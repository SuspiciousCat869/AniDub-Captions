WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.243
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.011
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.582
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.118
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.186
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.389
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.058
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.497
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.365
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.468
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.471
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.775
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.044
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:57.290
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.765
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.239
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.108
RAZENOID: Aaarrrrggggghhhh!

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:24.584
MAG MEL: Curse you!

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.619
RAZENOID: The gate is finally mine!

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.456
At last, I am whole!

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.424
RAZENOID: [mighty roar]

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.461
MAG MEL: Now all that is left is for me to get the key!

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.635
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: True Colours

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.372
MAG MEL: Soon Razenoid will awaken...

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.608
and his catharsis will be complete.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.710
Which leaves just one thing...

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:55.081
MAG MEL: I need Dan Kuso's key, so that I may become whole.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.583
SELLON: We will do whatever it takes...

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.085
so that your destiny may be realized, Sire.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.888
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle] Very well, then.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.756
Off with the both of you!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.258
MAG MEL: Bring back what is mine!

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.096
SELLON: As you wish, Master. We do this all in your honour.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.298
ANUBIAS: Sellon might be focused on looking good...

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.868
for Master Mag Mel, but I won't let her get in my way...

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.772
of taking down Kuso once and for all.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.809
NURZAK: Thanks to all of you peace has finally returned...

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:26.146
to Gundalia. We owe you a debt of gratitude,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.014
one that we can never repay.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.316
Thank-you kindly Battle Brawlers.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.719
FABIA: Once again you've shown us that by working together

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.022
we can conquer anything at all.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.258
DAN: Well, Spectra lent a hand as well.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.425
MARUCHO: That's true.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.528
SHUN: But the fight still isn't over.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.162
RAFE: Uh huh, you said it, Shun.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.499
DAN: For sure. We've gotta find Mag Mel.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.469
MARUCHO: Huh? It's an emergency transmission

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.337
from Bakugan Interspace.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.206
COMPUTER VOICE: Terminal System Error,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.974
Terminal System Error.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.709
PAIGE: That doesn't sound good.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.947
SHUN: How much do you want to bet Mag Mel's responsible?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.349
DRAGO: We'd better go check it out, then.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.684
DAN: Yes.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.020
NURZAK: If you need any help from Gundalia,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.223
please do not hesitate to ask at all Brawlers.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.592
FABIA: And the same goes for Neathia too.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:17.764
DAN: Hmm. Ready? Let's go!

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:23.236
FABIA: Safe travels, Battle Brawlers.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.437
MARUCHO: Here we go.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.710
MARUCHO and DAN: Arrrrggggghhh!

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.880
ALL: Whoooooaaaa!

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.114
DAN: That one really hurt.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.050
PAIGE: What the heck just happened, huh?

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.218
MARUCHO: I'm not sure. I've never had anything happen...

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.688
like that during teleporting before.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.089
SHUN: Hey guys, look!

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:50.930
MARUCHO, RAFE and PAIGE: Hmmmm?

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.166
ALL: [gasp]

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.639
NOAH and BEN: [panting, exertion reax]

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.140
ROBIN: They're everywhere!

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.643
NOAH: I don't think I can keep going!

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.145
BEN: Toughen up you big baby! Do you think...

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.482
Anubias would just give up like that?

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:13.286
BEN: Huh? [grunt]

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.487
ROBIN: Ben, wait!

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.657
BEN: No time to argue! You guys go find the boss!

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.791
NOAH: But Ben!

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.727
BEN: Ha, Don't worry about me, kid!

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.961
I'll run a little interference and then...

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.529
catch up with you later!

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:27.467
Hey lunkhead! Over here!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.936
BEN: Let's see if you're as slow as you are ugly!

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.838
JACK: Check it out, is he crazy?

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.740
ROBIN: No, just brave. Come on!

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:34.741
NOAH: Yeah but...

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:46.586
ROBIN: You heard Ben, so quit arguing!

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.587
[laser blast]

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.588
[explosion]

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.922
BEN: Ooooomph! [grunt, pain reax]

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.292
BEN: [groan] As soon as the others...

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.061
get back with Anubias, you guys are toast!

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.063
DAN: Ability activate!

00:04:57.096 --> 00:05:00.700
DAN: Dragon Blazer!

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.035
[explosion]

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.269
BEN: Hmmm?

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.539
MARUCHO: That was a pretty bad hit. Are you okay, Ben?

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.207
BEN: The Battle Brawlers?

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.843
ALL: [panting, exertion reax]

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.445
BEN: They just saved my bacon.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.380
JACK: [laughter] The big tough hero...

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.282
needed to be saved, huh!

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.017
BEN: Hey! Pipe down!

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.719
DAN: What the heck happened to this place?

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.455
DYLAN: You might say, the lunatics are running the asylum,

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.791
or is it ruining? [chuckle]

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.693
MARUCHO: Dylan! What are you talking about?

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:29.462
DYLAN: Well, you may have kicked Mag Mel out,

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.064
but that doesn't mean the Chaos Bakugan...

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:37.370
are going to start behaving, now does it.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.905
KYOSUKE: Have you managed to find...

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:41.541
a way back into Bakugan Interspace yet?

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.509
KATO: Unfortunately, none of the access points...

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.813
are responding to our remote commands.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.482
KYOSUKE: Marucho...

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.084
BEN: We gathered all the remaining battlers...

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.919
we could find in here.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.220
MARUCHO: I don't understand why we can't...

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.122
transport ourselves out of here right now,

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.323
like we normally would.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.958
I need to have a closer look at the system

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:01.260
to see if I can figure it out, okay?

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:06.299
RAFE: Got it. I'll come with you.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.968
MARUCHO: Check it out. None of the access points are working.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.637
RAFE: We can't even teleport back to Gundalia,

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.172
or Neathia either.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.808
SHUN: So people can come in but they can't get out.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.510
DAN: That makes zero sense.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:21.881
DYLAN: Then maybe I can explain it for ya.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:25.518
DYLAN: Gather 'round kiddies, 'cos it's story time.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.220
DYLAN: Right after you guys took off,

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.921
everything seemed to be back to normal.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.890
That's when the Chaos Bakugan reappeared

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.892
and things got ugly again.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.228
DYLAN: They attacked everything and anyone in sight.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.730
DYLAN: Several brave battlers stood up to them...

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.066
and fought but ultimately they were no match...

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.770
for their enemies' might. One by one they were all defeated,

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.806
and before you knew it the invaders were running riot,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.709
and in the blink of an eye they reduced Bakugan Interspace...

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.144
to a pile of rubble.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.979
DYLAN: And that's the story of what happened

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:56.349
while the Battle Brawlers were away.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:58.251
MARUCHO: So that's why we can't use the access points...

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.253
to exit from the system.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.188
DRAGO: The Chaos Bakugan destroyed too much...

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.857
of Interspace from the inside and messed up the framework.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.527
DAN: I still say Mag Mel's behind this.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.561
CHRIS: Whooooooooa!

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.829
DAN: Huh?

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.531
CHRIS: Ouchiiiiiiiiieeeee!

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:12.698
SOON: So is this...?

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:15.034
SHUN: I know you two you're with Sellon.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:17.203
MARUCHO: Huh, Soon and Chris isn't it?

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.505
SOON: The...the Battle Brawlers?

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:31.551
CHRIS: How totally embarrassing.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:34.053
NOAH: How long do you think we'll have to stay here guys?

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.788
DAN: Try not to sweat it, dude.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:36.823
NOAH: Hmmm?

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.925
DAN: Marucho's the biggest brain I know.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.027
He'll have us out of here real soon.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.696
NOAH: [angry grunt] Now you're acting like a hero?

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.732
Where were you when we needed you most?

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.602
DAN: Gundalia.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:54.607
NOAH: I guess that's right he was helping others.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.608
MARUCHO: I think I may have found

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.844
a back door out of here, guys.

00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.079
DAN: An old access point?

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.048
MARUCHO: It was created for maintenance purposes...

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.250
while developing the beta version, but once we had...

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.319
the official launch it was abandoned.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.087
SHUN: Great work you guys.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.889
MARUCHO: The credit should go to Kato. The only reason...

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.892
I spotted it was because he sent us a message through it.

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.760
DAN: Well okay, then. Let's hike on over to this...

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.296
access point, and get the heck out of this dump.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.332
CHRIS: We're not even sure where Ms. Sellon is.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.167
Maybe we should wait here until she comes to find us.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.036
SOON: You want us to cower like mice?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.104
CHRIS: [gasp]

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.807
SOON: Did you break your backbone in that fall?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.942
SOON: We're going to face this challenge head on.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:32.845
Just as Ms. Sellon would.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:36.949
SOON: We'll go forth and blaze our own beautiful path.

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:40.286
BEN: Well fellas, I don't know about all that beautiful stuff,

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.121
but I don't wanna sit around either.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.856
ROBIN: Yeah. Let's go.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.091
JACK: Haha!

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.193
CHRIS: Maybe we should send a message to Ms. Sellon,

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.529
just in case she's stuck inside here too.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.197
SOON: Good thinking, Chris.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.734
CHRIS: Right! Leave no teammate behind!

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:55.935
SHUN: Okay, then...

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:59.839
DAN: Yup, No point standing around. So let's go.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:05.912
DYLAN: Well, well this is interesting.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.980
SELLON: Chris just sent me the coordinates where she...

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:12.485
and Soon are heading along with the Brawlers.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.521
ANUBIAS: I'm coming for you Dan Kuso!

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:23.029
DAN: We gotta bust out of here before it's too late, Drago!

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.100
SHUN: Keep your eyes open for trouble, Taylean!

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.936
SHUN: It looks like the majority of them...

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:32.605
are clustered around the centre of Interspace.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.173
So our safest bet is to approach...

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.609
from the East to avoid detection.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:37.977
SHUN: It's not the most direct route,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.747
but it's our best option.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.482
DYLAN: Hey, hey, hey! Where's the fun in...

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.384
sneaking around, Brawlers?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.652
DAN, MARUCHO and SHUN: Huh?

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:49.689
DYLAN: Since when are you afraid of a little danger?

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.891
MARUCHO: What are you smiling about, Dylan?

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:55.261
You may think this is just a big game but it isn't!

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:58.698
DYLAN: Hey, relax guys. I'm not trying to cause you grief.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.100
DYLAN: I'm just doing my job here, okay?

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.470
DAN: Doing your job? What are you talking about, Dylan?

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.205
DYLAN: Well...

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.474
DAN: I've had enough of your riddles and nonsense!

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:12.078
It's time for answers! So you better spit some out, dude!

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.346
MARUCHO: Right now!

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.949
SHUN: Are you the one, who brought the Chaos Bakugan here?

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.317
DYLAN: And what if I was?

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.318
SHUN: Did you?

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.487
DYLAN: [chuckles] Calm down, pal.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.222
I'm just saying what if?

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.490
DAN: Dylan!

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.392
DYLAN: I mean wouldn't that be the kind of challenge...

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.328
you've all been looking for after all?

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.596
DAN: What?

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.598
DYLAN: Sure! You've all been looking for more intense...

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.867
battle action. Why else would battle gear like...

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.403
the BakuNanos be so popular? They aren't created...

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:40.639
in a vacuum fellas. And that's where I come in.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.908
Think of me as a genie in a bottle. I was created...

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.845
to make all your dreams come true.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.346
SHUN, MARUCHO and DAN: [gasp]

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.881
DYLAN: Since the beginning of Bakugan Interspace,

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.549
you've all grown and matured as battlers...

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.918
so the system needed to evolve as well.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.587
DYLAN: To keep up with your growing skill set...

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.523
it created a data bug so things wouldn't become predictable.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.558
DYLAN: And that bug is me kiddies.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.694
DAN: Seriously?

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:02.862
MARUCHO: So you're telling us that you're not human?

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.297
DYLAN: That's exactly right. I am nothing more...

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.233
than a jumble of data in a slick looking package,

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:10.970
created by Interspace to fulfill your deepest, darkest desires.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.805
But when you think of it, since you're the ones who...

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:16.075
built Interspace, I guess I'm really your creation.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.110
Which is kind of funny, because you humans...

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.413
have been so quick to blame all of the recent developments...

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:25.651
on Mag Mel, when the whole time you're the ones responsible.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.786
DYLAN: How do you know you didn't...

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.789
create Mag Mel, huh Brawlers?

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.458
DAN: That's crazy talk, pal!

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.428
SHUN: Hmmm? It looks like they've found us.

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:40.299
DYLAN: Hey don't look at me, I didn't call them.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.601
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.370
DAN: Bakugan stand!

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:53.379
BakuNano Sonicannon, destroy!

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.614
DAN: As soon as we open up a path through the middle

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.817
everyone make a run for it! Got it?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.453
SHUN: We'll keep the Chaos Bakugan occupied!

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:03.022
MARUCHO: Don't worry. You'll be safe. We've got your backs.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.224
ALL: [gasp]

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:07.226
RAFE: Wolfurio and I will bring up the rear!

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.362
PAIGE: And Boulderon and I will be right beside them!

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.565
BEN: You heard 'em. Let's go!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:17.403
DRAGO: Move it, people!

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.972
CHRIS: [screams] SOON: [gasp]

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.876
SHUN: BakuNano Hammermor, destroy!

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:28.047
MARUCHO: BakuNano Crosstriker, destroy!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.215
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaah!

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:39.191
TRISTAR: Oooooooh yeeeeeeah. Let's do this!

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:40.759
PAIGE: Here they come!

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:44.697
WOLFURIO: Haaaaaaah!

DRAGO: Haaaaaaah!

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.168
JACK: This isn't looking so good.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:52.204
BEN: I wish we had some Bakugan.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.073
ALL: [gasp]

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.374

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.478

SELLON: You poor fools still don't understand.

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.559
DRAGO: I don't believe it.

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.761
DAN: They're on Mag Mel's side!

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:51.163
SELLON: It's true. We are artificial life forms...

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:55.334
created by Master Mag Mel to aid in his resurrection.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.536
SELLON: But it's thanks to you, Battle Brawlers,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.539
or should I say the energy you generated by battling,

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.042
that the master was able to speed along his rebirth...

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:05.311
by absorbing all that you produced.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.313
DAN: Unbelievable, dude.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.916
SHUN: So they've been using us from the very beginning!

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.853
SELLON: Now all that's left is to take that key of yours.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:16.889

ANUBIAS: Why waste your time...

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.483
protecting such pathetic insects?

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:46.719

the battlers to a safe zone!

to get to know each other but alas it ends here.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.532
MARUCHO, DAN and SHUN: Aaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.702
SELLON: [grunt, exertion reax] What are you doing, Anubias?

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.704
We're supposed to be retrieving the key,

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.139
not blowing it away!

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.807
ANUBIAS: Just keep quiet!

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:58.884
Come Deezal, Rock Fist!

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:07.760
Come Deezal, Rock Fist!

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:08.994
DAN: Mechtogan!

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:13.532
ANUBIAS: I'm coming for you, Kuso!

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.235
DRAGO: Oh no.

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:23.842
ANUBIAS: Hmmmph! Huh?!?

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.877
ANUBIAS: No way!

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.211
SELLON: Impossible!

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.913
DAN: Thanks guys!

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:30.182
RAFE: No problem. All the other battlers...

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.617
are safe and sound, so...

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.354
PAIGE: We thought we'd just come back and join in the fun!

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.256
ANUBIAS: I'll make you pay for that!

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.658
PAIGE: I'd just like to see you try, buddy!

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:42.327
Now! Let's go, Vexfist!

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.396
VEXFIST: Merely point the way, my lady...

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:51.236
and I will clear a path for you!

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.173
RAFE: Now it's our turn to play, Swift Sweep!

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:55.274
SWIFT SWEEP: With your guidance,

00:17:55.307 --> 00:18:01.947
I will rid this place of all evil, ha!

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:12.091
ANUBIAS: Oh no! He's too fast!

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.358
ANUBIAS: It can't be!

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.394
PAIGE: Hit 'em again!

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.729
BOULDERON: I want in on this too, Paige!

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.732
PAIGE: Okay! Ability activate!

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.468
PAIGE: Burst Quench!

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.170
BOULDERON: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:30.509
[laser blast]

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:35.514
[explosion]

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:37.950
ANUBIAS: Rock Fist, nooooooo!

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.585
DAN: Come on, Drago!

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:42.087

TRISTAR: Haaaaaaah!

00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:00.005
ANUBIAS: No way!

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:02.774
SELLON: Anubias! Your skills are pathetic!

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.909
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:04.910
SELLON: [gasp]

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:07.613
SHUN: Shadow Leaf Twin Dragon!

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:11.850
TAYLEAN: Hmmmmph!

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.186
SHUN: Shadow Leaf Field Grenade!

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:19.424
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaah!

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.793
[string pluck]

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:25.197
SELLON: Enough of this!

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.799
SHUN: You're finished Sellon!

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.102

SELLON: [angry grunt] I mustn't fail Master Mag Mel!

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.483

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.585

TAYLEAN: Hmmmmmph!

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:58.730
SELLON: [scream]

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:04.002
ANUBIAS: Sellon! [frustrated grunt]

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.671
DAN: Nice one, Shun!

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.105
SHUN: Thanks, Dan.

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.140
MARUCHO: We should go find the others...

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.575
and head for the access point.

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:12.678
RAFE: Sounds good.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.546
SELLON: Cursed Battle Brawlers.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.883
They've gotten so much stronger!

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:23.322
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt]

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.556
DAN: This is the place?

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.959
MARUCHO: Yeah, look it's right over there...

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.360
DAN: What is it, buddy?

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:33.131
MARUCHO: The access point...

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:35.534
It's been damaged, and it isn't responding.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.102
ALL: [gasp]

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:39.404
BOY BATTLER: So then, we're stuck inside here?

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.207
GIRL BATTLER: Does that mean we're here, forever?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.877
SHUN: I'm sorry. It was my carelessness in battle...

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:49.181
that caused this. It was all my fault.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:53.418
DAN: Just relax, buddy. It's going to be okay.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:56.088
BEN: What the heck are we supposed to do now?

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:59.091
[rain drops]

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:00.626
DAN: It's raining?

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:07.399
MARUCHO: But the system isn't programmed to produce rain!

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.668
SHUN: After my battle against Sellon, it seemed like

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.237
I destroyed the last access point and our only hope

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:15.307
of escaping Bakugan Interspace. We were stuck inside

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.144
with a horde of Chaos Bakugan who were on a non-stop rampage.

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:21.480
And that's when things started to get even weirder.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.815
Sellon showed up in bad shape and asked for

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.451
our help against Mag Mel! Can you believe it?

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:29.221
Dan seemed to believe her but I smelled another trap.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.523
You've got to tune in to see how things played out.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.959
For all of her talk of beauty and light, you won't believe

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:37.162
some of the dark secrets that Sellon has been hiding.

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:38.196
