WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.541
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.009
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.846
But then, out of nowhere, we were invaded by

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.647
these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.249
who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.818
Coredegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.887
Exostriker and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.623
and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.125
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.426
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.028
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.930
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.366
So, we fought back,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.568
because no one is going to take our freedom: not now, not ever!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.471
\u266a What are you going to do

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.674
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.110
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.579
\u266a Got to give it your all

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.949
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.518
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:56.456
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.293
\u266a You got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.263
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.631
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.805
Don't you dare give up the fight.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.807
If you punks are done,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.975
you might as well go to the Doom Dimension.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.277
What?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.578
(Screaming)

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.547
BETADRON: I don't know what to say.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.749
There's nothing left to say, Betadron.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.718
I'm afraid I can't let you leave.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:30.690
Not without facing us in battle. The only way out is through us.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:34.727
Well, Brawlers, some things are worth the risk.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.101
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.276
Hey, you guys. Welcome back.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.713
It's your favourite roving reporter Julie here.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.049
Live from downtown Bakugan City.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.384
We're here to cover all the festivities happening today,

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.488
as we commemorate the one-year anniversary

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.156
of the day the Bakugan came to live on Earth.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.891
(Laughing)

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.427
As you all know, things have been a bit insane

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.728
around the city these days.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.463
So, I thought I'd turn the microphone over to you

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.764
to see what the public is thinking

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.366
on this historic day.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.934
Are you serious?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.536
Has it really been a year already?

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.537
What a surprise.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.138
The first few months really moved by.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.140
Those were good times

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.241
with lots of happy memories.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.642
Lately, that hasn't been the case, though,

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.711
now that the battle arenas have been shut down.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:25.812
It's understandable,

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.780
given the threat that Wiseman posed.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.183
We're just hopeful that the Brawlers can defeat our enemies

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.752
so that one day, things will get back to normal.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.954
(Growling)

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.122
(Grunting)

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.924
Thanks to Wiseman and his lousy Nonets,

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.425
many humans stopped trusting Bakugan.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.528
But slowly, we've been able to

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.263
rebuild the trust between us.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.765
Bakugan battling is the coolest.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.700
We love brawling, too.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.903
The Bakugan are our friends.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.405
We love Bakugan City.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.073
Yeah!

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.245
But make sure you get a shot of that statue

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.446
that represents the bond

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.582
between humans and Bakugan this time.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.851
DAMDOS: Look at you, being bossy again.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.554
Did you forget me already?

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.924
Hey, Damdos.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.525
It's so good to see you again, big guy.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.826
And it's really great to see that

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.828
the people are visiting Bakugan Land again.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.364
Thanks in large part to you.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.266
No, no. People saw you rescue me

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.668
from being crushed by that statue

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.969
and realized that Bakugan were our friends

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.437
and could be trusted.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.873
DAMDOS: Well, things may be happy on the surface here,

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.174
but I can't help but worry that

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.710
this is just the calm before the storm.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.479
Sure, people and Bakugan are cooperating again.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.416
But Wiseman is still lurking out there somewhere,

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.750
and the fight isn't over yet.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.085
I don't know if you've noticed,

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.387
but the Brawlers haven't been around for a while now.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.388
It's like they just vanished.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.389
Doesn't that worry you?

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.757
Maybe a bit.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.260
And yet, you're acting as though nothing is wrong.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.461
You're laughing and carrying on

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.396
like it's business as usual.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.498
If I don't keep a really brave face,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.100
people will start to worry.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.369
I just have to trust that wherever they are,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.037
Dan and the others are fighting the good fight

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.339
and winning against Wiseman and the Nonets.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.807
Ow!

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.808
Oh, no.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.509
Got it.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:04.510
Huh?

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.112
Here you go.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.181
Thanks, mister.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.149
(Giggling)

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.651
You know, Damdos,

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.286
you might pretend to be a big grump,

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.754
but I see right through you.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.656
Underneath, you're just a softie.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.658
It's been really great catching up with you,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.627
but I should be getting back to work now.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.728
Whee!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.097
Catch you later.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.098
Would you move it?

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:28.268
Huh. That girl is one of a kind.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.252
What are you doing here, Gunz?

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.287
We used to be friends. Remember?

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:51.991
I'm not Gunz. I'm the new Wiseman, Dan.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.092
That's not true.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.728
Dude, I'm sorry we doubted you,

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.431
but you have to understand our confusion.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.000
We don't have to be enemies.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.637
You think it's that easy to get my forgiveness?

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.806
You turned my old partner against me, Dan.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.308
We're sorry.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.776
We never meant to hurt you.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.245
Enough with all this nonsense.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.247
I didn't come to talk.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.415
I came to fight.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.483
So, let's get on with this, Drago.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.886
Drago!

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.056
I've been waiting eons to exact my revenge,

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.724
and I won't hold back for one second longer.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.927
It was my ancestors who banished you to this place, not me.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.197
Well, they're not here right now,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.066
so you're the next best thing.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.702
The years of anger I've cultivated towards them

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.705
will be taken out on you a thousand fold.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.606
DRAGO: Don't you realize how insane it is

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.476
that you come back to the very place you wanted to escape

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.080
for so long just to get your precious revenge?

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.549
But if it's a fight you want, you've got one.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.752
That just leaves you and I, Kouzo.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.654
If a battle is what it's going to take

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.255
to knock some sense into you,

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.158
I guess you're about to learn a real hard lesson, Gunz.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.260
Dan, wait. Let me. Sorry, Reptak.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.963
This is something Drago and I have to do.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.199
Besides, Betadron won't be satisfied

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.434
battling against anyone else but me.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.403
REPTAK: But guys--

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:11.637
DAN: Don't worry.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:12.872
When this is over, Gunz will be back.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:14.140
I promise.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:19.078
REPTAK: Well, okay, then.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.580
BOTH: Bring it.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.618
Ha!

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:32.191
(Roaring)

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.299
I'm going to enjoy every second of your suffering, Drago.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.568
You're going down.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.239
Ability activate.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.941
GUNZ: Mist Burn.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.244
Ability activate.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.813
Dragon Thrasher.

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.090
Dan!

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.559
Someone's going to get seriously hurt.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.629
(Screaming)

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:13.132
Dan! Aw.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:20.072
That was a close one.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.577
Ability activate.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.713
Dragon Over Cannon.

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.817
Ability activate.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.119
Orion Shield.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.564
Ability activate.

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.533
Night Vizaler.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.905
Ability activate.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.474
Dragon Exploder.

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.379
Nice.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.881
Not so fast. Huh?

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.984
Ability activate.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.019
Black Burn.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.994
Where are you going?

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.033
Drago!

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.502
I'm not finished with you yet.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.847
(Screaming)

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.316
Drago!

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.520
Whoa. Ugh.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.088
Oh.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:45.291
Drago!

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.426
I don't know which one of you is more stubborn.

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.699
DRAGO: You're determined, aren't you?

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.536
That's an understatement, Drago.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.405
My brother Nonets gave more than you can imagine

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.641
for me to come find you.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:05.845
I'm not going to let their sacrifice be in vain.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.882
Sacrifice?

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.384
What are you talking about?

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:14.587
What happened with Mechtavius Destroyer?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.156
Never mind. That's not important.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.091
The only thing that matters now

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.027
is that I'm going to take you down.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.395
Ability activate.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.430
Dragon Spur.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:26.766
Huh?

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.849
Is that all you've got?

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.084
Huh?

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.323
Let's hit him again, Drago.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.725
Ability activate.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.760
Hyper Drive.

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.199
You're the one who's going down.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:07.306
(Roaring)

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:16.415
(Cackling)

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.783
No way.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.385
You're going to like this.

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:21.921
Ability activate. Dark Stream.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.090
Pay attention, Drago.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.759
This is where things really get interesting.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.227
(Sighing)

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.696
(Cackling)

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.599
(Cackling continues)

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:37.169
As if.

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:40.606
Once we finish off Drago, we'll go back and take down Coredegon.

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.143
Why stop at Coredegon?

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.679
We'll take down all the Mechtogan.

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:55.287
Are you sure you're not holding back, Drago?

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.857
Because so far, the effort you've shown me

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.991
has been totally pathetic.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:06.232
Drago!

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.100
Oh, man.

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.302
Drago should have way more power than him.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.139
He's fuelled by hate. Get lost.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.176
You should know that I'm driven by

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.478
the same level of anger that fuels Betadron.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.880
And just as he's going to take out Drago,

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:24.083
I'm going to destroy you, Dan.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.385
So, get ready to say goodbye.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.093
Ability activate.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.361
Night Phalanx.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:47.907
Ability activate.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.875
Sabre Shield.

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.243
Useless.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.456
GUNZ: The simple truth is, you and Drago

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:06.092
don't want the victory as badly as we do.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:09.562
So, you're toast. Ability activate.

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:11.597
Anger Shroud.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.306
No one wants this more than we do, pal.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:22.241
Ability activate.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:24.910
Dragon NR Gear.

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.819
(Roaring)

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.187
Intense.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:39.024
You may want the victory, but we want peace, Gunz.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.927
And our desire for that totally out-trumps

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.662
anything you're packing, buddy.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:44.697
Is that right?

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.532
We aren't doing this for selfish reasons,

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:48.367
like you guys.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.669
We're doing it for all of the humans and Bakugan back home.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.371
Don't make me laugh.

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:56.175
We'll be the ones laughing when this is over, creep.

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:58.844
Ability activate.

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:01.247
Dragon Eternal Force.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.989
(Roaring)

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:13.192
Ability activate.

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.427
Wing Pulsar.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.107
Keep going.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.442
What do you think I'm doing?

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:48.160
Whoa. This is going to be a close one.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:51.163
Oh, man. I wish I was in there.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:13.352
I can't lose. I won't lose!

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.754
Victory is going to be--

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.224
BOTH: All mine.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.426
Ability...

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.427
...activate.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.895
(Screaming)

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:24.597
Wing Pulsar.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:29.068
Dragon Eternal Force.

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:34.373
This one is going to hurt.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:37.109
Not as much as this.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.047
(Roaring)

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.923
BOTH: Whoa!

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.758
Dan! Watch out.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.396
No, guys. Take cover.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.504
Ugh.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.075
Betadron?

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.652
Argh.

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:25.090
DAN: Drago!

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.565
You won't defeat me.

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:43.208
Yeah! We won this.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:46.045
Dan and Drago totally took them down, Shun.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.315
Great job.

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.683
SHUN: Yeah.

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:51.984
Huh?

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:56.088
I don't believe it. I lost.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.189
DAN: Now you can join us.

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:59.391
Are you insane?

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.895
Why would I go with you guys?

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.597
Because I beat your Wiseman persona.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.667
So now, you can put it to rest

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:11.136
and go back to being Gunz.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.408
What makes you so sure that

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:18.644
I even want to go back to being Gunz?

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:20.713
It's time for me to start all over again.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:23.615
There's nothing left for me in that old life back there.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.150
That's not true.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:27.486
Did you ever stop to think that

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.421
the reason you were so angry we doubted you

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:31.790
wasn't because of our supposed betrayal,

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.860
but because you cherished your own life so much

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.528
and were scared of losing it?

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:37.863
We went through a lot together,

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:39.365
so I understand why you would be furious

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:41.567
at the thought of being abandoned,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.769
but I need you to put that all behind us, Gunz.

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.537
You need to forget so that we can move forward.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:49.007
Come on. We need to get past this.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.776
Please forgive me.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.277
I don't know.

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.581
You stole my identity, so now, I'm taking it back.

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:59.485
It's mine.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.887
Well, Brawlers, some things are worth the risk.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.190
No. That's not true, you guys. No.

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.659
I can only see bits of it,

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.962
My brain is so fuzzy.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:14.133
Any final words, Kouzo, before I take you down?

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.734
We'll be able to take down

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:18.937
anyone who dares to cross our path.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.840
Well, I guess we did promise...

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.114
...that we'd crush any challenger, Reptak.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.553
So, I guess your old partner Gunz is back.

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:37.256
Gunz.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:40.793
I'm still going to want a rematch, Dan.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.795
As soon as this is all over.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.830
Sure. It's a deal, buddy.

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:50.069
(Groaning)

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:54.907
DRAGO: Betadron, can you stand?

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.777
Now that we have a common enemy, let's take him down together.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:01.280
I'm talking about Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.390
WORTON: I'm glad we settled our differences.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:14.126
Aren't you--

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:16.361
Worton?

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.397
What are you doing here?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.834
Before we Nonets decided to take on Mechtavius Destroyer,

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.336
the professor chose to return to the Doom Dimension.

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:25.671
You chickened out.

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.439
That's right.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.808
There are more pressing issues at hand.

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:33.078
It's Mechtavius Destroyer. He's on the move.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:41.120
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Finally, I am rid of all the vermin

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.256
who have stood in the way of my master plan.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.092
Now I can get on with the business of destroying

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.562
Bakugan City and all of those who inhabit it.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:54.600
(Cackling)

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.036
For reals?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.172
You're saying Dan and the others just disappeared?

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.874
MIRA: Sort of.

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:02.941
They were headed to Wiseman's secret hideout

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.109
when we lost contact with them,

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:05.711
and we haven't been able to raise them

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:06.845
on the Bakumeters since.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.947
Oh, my gosh. Dan!

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.249
No need to worry, Julie.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.518
We're on the case.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.952
We're going to find them, no problem.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.654
I'm sure everything's fine

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:16.655
and that there's

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.457
a reasonable explanation for it.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.458
We should hurry, Runo.

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.859
Coming.

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.561
Okay, guys. Wait.

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.029
Huh?

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:26.498
Just hold on a second, okay?

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.766
What?

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.535
I've decided I'm coming along with you, too.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.203
Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:32.838
Guys, wait. Huh?

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.806
What's wrong, Julie?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.009
Look. What's that over there?

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:45.317
(Screaming)

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:03.936
Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.704
This is bad, guys.

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.239
If we don't stop him,

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.908
it could mean the total destruction of Earth.

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:13.645
You filthy human and Bakugan swine.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.381
We must hurry. Time is of the essence.

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:20.852
Behold the terrifying might of my powers.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.588
Oh, no.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.690
I fear it could already be too late.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:25.924
Ugh!

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.626
ALL: It can't be.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:30.929
(Roaring)

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.639
(Screaming)

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.046
(Child crying)

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:04.830
(Cackling)

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.468
DAN: Now that we finally got Gunz back

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.769
to battling on our side,

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:12.304
we had to focus on an even greater threat.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.773
Professor Worton told us that Mechtavius Destroyer

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.975
was on the move and intent on destroying the Earth.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.644
We couldn't let that happen. But unfortunately,

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:19.911
we were still stuck in the Doom Dimension

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.980
and had to figure a way out first.

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.215
Luckily for us, Drago had an idea

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:24.449
about recruiting additional help

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:26.184
from some old friends on New Vestroia.

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:27.753
After all, once he was finished with Earth,

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.121
Mechtavius Destroyer would likely

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:31.156
take his tour of destruction there next.

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:32.424
You've got to tune in to see for yourself

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:33.759
just how insane the action gets.

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.995
Mechtavius Destroyer is in for the fight of his life.

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:47.005
