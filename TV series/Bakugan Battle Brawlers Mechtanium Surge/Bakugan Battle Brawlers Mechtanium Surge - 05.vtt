WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.510
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.946
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.148
Interspace the number of people accessing it from

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.550
around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.452
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.489
with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.725
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.527
DAN: The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.130
against some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.932
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.035
DAN: ...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.771
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:41.107
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.976
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.611
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.179
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.580
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.315
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.784
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.919
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.687
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.426
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.462
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.364
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.872
[\u266a]

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.942
SHUN: Dan, you need to take a break from battling.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.277
DAN: Are you nuts?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.380
Why would I ever give up battling?

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.948
SHUN: Come on...

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.883
SHUN: ...do I really have to explain the danger that

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.054
Drago's un-harnessed powers pose to everyone?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.489
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [screams, terror]

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.559
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [terrified screams]

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.327
SHUN: It's irresponsible to continue.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.563
DAN: I know exactly what's at stake here!

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.898
Why do you think we've been practicing so much, huh?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.401
SHUN: I know that Dan. It's just...

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.802
DAN: Spit it out Shun!

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:46.906
You don't trust us, that's totally it, isn't it?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.175
SHUN: [angry grunt]

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.945
DAN: [angry grunt] Answer me!

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:55.415
SHUN: You're right. I don't trust you.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.683
DAN: [gasp]

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.018
MARUCHO: What Shun's trying to say...

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.321
DAN: Don't try and cover for him, Marucho.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.622
Shun was clear.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.023
SHUN: It's not personal.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.592
DAN: How could it not be?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.793
MARUCHO: Dan, let go!

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.094
DAN: Back off, Marucho!

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.863
DAN: Aw now I get it man.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.166
You agree with Shun here, don't you?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.504
MARUCHO: I'm sorry, Dan but he does have a really good point.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.905
DAN: [gasp]

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.574
DAN: [angry grunt] Fine then.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.180
MARUCHO: Dan, wait!

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.548
[\u266a]

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.750
MARUCHO: Stop Shun!

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:34.320
[\u266a]

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.592
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.327
Tri-Twister Take Down.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.365
MARUCHO: Oh man. This is really, bad.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.167
I've never seen Dan so hurt and angry.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.504
TRISTAR: What did you expect, huh?

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.439
TRISTAR: You and Shun are his best friends and

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.708
teammates and you totally turned your backs on him.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.577
MARUCHO: Don't say things like that.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.112
You know it's not true.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.015
TRISTAR: Well, that's what he thinks.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.483
MARUCHO: Shun wasn't trying to be mean.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.985
He was right to ask Dan to take a break.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.487
There have been way too many close calls with

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.822
Drago losing control of his powers.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.658
We have to think of the safety of the audience

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.126
above all else.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.794
TRISTAR: So how come you guys didn't explain that

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.396
part to Dan, then?

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.498
MARUCHO: Believe me we tried, but you know

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.301
yourself what a passionate battler Dan is.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.603
MARUCHO: He eats, sleeps and breathes, Bakugan

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.973
brawling but unfortunately that sometimes causes him

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.309
to lose his perspective.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:33.613
MARUCHO: So asking Dan not to battle is like asking a

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.014
fish not to swim.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.783
It's against his nature.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.619
TRISTAR: Then how can you ask him to be so untrue to himself?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.387
There has to be a better way.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.556
MARUCHO: If there is Tristar, I wish I knew

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.858
what it was, but I don't.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:50.296
Oooooh this stinks. What are we going to do?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.900
[\u266a]

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.869
DION: [grunt] I can't believe we lost again.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.174
LUCAS: Man, I wonder what it's like to win in a battle.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:03.576
DION: Huh? LUCAS: Whah?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.249
[\u266a]

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:14.687
DION: Huh? What are these?

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:18.124
LUCAS: Whooooooa! DION: Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.260
MAG MEL: With these gifts...

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:23.963
MAG MEL: I want you to battle.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.332
MAG MEL: Bring me the power!

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.767
DION: Hmmmph.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.070
[\u266a]

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.039
SHUN: Now what?

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:37.176
DAN: You don't trust us, that's totally it, isn't it?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.379
TAYLEAN: You've got nothing to be sorry about.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.114
You were right.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.749
Why don't you try talking to Dan again?

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.184
Maybe he's cooled down.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.020
SHUN: Maybe.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.455
I suppose it couldn't hurt.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.923
TAYLEAN: Great.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.226
SHUN: [grunt]

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.330
[\u266a]

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.700
SHUN: What do you want Sellon?

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:03.670
SELLON: Have you reconsidered my offer?

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.772
SHUN: You're wasting your time.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.274
SELLON: You look troubled.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.710
Did you have another fight with your friend Dan?

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.111
SHUN: [angry grunt]

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.613
SELLON: Hmmmph.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.982
SELLON: It's hard to be at odds with such a close

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.851
friend but Dan is the one who chose to run away.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.319
Perhaps you should consider giving him the

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.722
space he's looking for.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:27.727
SELLON: Let go of the guilt you're feeling immediately.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.262
SHUN: I wish I could.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.497
SELLON: It's a different kind of help that Dan

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.433
needs right now.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.870
The best thing you can do is walk away.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:44.944
Force him to work through his troubles on his own.

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:49.015
SELLON: It may sound cruel and unkind but I promise it isn't.

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:52.719
It's tough love.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.222
SELLON: One day, Dan will thank you for giving him

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.725
this wonderful gift.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.961
Trust me.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.032
SHUN: Tough love.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.036
[\u266a]

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.039
DION: Listen up, suckers! We're the Tri-Twisters!

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.241
LUCAS: Yeah, and we're about to turn Bakugan

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.143
Interspace upside down!

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.611
DION: We're gonna totally change the way battling is

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:21.013
done in here.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.383
DION: And to show you what we're talking about we're

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.452
gonna start by taking on the tired old champs,

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.588
the Battle Brawlers.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.356
DYLAN: I don't know who these kids are but

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.225
I really like their style.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.393
[chuckle]

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.198
MARUCHO: Huh. The Tri-Twisters.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.268
I don't think I've ever really heard of these guys before.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.770
TRISTAR: I don't understand why they call

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:45.605
themselves the tri-twisters when there's

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.006
only two of them.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.375
MARUCHO: Maybe they just really stink at math, or

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.878
maybe they just thought it sounded like a cool name

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.614
sort of like, I don't know, Tristar?

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.681
[giggle]

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:56.816
TRISTAR: That's totally different!

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.151
Tristar is a cool name!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.520
MARUCHO: [sigh]

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.455
TAYLEAN: Do you know if Dan knows anything about

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:03.990
these guys?

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.491
MARUCHO: I don't know.

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.927
Maybe we should give him a quick call to find out.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.228
SHUN: No way.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.296
MARUCHO: Why not, Shun?

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.032
SHUN: You and I can handle this by ourselves.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.401
MARUCHO: But won't Dan be upset?

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.737
SHUN: What Dan needs most is to focus on getting

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.705
control of Drago's powers.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.309
A battle against these silly kids will only distract him.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.278
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.779
SHUN: We have to keep the Brawlers' reputation

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.615
intact, so he'll have something to come back to.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.251
MARUCHO: You're right. You and I, we can do this!

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.554
For our team! Let's go!

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:43.329
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.698
[\u266a]

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.302
DAN: Ability activate!

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:52.672
DAN: Dragon Force Striker!

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.308
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.947
DAN: Aw snap. There wasn't enough power that time.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.183
DRAGO: [grunt] Sorry, Dan. My head wasn't in that one.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.586
I'm still distracted by the argument earlier.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.321
DAN: I know, I hear you buddy.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:11.023
It's got me pretty worked up too.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.192
I can't believe I'm saying this but, I think Shun

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.329
might have had a really good point back there.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.631
This stinks!

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.967
DAN: Between these new Battlers...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.335
DAN: ...and Zenthon.

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.769
DAN: I'm worried that we're letting our team

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:28.007
down by sitting these battles out and I really hate that.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.143
DAN: We need to fix this.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.779
DAN: So we can help out our team and get right

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:36.148
back into the action!

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.317
ANUBIAS: Well, well the cheese stands alone.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.452
DAN: [gasp]

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.387
DAN: What do you want, Anubias?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.389
ANUBIAS: Who would have thought, the mighty Dan

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:47.326
Kuso, sitting here like a sad, little, lost puppy.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.962
ANUBIAS: What's wrong, pumpkin?

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:53.566
DAN: You're really pushing my buttons!

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.234
ANUBIAS: Don't worry about it, Dan.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:09:00.540
Everybody goes through periods of fear and doubt.

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.042
The important thing is to push through it.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.812
Otherwise, if you focus on it too much, you'll be

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:10.149
stuck in neutral forever.

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:14.420
DAN: He's just trying to get inside my head.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:17.189
DAN: [angry grunt] Hey! Where you going?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.925
ANUBIAS: Oh, didn't you hear Dan?

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.061
There's something interesting going on in Area A.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.829
DAN: What do you mean?

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.867
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Welcome back, Battle fans.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.002
We're about to watch Battle Brawlers Shun and

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.739
Marucho take on the new, but mighty smack talkers

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:37.944
Dion and Lucas, also known as the Tri- Twisters!

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:43.516
SOON: That's odd. I don't see Dan Kuso anywhere.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:46.852
CHRIS: Awww, I was hoping to see these two take him down.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.688
SELLON: Oh well.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:10:00.633
[\u266a]

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.104
SHUN: It's time for us to take the lead, Taylean!

MARUCHO: Get ready for some heavy action, Tristar!

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.245
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field Open!

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.613
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Given the heated words

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.115
thrown down by today's challengers...

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.516
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: ...we felt it appropriate

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.252
that our battle environment be under the scorching sun.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.221
DION: Battle Brawlers!

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.657
DION: Let's start with some one on one action.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.160
LUCAS: That is, if you have the guts for it.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.529
TRISTAR: Bring it! Tough guy!

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.399
TRISTAR: Hey, wait a minute!

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.168
SHUN: Tristar, I'm gonna go first.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:41.040

TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaaa!

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:42.802
TAYLEAN: So far you're nothing but a lot of talk.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.203
LUCAS: Hmmmph!

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:45.971

SELLON: He lied.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:57.283
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] Weasel.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:01.454
TRISTAR: What the heck happened to one-on-one?

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:03.923
MARUCHO: Well, I guess that's our cue.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:07.259
DION: Gate Card, open!

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.195
DION: Field Lock!

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.800
MARUCHO: Whoa! What just happened?

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.502
DION: Weren't you paying attention?

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.670
I locked the field.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.239
So no one else can enter it now.

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:22.842
TRISTAR: That was dirty punk!

DRAGO: Why did he fall like that?

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.184
SHUN: What happened Taylean?

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:08.721

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:10.990

MARUCHO: I hear what you're saying Tristar, but

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.318
we need to figure out what that invisible attack was

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.988
earlier, just to be safe.

SOON: A trick attack followed by a fake attack

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.077
is a sound strategy.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.012

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.621
It's like they were attacked by an invisible enemy.

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.905
DION: The ability, Zaltosis can be used by

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.007
any Percival Bakugan...

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.442
DION: ...It allows us to make any other Percival

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.711
invisible which then of course...

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.414
DION: ...allows us to launch a phantom attack...

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.082
DION: ...just like I did with Darkus Cyclone

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.785
Percival this round.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.353
DION: Thanks for being dumb enough to fall right

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.655
into my trap, Brawlers.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.924
[grunt]

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:06.925
SHUN: You can't !

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.926
LUCAS: Can't what?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.296
We told you we're playing by our rules now!

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.734
DION: You better wise up real quick.

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:18.670
Ability activate!

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:22.241
DION: Depth Cry!

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.642
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain] TAYLEAN: [grunt, pain]

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.244
TAYLEAN: Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:26.545
TRISTAR: Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:27.980
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.049
DAN: I can't take much more of this sitting around stuff.

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:33.685
DRAGO: Dan! Shouldn't we jump in?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:39.625
[\u266a]

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:41.927
DION: This is how the Tri-Twisters roll.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.495
Do you hear me Brawlers?

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.930
LUCAS: Get used to it!

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.231
SELLON: Unacceptable!

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.800
LUCAS: Hmmm? DION: Hmmm?

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.070
SELLON: [grunt]

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:58.644
[cheering]

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:03.282
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Sellon! Sellon! Sellon!

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:06.218
SELLON: Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.320
SELLON: Bakugan stand!

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:11.557
SELLON: Rise Haos Krowll!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.260
SELLON: Your strategies are dishonest.

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:17.529
And your tactics cowardly.

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:18.797
DION: Huh? Say what?

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.799
SELLON: You have no honour and you do not

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.968
deserve to battle here!

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.237
DION: Hah! Maybe it's time we teach you about

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.506
the Tri-Twister rules too!

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.741
DION: Ability activate!

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.311
DION: Depth Cry!

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.646
[\u266a]

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.320
SELLON: Ability activate! Battle Sines!

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.721
DION: Oh man!

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:45.724
LUCAS: Depth Cry just disappeared.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.830
SELLON: Battle Sines is a sacred wave that negates

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:54.900
all other abilities.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:19:03.008
[\u266a]

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.142
LUCAS: Huh? What is that?

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.945
DION: What is that?

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.046
ANUBIAS: Hey!

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.314
ANUBIAS: Who do you think you are?

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.350
Coming in here, setting down new rules?

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.552
It just doesn't work that way my friends.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.420
LUCAS: [gasp] DION: [gasp]

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:18.257
ANUBIAS: I think it's time you two clowns were

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.859
taught a real lesson.

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.728
LUCAS: Hey! Hold on a second!

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:25.430
DION: You can't just interrupt us like this!

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.833
ANUBIAS: According to my rules, I can.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:33.105
ANUBIAS: Ability activate. Tribal Crusher!

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:35.340
[\u266a]

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:38.877
LUCAS: Ohhh noooooo! DION: Ohhh noooooo!

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:47.152
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Sellon! Anubias! Sellon! Anubias!

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.153
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: This battle will be

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.454
ruled no contest!

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.589
I repeat...

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:54.593
...this battle will be ruled no contest!

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.361
DYLAN: No contest?

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.330
I'd say more like no holds barred.

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:02.100
That was pretty intense battle action.

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:06.305
ANUBIAS: Everybody goes through...

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:08.807
ANUBIAS: ...periods of fear and doubt...

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.410
The important thing is to push through it.

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:15.013
Otherwise, if you focus on it too much, you'll be

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.483
stuck in neutral forever.

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:22.888
DAN: I can't let him get inside my head!

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.257
DRAGO: If we don't figure this out soon,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.493
we're in real trouble, that's for sure.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:29.561
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.663
DAN: I know.

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:38.470
MAG MEL: Despite their loss, that was a most

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:44.743
impressive debut for my Chaos Bakugan and their battlers.

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:49.815
MAG MEL: It won't be long before I have all of the

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:56.421
dark energy that I require to become the supreme ruler!

00:20:56.455 --> 00:21:01.226
And then all will fall at my feet!

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.595
MAG MEL: [maniacal laughter]

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:10.268
DAN: I gotta say things have been at an all time low lately.

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.404
Ever since Drago inherited his new powers there's

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.940
been a huge rift between me and the other Brawlers.

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.341
They don't want me to battle to protect the

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.443
safety of the audience, but the longer I stay

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:21.046
away, the more support I lose from my fan base,

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:23.015
and the more popular creeps like Team Anubias

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:24.850
and Team Sellon get.

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.752
DAN: It feels like I'm in a no win situation here

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.754
and I really don't know what to do.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.423
DAN: Tune in next time to see the craziness I'm dealing with.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.758
Maybe you'll have some advice for me.

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.493
DAN: Anything would help, 'cos it feels like

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.328
I'm losing my mind!

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:46.405
