WEBVTT

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:06.906
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.409
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.878
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.847
Interspace the number of people accessing it from

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.449
around the world totally exploded!

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.551
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along with our

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.654
pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar; and Shun

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.025
who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.025
DAN: The flood of new battlers

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.093
means we're up against some

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.062
crazy serious competition now!

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.165
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen it before...

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.367
DAN: ...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.103
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:40.306
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.308
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.676
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.578
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.946
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.615
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.116
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.585
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:53.753
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.758
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.761
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.663
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.568
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.303
DAN: What's wrong, dude?

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.273
DRAGO: I'm losing it!

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:18.645
DRAGO: Can't control my power!

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:28.321
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.595
DAN: What did we just do?

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.797
DRAGO: I'm sorry.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.098
DAN: Drago!

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.233
DAN: Are you okay, buddy?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.168
Talk to me!

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.370
DAN: Drago!

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:54.614
MAG MEL: What is it, Razenoid?

00:01:54.647 --> 00:02:00.386
MAG MEL: I feel the same pain as you.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.623
MAG MEL: We don't have enough to make it stop!

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.660
MAG MEL: We need more energy to free our captive bodies!

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.763
They must battle more to get us what we need!

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.007
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Mechtogan Mayhem!

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:27.247
MARUCHO: So let's just be clear about this,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.549
You're saying that giant explosion in the last battle

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.051
was caused by Drago releasing too much energy

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.786
as he was fighting?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.489
DAN: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.492
DAN: Maybe the powers he gained in that last evolution

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.129
are too strong for him to control without training.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.999
DAN: Whatever the case, we gotta get things in check soon

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:50.203
before we wipe out the audience.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.539
MARUCHO: We saw how dangerous that power can be firsthand.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:57.777
So, maybe you should consider sitting Drago out for a while.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.945
DAN: Nah.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.280
All we need are a couple practice rounds

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.748
and we'll be good to go.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.350
Piece of cake.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.687
DAN: Nice one!

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.489
MARUCHO: I'm not so sure about that.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.490
TRISTAR: This is perfect.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.491
I want to battle.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.559
Dan wants to practice.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.694
Why don't we do a couple training rounds together?

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.596
DAN: Sounds good to me.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.698
TAYLEAN: Are you two actually listening what you're saying?

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.668
Honestly, it's like the blind leading the blind.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.969
TRISTAR: Are you listening to what you're saying?

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.070
That makes no sense.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.339
How can a blind person lead another blind person?

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.373
MARUCHO: Come on, guys!

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.841
This is no time to fight!

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.777
SHUN: Dan, I'm not sure you're being honest with us

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.978
or even yourself.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.212
DAN: Huh?

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.614
DAN: Why would you say that?

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.748
Everything's fine.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.116
Seriously.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.384
Aww.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.586
SHUN: Come on.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.820
This is us you're talking to Dan.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:41.988
DAN: Aw, snap dudes!

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.058
DAN: I forgot I have to get some stuff for my Mom.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.426
Gotta bail.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.463
MARUCHO: Dan, wait!

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:51.631
DAN: Sorry, Marucho!

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.966
We'll have to talk about this later, okay?

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.568
I promise!

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.370
MARUCHO: I guess we'll just have to keep an eye on things

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.573
but maybe I am worrying too much.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.343
TRISTAR: We need to focus on our own battle, right now!

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.577
MARUCHO: Good point.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.012
TAYLEAN: Where's Drago?

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.781
It's not like him to be away from Dan's side.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.216
SHUN: Hmmm.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.787
DAN: I hope I was believable back there.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.924
I don't want the guys to know I'm a little freaked out.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.759
DAN: I'm home!

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.527
MIYOKO: Hi, hun!

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.930
MIYOKO: Did you have fun with your friends?

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.032
DAN: Yeah, it was okay.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.567
MIYOKO: [gasp]

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.803
MIYOKO: [sigh] Teenagers are exhausting.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.907
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.042
DAN: Hey, pal!

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.477
Huh?

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.046
DAN: What's going on, buddy?

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.214
DRAGO: Yes.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.615
Sorry about that.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:43.983
DAN: You should take it easy.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.019
DAN: That last battle took a tonne out of you didn't it?

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.020
DRAGO: Don't worry.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.388
I'll be fine.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.056
What did you say to the others?

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.290
DAN: I just down played it.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.192
Told them some practice would fix things.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:57.030
DAN: That explosion has to be tied to your latest evolution.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.365
I'm sure of it, bud.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.867
DAN: Or maybe...

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.237
DAN: There's something that Code Eve didn't tell us about

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.638
the powers she gave to you.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:14.514
[\u266a]

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:16.416
DAN: Whatever it is, that thing is messing with our

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.251
battling abilities.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.653
DRAGO: The only solution is for me to figure out how to

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.789
control these powers.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.824
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.594
DRAGO: For better or worse, this thing is part of me now so,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.897
I must embrace it.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.366
DAN: Good plan.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.637
DAN: Guess we both know what comes next then.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.439
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Well, Bakugan fans the battle arena

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.608

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:46.379
spectacular match up!

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:47.814
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Representing the Battle

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.916
Brawlers it's the creator of Bakugan Interspace himself.,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.885
Marucho!

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.454
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: And on the opposing side,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.655
representing Team Anubias.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.923
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: He's four foot eight

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:58.558
and full of hate.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.126
It's Jack Hunt!

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.594
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: This is the latest battle between

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.429
these two teams as they battle it out for top spot in the

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.697
league standings.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.266
I promise you folks this is gonna be a doozie!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.268
MARUCHO: Maybe if I can gain some more ground for the team

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.070
then, Dan can focus on training Drago

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.672
with his new powers.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.607
TRISTAR: I'm so psyched to fight, I'm vibrating!

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.776
We're gonna pound these guys into a paste!

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:17.910
Yeeeeeah!

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.145
JACK: Hah!

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.346
Aw man, this stinks!

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.281
I thought I was gonna have a crack at King Kuso and

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.217
now I gotta fight this twerp?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.451
ANUBIAS: Jack!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.086
ANUBIAS: Don't worry about Dan, focus on the battle at

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.355
hand this should be an easy one.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.723
TRISTAR: You heard him, cockroach!

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.759
Step right up and see how easy we are!

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.160
MARUCHO: Tristar, no!

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.129
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Woooooooooo!

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.563
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.564
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Well, the surprises

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.699
just keep coming!

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:40.833
It appears that we have

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.668
Team Sellon in the audience, battle fans!

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.070
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: I guess everyone is anxious to

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:48.007
see how the action is gonna go down in the arena today!

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.509
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] Great.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.210
Another distraction for Jack.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.545
SELLON: Good luck, gentlemen!

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.413
We're looking forward to the battle ballet that

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.083
is about to unfold.

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.584
MARUCHO: Thanks guys!

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.119
TRISTAR: What's she talking about, ballet?

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.554
CHRIS: Madame Sellon wasn't talking to you.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.556
So mind your manners and while you're at it, why don't you

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.991
get some culture!

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.859
SOON: I don't see Dan Kuso anywhere.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:10.129
SELLON: Never mind that.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:14.600
SHUN: Hmmmm.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.637
SHUN: I think, I'm going to have to keep my eye on her.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.472
DYLAN: You and me both, pal.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.706
DYLAN: But I didn't come here

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.708
to chat about pretty girls.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.678
There's talk going around that maybe Drago's hurt and that's

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.181
why he and Dan didn't show today.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:29.982
SHUN: And just where did you hear that?

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.217
DYLAN: Sorry, pal.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.420
Can't reveal my sources.

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:36.289
DYLAN: Sounds like we're starting.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.392
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field Open!

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.074
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: For this next rumble, we're gonna

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:57.810
take it to the jungle!

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.178
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: And since both of these guys are

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.913
Aquos battlers, this environment should be

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.015
advantageous to both.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.152
MARUCHO: Gate Card, set!

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.521
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.456
MARUCHO: Bakugan Stand!

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.259
MARUCHO: Let's go, Aquos Tristar!

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.561
TRISTAR: Alright! Bring it on, suckers!

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.829
JACK: Hah!

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.664
Let's see if you've got the skills to back up your lip,

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.765
buddy!

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.134
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.536
JACK: Bakugan stand!

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.439
JACK: Go get'em, Aquos Krakenoid!

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.143
TRISTAR: Whoa!

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.278
Where is he?

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.846
JACK: Ability activate!

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.348
Fish lock!

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.515
TRISTAR: Fish what?

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.683
MARUCHO: Tristar!

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.886
MARUCHO: Watch out below!

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.721
TRISTAR: Huh?

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.289
MARUCHO: [angry grunt]

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.057
MARUCHO: Alright, time to step things up!

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.859
Ability activate!

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.861
Aquos Mine!

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:53.132
TRISTAR: [mighty roar]

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:58.771
TRISTAR: Oh yeah!

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.139
MARUCHO: Tristar! Look!

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.174
TRISTAR: Huh?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.378
TRISTAR: [grunt] Ooomph!

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.248
DAN: Kick it, Drago!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.451
DAN: Nice one.

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.020
How did that feel, pal?

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.588
DRAGO: It felt great!

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.690
This was a good idea to come here.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.392
DRAGO: An abandoned arena is the perfect location for this

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.227
kind of training.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.561
DAN: Yeah!

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:23.963
This way we can test your new powers full on, without having

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:25.932
to worry about the audience getting hurt.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.967
DRAGO: I need to get on top of my powers.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.536
Between that, your nightmares and the visions I'm having,

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.039
I don't like how out of control things are.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.740
DAN: All of these things only started happening after your

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.142
last evolution.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.944
If we can crack the secret to containing your

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:40.279
new powers then...

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:44.116
DAN: Hopefully we can figure the rest out too.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.087
TRISTAR: [panting]

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.223
TRISTAR: He cloned himself! Seriously?

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.092
DAN: Tristar! Watch out!

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:55.628
DRAGO: He can't hear you, it's just a transmission!

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.866
TRISTAR: [grunt]

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.867
JACK: Bet you can't tell

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.537
which one is the real one, can you?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.172
MARUCHO: Does he really think ganging up on us like that is

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.940
gonna work?

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.242
MARUCHO: Time we teach him a lesson about how we Brawlers

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.011
do things, Tristar!

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.913
MARUCHO: Gate Card, open!

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.849
MARUCHO: Egon Minzer!

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.851
TRISTAR: Haaaaaah!

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.419
JACK: What's happening?

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.524
ANUBIAS: Marucho just increased Tristar's power level!

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:28.461
Now he's the most powerful Bakugan on the field.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.762
TRISTAR: Hah!

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.763
Hah!

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:31.998
Hah!

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.501
Hah!

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.436
So, you like that you punks?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.704
MARUCHO: And there's more where that came from,

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.373
trust me!

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.541
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [wild cheers]

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.709
DRAGO: It looks like they're doing just fine.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.212
We should get back to our training.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:47.346
DAN: Okay, pal.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.049
Let's try switching up abilities this time.

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.218

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:54.687

DAN: That's it buddy.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.524
Slow and steady.

00:10:58.557 --> 00:10:59.792
As soon as you learn to harness this thing,

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.994
we'll be unbeatable in the ring.

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:07.033
DRAGO: [grunt] [gasp]

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:10.569
DRAGO: Aaaaarrrrrrgggghhhh!

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:23.983
DRAGO: The visions are back I feel my energy draining.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.363
DAN: Whoa! What the heck is going on?

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:50.109
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.577
DRAGO: What? DAN: Huh?

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.687
DAN: We gotta sort this crazy power out, Drago!

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.594
MARUCHO: We've got to win this one for the team, Tristar!

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.396
DRAGO: Now I'm really confused.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:11.931

DAN: Drago! You okay, buddy?

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:33.886
DRAGO: I think so, but what is that thing?

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:40.893
DRAGO: [grunt] Whoa!

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:41.927
DAN: Drago!

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.195

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.430

DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:57.143
Hmmmph!

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.146
Oooooomph!

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.714

DRAGO: Not even a scratch!

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.727
DRAGO: Who are you?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.862
Why are you here and what do you want from me?

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:17.897

Who's that?

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:58.397
TRISTAR: Where did he come from?

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.898
MARUCHO: [gasp] I don't know, but he doesn't

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:00.899
look too friendly!

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:02.334

We'll see about that!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.999
SELLON: Bakugan, Brawl!

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.668
SELLON: Bakugan Stand!

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.536
SELLON: Rise Ventus Spiron!

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:48.374
MARUCHO: Sellon!

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:51.844
SELLON: [grunt] Ability activate!

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.513
SELLON: Ancient Levity!

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.755
SELLON: Now's your chance!

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:05.023
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] Ability activate!

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.192
ANUBIAS: Tribal Crusher!

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:12.431
ANUBIAS: Stay out of my way!

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.800
Well, do you understand me Sellon?

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.736
SELLON: I think you've got things a little confused.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.373
It's you who is getting in my way, Anubias.

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.275
CHRIS: Man, she is so cool!

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.244
SOON: Well played, Madame!

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.346
SELLON: Hmmmph!

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.653
SELLON: He took a direct hit with no problem.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:37.156
ANUBIAS: It doesn't surprise me with the garbage

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.691
you were throwing.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.461
SELLON: I didn't see your attack do much better.

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:45.230
ANUBIAS: I was just getting warmed up, sweetheart.

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.366
Now we're gonna kick it up!

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:48.867
Let's go, Horridian!

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.670
Time to win this thing!

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:55.307
SELLON: Hmmmph, as if I'm going to leave this to you.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.777
Let's go, Spyron!

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:02.214
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [mighty round of cheers]

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:09.888
ANUBIAS: Ability activate!

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.323
ANUBIAS: Tribal Crusher!

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:17.029
SELLON: Ability activate!

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:19.865
Motion Vital!

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.636
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Whooooooaaaaaaa!

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.871
SHUN: Amazing.

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.806
They've combined forces!

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.015
ANUBIAS: No way!

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:47.092
[\u266a]

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:54.099
[\u266a]

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:58.670
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] And now he's gone!

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.672
SELLON: We'll have to resolve this another day.

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.641
ANUBIAS: [frustrated grunt]

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.577
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Well who'd have thunk it people!

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.413
A tag team battle with Anubias and Sellon!

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.215
BOY SPECTATOR: You're the best, Anubias!

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.950
GIRL SPECTATOR: We love you, Sellon!

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.051
DYLAN: Woah!

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.786
That was total awesome sauce.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.455
Man, I'm all tingly!

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.090
Woohooo!

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.258
TRISTAR: Not cool, man!

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.692
They totally hijacked our battle!

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.661
MARUCHO: That Mechtagon had the same destructive power

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.029
as Drago!

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.664
SHUN: I wonder...

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.666
SHUN: ...if they're somehow connected.

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.334
The timing sure is suspicious.

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:30.669
MARUCHO: Hmmm...

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:32.237
DAN: We've seen a lot of trippy stuff man, but this...

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.339
DAN: ...is craziness.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:38.410
DRAGO: Whatever that thing was it came from me.

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.345
We both saw it.

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:41.713
DAN: I know.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:44.950
It looks like harnessing your powers isn't all we have to do.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.453
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: Breaking news Baku fans!

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.789
The battle between Marucho and Jack has been officially ruled

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.392
\"no contest\" due to the sudden interference

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.627
of a bizarro Bakugan!

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:56.995
DAN: Oh man!

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.197
DRAGO: That's the Mechtagon Zenthon!

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.866
PLAY BY PLAY ANNOUNCER: While the identity and origin of the

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:03.468
battling brute is still unknown this announcer has no

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:07.706
doubt we'll be seeing much more of him in the future.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.822
MAG MEL: I see.

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:26.225
MAG MEL: So what you're telling me is that Drago has

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:29.995
spawned a Mechtagon just as Razenoid has.

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:34.066
SELLON: Yes, Master Mag Mel.

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.767
MAG MEL: Very interesting.

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:39.037
Who knew Titanium Dragonoid possessed such power?

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:42.841
MAG MEL: This is getting rather entertaining.

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.444
MAG MEL: Rip him apart!

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:48.447
Tear the power from inside of him!

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.549
Take what is ours!

00:20:53.952 --> 00:21:03.862
MAG MEL: My destiny.. Awaaaaits! [maniacal laughter]

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.667
DAN: Ever since Drago's last evolution

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.769
things have been completely nuts for us.

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:13.038
First he unleashes an insane amount of energy that nearly

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:15.674
destroys Bakugan Interspace then the same massive energy

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:17.809
creates a Mechtagon!

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.578
Talk about crazy!

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.279
DAN: Problem is, every time we try to get a handle on things

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:23.982
we're challenged to a battle by another new competitor.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.817
Just like that creep Anubias.

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.552
Man that guy gets on my nerves.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.521
DAN: Tune in, you'll see exactly the kind of insanity

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.056
I'm talking about.

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.891
DAN: But no matter what, we'll do what it takes to figure out

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.359
Drago's new powers.

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.395
And nothing will get in our way!
