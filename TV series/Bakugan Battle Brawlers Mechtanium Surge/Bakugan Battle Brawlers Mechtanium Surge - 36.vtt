WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.974
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.876
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.344
But then, out of nowhere

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.947
we were invaded by these mysterious, evil Mechtogan

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.682
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:20.320
Coredegon, Slycerak, Exostriker and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.056
and leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.858
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.126
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.328
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.530
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.566
So, we fought back because no one is gonna take our freedom.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.001
Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.171
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.107
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.543
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.513
\u266a Got to give it your all

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.382
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.217
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:55.388
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.026
\u266a You got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.695
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.063
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.972
My plan is finally coming together.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.909
With each battle they fight against the Brawlers,

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.345
the power of the Nonets is growing immensely.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.881
The time for the complete resurrection

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.883
of the Mechtogan is near.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.987
But first, I must bring together the Nonets one more time.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.094
The bond between Bakugan and humans is doomed.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.101
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.238
MARUCHO: Okay, everyone!

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.706
Listen up and pay attention!

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.976
We need to familiarize ourselves with the enemy.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.046
Here's what I've managed to gather on the Nonets.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.014
This is Pyrus Spatterix.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.449
He's a vicious one!

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.318
You've got to keep an eye on him.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.686
MARUCHO: And Subterra Stronk.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.021
That dude reminds me of a bulldog.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.823
Plus, he's as mean as he is dumb.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.358
MARUCHO: There's Ventus Worton.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.993
They call him \"professor.\"

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.828
He must be the brains of the bunch.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.263
MARUCHO: Next is Aquos Balista.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.698
Oh, this guy, now--

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.366
(Roxtor chattering)

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.868
What do you mean, zip it?

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.870
He's right. We don't need your commentary.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.037
Oh, yeah?

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.939
Well, who the heck made you boss, Reptak?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.674
Maybe the others find my insights useful.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.309
They really don't, trust me.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.644
Can we just focus, please?

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.412
Huh, fine, whatever!

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.648
I'll just keep my valuable intel to myself.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.716
Uh, right.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.219
Anyhow, these are Haos Tremblar, Darkus Betadron,

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.756
Darkus Kodokor and Darkus Mutabrid.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.962
Also, there are the four Mechtogans,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.298
starting with Coredegon, Slycerak,

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.500
Exostriker and Mandibor.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.636
And of course, their puppet-master Wiseman,

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.606
and let's not forgot they've stolen the Battle Suits now,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.044
Combustoid, Clawbruk and Fortatron.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.714
So, that's the total number of potential opponents,

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.716
and the level of fire power we're facing.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.486
We know what Wiseman's goal is, but what about the others?

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.421
Don't you remember what Betadron

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.256
and Mechtavius Destroyer told us?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.325
For countless millennia, we've been locked away

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.594
in the far depths of the Doom Dimension

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.230
after having been banished there by your ancestor,

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.699
the original Dragonoid.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:23.503
We may have broken the chains from our creator Bakugan,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.605
but we will never be truly free

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.707
until we destroy every last living Bakugan!

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.909
Argh!

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.478
So, that's your evil plan, is it?

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:36.182
Why would they join forces if their goals are different?

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:39.218
Doesn't that seem odd to any of you guys?

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.188
It's a smart move on Wiseman's part.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.657
Three groups of enemies with three goals

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.293
mean they fight three times as hard against us.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.761
So, then, what do you think

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.563
brought them all together in the first place?

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.466
And there's still the question of our enemy's true identity.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.335
Is he Gunz or Wiseman,

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.503
or are we dealing with a multiple personality?

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.241
Ah, this stinks.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.010
There's way too many questions,

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.545
and there are not enough answers.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.716
Well, we've never been the kind to sit around and wait.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.485
Maybe it's time we surprised them!

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.220
If we knew where their hideout was,

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:15.521
we could totally ambush them!

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:16.522
Mm-hmm.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.690
Sounds like a great plan,

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.926
but how would we even know where to start?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.261
It's not like they've got a sign hanging out front.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.296
(Roxtor shouting)

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.430
Oh, yeah, right.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.432
We could map out everywhere he's appeared in town,

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.201
and see if there's a pattern that might give us any clues.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.303
I was just about to say that before you interrupted!

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.505
(Whistling)

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:33.840
You rang, Master Shun?

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.208
What's up, boss?

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.844
We need you to help us on a recognizance mission,

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:40.446
gathering intelligence on Wiseman's whereabouts.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.915
Will you help? Skytruss, Orbeum?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.384
BOTH: Yes, sir!

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.918
We'll all go.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.020
Hmm.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.289
If we all split up, we should be able

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.058
to cover the entire city in no time at all.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.461
WISEMAN: I know you're still angry

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.930
that I ended our last battle against the brawlers early

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.332
before we could claim victory,

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.401
but trust me, it was for the best.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.437
And because of that, we are now entering the final stages

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.840
of my master plan to take down both Bakugan and Brawlers.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:11.110
Remember, you have fought some intense battles

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.046
and despite never coming out victorious,

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.480
you still gained power

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.949
that will allow you to be hosts for the Mechtogan.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.518
Why should we care?

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.320
Quite simply, because resurrecting them

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.756
and having them fight alongside of us

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.925
is the ultimate key to winning this.

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:26.926
What?!

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:27.927
Is he crazy?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.961
I don't believe it.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.363
(Growling)

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:34.534
I promise you all the day of reckoning is close at hand

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.737
for Drago and all of his Brawler friends.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.540
MARUCHO: Just remember, guys,

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.009
make sure to ask people if they noticed anything strange

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.477
before they saw Wiseman appear.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.080
We need all the info we can get.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.715
Hmm, excuse me, ma'am?

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:49.882
Yes?

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.618
I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time?

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.720
Really, you sure?

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:54.787
Uh-uh.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.889
Thank you. Sorry!

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.725
Nope, sorry, dude.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.526
Uh, okay, thanks.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.729
So? Have you had better luck than me?

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.565
Anyone you talk to seen anything of use?

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.233
No, not a single thing.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.534
Huh?

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.903
Skytruss, watch out! Duck!

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.472
Whoa, ah, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.007
Hold on, I'm coming!

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.282
I'm not sure I like this plan to resurrect the Mechtogan.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.351
Does no one else have a problem with it?

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.419
Why?

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.887
Did you forget what they did to Fury?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.388
(Screaming)

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.160
What if they do the same to us?

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:37.497
It's definitely a possibility, I'm aware of that.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.233
But I think we can all agree that it's worth the risk.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:43.336
I still think we can take down the Brawlers without their help.

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.506
Maybe it's Wiseman holding us back.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.308
Whatever the case, nothing has changed for us.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.779
Failure means a return to the Doom Dimension.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.281
So, we'll use Wiseman to help us

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.717
get our revenge against Drago,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.687
and if others dare to cross us, then we'll destroy them, too.

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.659
It's time for us to go.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.568
So, if we have no eyewitness information

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.103
that can lead us in the direction of his hideout,

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.204
what can we do?

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.139
Every time he teleports himself,

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.875
he must leave an atomic signature in the atmosphere.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.812
Maybe there's a way we can see which ones are the strongest

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.947
and use that to reverse triangulate coordinates

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.482
back to his origin point.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:30.783
That's not a bad idea.

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:31.918
Whoa!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.286
Did you feel that?

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.754
Yes, the dimension field rippled.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:35.855
Wiseman must be near.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.223
Up there!

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.896
Let's go! Onto the next spot.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.064
Right.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.199
Wait a second.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.201
What is it, Jaakor?

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.970
I'm picking up an urgent signal from Skytruss and Orbeum.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:52.104
Huh?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.874
Okay, roger that. We're on our way.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.877
They've got a visual on Wiseman in the West Bay area.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.212
Let's go!

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.548
Attention! Wiseman has been spotted in the West Bay area!

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:05.084
Everyone, head there immediately!

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.587
JAAKOR: Correction, he's now headed further up the inlet.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.290
Please hurry, everyone!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:15.361

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.300
SHUN: Skytruss, Orbeum! Prepare for battle!

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:26.839
The time of the Mechtogan is near!

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.878
Huh?

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:32.879
There you are!

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.614
Good work, guys. Thank you, sensei.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:38.050
Good afternoon,

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:41.921
or at least it will be once I win this battle

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.357
and put you and your Bakugan down for good.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.459
Oh, yeah?

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.694
This has gone on too long, wouldn't you say?

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:49.929
You bet!

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.398
So, let's quit talking and get on with it, okay?

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.834

No!

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.358
I am gonna crush you, Drago!

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.359

It's over.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.416
Nothing is over until you pay for the suffering

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.452
your ancestors caused us!

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:48.220
That's all for now, Betadron.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.288
What?

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.357
The power-up is now complete.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.326
I thank you Nonets for your valued service,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.763
but the Mechtogan can take it from here on in.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:00.666
(Growling)

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:03.702

Hmm.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.057
Ha, finally.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.259
It is good to be back.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.295
I feel better than ever.

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:30.963
What's the hold-up?

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:33.866
Let's jump right into the action.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.200
(Moaning)

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:37.870

Ahhhhh!

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.375
Can't hold on...

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.377
Much longer!

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.113
Jaakor! Orbeum! Skytruss!

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.816
Prepare to suffer, fool!

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:51.917

(Groaning)

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.013
Ahhhhh!

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.048
Drago, you okay?

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:28.187
Hmm, not bad for a test run.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.224

Yeah?

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.070
Two can play at that game.

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.071
Call him!

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.107
Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.347
Bakugan, brawl!

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:58.784
Bakugan, brawl!

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:00.452
Are you ready, Drago?

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:01.687
Yup.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.190
Bakugan, brawl!

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.292
Right on!

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.828
Jumping attack!

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.364
Ahhhhh!

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:14.066
Rowr!

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.735
Hold on, Jaakor!

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:19.772
Ability, activate!

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:22.174
Supreme Jet Shot!

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.309
Argh!

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.345
And I'll raise you a little Harvey Cannon.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.151
Really? How disappointing.

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.753
I remember you as more challenging opponents.

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:35.988
What happened?

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.689
That shield is new.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.625
Do you like it?

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:42.094
It requires a lot of energy to feed it,

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.362
but with it on,

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:46.432
your attacks feel like I'm being tickled with feathers.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.467
Now, begone!

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.472
Arrrgh!

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.707
Ahhhh!

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.643
Jaakor!

00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:00.679
Mechtavius Destroyer's just so much stronger than before.

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:02.748
We've still got some fight left, boss.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:04.817
Put us back in the battle, please!

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.785
(Roxtor chattering)

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:09.655
See, even Roxtor agrees with me, so how about it?

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.423
I don't know.

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:14.626
Marucho, get out of the way!

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.863
Dragonoid Destroyer and I can handle this.

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:21.033
Attack!

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.702
Freeze Forward!

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:28.874
Engage again, don't stop!

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:31.110
Ha, bust down his shield!

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.444
(Grunting)

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:35.214
Don't you understand? This is pointless.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:39.151
Listen to me, brother!

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:41.153
We are both Mechtogan.

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.222
We need neither the humans nor Bakugan.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.390
Let us join to become the ultimate Mechtogan.

00:18:45.424 --> 00:18:46.592
What is he doing?

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.261
You needn't be their slave anymore.

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:52.264
Break free and fight alongside your true family.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.599
Come join us now.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.766
Don't listen to him.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.768
Yeah, he's nothing more than a lying creep!

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.937
Silence, you insolent fool!

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.906
Superior beings are trying to speak here.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.746
I am a Mechtogan,

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:10.949
but one born from human and Bakugan alike.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.952
My true families, and I am here to protect them.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.053
What?

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:19.158
Not even your best lies could turn me against them.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.227
Yeah, buddy!

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.263
Ahh!

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.634
If that's your response to my offer,

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.536
then I am truly disappointed.

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:34.506
It wasn't my first choice to destroy a fellow Mechtogan,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.242
but unfortunately, you've left me with no alternative.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.310
Drago!

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.311
Cross gear shield.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.213
Say goodbye!

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.315
You'll never take me down!

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:48.887
Stay strong, buddy!

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.355
You can do this.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.591
Mechtavius Destroyer's got nothing on you.

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.426
Sorry, my brothers.

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:56.428
He's too powerful!

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:59.398
I... can't... hold... on!

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:02.134
(Shouting in pain)

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.835
Whoa!

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.404
Dan! Drago!

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:08.707
Nice one, we took down their Mechtogan.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.410
With him out of the way, we can crush the others.

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.878
What are we waiting for?

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.313
Let's take them down now.

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.949
As much as I would love to,

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.751
that last blast took everything we had.

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:22.554
We're going to need to recharge before such an attack.

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.490
But there's no reason we still can't have a bit of fun,

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:26.858
and inflict more anguish

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.728
upon these worthless insects that oppose us.

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.496
Listen up, Brawlers!

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.466
I'm giving you the time it will take us to recharge,

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:38.203
twelve hours, to destroy your own partner Bakugan.

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:42.140
If you do so, when we return we will only destroy you.

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:46.211
If you don't, we will wipe out the entire population of Earth.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.047
So, the fate of the world is in your hands.

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:54.052
For the sake of its citizens, I hope you choose wisely.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.921
Unbelievable!

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.190
You can't be serious!

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:00.692
We'll never do that, do you hear me?

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:05.330
We won't back down!

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.901
DAN: Bakugan City is gripped with panic

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.471
after Mechtavius Destroyer threatened to destroy everyone

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.940
if the Brawlers don't take out their own partner Bakugan,

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.441
and they're right to be scared

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.443
because that dude is packing some serious power!

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:20.445
Not only that, we don't have Dragonoid Destroyer

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:21.747
backing us up this time.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.482
We've been left with an impossible decision to make.

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:24.816
I got to tell you,

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.218
the stress is nearly tearing the Brawlers apart.

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.953
I'm not sure what we're gonna do.

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.488
Maybe you should tune in to see if we make the right choice.

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.789
One thing's for sure,

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.724
I've never seen Shun's ninja calm shaken so badly.

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.526
So, you know you're in for some heavy action.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.129
I just hope we make it out alive!

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:47.139
