WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.974
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.009
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.978
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.047
by these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.015
who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.183
Coredegon

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.184
Slycerak

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.386
Exostriker

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.820
and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.956
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.891
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.594
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.330
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.599
So we fought back, because no one is going to

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.001
take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.138
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.408
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.577
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.881
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.050
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.788
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.762
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.998
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.002
DAN: Unbelievable! You guys serious?

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.105
DAN: You were able to combine Jaakor with two other Bakugan?

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.408
SHUN: Yes, with Orbeum and Skytruss.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.577
JAAKOR: They were my former students, and have since...

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.013
pledged allegiance to the Battle Brawlers.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.749
DAN: Sweet. We're gonna need all the help we can get,

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.417
I'm feeling way better knowing we've got...

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.288
this many combination options to fight Wiseman with.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.823
REPTAK: Combining seems to be the key to...

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.257
taking the Nonets down.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.126
MIRA: And we know which members of our team combine.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.761
except for Radizen.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.229
DAN: [gasp] RADIZEN: Uh...

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.730
DAN: Right. So how 'bout it?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.399
RADIZEN: Ummmm... SHUN: Combine....

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.969
RADIZEN: Yeah, yeah well um the thing is uh...

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.938
MARUCHO: Radizen and I are the best combination...

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.040
anyone can ask for, right pal?

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.476
RADIZEN: Uh yeah. Uh, that's right!

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.078
[grunt, pain reax] What the?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.713
RADIZEN: Didn't you see me standing there?

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.281
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.583
RADIZEN: Yeah! Well no one asked you, okay?

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.218
MIRA: [gasp] MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.486
MARUCHO: Hmmmm.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.021
MIRA: Sounds like Roxtor thinks he might have a solution.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.890
MIRA: Why don't we hear him out?

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:12.098
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Combination Impossible

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.867
RADIZEN: First I can't be launched...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.503
by Dragonoid Destroyer. Now I'm worried if I can't combine with

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.973
another Bakugan, Marucho won't want to battle with me anymore.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.077
MIRA: Huh!

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.747
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu MIRA: Hmmm?

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.082
MIRA: You okay?

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.818
RADIZEN: No I'm not okay! I need your help!

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.920
RADIZEN: You gotta find a way to fix me so I can be...

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.455
launched by Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.723
MIRA: Huh?

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.124
RADIZEN: I just need a little help to get up to speed...

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.392
with the Baku Skyraiders.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.060
MIRA: Hey, take it easy.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.929
RADIZEN: C'mon, Mira. You've seen me in action.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.965
I'm no slouch. All I'm asking is for a little boost.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.001
You heard Dan. We need to be tip-top...

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.603
if we're gonna defeat Wiseman. This isn't just for me.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.406
It's for all of us. There must be something you can do.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.841
MIRA: I'm sorry. I can't.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.576
RADIZEN: What d'ya mean? Why not?

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.112
MIRA: I'm afraid it's just not that simple.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.715
RADIZEN: Never mind then it was a silly idea anyhow.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.918
MIRA: Don't go.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.287
RADIZEN: There's something I forgot to do.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.089
RADIZEN: I'll catch you guys later.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.994
MIRA: See you...

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.402
RADIZEN: I can hear you breathing, you know.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.704
RADIZEN: I'm really not in the mood right now Roxtor,

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.673
so do me a favour and beat it.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.141
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.777
RADIZEN: I don't care. I don't want to hear it, okay.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.880
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.948
RADIZEN: What did you say?

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.749
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu!

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.485
RADIZEN: I don't have time for your crazy talk, Roxtor.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.821
I came up here to be alone. Can't you take a hint...

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.289
for once in your life?

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.458
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.260
RADIZEN: I have to figure out a way where I can be...

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.696
the best partner possible to Marucho and listening to your...

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.532
jibber jabber isn't helping. So for the last time,

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.100
hit the road!

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.568
RADIZEN: Huh, I can't believe that guy.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.670
I've got heavy stuff on my mind and instead of helping...

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.973
he's buzzing around like he always does and is all...

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.941
blah, blah, blah... Huh?

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.977
MARUCHO: [chuckles] There you are.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.245
I was looking for you all over the place.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.048
RADIZEN: Um why? Is there something wrong?

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.817
MARUCHO: Just follow me.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.685
RADIZEN: Uh okay.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.253
RADIZEN: Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.556
'Cos if not, I've got a few things I need to sort out.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.158
MARUCHO: Relax, Radizen.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.360
DAN: Hey you guys!

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.361
MARUCHO: Huh!

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.762
MARUCHO: Oh hey Dan.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.330
DAN: We want to have a meeting to discuss strategy...

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.833
against Wiseman.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.802
SHUN: Hey, are you guys heading out somewhere?

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:32.138
MARUCHO: Yep, that's right. We're just on our way...

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.907
to my family's off site Nautical Laboratory.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.209
DAN: Like right now?

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.410
MARUCHO: Yes.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.980
SHUN: Marucho, I don't think that's a very good idea.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.649
DRAGO: I agree with Shun.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:44.217
JAAKOR: Wiseman's been targeting each of the...

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.618
Battle Brawlers individually.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:48.521
He's already had a go at us, you'll probably be next.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.090
RADIZEN: Whoa! I never thought about that.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.392
Maybe they're right, boss.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.560
DAN: Do you really have to go to this place?

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.863
MARUCHO: Absolutely.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.331
SHUN: Okay then we'll go with you.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.932
MARUCHO: No thanks. We'll be fine.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.802
MARUCHO: I appreciate your concern but Radizen and I...

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:06.873
can hold our own against Wiseman if he shows up.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:07.974
RADIZEN: Yeah, that's right.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.208
DRAGO: But Marucho...

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:12.912
MARUCHO: Enough! You guys seriously need to back off.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.248
SHUN: Fine then.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.251
DAN: Yeah, okay. Good luck, see ya.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.622
BETADRON: We've been doing it your way,

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.657
and look where it's gotten us!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.494
WISEMAN: Relax, Betadron. You forget, with each failed battle

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.630
we have gained intelligence about the Brawlers.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.298
So it's not a complete loss.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.666
WISEMAN: [laughter]

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.301
BETADRON: You think this is funny?

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.270
WISEMAN: Calm down already.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.205
WISEMAN: I have a new plan okay?

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.673
BETADRON: Go on then.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.875
WISEMAN: It's time we reverse tactics.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.310
BETADRON: What?

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:48.114
WORTON: Up until now we've gone after their strongest members.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.183
This time we'll target their weak spot.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.085
And I know just who that is.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.786
WORTON: Marucho and Radizen.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.057
WISEMAN: Well done Professor Worton. I'm impressed.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:03.529
Perhaps you and Balista will join me this time? Sound good?

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:07.400
BALISTA: I don't know about Worton but I'm certainly game.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.868
WISEMAN: [chuckle]

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.540
MARUCHO: That's it up ahead.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:18.144
RADIZEN: Whoa. It's massive.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.680
MIRA: I can't believe you talked me into this.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.549
Why are we spying on our own teammates Roxtor?

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.551
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:28.054
MIRA: What? Well, why didn't you just tell that...

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:33.760
to Radizen, then? I guess he's not the easiest one to talk to.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.465
RADIZEN: This place is epic.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.134
MARUCHO: Yes, it is, isn't it?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.237
The energy we produce here using cold fusion from deep-sea water

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.706
is what we use to fuel 80% of the power grid...

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.741
at my family's lab complex.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:51.811
MARUCHO: Water is all around us, but very few people...

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:55.515
realize how much usable power it actually contains.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.949
RADIZEN: Water power?

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.885
MARUCHO: Aquos power!

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.120
RADIZEN: Yeah I guess it is.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:04.457
MARUCHO: The beauty of water's power is its fluidity.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.359
At times it is gentle and soothing,

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.427
other times mighty and punishing.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.896
That's why I think it's the greatest...

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.765
of all of the elements. As an Aquos battler...

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.201
you possess all of those strengths.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:18.404
RADIZEN: I do? You really think so?

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:20.706
RADIZEN: What am I talking about? Of course you're right!

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.976
I'm an Aquos battler, which means I'm as bad as they come.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.379
Who cares if I can't be launched by Dragonoid Destroyer?

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.948
MARUCHO: So are you feeling any better now, Radizen?

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.149
RADIZEN: Huh?

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.251
MARUCHO: I know you felt pressured when the others...

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.288
asked you about combining, but it doesn't bother me.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.956
RADIZEN: Are you sure Marucho?

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.991
It's just I don't want to let you down.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.827
MARUCHO: Don't worry, you could never let me down,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.096
Radizen I know you've always got my back.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.598
RADIZEN: Yeah! You know it, boss.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.267
I'm totally done wasting my time worrying about this.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.236
Let's just focus on taking down Wiseman!

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:54.841
MARUCHO: Yes! That's exactly what I want to hear!

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.477
MARUCHO: Now that we've got that stuff out of the way...

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.146
I've got something cool I wanna show you.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.582
RADIZEN: Sweet! I'll race you there!

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.250
MARUCHO: Whoa! Hold up!

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.752
You're going the wrong way!

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:11.090

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.026
MIRA: [gasp] What's wrong?

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.195
Why are you so upset?

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.497
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:22.401
MIRA: Guess we didn't need to take that plane ride...

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.337
out here after all.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.507
RADIZEN: Cool. What is this place?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.609
MARUCHO: This is where we're conducting...

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:32.178
the latest hydro experiments.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.113
MARUCHO: Each of these tanks houses a unique set...

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.816
of variables whose reactions we're tracking.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.552
WISEMAN: All this talk has me anxious to try an experiment...

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.553
of my own.

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.988
MARUCHO: Hummmm?

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.225

MARUCHO: Wiseman!

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.470
WISEMAN: I want to see what kind of chain reaction...

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:02.842
I can cause the Brawlers after I wipe you two off the map.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.876
WISEMAN: Hmmph.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.147
WISEMAN: Time to show them what you're made of, Balista!

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.053

RADIZEN: Seriously? This clown thinks a couple of bubbles

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.466
are gonna take me down?

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.235
RADIZEN: Huh!

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.405
RADIZEN: Man, I've seen snails that move faster.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.807
Bah, enough of this.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.209
MARUCHO: Be careful! It could still be a trick!

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.478
RADIZEN: Nah, I don't think so. Check it out...

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.946
while I burst his bubble.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.152
RADIZEN: Yeeeeeeeoooooow!

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:23.322

What makes you think you can do any better?

RADIZEN: It doesn't matter what you guys throw at us,

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:36.262
Marucho and I will never be beaten because we've got...

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:39.665
a solid bond like you two creeps have never seen before!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.201

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:44.470

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.802
RADIZEN: Don't worry, Marucho! I'll prove to you that...

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:06.305
you weren't wrong to put your faith in me.

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:07.473
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.941
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.843
RADIZEN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.380
MARUCHO: Whoa!

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:17.249
MIRA: The tornado's turning everything in its path to ice!

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.051
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.688
RADIZEN: These guys won't beat me!

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:23.889
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.524
MARUCHO: Radizen!

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:29.428
RADIZEN: I am gonna drop the Aquos hammer!

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.263
WORTON: You've got it backward, fool!

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.499
You're the one who's going to be dropped!

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.733
RADIZEN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.168
MARUCHO: Radizen!

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.737
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.239
MIRA: Roxtor, no!

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.274
RADIZEN: Huh?

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.677
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.944
RADIZEN: What?

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.147
RADIZEN: Alright, alright, Mr. Big Talk. If you think...

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.481
you can do better, show me!

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.685
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu, Kyukyukyu

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.326
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.794
RADIZEN: Now what? Huh?

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.530
RADIZEN: [grunt, pain reax]

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.231
RADIZEN: Oooomph! Ouch!, Oooohh!, Owwwww!

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:09.168
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu, Kyukyukyu, Kyukyukyu

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.372
MARUCHO: Radizen! MIRA: Roxtor!

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.219
[heavy ground impact]

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.224
MIRA: I can't believe it!

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:34.626
MARUCHO: They actually combined!

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.334
COMBINED RADIZEN: Did we just...? But how did...?

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.335
We're combined?

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.536
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.138
COMBINED RADIZEN: I just can't believe that out of all...

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:49.141
the Bakugan to combine with, it would be you!

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.310
COMBINED RADIZEN: But it feels gooooooood!

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.313
WISEMAN: I would say the stakes just got raised.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:57.149
COMBINED WORTON: I'll bet those two morons don't even realize...

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.585
the power they possess by being combined.

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:01.253
COMBINED WORTON: Too bad they won't be around long enough...

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.322
to figure it out. Ha ha!

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.690
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.191
COMBINED RADIZEN: Yeah, I'm ready too.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.593
COMBINED RADIZEN: Why don't we take these new...

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.895
combined powers for a test drive!

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:16.201
MARUCHO: Roxtor, Radizen, get ready Juuuuuuump!

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.003
COMBINED RADIZEN: Hmmmmph!

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.272
MARUCHO: Combined Ability activate!

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:22.408
MARUCHO: Abyss Grander!

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:26.478
COMBINED RADIZEN: [rising might roar]

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.714
COMBINED WORTON: Your powers are inferior!

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:30.482
COMBINED RADIZEN: We'll see about that!

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.452
Haaaaaah!

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.800
COMBINED WORTON: I can't believe they stopped our hydro twister!

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.202
Now, I'm mad.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.171
COMBINED RADIZEN: I can't believe I'm saying this Roxtor,

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:54.406
but I think we make a pretty good team.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.209
We should find a name for when we do this combo thingy.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.445
Hmmmm?

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.980
COMBINED RADIZEN: How 'bout the Friendship Bond?

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:05.150
Partner Power? Yeah! I like that.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:08.454
It's got a real ring to it, if I do say so myself!

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.956
MARUCHO: Combined Ability activate!

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.825
MARUCHO: Terror Blue

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.595
COMBINED RADIZEN: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:31.076
MIRA: Roxtor, Radizen...

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.713
COMBINED RADIZEN: Oh yeah! This is some power we've got, Roxtor!

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.682
COMBINED WORTON: Their power is impressive,

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:40.085
but it's still no match for ours.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.488
WISEMAN: Combined Ability, activate!

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:44.523
WISEMAN: Blast Burn!

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.492
COMBINED WORTON: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.797
MARUCHO: Radizen! MIRA: Roxtor!

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.432
RADIZEN: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:54.600
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyuk

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.569
COMBINED RADIZEN: We're taking you, doooooooown!

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.271
COMBINED WORTON: Uh oh! [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.310
COMBINED WORTON: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:12.050
MARUCHO: [gasp] Huh? You did it guys!

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.921
COMBINED RADIZEN: Yeah we did. We actually won!

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:19.591
WORTON: So this is the kind of power that humans...

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:23.295
and Bakugan wield when they battle together.

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:28.100
WISEMAN: I see you've learned from today's little battle.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.913
RADIZEN: Man, did you see the way we wiped the cocky...

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:43.982
grins off those Nonets' faces? It was awesome.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.584
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:48.720
RADIZEN: Hmmm? Look, I listened to you in the end, didn't I?

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.256
Why do you have to bring that up?

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.159
RADIZEN: Argh, talk about spoiling the moment!

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:55.561
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:58.530
RADIZEN: Sheesh! So I got angry with you a few times,

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.165
I gave you your props in the end.

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.600
Isn't that what's important?

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:04.136
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu, Kyukyukyu

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:05.871
RADIZEN: Don't you take that tone with me!

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:07.806
'Cos I'll come over there and make you eat this broom.

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.174
You hear me?

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:11.510
MIRA: Unbelievable. You'd think after everything they went...

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:14.112
through today, they'd have figured out a way to get along.

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:19.084
MARUCHO: I guess some things never change Mira.

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.386
MARUCHO: But then again, I guess I don't have to tell you

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.057
that sometimes the greatest partnerships...

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.260
come from the most unlikely of combinations.

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.462
MIRA: Yeah, your right.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:33.232
MIRA: I'm just glad Roxtor didn't give up on Radizen.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:37.669
Otherwise we'd have never known the power they had together.

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:44.243
MARUCHO: Well, nothing good comes easy, know what I mean?

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:47.512
Especially when Radizen is involved.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:48.747
MIRA: That is true.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.282
MARUCHO: Hmmph.

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.950
MIRA: I thought getting these two to work together...

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:54.186
doing chores might help prep them to become partners,

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.588
but now I'm not so sure. Maybe we should make it...

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.157
more permanent by adding Roxtor to the team.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:03.328
MARUCHO: [gasp] That is a great idea, Mira!

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.364
RADIZEN: Roxtor, you are cuh-razy!

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:10.068
DAN: Until now we'd been able to fight off Wiseman

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.004
and the Nonets every time they attacked,

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:14.373
but with each battle it was definitely getting tougher.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.475
Luckily for us, Mira finally completed her work on

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:19.144
the new Battle Suits. Vestal technology is the best

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:21.313
in the universe. Before we could try it out though,

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.948
Mira collapsed from exhaustion.

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.117
I guess working around the clock had worn her out.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.952
That meant we were suddenly short a team member

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:29.087
which wasn't the greatest news as we were about to

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.690
engage in another battle. You've got to tune in

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:34.126
to see how we handled the action. It was totally intense!

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.761
Oooh, I almost forgot. You won't believe

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.462
the surprise visitor we had.

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:47.539
