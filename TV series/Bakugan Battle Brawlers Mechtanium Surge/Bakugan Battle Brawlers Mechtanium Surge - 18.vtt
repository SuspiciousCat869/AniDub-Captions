WEBVTT

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.142
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.677
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.347
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.549
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.852
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.121
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.790
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.960
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.195
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.764
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.200
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.137
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.507
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.676
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.913
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.083
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:56.189
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.758
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.828
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.399
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:11.071
[laser blasts]

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.741
[explosions]

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:20.079
[laser blasts and explosions]

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.314
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER #1: Stand firm!

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:31.391
We can't let them destroy any more of Gundalia!

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:37.597
We can't let them destroy any more of Gundalia!

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:48.908
SELLON: All of their pitiful attempts make me laugh.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.710
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER #1: They're too strong.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.247
ANUBIAS: Now, where's that little rat Dan Kuso?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.283
ANUBIAS: [evil laughter]

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:06.259
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Battle Lines

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.364
ELRIGHT: We've confirmed that the invading Chaos Bakugan...

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.299
...are heading in one direction.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.401
REN: That's right. They're all proceeding directly

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.303
to the capital of Gundalia.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.738
DAN: Sounds like bad news.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.007
ELRIGHT: You're right. There's a dimension transporter

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.343
in the capital that connects Gundalia to Neathia.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.978
We can only assume they're heading there

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.747
because they want to invade Neathia next.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.848
RAFE: Are you serious?

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.384
SHUN: Do we know where Mag Mel is now?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.420
REN: Kind of. We're picking up bio-waves

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.322
that are being sent to the Chaos Bakugan.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.991
We believe its Mag Mel giving his orders,

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.526
and they're on a frequency that would suggest

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.994
he's hiding under ground.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.162
PAIGE: [angry grunt] So what are we waiting for?

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.598
Let's go! It's time we smoke that rat

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.333
out of his hole and squash him!

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.435
REN: Paige remember the last time we tried

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.806
a surprise attack? The surprise ended up being on us.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.542
ELRIGHT: Right now we have to focus on protecting

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.677
the people of Gundalia. That's our first priority.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.980
PAIGE: Arrrggh! Fine then!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.149
DAN: So let's go take care of that swarm...

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.884
of Chaos Cockroaches first and then Drago and I...

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:10.156
will find Mag Mel and we'll finish him off too!

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.125
MARUCHO: Sorry Dan, but you guys are gonna have to

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.426
sit this one out.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.532
DAN: Huh?

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.000
DAN: What are you talking about?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.502
Quit fooling around, Marucho.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.470
MARUCHO: I'm not fooling around this time, Dan.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.606
You need to take yourself out of this next battle.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.441
DAN: What for?

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.176
MARUCHO: The reason our last plan fell apart...

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.379
was because Mag Mel used your psychic link to read your mind,

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.348
and see the ambush we had planned.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.884
We can't risk being compromised like that again.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.286
MARUCHO: Not to mention that you're not in fighting shape.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.522
Having your brain invaded repeatedly has taken

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.124
a toll on your body. You're a liability.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.360
DAN: What? That's just crazy talk.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.262
MARUCHO: I went against my better judgment before...

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.497
and let Drago fight when he didn't have control...

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.834
of his powers and that ended badly.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.003
DRAGO: But things are different now.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.772
DAN: I'm the original Battle Brawler, you're not...

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:03.509
gonna keep me from this fight. I came to free Gundalia.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.678
MARUCHO: We need to pick the best strategy right now,

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:09.349
and that means reducing any unnecessary risks, like you.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:15.888
DAN: [gasp]

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.224
DAN: Who are you calling a risk?

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.258
MARUCHO: Whoa!

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.560
DAN: [angry grunt] How many times...

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.662
have I saved your bacon over the years, huh?

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.964
And now you're going to call me a threat to the team?

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.065
TRISTAR: Let him go, dude!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.869
DRAGO: Dan! Stop it!

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:32.238
DAN: [angry grunt] You're a punk!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.540
RAFE: That's enough, Dan! Try to stay focused...

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.009
on who the real enemy is here!

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:40.446
DAN: Hmmm! Whatever.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.681
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER #1 : The Chaos Bakugan have

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.116
breached the perimeter!

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:51.257
REN: We've gotta go!

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.892
MARUCHO: We'd better hurry up, Shun.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:57.930
SHUN: Yeah...

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.232
DAN: Stinks!

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.234
TRISTAR: I can't believe the nerve of Dan, putting his hands

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.670
on you like that. Not cool at all, dude.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.104
MARUCHO: He's just mad.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.239
TRISTAR: No kidding.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.041
MARUCHO: If I hadn't spoken to him that harshly,

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:10.810
he would've ignored us, and rushed back out into battle.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:11.911
MARUCHO: Even though he knows

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:21.988
he could've hurt himself or others.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:28.695
he could've hurt himself or others.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:33.166
TAYLEAN: What's wrong, Shun?

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.870
SHUN: Nothing. I'm just fine.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:40.239
DAN: I'm sorry, Drago. After all the training and hard work

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.308
we went through to get back in synch...

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.811
I let Mag Mel get in my head, and now we can't battle.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.380
DRAGO: It's not your fault. You had no way of knowing

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:50.416
they were playing us. But now that we do...

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.852
I think it's time we settle the score.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:57.156
DAN: That sounds... like a plan.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.692
DAN: [angry grunt] Mag Mel!

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.027
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Aaaaarrrrrgggghhh!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.729
DRAGO: Dan!

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.697
DAN: Aw! Not again! It's happening!

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.332
DRAGO: Dan! Don't let him in!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.735
Stay strong! You can fight it!

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:13.473
MAG MEL: Where are you, Kuso? You can't hide from me forever!

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.008
MAG MEL: Come to me! Give me the key and...

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.311
gate that I seek, nooooow!

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.612
DAN: Say what?

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:24.150
MAG MEL: Give me what I seek, or Gundalia will be destroyed!

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:33.326
MAG MEL: [evil laughter]

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:38.064
DAN: Huh? Stop iiiiiiiiiiit!

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.832
DAN: [gasp]

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.467
DRAGO: Is he gone?

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.670
DAN: Yeah, it's really weird Drago,

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:47.840
Mag Mel said something about a Key and a Gate.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.910
DRAGO: That sounds very familiar.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.745
DAN: That girl we fought in New Vestroia

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.081
talked about it too, remember?

00:06:55.114 --> 00:07:01.554
DRAGO: Yes! That's right!

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:07.093
DAN: [gasp]

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:09.862
DAN: Let's Mobile Assault this.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:20.139
BAKUMETER: Ready, Zoompha.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.675
DAN: Mobile Assault Vehicle!

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:30.249
DAN: Laaaaaaaunch!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.517
DAN: Let's go!

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:37.523
DRAGO: Ready!

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:46.032
MAG MEL: Come to me now Dan Kuso!

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:48.568
DAN: I have no clue what this Key and Gate are,

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.505
but at least now we know it's us he's after and not Gundalia.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.173
DRAGO: Then let's pay him a visit.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.608
DAN: That's the plan!

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.443
DAN: I have to do this myself.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:01.347
I can't keep putting the others in danger.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.115
DAN: Huh!

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.385
DRAGO: What?

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.687
DRAGO: Taylean?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.723
SHUN: Hey where do you think you're going?

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.730
SHUN: We can't let Dan jeopardize

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:19.031
the mission, Taylean!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.003
DAN: We may have to call on Zenthon for help, Drago!

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:37.617
LINEHALT: Bolting Vibra!

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.856
WOLFURIO: In the name of the Castle Knights of Neathia...

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.426
I cast you out!

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.062
BOULDERON: Come and get some!

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.865
RAFE: It doesn't matter how many we stop they just keep coming.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:58.170
PAIGE: Then we keep going until they're all destroyed!

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.407
PAIGE: They won't get away with this, not again!

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.808
RAFE: I know!

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:06.445
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaah!

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.915
TRISTAR: Wow where the heck is Taylean?

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:13.753
MARUCHO: And Shun...Oh man!

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.655
SHUN: I asked you where you were going, Dan.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.089
DAN: None of your business.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.658
SHUN: You wouldn't be going after Mag Mel

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.192
and Razenoid, would you?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.794
DAN: If you already know the answer

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:29.268
then why bother asking the question!

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:32.471
SHUN: Have you thought about what happens when you find him?

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.040
DAN: Ya, we fight him.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.275
SHUN: Do you honestly think it will be that simple?

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.711

MARUCHO: I took Cannonfury, Rafe's Mobile Assault Vehicle

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:24.630
and increased the firepower of its cannons,

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.698

MARUCHO, SHUN and DAN: [surprised grunt]

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.102

MARUCHO: Stop, you guys are not going to get far.

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:44.810
We need to come up with a plan...

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.001
DAN: Rafe and Paige went off in search of Mag Mel

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.769
which wound up getting the rest of us Brawlers

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:13.505
in hot water too. I guess they didn't realize that it's Drago

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:16.108
and I that have to take down Mag Mel and Razenoid.

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.176
It's because they're after some kind of Gate and Key

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.512
they think we have. Whatever, dude!

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.514
Those clowns are through destroying Gundalia

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:24.950
because we're about to take them down for good!

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:27.152
You can believe it! If I were you I'd tune in to watch

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.688
the action first hand. It's gonna be epic!

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.456
Maybe after we're done rescuing Gundalia,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.492
we'll win back the trust of the other Brawlers and they'll

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:37.162
realize who the real Team Captain should be.
