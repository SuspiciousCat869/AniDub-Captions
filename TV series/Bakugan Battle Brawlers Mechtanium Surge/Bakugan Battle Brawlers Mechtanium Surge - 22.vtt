DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.978
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.682
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.650
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.120
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.389
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.091
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.530
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.365
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.535
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:57.457
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.126
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

SELLON: I want to see the beauty of all your light.

SELLON: Master Mag Mel, pleeeeeeeeaaaaase!

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.482
ANUBIAS: It looks like Sellon's disappeared.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:26.119
ANUBIAS: Which means she won't be getting in my way.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:31.925

DRAGO: You're right. No matter how many we take down,

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.218
twice as many show up to replace them.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.486
SHUN: That's not all.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.888
SHUN: Now that Mag Mel has the gate and the key...

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.391
we have to worry about what his next move will be.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.725
TAYLEAN: Which is pretty hard to do...

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.061
if we're constantly fighting off Chaos Bakugan.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.463
I'm sure he's counting on the distraction.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.766

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.936

DAN: What's happening? Why do you have Noah's Bakumeter?

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.431
ANUBIAS: Take it easy. I just borrowed it for a while.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.868
Besides he doesn't need it right now.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.351
ANUBIAS: The humiliation you've caused me Kuso has scarred me.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.621
The only way I'll clear the slate is to take you down.

It has to be a trap, but I just can't leave Noah behind!

ANUBIAS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.868
DAN: [grunt]

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.603
SHUN: Dan!

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.738
DAN: Anubias! Come on!

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:08.340
You gotta fight it!

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:13.245
ANUBIAS: I can't his powers are too strong for me!

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:14.746
ANUBIAS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.483
DAN: Anubias!

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:28.694
RAZENOID: Finally! The Ultimate Power is ooooouuuurrrs!

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:33.865
MAG MEL: [evil laughter]

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.177
NOAH: Is he really gone?

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.252
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:54.786
DRAGO: Dan...

00:20:55.887 --> 00:20:59.491
DAN: We can't let him get away with this.

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:03.362
DAN: Mag Meeeeeeelllll!

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.334
DAN: It seems like forever that we've been stuck

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:10.869
in Bakugan Interspace.

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.537
No matter where we look we just can't seem to find

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.973
a viable access point we can escape through.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.175
Now that Mag Mel has the ultimate power it's only

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.977
a matter of time before he unleashes his evil

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.546
upon the universe. And we can't let that happen!

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.116
Maybe if I tap in to the psychic link I share with Mag Mel,

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.585
I can stop him that way! I know it sounds crazy,

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.854
but we're out of options so I've gotta try!

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:31.290
You've gotta tune in to see if my gamble pays off.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:33.458
One thing's for sure, the battle action you'll catch

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.194
will be so intense it'll blow your mind!

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:47.239
