WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.775
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.110
after the Bakugan came to live with us,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.611
but then out of nowhere,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.681
we were invaded by these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.649
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.017
Coredegon,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.086
Slycerak, Exostriker,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.354
and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.857
and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.425
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.826
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.628
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.897
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.265
so we fought back.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.134
Because no one is gonna take our freedom!

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.969
Not now, not ever!

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.872
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.075
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.511
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.879
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.113
\u266a Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.848
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.917
\u266a Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.918
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.753
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:58.024
\u266a On the inside

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.994
\u266a You've gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.030
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.516
Who is that?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.185
I am Chromopod,

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:28.621
a Mechtogan born of my masters, Gunz and Reptak.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.624
We've created...

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.593
Our own Mechtogan.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.295
Hmm, now we're all here!

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.302
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"End of the Line.\"

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.643
A new... Mechtogan!

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.312
That's handy.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.981
GUNZ: This is incredible, Reptak.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.117
I had no idea we could create something like this!

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.287
The bond between you two is a powerful one

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.288
and should be envied.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.690
That's right.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.425
You hear that, Reptak, buddy?

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.426
You and I...

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.928
Are truly...

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.565
BOTH: Partners.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.834
(Laughing evilly)

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:18.304
All of this emotional nonsense makes me sick!

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.673
Especially when it involves a Mechtogan,

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.309
who should know better than to be so weak!

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.446
How dare you show more loyalty to humans and Bakugan

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.114
rather than your own brothers?

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.215
No matter.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.551
Now that we are the ultimate Mechtogan...

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.420
You're no longer the same as us.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.455
(Growling)

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.091
Oh, no! He's powering up again!

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.392
We're not prepared for another attack.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.393
Watch out!

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.461
RADIZEN: Dan and Drago?

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.097
(Roaring)

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.466
Brace yourself, pal. This will be intense.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.567
Got it.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.602
(Roaring)

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:53.873
Whoa!

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.808
He's generating way more power than last time!

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.477
What's up with that?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.512
(Roaring)

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.585
Huh? What's happening?

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:08.788
I can feel it rising inside of me.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.825
I can feel it too.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.427
I don't understand, it seems to be coming

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.462
from deep within Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.338
Oh, man! This is no good!

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.540
We're too far away to see anything!

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:30.276
Mira, you have to get us closer, okay?

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.578
Are you crazy?

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:34.113
I'm not gonna risk getting caught in the crossfire.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.381
If we get any closer,

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:39.586
we might not be able to get away if things get crazy.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.853
(Gasping)

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.890
Dragonoid Destroyer's energy readings look really strange!

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.125
Dan, I think Dragonoid Destroyer

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.428
is finally operating at 100%!

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.097
Okay, Dragonoid Destroyer, now that Chromopod has shown up,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.766
are you Mechtogan ready to fight at full strength?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.535
Isn't that what you meant

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.037
when you said that everyone is here now?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.507
Please, tell us.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:04.277
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Everyone is here, but there is still more to come.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.979
What the heck does that mean?

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.347
JULIE: Check it out!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.449
Dragonoid Destroyer is glowing!

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.218
Whoa! Awesome!

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.087
I bet he's about to take Mechtavius Destroyer down

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.421
really super hard!

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.725
(Thinking:) Something is still off with these power readings.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.862
What is going on with Dragonoid Destroyer?

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.897
(Roaring)

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.669
I don't get it!

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:33.139
He's still collecting energy and getting more powerful!

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.508
Dragonoid Destroyer, what's going on?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.310
Are you in complete fighting form or not?

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.445
Something's not right with the Brawlers!

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.147
It looks like they could be in trouble!

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.583
Now hold tight everyone!

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.453
(Crowd gasping)

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.123
This angle is no good for my viewers, Mira!

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.124
We can't see what's going on!

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.125
We need to get closer!

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:55.261
Come on, Mira, drop down just a bit.

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:58.731
The people really, really need to see this!

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.266
They deserve to know what's happening,

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.468
because everyone's future is at stake here!

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:05.138
Our fates are all linked now, humans and Bakugan alike!

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:10.476
That's right. We are all linked together.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.246
Dan, I think the energy that you guys are feeling

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.848
is what Dragonoid Destroyer is channelling from the bonds

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:19.619
of all humans and Bakugan around the world!

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.521
Are you serious?

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:22.855
Incredible!

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.890
I summon the righteous energy

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:28.227
from all humans and Bakugan!

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.029
Send it to me!

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.065
Send it to me now!

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.569
Whoa, Sensei!

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:39.238
What was that?

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.574
Hmm?

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.411
Oh, man.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.914
Whoa!

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.252
This feels weird.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.454
I know.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.223
This is unlike any other energy I've felt before.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.958
I thought I'd seen everything before,

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.993
but this really takes the cake.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.431
Huh? What the--

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.467
Something's happening, Mama!

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:14.941
This is totally freaking me out.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:15.975
(Gasping)

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.443
BOTH: Huh?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.444
What's going on here?

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.445
What's this?

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.648
What's this?

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.450
Huh?

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.451
(Gasping) Look!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.453
Check it out, everybody!

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:30.356
Dragonoid Destroyer has just turned golden!

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.390
MIRA: Incredible!

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.326
His power level just keep rising!

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:37.864
At some point, he has to reach his maximum potential.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.099
How much longer can this keep going?

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.035
Perhaps he's going through some kind of evolution,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.937
just like I have many times in the past.

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.139
Maybe.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.241
I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:51.377
MIRA: I never realized the level of power that existed in the bonds

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.446
between everyday humans and Bakugan!

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.580
It really is spectacular!

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:56.015
Gunz!

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.417
I see it.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.152
This could be a real game changer.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:02.255
In every human and Bakugan,

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.023
there exists the potential to generate

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.092
their own Mechtogan.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.362
It's that boundless energy that I call upon to free us all.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.430
But how much of this energy can he handle?

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.066
DAN: Mira, is this power up showing any signs of slowing down?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.835
Doesn't look like it.

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:20.273
He just... doubled his... previous load.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.608
I wouldn't believe it myself

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.644
if I didn't see the numbers here in front of me!

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:33.519
Here's proof of the beautiful bond we all share together.

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:43.229
Mira!

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:44.497
Tell me what's going on!

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.933
It's still shooting upward!

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.135
In fact, it's moving faster than ever!

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.503
ORBEUM: I don't know, big bro.

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.205
Should we be worried here?

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.206
SKYTRUSS: Be patient.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.241
Dragonoid Destroyer hasn't let us down yet!

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:01.047
COREDEGON: This little sideshow of yours is of no consequence.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.749
You have zero chance of defeating us.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.351
SLYCERAK: You need to accept the fact that...

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.186
MANDIBOR: Our strength is unmatched.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.222
EXOSTRIKER: We are the ultimate Mechtogan!

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.223
Bow down at our feet!

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.391
That will never happen.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.062
You're a disgrace to the true Mechtogan, like us.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.232
Together, we will crush you.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.200
Oh, man.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.436
It's kicking off!

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.679
Whoa!

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.549
(Screaming)

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:39.752
Infinite...Power!

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.692
Wow, check it out!

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:49.662
He's growing!

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.697
That's the understatement of the year.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.372
This is getting exciting, everyone!

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:02.174
He's now the size of Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.845
Well, let's hope... he's more powerful!

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:09.415
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: You can flex your muscles all you want!

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.984
But it's too late for you all!

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.152
ALL: Dan!

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:15.621
Time to say goodbye!

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.323
Let's go!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.591
DRAGO: Now, Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.061
Attack!

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.229
What?

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.897
He blocked my attack?

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.568
(Roaring)

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.770
I don't believe it!

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.071
Keep going!

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.407
You're beating him!

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.977
SLYCERAK: How is it possible that they're doing this?

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.345
MANDIBOR: It makes no sense!

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.048
EXOSTRIKER: Our power should be far superior to theirs.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:46.218
VOICE: Mechtavius Destroyer, you are indeed most powerful.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:50.289
But might alone isn't always enough to reign supreme.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:55.227
This thirst for power caused you to overlook one crucial element.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.698
True power comes from uniting with others.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:02.702
That's not...Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:06.739
VOICE: No, Dragonoid Destroyer is only providing me a vessel

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.708
for which to speak to you.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:11.310
I am, in fact, your ancient ancestor,

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:15.214
the very first Bakugan, Genesis Dragonoid.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.216
What? How is that possible?

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.617
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I don't believe it!

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:22.455
VOICE: You, Mechtogan, who comprise Mechtavius Destroyer, Coredegon,

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:25.157
Slycerak, Exostriker and Mandibor,

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.493
you need to understand.

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.730
Your creation came at the hands of Fury;

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:35.034
a Bakugan that I banished to the Doom Dimension eons ago.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.703
This punishment made him angry and vengeful.

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:43.075
In the years that passed during Fury's exile,

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.478
the Bakugan and humans met for the first time.

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:55.454
It wasn't long before they learned to work together

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.623
and battle as partners.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.126
Mighty bonds were forged between the two,

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.828
and as they strengthened, evolutions

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.564
- like the ones you experienced, Drago -

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.566
illustrated the incredible levels of power

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.337
they had obtained.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.839
It is with this same power that you learned

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:16.409
to create your own Mechtogan,

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:17.810
and eventually summon them at will.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:21.013
(Roaring)

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.050
Fury learned to create and summon Mechtogan himself;

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.185
the difference was that his creations were not born

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:29.555
out of a desire to come together with others.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:33.659
His intentions were divisive and destructive!

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:37.430
And this was ultimately his downfall.

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.331
Don't be foolish, Coredegon!

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.634
(Roaring)

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.036
GENESIS DRAGONOID: You Mechtogan thought you were so clever,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.672
destroying your host and roaming free.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.875
You thought it was this autonomy that made you so mighty,

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:52.244
but you couldn't have been more wrong.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.813
By putting yourself at odds

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:58.217
with the bond Bakugan and humans share, you turned your back

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.419
on the true great power.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.922
You excluded yourself from being a part of the very thing

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.256
that unites us.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.325
You sealed your fate for the worst.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:08.761
COREDEGON: You're talking nonsense!

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.663
SLYCERAK: Nothing can take us down!

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.265
MANDIBOR: Our power is beyond measure!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.201
EXOSTRIKER: We will reign supreme!

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.836
GENESIS DRAGONOID: Don't you understand?

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.270
No amount of rage is enough

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:21.073
to stand up to the one singular energy that now links

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.375
Bakugan and humans throughout the universe, and even beyond.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.678
You are an imperfection, whose time is over!

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.383
Your words mean nothing!

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.686
We will never fall before you!

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:34.887
Not ever!

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.958
(Growling)

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.526
(Roaring)

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.495
(Screaming)

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:44.697
Radizen!

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:48.801
(Screaming)

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.837
(Roaring)

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:03.782
GENESIS DRAGONOID: Wake up, my friends. It is finally over.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.485
You have won.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.454
(Groaning)

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:12.158
Ages ago, when I banished the Nonets to the Doom Dimension,

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.593
I had no idea that their anger and hatred

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.463
would put my descendants in such peril.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:20.833
I must thank you for your bravery in fighting the scourge

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.535
of the evil Mechtogan.

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.003
You saved the universe.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.572
DRAGO: It was our honour.

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:28.941
GENESIS DRAGONOID: I was keeping a watchful eye on you this whole time,

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:32.011
and I can tell you that based on what I observed,

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.546
your success had everything to do

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.515
with the loyalty that exists between you.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.884
We're partners.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.119
It's more than that.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:41.754
You two are linked for life.

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:44.290
And while I cannot predict what is coming next for you,

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:48.627
I can say with certainty that as long as you face it together,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.962
nothing will ever stop you.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.931
Huh?

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:52.965
Hmm...

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:53.999
That's right!

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.502
Drago and I are in it for the long haul.

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:59.238
GENESIS DRAGONOID: Be well, my friends.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.062
(Birds chirping)

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.266
SHUN: Dan! Hmm?

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:30.236
Hey, guys! Hey, you won, dude!

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.570
(Chuckling)

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.872
JULIE: Hey, Dan!

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:34.873
Great job!

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.475
I don't know about you guys,

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:40.446
but... I'm really sick of this lousy island,

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:41.480
you know what I mean?

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.749
MARUCHO: Bakugan City, here we come!

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:44.750
ALL: Yeah!

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:45.884
DAN: We did it, guys!

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.786
Mechtavius Destroyer is finally history!

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.358
DAN: You're part of the team now, Chromopod.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.393
Welcome aboard.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.466
ANNOUNCER: Welcome, players, back to Bakugan Battle arena,

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:01.834
for today's headline match,

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.669
the B1 Flymax Final.

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.104
Yes!

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:07.706
At long last, we're going to see the equally anticipated rematch

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.341
between Gunz and Dan!

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:13.279
The former adversaries who are now friends and teammates!

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.615
And of course, I'm here to give you the play-by-play!

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:20.052
I wasn't sure if we'd ever get this chance again.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.287
So let's make sure we have fun with it.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.957
Promise me you won't hold anything back, okay?

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.292
No way!

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:29.662
I'm fighting the best, so I'm going to bring my best!

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.830
Let's get this party started.

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:34.300
I'm ready whenever you are, Kouzo.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.735
Okay.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.771
(Crowd cheering)

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:45.577
Let's go, guys!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.780
ANNOUNCER: Gentlemen, I'm sure you both remember the rules.

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:52.284
So, without further ado, let's Brawl!

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:55.954
Gate Card, set!

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:59.124
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.492
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:04.697
Baku-Sky Raider, jump!

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.165
Rise, Haos Reptak!

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:09.201
Go, Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid!

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:16.542
Ability, activate!

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:20.679
Dragon Astral!

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.114
Let's go!

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.116
Ability, activate!

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.518
Shining Shield!

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.725
REPTAK: I've learned a few tricks since we last fought!

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.992
Check it out!

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.295
They're both going at it with everything they've got!

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.996
Bring it!

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.199
Whoa!

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.401
(Crowd cheering)

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:45.738
JULIE: Whoa, talk about an exciting battle!

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:46.939
At the halfway point, we've got a tied score

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:49.742
with each opponent sitting at 40% power level.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.777
If you're not already sitting on the edge of your seat,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.811
then you should be!

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.147
This battle could go either way, folks!

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.916
So how about we get back to intense action, 'kay?

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.254
Gate Card, set!

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.555
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.557
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:08.427
BOTH: Baku-Sky Raiders, jump!

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.929
Ability, activate!

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:13.265
Mega Harvey Cannon!

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.300
Dragon Tornado!

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.305
(Roaring)

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.673
(Crowd cheering)

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.276
This match is so exciting, I can barely stand it!

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.982
(Roaring)

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.950
Oh, man.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.253
Pure battling is so beautiful.

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.188
Way to go, guys!

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.589
Time to finish this!

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.191
Ability, activate!

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.192
Thunder Valley!

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.660
Let's go, Reptak!

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:46.565
Good call, Gunz!

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:49.835
Your skills have definitely improved, Reptak.

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.103
Dan!

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:53.272
Don't worry! I'm here, pal!

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.108
Gate Card, open!

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.710
Pyrus Enforcement!

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.047
Wow, Jaakor, it sure is strange to watch a battle

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:05.517
where the fate of universe isn't at stake.

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.320
It's definitely a refreshing change.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:11.824
BOTH: Ability, activate!

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.859
GUNZ: Grapple Buster!

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.994
DAN: Dragon Blade!

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:30.042
Who won that attack?

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.043
(Moaning)

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:32.878
Yeah!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.147
Did we do it? Did we win?

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.983
Whoa. Head rush.

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:42.120
(Crashing)

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.722
(Grunting)

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:45.290
ANNOUNCER: And with that,

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.760
Dan and Drago remain the Battle Brawler champs!

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.364
(Crowd cheering)

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:55.968
Awesome!

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.936
I guess you're still the best.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.937
We got lucky.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.773
That was a well fought match, Gunz.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.376
You should be proud. You put us through our paces.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.412
Thanks for the kind words, Drago.

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:09.882
It was an honour to battle you guys.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.418
We'll beat ya next time, pal!

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:15.621
Yeah, maybe you will.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:16.622
(Crowd cheering)

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.623
CROWD: Dan! Huh?

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:22.561
CROWD: Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan,

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:27.466
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan!

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.303
DAN: Remember this moment, Drago.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:32.638
I can't believe they're late!

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.208
Where the heck could Dan and Drago be, huh, Mira?

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.977
How rude to be late to your own party.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.746
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.015
Yeah, they probably just got held up signing autographs.

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.182
(Laughing)

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:46.652
REPTAK: Maybe we should give them a few more minutes!

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.888
I say we just get things started without those two slowpokes.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.591
I'm so hungry I could eat my own hair.

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:57.029
Yeah, I really don't want to see that, so I say let's start!

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.497
JULIE: Me too! Let's do it!

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.032
MARUCHO: Okay, but just the snacks

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:02.200
'cause we should save the cake until they get here!

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.403
Hmm?

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:08.473
Hey, thanks a lot for letting us borrow your sailboat, Kato.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:11.143
Oh, it's my pleasure, Master Dan!

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:13.445
But are you sure leaving now is for the best?

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.147
Yup.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.216
After all we've been through, it's time to unwind.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.086
Make a clean break from everything, you know?

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.422
As battlers, we have nothing left to prove.

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.225
So it's time we step aside and let others have a chance

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.560
to reach the heights we've already attained.

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:31.363
We need to focus our energies elsewhere, right, Dan?

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.699
It's time for another evolution.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:38.070
Hey, listen, buddy,

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.339
I'd just be really happy to be able to sleep in

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.940
for a couple of days.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:44.376
DRAGO: You know what I mean.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:46.545
Have a safe trip.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.815
And make sure you take care of one another, okay, boys?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:54.253
Sure thing. You bet, Kato.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:58.724
Take care and tell the others we'll be back in no time, okay?

00:20:58.757 --> 00:20:59.725
I promise!

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.760
I will, indeed.

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:10.068
Dan, where exactly are we going?

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.805
Wherever the wind takes us.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.408
Because, wherever that is,

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.111
I'm sure adventure will be waiting for us.

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:21.146
Agreed.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:47.973
