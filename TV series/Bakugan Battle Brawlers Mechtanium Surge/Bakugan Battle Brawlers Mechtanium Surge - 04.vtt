DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.243
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.912
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.981
Interspace the number of people accessing it from

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.317
around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.185
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.422
with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.792
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.127
DAN: The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.763
against some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.832
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.101
DAN: ...But we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.837

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.041
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.042
\u266a Back against the wall

\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.312
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.680
\u266a this is the final stand

\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.850
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.319
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.487
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.492
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.495
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.397
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.967
MARUCHO: Hi there, Ms. Kuso.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.003
We were wondering if Dan was home.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.139
MIYOKO: Mmmm. Sorry boys, he and Drago went out.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.441
TRISTAR: I bet they headed over to

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.376
Bakugan Interspace to practice.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.511

SHUN: Mmm hmm.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.281
MIYOKO: Listen... I was wondering...

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.783
MIYOKO: Has Dan said anything about having nightmares?

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.685
Last night he woke up screaming again.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.853
MARUCHO: Uh...

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.055
SHUN: It's nothing to worry about he's just

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.558
stressed about his next battle.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.926
MARUCHO: Mmm hmm.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.094
MIYOKO: Well then um, could you do me a favour

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.264
and tell him to relax a little bit?

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.700
MARUCHO: Sure thing!

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.906
MIYOKO: Goodness. My Dan sure is lucky that he has good

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.708
friends like those two boys.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.849

TRISTAR: Well, Battle Arena J is down that way.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.082

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.251

DAN: The only way you're going to learn to control

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.160
your energy is if we give 100% effort 100% of the time.

If they're practicing in secret that must mean...

It wasn't on the schedule yesterday.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.158
Thanks for jumping in!

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.459
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:08.627
DAN: You okay, Drago?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.129
DRAGO: Yes. Taylean siphoned off my energy and helped

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.363
me pull it back.

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.398
Thank you.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.966
TAYLEAN: No problem.

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:17.603
SELLON: Perhaps Taylean is even more impressive than Drago.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:21.206
CHRIS: Maaaaan! I lost again.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.008
SOON: I knew that Chris wasn't strong enough to

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.576
properly assist, Ms. Sellon.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.078
That should have been me down there.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:29.348
SHUN: Come on Dan you need to pace yourself to keep control.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.682
DAN: Whah?

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.119
SHUN: Remember. We're a team. We can do this together, okay?

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.988
DAN: Okay I hear you.

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.690
SHUN: Let's hit them with a simultaneous attack.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.160
DAN: Sweet! Hear that, Drago?

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:44.263
DAN: Ability activate!

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.665
DRAGO: Dragon Hard Striker!

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.700
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.070
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.305
SHUN: Shooting Wind Dust Slash!

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.109
SELLON: Gate Card, open!

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.812
SELLON: Evil Clear!

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.582
TAYLEAN: What?

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:05.350
She nullified the abilities.

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.286
SELLON: Ability activate!

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:11.390
SELLON: Ancient Gravity!

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.128
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:20.632
SHUN: Truth Core, Battle Bastion!

[\u266a]

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.570
1st BOY SPECTATOR: Oh yeah!

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.104
Sellon did it again!

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.673
2nd BOY SPECTATOR: Dan's finished!

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.108
Sellon's number one!

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.276
DAN: I've had it! Let's finish this!

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.911
DAN: You know what I'm saying, Drago?

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.281
DRAGO: Absolutely. No more holding back. Let's go!

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.516
SHUN: [gasp] No Dan, wait!

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.985
DAN: Ability activate!

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.554
DAN: Dragon Force Striker!

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:43.889
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:48.627
DRAGO: I am going to control this energy so help me.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.028
DAN: Yeah, buddy, do it!

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:54.399
DRAGO: Huuuuuuaaaaaaaahhhhh!

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:58.871
DAN: No way! He actually did it!

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:02.608
DAN: [gasp] But that's not gonna be enough to take down Spyron.

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.676
SELLON: Hum.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.614
SHUN: Huh? DAN: Whoa!

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.250
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:14.453
the Brawlers take the win!

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:17.356
SELLON: [chuckle]

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:21.527
CHRIS: I'm real sorry I let you down Ms. Sellon.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.730
SELLON: I would like to thank my fans, for all of

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:28.033
their kind support during the battle.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.169
1st BOY SPECTATOR: We love you Sellon!

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:34.006
2nd BOY SPECTATOR: Yeah! Better than Dan the dud!

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:37.809
SOON: Perhaps Ms. Sellon did score the victory.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.077
DYLAN: Well, well, well.

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:43.081
It sounds like the tide is turning against the Brawlers.

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:49.755
DRAGO: [groan] [panting]

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:53.158
DAN: Drago.

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.494
DRAGO: [panting]

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.233
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle]

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:07.206
At last the energy I need has started to flow.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:14.846
MAG MEL: Awake my dark servants. Awake!

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.417
MAG MEL: [maniacal laughter]

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:29.227
[\u266a]

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.763
SHUN: I'll just get right to the point.

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:34.600
Why did you throw the match?

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.235
SELLON: It's obvious that Dan is struggling with

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.205
some kind of internal issues.

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:44.409
SELLON: It shows in his performance.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:47.879
SELLON: So I took the opportunity to win the

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.582
audience over instead.

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:55.821
SELLON: I could use a graceful battler like you.

00:20:55.854 --> 00:21:00.792
Think it over, Shun.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:04.129
[\u266a]

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.264
SHUN: Never.

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.034
MARUCHO: Ever since we discovered that Dan and

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.369
Drago were keeping secrets about their link to

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.704
Zenthon, Shun has been convinced that Dan needs

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.539
to take a break from brawling.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:16.241
I think he has a point but how on Earth do we bring

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.509
this up to Dan?

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.711
MARUCHO: As if that wasn't bad enough, suddenly all

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:22.147
these new Battlers showed up with these incredibly

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.448
powerful Bakugan!

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.117
That's where things got really crazy!

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.686
And it was up to Shun and I to sort it all out.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.354
MARUCHO: You've got to tune in to see the power

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.123
we were fighting against!

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.958
MARUCHO: Hey, is that Anubias?

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.559
Oh man, what is he doing here?

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.662
Unbelievable!

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:37.696
