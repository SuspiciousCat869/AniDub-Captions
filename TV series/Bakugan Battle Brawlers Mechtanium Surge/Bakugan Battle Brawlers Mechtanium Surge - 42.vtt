WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.475
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.943
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:12.412
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded by these

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.414
mysterious evil Mechtogan,

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.182
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.752
Cordegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.820
Exostriker, and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.556
and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.392
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.659
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.595
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.331
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.833
So we fought back, because no one is gonna take our freedom.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.502
Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.638
\u266a What are you gonna do

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.044
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.945
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, this is the final stand \u266a

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.617
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.318
\u266a The power's in your hands

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.021
\u266a 2.0 worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.527
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.564
\u266a This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.138
Another Wiseman.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.339
Gunz.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.812
(Laughing) Playing dress-up now, are we?

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.648
We're taking the Brawlers down, then you.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.117
I doubt that very much.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.152
(Shouting)

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.790
(All shouting)

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.826
(All screaming)

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.366
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.339
SPATTERIX: What?

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.508
STRONK: They just disappeared.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.943
What did you just do?

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.446
I got rid of them just like I said I was going to.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.683
I can't believe you don't relish the irony of those who banished

00:01:56.716 --> 00:02:00.286
you to the Doom Dimension eons ago being trapped there now

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.655
themselves to rot for eternity.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.257
MUTABRID: You robbed us--

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.892
SPATTERIX: Of our vengeance.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.894
You promised us the brawls.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.262
And their Bakugan partners.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.298
You're lying, cheating scum.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:16.102
We won't let you get away with any of this.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.471
(All screaming)

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.648
(All grunting)

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:31.951
(Grunting)

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.320
(Both grunting)

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.588
You guys okay?

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.158
We're good. Yeah, we're okay, too.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.292
(Speaking gibberish)

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.760
I know you're supposed to tuck and roll,

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:44.531
but I was trying to cushion Marucho's fall, okay?

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:48.234
I can see why they call this place the doom dimension.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.472
SHUN: No kidding, sensei. I've never seen a place as grim as this.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.808
(Speaking gibberish)

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.076
Yeah, I hear you, pal.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.045
Does anyone else feel funny inside?

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.581
Kind of like everything is twisting and shrinking?

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.250
SHUN: It's an amplified sense of despair you're feeling

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.920
from being so deep inside the Doom Dimension.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.622
I wish there was something we could do to shake it.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.394
We're taking the brawlers down, then you.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.062
Sorry, you guys. We wouldn't be here if

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.464
Gunz hadn't challenged Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.899
What are you talking about, Reptak?

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.835
Are you saying that the red suited Wiseman we saw

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.404
was really Gunz in disguise?

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.439
I'm sure of it this time.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.375
I must have driven him to it by turning my back on him.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.844
Huh, you think so?

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.648
We need to keep our focus here on how we're going to get out.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.717
Huh, Drago.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.287
You teleported yourself out of here once before, right?

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.425
That's true. Let me try it again.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.460
(Grunting)

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.200
(Grunting)

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:05.945
(Grunting)

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.781
Blast.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:09.849
What happened?

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.150
Sorry, guys.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.687
If Drago's powers aren't enough to get us out of here,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.123
then we're in really serious trouble, guys.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.926
There must be another way, right, Dan?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.562
For sure, we just have to find out what that is.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.535
TREMBLAR: Traitor! You're going to pay for

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.971
all the lies you to to trick us into helping you.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.873
Huh, is that right?

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.142
We're not afraid of you.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:39.078
Don't think we won't tear you apart.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.415
I am taken aback by your hostility.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.350
And to think, I was about to offer you

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.052
the gift of eternal life.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.022
You mean in the Doom Dimension with the Brawlers?

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.292
(Chuckling) Of course not.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.960
That would be a punishment.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.662
What do you take me for?

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:59.032
No, my silly little Nonets. The eternal life I offer you

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.867
is isn't in the Doom Dimension,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.904
but rather, as part of me.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.639
What?

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.509
Come and give your worthless lives so you can be

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.211
part of the greater glory of being me.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.246
Scatter!

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.883
(Shouting)

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.585
The sacrifice I ask for is miniscule compared

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.254
to the gift I offer in return.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.388
(Grunting)

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.092
(Grunting)

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.630
Your lives are mine whether you give them voluntarily

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.399
or force me to take them.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.268
(Screaming)

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.371
(Shouting)

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.207
Huh?

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.743
(Shouting)

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:46.279
(Grunting)

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.918
I see you! (Shouting)

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.923
(Grunting)

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.258
(Grunting)

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:03.896
(Grunting)

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.502
You can't escape me.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:14.207
(Laughing)

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.817
It's okay. Looks like the coast is clear.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:30.456
BETADRON: I'm not gonna go down like this, not here.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.959
KODOKOR: Relax Betadron. We're going to make those

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:35.194
scumbag Mechtogans sorry they ever met us.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.263
STRONK: You said it, pal.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.866
We can do this if we work together.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.300
MUTABRID: Exactly.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.136
SPATTERIX: Let's not forget it was the Mechtogan who served

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.171
the Bakugan, not the other way around.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:48.674
Well then, since we all agree now.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.777
Let's take this fight to Mechtavius Destroyer

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.078
and finish him off.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:54.147
SPATTERIX: That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.650
STRONK: You and I should combine so we can give him a double thumping.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.420
Hold on, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:04.357
I fight way better without your weighing me down, okay?

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.525
Are you serious?

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.059
Enough you two.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.862
Save your energy for the battle with Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.397
You're going to need it.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.499
Exactly.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.700
SPATTERIX : Fine.

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:17.703
STRONK: Yeah, okay. It's time to fight.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.706
Yes. Victory will be ours.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.091
(Laughing)

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.594
I see you have finally come to your senses.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:44.664
If you think we'll lie down without putting up a fight,

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:47.233
you're even crazier than we thought you were,

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.935
Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.405
Well, if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.373
(Grunting)

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:57.443
Let me have the first crack. Time to throw down.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.712
Bakugan brawl!

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.848
Bakugan stand.

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.749
Rise Pyrus Spatterix!

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:04.784
(Grunting)

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.421
Now, Spatterix.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.456
What exactly do you want me to do here?

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.192
He's hitting us with more power than I was expecting.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.895
We need to pick the perfect move.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:19.265
Shoot me next. I'm telling you, I can help out here.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.567
No one asked you for your help.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.270
We're doing just fine here. Now beat it.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:27.173
Stronk's right. You two need to combine.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:30.276
Fine, whatever. Let's get on with it, Stronk.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.310
Ready!

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:35.047
Bakugan brawl!

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.817
Bakugan stand!

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.619
Rise Subterra Stronk.

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.720
Ready, buddy?

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.088
Let's do it.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:43.789
Bakugan fuse.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.194
(Grunting)

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:50.129
Fusion ability activate!

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.064
Mag Extreme.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.699
(Grunting)

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.870
Whether separate or combined,

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.606
your attacks are useless against me.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.842
Oh, yeah? Well, we're just getting started.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.444
Fusion ability activate. Hah!

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.348
Mega Spindle.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.483
(Shouting)

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.919
(Grunting)

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.923
Oh, what's wrong? Did that one sting a little bit, big guy?

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.359
Finish him. Fusion ability activate.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.361
Power Ditch.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.196
(Shouting)

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.765
(Groaning)

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.768
I think we'll be the ones to get your powers now.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.737
(Shouting)

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:32.738
SPATTERIX: That's right.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.240
STRONK: Keep going.

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.241
Do it.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.343
SPATTERIX: With pleasure.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.378
(Shouting)

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.846
SPATTERIX: Oh, yeah.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.815
STRONK: I told you we were good together.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:45.418
You make me laugh.

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:50.122
(Grunting)

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.357
What?

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.491
BETADRON: Get us in there.

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.660
MUTABRID: Yes, we'll combine, too.

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:55.695
Fine, then.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.665
Bakugan brawl!

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.335
Baku Sky Raiders, jump!

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:03.569
Rise, Darkus Kodokor.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.304
(Roaring)

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:07.506
Rise, Darkus Mutabrid.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.108
Rise, Darkus Betadron.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.577
Bakugan, unite!

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.245
(All grunting)

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.115
More insects to crush.

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:18.017
(All shouting)

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.087
(All grunting)

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.823
(Groaning) That didn't go well.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:27.059
Oh, really. Do you think? Let's go again.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.528
(Whimpering)

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.565
(Shouting)

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.733
(Grunting)

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.069
Sorry, but your days of combining are over.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.304
Mutabrid.

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:39.338
(Grunting)

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:43.776
We need to try combining again.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.345
Betadron, Kodokor.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.615
Are you sure? You're hurt really badly.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:52.385
I'm fine. Now, quite arguing and just do it!

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.754
Okay, then. I'm ready.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:58.891
(Groaning)

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:02.161
(Panting)

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.196
(Laughing)

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.100
(Shouting)

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.436
(Screaming)

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.004
Mutabrid!

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:16.042
(Screaming)

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.178
Oh, no, no, no.

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:21.580
There's no retreating into ball form for you.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:24.617
(Screaming)

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.921
Leave him alone!

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.556
I'm sorry, brothers,

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:35.227
but you'll have to add me to the list of those to avenge.

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.596
Destroy him!

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.399
Mutabrid!

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.310
I'm gonna make you pay.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.317
(Laughing) That was tasty.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.718
Mutabrid, no!

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.687
My brother.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.023
SPATTERIX: Don't just stand there moaning.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.158
Let's make him hurt for what he did.

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.660
He's right.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:10.129
Here comes the pain.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.998
(Laughing)

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:16.102
Keep on laughing, gigantor, because pretty soon

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.404
you're going to be choking on your tears.

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:19.738
Yeah!

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.006
That's right.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.508
Alright, you ready, Tremblar?

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.876
100%.

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.681
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.449
Bakugan stand.

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.818
Rise Haos Tremblar!

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.753
(Laughing)

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:37.556
Bring it on. All of you!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.191
You heard him.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:43.229
Let's show him Mutabrid's demise wasn't in vain.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.766
WISEMAN 2.0: Don't give up. Vengeance will be ours.

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:53.472
Mechtogan will pay for what they did to us.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:00.012
(Grunting)

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.814
Say goodbye!

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:02.882
(Grunting)

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.819
(Grunting)

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.655
Fusion ability activate! Mag Max!

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:12.024
(Grunting)

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.292
(Shouting)

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:17.997
Fusion ability activate. Mega Spindle!

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.033
(Shouting)

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:24.837
Pathetic.

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:28.240
A little help here.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:31.844
Ability activate. Goliath Floogle!

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.879
(Grunting)

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.086
What's this?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.223
Ability activate. Mist Burn!

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.958
Mega Spindle!

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.195
(Shouting)

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:51.230
(Groaning)

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.202
BETADRON: We destroyed his shield!

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:58.904
(Laughing) Are you sure about that?

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.808
What?

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.177
Hit him again. Harder this time.

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.012
Got it.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.514
Let's do this.

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.951
Ability activate. Battle Smasher.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:13.686
Heavy on the smasher.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:18.224
Ability activate. Dark Anthem.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.859
(All grunting)

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.163
(Grunting)

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.699
Now, you're really starting to get on my nerves.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.601
Come on, get in there, Tremblar.

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:29.969
Ready.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:31.704
Ability active. Boost Floogle.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:38.677
Right.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.184
You annoying little gnat.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:49.555
I think I'll take your energy next for my collection.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:52.524
Then come and get it, if you think you can.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:56.929
Ability activate. Grudge Cannon!

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.265
(Shouting)

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:00.432
(Grunting)

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:01.901
Go down, you!

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:06.038
Never! (Shouting)

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.239
(Grunting)

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:10.376
(Screaming)

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.744
Tremblar!

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.951
BETADRON: He just absorbed all of Tremblar's energy.

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:21.387
SPATTERIX: I don't believe it.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.422
(Roaring)

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.329
(All screaming)

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:31.363
(Grunting)

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:35.301
(Both grunting)

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.669
STRONK: This looks bad.

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.937
SPATTERIX: Don't you dare give up the fight.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.307
If you punks are done, you might as well go to

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.574
the Doom Dimension.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.742
BETADRON: What?

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.611
If your heart isn't in it here,

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.346
you might as well go fight Drago.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.915
Only a coward turns and runs.

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.950
We'll get our chance to fight Drago.

00:15:56.655 --> 00:16:00.125
But it'll have to wait until after we take down this creep.

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:03.095
Kodokor's right. We're not going anywhere.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.998
Good, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:08.067
Now let's get back to the task at hand.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.770
So, who wants to be next?

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.273
Decisions, decisions.

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:15.307
(Grunting)

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.610
(Grunting)

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.846
I don't believe it, not even a dent.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.314
This is hopeless.

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:25.351
I can't believe you still have doubts, Betadron.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:28.687
You, in the Wiseman suit, take him to the Doom Dimension.

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:31.323
He can help you get your vengeance against the Brawlers.

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.825
WISEMAN 2.0: What? I'm not leaving.

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:34.526
Quit trying to be a hero.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.829
We're a little outgunned here.

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:39.665
If you don't leave now you may never have another chance.

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:40.666
(Grunting)

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.568
You heard him. Get out of here.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:43.602
(Grunting)

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:44.837
(Laughing)

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.005
Go on, I'm serious.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.341
Otherwise all of this will have been for nothing.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.146
(Grunting)

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.714
I don't know what to say.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.916
There's nothing left to say, Betadron.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.951
(Groaning)

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:01.954
Let's go.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.792
Good luck, my brothers.

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.260
You ready?

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.261
Of course.

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:11.230
(Groaning)

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.699
Mag Max, hah!

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:15.567
Tomb Sonic, hah!

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.138
Such a sad little effort.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.739
(Grunting)

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.541
(Both grunting)

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:23.909
Fixed Defense.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.478
What are you doing?

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.113
I'm running interference.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.114
What?

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.183
(Shouting)

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:35.754
He's too powerful for you to take on alone.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.923
Why are you just standing there?

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.826
Kodokor, this is insane.

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.828
There's no time to argue.

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:45.230
When we takes me down there will be a huge blast,

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.032
just like with the others.

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:49.701
Make sure you're ready for it, understand?

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.538
Use it to your advantage to get the jump on him.

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.540
I understand.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.241
Here it comes!

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.111
Kodokor.

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.081
(Screaming)

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:04.650
I'm gonna take you with me, scum.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:07.619
In your dreams. (Grunting)

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.588
(Screaming)

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.257
(Shouting)

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.294
(Screaming)

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.467
(Grunting)

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.936
That was tougher than it should have been.

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.137
(Grunting)

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.738
I'm gonna make you suffer for everything you

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.341
put my brothers through. (Shouting)

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:30.342
(Grunting)

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.510
You're going down.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.544
(Grunting)

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:36.181
(Laughing)

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.382
Is that it?

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.853
You seriously overestimate your abilities.

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:44.122
Perhaps it's time I remind you of who is superior.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.991
(Screaming)

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:47.459
(Grunting)

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:50.462
(Shouting)

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.903
(Both grunting)

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:01.773
(Laughing)

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:05.444
Come on, Stronk. We have to get back up and combine again.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.713
Quickly, before he attacks again.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:11.250
Are you sure? I thought you didn't like battling

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.685
when you were combined with me.

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.954
(Both groaning)

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.856
Yeah, well, what can I say?

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.726
You're the best partner I ever had.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.761
(Grunting)

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:26.265
BOTH: Huh?

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:39.578
(Grunting)

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:43.615
(Laughing)

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:57.129
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.497
Absolutely.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.132
Okay, then.

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.333
Here we go.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.113
Okay, listen up.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.449
We have to put our heads together.

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:18.483
Right.

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.319
There must be another way out of here.

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.321
MARUCHO: We have to stay positive.

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.423
Yeah, 'cause the bad vibes in this place

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.291
are really bumming me out.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.361
WISEMAN 2.0: I'm afraid I can't let you leave.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.430
What?

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:33.832
BETADRON: Not without facing us in battle.

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.467
The only way out is through us.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.402
DAN: You mean you came here and risked getting trapped

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:38.670
just to fight us?

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:43.141
Well, Brawlers, some things are worth the risk.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.343
Unreal.

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.677
You're totally insane.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:49.581
Is your need for revenge really that strong?

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:53.085
Well, Shun, you'll find out the answer to that soon enough.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:21:00.492
\u266a

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.095
Gunz.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.368
DAN: We thought things had taken a turn for the worse

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.435
when we got banished to the Doom Dimension,

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:11.870
but we were wrong.

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:13.739
Like a couple of maniacs, Betadron and Wiseman 2.0

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.107
came after us.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.042
Betadron was still obsessed with taking down Drago

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:19.011
for what his ancestors did to the Nonets eons ago

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.679
and Wiseman 2.0, who's really Gutz,

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.314
wants to get even with me because he thinks

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.883
I turned his partner Reptak against him.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.252
The problem is, I can't battle Wiseman 2.0 with my full might

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.154
because I promised Reptak we'd get him back to

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:30.555
his normal self as Gunz.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.557
Tune in and you'll see exactly what it's like to be

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.159
between a rock and a hard place.

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.862
I'm really hoping Drago and I can keep it together.

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:46.872
