WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.510
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.112
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.615
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.617
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.186
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.389
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.258
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.597
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.832
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.435
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.011
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:57.323
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.333
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.735
[explosion]

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.237
ANNOUNCER: What an incredible first victory, battle fans.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.039
Rafe and Paige are certainly proving their worth...

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.141
as the newest member of the Battle Brawlers!

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.143
SHUN: Hah. Nice brawling.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.446
PAIGE: Yeah, we know how to rock.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.847
MARUCHO: You showed some impressive skills

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.315
out there Rafe.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.017
RAFE: What can I say? I learned a thing or two

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.187
in my time back home with the Castle Knights.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.422
ANNOUNCER: With this latest victory, there's no question,

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.559
the Brawlers have moved on since the departure of Dan Kuso.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.360
ANNOUNCER: And it looks like it's for the better!

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.162
ANNOUNCER: The official standings now have the Brawlers

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.198
tied with Team Anubias. But as we all know

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.933
there can only be one.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.101
SOON: We should be on that leader board with them, Chris.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.571
CHRIS: We will be as soon as Ms. Sellon gets back.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.005
SOON: [gasp]

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.007
ANNOUNCER: It's been a long tim e since we've seen a match up

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.976
this epic folks, so you can be sure that we're gonna

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.978
bear witness to some fearsome brawling!

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.047
PAIGE: Hmmmph. Yeah, big deal.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.648
RAFE: Relax, Paige. They're just trying

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.350
to get the fans riled up.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.252
MARUCHO: You two are definitely skilled brawlers

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.454
but it's important that you don't get cocky

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.090
and go into this next battle with blinders on.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.459
MARUCHO: Team Anubias is using new technology.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.961
They're known as BakuNano.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.263
They pack a serious punch and can really do damage

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.900
to anyone who gets in their way.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.336
We're going to have to increase our power levels for the next

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.871
battle, but we'll have to be careful not to

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.906
let things get out of control.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.275
ANNOUNCER: The tension in Battle Arena A is so thick

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.043
you can cut it with a knife, fans.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.979
Stick around to see who survives

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.349
and who goes down for the count!

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.618
MAG MEL: It seems the stage has been set.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.721
RAZENOID: Well, what are they waiting for?

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.156
Why don't they fight?

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.730
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Triple Threat

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.909
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar] DAN: [rising mighty roar]

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:59.846
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.314
DAN: Nice one, Drago!

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.816
DRAGO: Thanks. It felt good. It may sound crazy

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.085
but I really think we were in synch on that one.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.888
DAN: Naw dude. You're right. I could feel the energy rise

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.658
inside of you right in the centre of my own chest.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.993
DRAGO: Finally, our training seems to be working.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.828
Maybe we should try a round with Zenthon

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.064
to see how well we can control him.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.600
DAN: Seriously? Are you feeling up to it?

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.802
DAN: I'm game if you are, pal.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:30.076
DRAGO: Let's do it.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.880
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:38.218
DAN: [grunt, pain reax]

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.822
DAN: [gasp]

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.991
[mighty roar]

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:48.494
DAN: What's going on?

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:56.102
[laser blast]

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.439
DAN: Whoa. That's Bayview!

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:04.811
[mighty roar]

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.446
[explosion]

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.450
DAN: Noooooooooo!

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.818
DAN: [groan]

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.720
DRAGO: Dan! Are you okay?

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.389
DAN: [panting]

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.725
DRAGO: What just happened?

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.060
DAN: Another vision.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.630
DRAGO: Tell me what you saw.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.398
DAN: Bayview was...

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.066
...was being attacked.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.735
DRAGO: What!

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.103
DAN: Razenoid was blowing things up.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.638
There was total chaos everywhere.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.840
It seemed so real. I can still feel it.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.508
The heat...

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.645
SELLON: That's because it was real. What you experienced

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.414
was a premonition of things to come.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.150
SELLON: A glorious black vision of what Master Mag Mel

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:47.987
has in store for you once he has attained the Ultimate Power.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:49.422
DAN: Mag Mel!

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.424
ANNOUNCER: The time has come people.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.793
New crew on the block, Team Anubias will be

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.828
facing off against the Battle Brawlers!

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.765
ANNOUNCER: Can you dig it?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.502
DYLAN: Let's see who'll be the next kings of the ring.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.936
ANUBIAS: What a rip off!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.073
I should be the one hunting down Dan and Drago not Sellon!

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:11.277
That battle was owed to me!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.313
[frustrated grunt]

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.481
ANUBIAS: I don't know what Master Mag Mel was thinking.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.117
She's no match for the likes of Dan Kuso.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:24.223
Perhaps I'll have to finish him off, once I'm done here.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.459
SELLON: Well gentleman, as pleasant as this has been,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.662
I do have business to attend to. So if you'll indulge

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.532
a lady may we please proceed ahead to battling?

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.200
DAN: Tell us who you are!

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.903
SELLON: I suppose I could do that but then...

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:41.374
I'd spoil the surprise!

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.510
DRAGO: Well, that doesn't look very friendly.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.347
SELLON: The time for talking is over, Dan.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.916
SELLON: You may have beaten the one who came before me,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.919
but he wasn't half the battler that I am.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.588
DAN: Huh?

00:05:55.621 --> 00:06:01.127
DAN: That dude was working for Mag Mel too?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.466
DAN: [gasp]

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.334
ANNOUNCER: If looks could brawl these two teams

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.636
would already be tearing each other apart!

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.072
JACK: Aw yeah, a walk in the park!

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.274
PAIGE: For a little guy, you've got a really big mouth.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.709
RAFE: Don't waste your breath, Paige.

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.344
We'll show him soon enough.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.713
SHUN: As soon as we win this, we're going to wipe

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.648
this place clean of all your chaos.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:23.916
MARUCHO: We're going to bring back

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.818
the spirit of good sportsmanship!

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:29.355
JACK: [laughter] You guys are hilarious!

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:33.226
ROBIN: The strong survive by chewing up the weak

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.461
and spitting them out! Accept it.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.163
MARUCHO: It's horrible attitudes like that,

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.198
that have poisoned this place!

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:43.269
SHUN: Chaos is a sickness that the Brawlers are about to cure!

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:45.872
ANUBIAS: You wish!

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:51.778
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field, open!

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.349
SHUN: Alright. Gate Card, set! Hah!

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.819
SHUN: Bakugan Brawl! Hah.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.454
SHUN: Bakugan stand!

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.856
SHUN: Let's go, Ventus Taylean.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.458
ANUBIAS: Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.226
ROBIN: Bakugan brawl! MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.364
ANUBIAS: Rise Darkus Horridian.

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:14.300
MARUCHO: Let's go, Aquos Tristar.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:21.007
ROBIN: Rise Pyrus Bolcanon.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.444
SELLON: May I have this dance?

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.346
DAN: We may have drifted apart before,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.817
but now we've got our groove back stronger than ever!

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.251
DAN: Let's go, Drago!

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.222
DRAGO: I'm with you.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.958

DRAGO: Oooomph!

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.719
DRAGO: That just made me mad.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.321
SELLON: I'm impressed that you're actually

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.755
getting up for more.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.225
DRAGO: It's going to take a lot more than that to keep me down.

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.627
DAN: Yeaaaah! Let's go, pal!

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.796

DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

SELLON: He took down all three of my pets!

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.282
That's incredible.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.383
DAN: Awesome!

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.986
You showed real control with that attack, buddy!

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.355
DRAGO: Like you said, we've got our groove back.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.157
SELLON: Hah! We'll see.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:52.331
Come, Chaos Bakugan Flash Ingram!

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.499
DAN: Oh man!

00:08:53.532 --> 00:09:01.741
SELLON: BakuNano Coin Blaster, destroy!

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:04.010
DRAGO: Huh? DAN: Whoa. What are those?

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.512
SELLON: Each BakuNano equips multiple Flash Ingrams...

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.981
covering all six attributes. Let's see how you fair

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:15.121
against them, shall we?

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:18.357
SELLON: This is for the glory of Master Mag Mel!

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.862
DAN: We might be calling on you soon Mechtogan Zenthon!

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:29.035
SELLON: Listen closely and you will hear the sound of...

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:32.038
...your own demise!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.373
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:40.579
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Well this is a new one.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.915
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.086
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Drago! If we're gonna take them

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:49.355
down then we gotta use Dragon Force Stryker again!

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:50.756
DRAGO: I'm ready!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.458
SELLON: Ability activate!

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:56.095

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.330
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:58.698
DAN: What's wrong, buddy?

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.801
SELLON: I just nullified your pathetic ability, that's what.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:05.938
DAN: Are you kidding?

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:09.108
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:12.211
DAN: If we can't activate abilities then we should...

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.146
DRAGO: I'm reading your mail!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.453
SELLON: [gasp]

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:24.957
DAN: Oooooohhhhhhhmmmmm...

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:30.129
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

SELLON: Hah!... [gasp]

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.733
SELLON: How is it possible that after getting hit

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.169
with six simultaneous blasts there's...

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.971
...not even a scratch?!

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.539
DAN: That was wicked!

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:17.076
DRAGO: He protected us without question.

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:19.879
ZENTHON: Isn't that why you summoned me?

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.781
DAN: He's talking again!

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.450
DRAGO: I definitely wasn't expecting that.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.318
DRAGO: Thank-you, Zenthon.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.789
ZENTHON: Hummm. There is no need...

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.425
...for my master and creator to thank me

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:37.263
for doing what is my duty and obligation.

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:38.264
[mighty roar]

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:39.498
DRAGO: Now that we're in synch...

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.167
...we can clearly communicate with him.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.903
DAN: Cool. Let's try a counter attack!

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:48.240
ZENTHON: As you wish.

DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:10.262
SELLON: No way. This isn't possible.

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:12.598
SELLON: So Dan and Drago finally have control

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.999
over their Mechtogan.

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.202
SELLON: Perhaps the Key and the Gate that Master Mag Mel

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:20.706
spoke about them possessing are closer than we thought.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:23.142
SELLON: But if they're still unaware that they have it

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:26.679
then maybe I still have a chance to steal it.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.815
SELLON: Master Mag Mel. Bestow your powers unto me!

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:39.892
SELLON: Come Mechtogan!

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:44.997
SELLON: Come Mechtogan!

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.334
[rising mighty roars]

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:51.504
DAN: Whoa! She's got three Mechtogan.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:54.673
DRAGO: It looks like she really means business.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:57.143
SELLON: Deezal...

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.246

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.681
...Miserak!

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.550
SELLON: Why don't you say hello

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:13.459
to the three most powerful Mechtogan in existence!

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:16.462
[heavy metallic impact]

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:17.530
DRAGO: Zenthon!

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.165

DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:29.408
[heavy ground impact]

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.043
DAN: Ability activate!

Thor Buster!

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:37.383
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.218
DRAGO: Are you okay, Zenthon?

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.920
SELLON: Are they insane?

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:44.323
They're actually going to take on all of them on!

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:48.160
SELLON: [groan]

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:51.497
SELLON: Controlling all three might be too much for me.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.632
SELLON: But, if it took Master Mag Mel's power

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.168
just for me to summon them, I'm going to have to

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:59.038
push myself to the limit and fight on.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:02.341
I'm better than Anubias! I can do this!

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:06.245
I will not go back empty handed.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.914
ANUBIAS: Let's go, Horridian.

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:16.755

TAYLEAN: Hmmmmph!

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:32.738
TAYLEAN: Haaaaah!

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:44.250
SELLON: I will fight for the glory of my Master!

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.252
DAN: Oh snap!

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:49.822
SELLON: I fear nothing and will go to any lengths to win this!

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:55.160
DAN: You're not the only one with guts here, lady!

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.551
It's incredible. [evil cackle]

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:25.658

DAN: I've gotta get back and warn the others.

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.513
DRAGO: Zenthon! Dan!

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:50.816
Oh you guys are gonna pay!

SELLON: I must finish these two off, first!

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:08.233
DRAGO: You're about to feel a world of hurt, my friend.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.736
DAN: No, Drago wait...

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:14.973
DAN: You can't do this alone buddy...

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:18.911
DAN: Remember our training... [grunt]

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.080
DAN: We've gotta stay in synch!

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:23.782
DRAGO: Got it! Thanks!

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.719
DRAGO: Zenthon, the only way we're going to win is to use our

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:30.155
combined strength by bringing our hearts and minds together!

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:32.791
DAN: You've gotta join us, buddy!

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.095
Together we can smoke these dudes!

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:43.335

SELLON: It can't be!

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.491

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:15.394
you were able to summon a Mechtogan Titan.

I'm not sure we would have won.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:01.199
Only Anubias is left standing against the Battle Brawlers!

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:04.136
Will he be able to dig himself out of this hole?

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:05.771
ANUBIAS: Yeah! No problem.

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.372
MARUCHO: You can't win this!

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.841
So you may as well give up now, Anubias!

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.311
SHUN: Yeah! We're going to restore order in here

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.213
by getting rid of you.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:18.016
ANUBIAS: You're hilarious. Soon enough, there'll be

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.552
nothing left for you to protect.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.087
SHUN: [gasp] MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.525
MAG MEL: Finally I can feel the swell of energy we've been

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.260
waiting for all along...

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.596
RAZENOID: The time has come!

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:34.600
MAG MEL: ...to free us of these shackles!

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.934
SHUN: [gasp] MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.570
ANNOUNCER: Attention everyone! This is an emergency!

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.039
RAFE: What?! PAIGE: Whoa!

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.941
ANNOUNCER: A faction of rogue Bakugan

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:50.782
have gone on a rampage inside Interspace.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.652
DYLAN: Well this is awfully interesting.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:58.490
I wonder how it will turn out.

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.058
ANUBIAS: I told you both already...

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.793
MARUCHO: Huh?!

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:06.732
ANUBIAS: ...it's the end.

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:08.567
MARUCHO: Just when we were trying to clean up

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.803
Bakugan Interspace for good, things dissolved into

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.306
pure and utter chaos. Bakugan were going on rampages

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.008
and destroying everything in sight.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.076
It all seemed hopeless but then help came from

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.779
the most unexpected source. We couldn't believe it!

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.881
It was someone I never expected to see again,

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:25.617
that's for sure. But luckily he somehow knew we were in trouble

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:28.820
and swooped in just in time to lend a much-needed hand.

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.789
You should tune in to see who it was.

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:33.091
Things were so crazy I almost didn't notice that

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.028
Dan and Drago were back. It was too much!

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.462
DAN: Boo-ya!

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.497
