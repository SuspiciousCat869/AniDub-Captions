WEBVTT

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.510
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.112
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.114
but instead it's a curse.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.882
He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.118
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.253
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.489
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.525
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.361
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.530
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.465
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.502
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.471
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.777
\u266a Back against the wall,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.880
\u266a You gotta give it your all, a-a-a-a-a-a \u266a

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:50.216
\u266a This is the final stand, a-a-a-a-a-a \u266a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.518
\u266a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:57.457
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.400
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.702
WYVERN: What you see in front of you is a pathway

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.337
to your inner mind.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.940
DAN: And why is it that we want to go in there?

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.642
WYVERN: The answer to ridding yourself

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.112
of the nightmarish visions that haunt you lies within.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.314
DAN: Okay. In we go!

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.316
DRAGO: Let's do it!

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:33.426
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Mind Search

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.728
ANNOUNCER: It's almost that time again battle fans!

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.497
ANNOUNCER: The next throw down will take place

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.566
in the Dungeon Battle Environment.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.701
ANNOUNCER: It'll be a capture the flag round.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.137
That means that all competing teams will start

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.072
from random drop points in the dungeon,

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.675
and then will be forced to battle each other

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.376
as they race to be the first to claim the flag

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.378
at the final destination point.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.882
ANNOUNCER: It's gonna be flag-tastic!

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.485
SPECTATOR A: You know I'm so getting on this!

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.554
SPECTATOR B: Round up the crew so we can sign up our team.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.691
MARUCHO: Yet another bad idea.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.860
SELLON: All is going according to plan.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:09.395
By engaging multiple teams in the next round,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.432
you should receive a giant surge of chaos energy.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.201
MAG MEL: Excellent. With each new battle growing

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.604
so too does the desire for the battlers

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.873
to engage in extreme brawling.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:23.042
The chaos energy produced will be so immense

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.979
that I'll be free of this place in no time.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.883
SELLON: I look forward to that glorious day Master.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.851
PAIGE: What do you mean you don't want us to battle?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.120
MARUCHO: Just listen for a sec.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.456
All you need for the win is to grab the flag.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.558
MARUCHO: So you really don't need to fight at all.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.660
PAIGE: We're battlers not cowards!

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.562
PAIGE: Why on Earth would we avoid fighting?

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.498
RAFE: I think maybe he doesn't trust our battling skills.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.734
MARUCHO: That's not it. It's just that things...

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.769
are out of control in Bakugan Interspace,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.871
so the less we add to the chaos the better.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.206
Once we get past the...

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.510
PAIGE: Save it okay. Man!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.846
RAFE: Just because you've lost your nerve, Marucho,

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.015
doesn't mean that we have.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.082
MARUCHO: Come on. Don't go.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.319
Rafe! ... Paige!

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.254
MARUCHO: What now?

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.990
SHUN: I'll do what I'm supposed to do.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:18.031
SHUN: I'll keep battling.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:21.301
MARUCHO: [sigh]

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.869
TAYLEAN: Are you sure about this, Shun?

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.371
SHUN: Marucho's right Taylean when he says

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:30.176
things are out of control in Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.012
SHUN: But he's wrong about what we need to do to fix it.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:37.483
You can't stop chaos by sitting idly by and avoiding battle.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.986
SHUN: The only way we're going to calm the storm

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.789
and bring peace back to Bakugan Interspace

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.857
is to face things head on.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.392
TAYLEAN: If that's the way you feel,

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.227
then I'm with you all the way.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.829
One hundred percent.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.099
SHUN: I'm happy to hear that.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.602
BEN: I can't believe the number of noobs signing up.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.337
What a pack of losers.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.005
JACK: Yeah, we'll knock 'em down

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.907
like a pathetic bunch of bowling pins.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.875
JACK: Right boss?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.912
ANUBIAS: Whatever. Just don't mess it up.

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:07.914
ALL: [grunt]

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.616
ROBIN: Aren't you coming?

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:14.053
ANUBIAS: No. This one's on you guys.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:18.491
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field Open!

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.093
ANNOUNCER: This is the moment

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.095
you've all been waiting for, battle fans!

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.163
The question is which team will make it

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.599
through the maze first, defeating all opponents...

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.837
in order to grab the flag and claim victory?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.440
Hold on to your socks, 'cos we're ready to rock!

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.309
MARUCHO: Bakugan...

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.343
ALL: Brawl!

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.345
ALL: Bakugan Stand!

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.814
TAYLEAN, TRISTAR AND WOLFURIO: [mighty roar]

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:46.686
SOON and CHRIS: Bakugan Stand!

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:54.994
BEN, ROBIN and JACK: Bakugan Stand!

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:59.165
BATTLER A: Well, well. Looks like I'm up first, fellas!

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.902
BATTLER A: Huh?

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.904
[mighty roar]

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:09.308
BATTLER A: Aw snap! This looks bad!

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.743
ARMY BATTLER CAPTAIN: Hahaha!

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.779
Another punk eats some dirt!

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.313
Oh yeeeeeaaaaah!

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.982
ARMY BATTLER B: Don't forget about his teammates.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.450
ARMY BATTLER CAPTAIN: Big deal!

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.285
Like they're going to be any harder to take down

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:20.720
than he was, dude!

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.255
ARMY BATTLER B: They might not be,

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:29.662
but what about that guy over there?

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.131
ARMY BATTLER B: Whoa! It's Shun Kazami!

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:38.371

Hmmmph!

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:18.277

I really love this one.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:32.792
Haaaaaaaaah!

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:34.460
PAIGE: Hah, that was easy.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:36.462
RAFE: I'm thinking maybe the Battle Brawlers

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.297
need to take a little lesson from us

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.233
on how to battle. What do you think?

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.335
PAIGE: Oh yeah! Like that'll happen.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.637

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.114
if you think you can take down a Castle Knight

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:06.385

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:40.920
BOULDERON: I've got him.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.489
He's gonna hurt real bad!

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:51.597
JACK: Hahaha! Come and get it!

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.333
BOULDERON: Oh no!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:09:01.874
PAIGE: [gasp] RAFE: [angry grunt]

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:05.011
MARUCHO: [grunt] Ability activate.

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.013
MARUCHO: Stun Current!

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:12.985
TRISTAR: Oh yeeeeeaaah!

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.487
[wave crash]

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.622
ROBIN: Huh? JACK: Whoa!

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:22.094
BEN: [gasp] They disappeared.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:30.803
PAIGE: Let's show these punks how to battle, Boulderon!

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:38.044
RAFE: Let's make the Castle Knights proud Wolfurio!

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.645
BOULDERON: [groan] WOLFURIO: [groan]

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.516
RAFE: [panting] PAIGE: [angry grunt]

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.384
TRISTAR: Sorry to break up the party back there fellas...

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.585
RAFE: We didn't need your help!

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:49.021
PAIGE: Yeah. We were doing just fine on our own!

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.189
TRISTAR: Gimme a break!

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.657
You guys were getting hammered pretty hard

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.859
by those clowns before we stepped in.

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.762
PAIGE: [angry grunt] What do you know?

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.364
RAFE: [sigh]

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.199
MARUCHO: We know a lot more than you give us credit for.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.268
Being skilled battlers isn't everything.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.103
There's more going on here than meets the eye

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.138
and it's time you listened to us.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:10.142
Using sheer strength won't save Bakugan Interspace.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.677
MARUCHO: This place is filled with Battlers

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.246
who are using technology way beyond their skill set

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.048
like BakuNanos and Mechtogans.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:19.318
And their style of extreme brawling is too destructive.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:22.254
MARUCHO: If Bakugan Interspace is going to survive...

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.957
we have to do everything we can to end all of this

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.060
unbelievable chaos once and for all.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.762
RAFE: Hmmm.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:35.601
PAIGE: [grunt]

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.803
DYLAN: For once I really don't know who's gonna win.

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:41.974
DYLAN: It's anyone's guess at this point.

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.710
Team Anubias are definitely the most fierce,

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:46.445
but without their Captain leading them,

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.447
I'm not sure if those three knuckleheads have

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.449
what it takes to pull off a victory.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.818
DYLAN: Team Sellon are definitely contenders,

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:56.088
but you can't rule out Shun Kazami and Taylean.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.557
Even though the Brawlers are shaky as a team,

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.292
they're a solid pair.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:12.705
DYLAN: I guess only time will tell us who the best is.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:18.911
TAYLEAN: [panting]

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.480
SHUN: Are you ready for another round, Taylean?

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:32.925
TAYLEAN: Yes!

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.928
SOON: Well if I'm not mistaken Chris, it's Shun Kazami.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.230
CHRIS: Huh? You mean that Emo twerp

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.933
who's the leader of the Brawlers?

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.401
CHRIS: Yeah I think you're right.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:45.304
It's pretty hard to miss that feathered hair anywhere.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:50.142
SOON: Let's take him down then, shall we?

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:57.116
SOON: BakuNano Slicerix Destroy!

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:06.625
CHRIS: BakuNano Orehammer Destroy!

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:10.229
[mighty roar]

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:14.667
TAYLEAN: Bring it!

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.302
MARUCHO: According to this read out, Shun is

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:19.271
facing Team Sellon by himself. I hope he's okay.

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.040
TRISTAR: Good plan, plotting our route through

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.875
the sewers, Marucho. I mean with a smell like this

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.377
who else in their right minds would come down here?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.247
RAFE: Oh yeah, trudging through the sewers like

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.316
a bunch of dirty rats.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.851
PAIGE: How humiliating.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.954
MARUCHO: [groan]

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:37.156
TRISTAR: Whoa! Marucho!

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.291
RAFE: [gasp] PAIGE: [gasp]

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.493
TRISTAR: Poor little, dude.

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.762
I told him he was pushing it too hard.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:45.064
RAFE: Pushing what too hard?

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.999
TRISTAR: Marucho stayed up the past two days straight

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.068
trying to plot the safest route to the finish line

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.803
that would allow us to avoid as many

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.338
potential battles as possible.

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.707
The amount of data he had to study was massive.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.276
It was enough to melt a normal person's brain.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.111
TRISTAR: Normally, I'd be all about the brawling

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:03.282
just like you guys. But we have to trust Marucho.

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:05.317
TRISTAR: He created Bakugan Interspace

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.454
so he knows what's best.

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:11.657
PAIGE: [sigh] [angry grunt]

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.560
[explosion]

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:19.498
JACK: Busted, punks! [laughter]

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.700
[mighty roar]

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:25.037
JACK: It's time for payback.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.972
TRISTAR: Alright. You back with us, boss?

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:29.275
MARUCHO: After that wake up call, yes!

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.111
Let's switch to Plan K on my mark.

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.680
TRISTAR: Oh yeah! Nice one.

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.282
MARUCHO: Switch to a G Pattern, now!

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.350
WOLFURIO: Copy that! BOULDERON: You got it!

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:42.688
JACK: Hey! Where you goin'?

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:48.694
JACK: So that's how you want to play this?

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:51.130
ANNOUNCER: We've seen some furious battles so far,

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:54.166
but no team has managed to take the flag yet.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.969
But as you well, know it's only a matter of time.

00:13:57.002 --> 00:14:01.140
The question is: Who will it be?

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.641
TRISTAR: [panting, running reax]

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.311
BEN: Is he by himself all of a sudden?

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.981
ROBIN: What happened to the other two guys?

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.716
TRISTAR: Hey team. Are you serious?

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:13.419
All three at once?

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.655
JACK: You're finished, now! [cackle]

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:23.395
TRISTAR: Wow! This kid is so annoying!

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.030
TRISTAR: Marucho? A little help?

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:28.067
MARUCHO: Ability activate.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.802
MARUCHO: Brow Stealth!

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:38.277
BEN: Huh? ROBIN: [grunt] JACK: [gasp]

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.646
TRISTAR: Hah! Now that's how you do it, son!

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:43.082
MARUCHO: Yup. Now let's hurry!

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:44.750
SHUN: Ability activate.

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:47.386
SHUN: Slash Rise Thunder!

TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.857
CHRIS: Oooooh, I'm scared.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.859
[explosion]

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.194
TAYLEAN: Huh?

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.729
SOON: Attack!

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.932
TAYLEAN: Aaaaarrrrrrggggghhhh!

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.267
TAYLEAN: Ooooomph!

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.534
SHUN: Taylean!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.204
TAYLEAN: Argh! That one really hurt, Shun.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.806
CHRIS: I bet you goofs didn't think a couple of girls

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.743
could take you down, but that's where you're wrong suckers!

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.911
Dead wrong! Got it?

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:15.347
SOON: It's our grace that gives us the edge.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.883
SHUN: Huh? Is that right?

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:21.086
We'll see then. Now Taylean!

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.087
CHRIS: [gasp]

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.422
SHUN: Where's your grace now?

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.257
SHUN: Ability activate.

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.626
SHUN: Shooting Wind Dust Slash!

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.263
TAYLEAN: Hah!

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:35.601
CHRIS: Dude! That's just harsh! Come on!

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.369
SHUN: Keep going, Taylean!

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:42.775
SOON: [frustrated grunt] Ready!

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:44.543
TRISTAR: Check it out. There's the flag!

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.145
MARUCHO: Hmmmmph!

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:47.246
SELLON: Hah.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.747
SELLON: Bakugan Brawl.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.416
SELLON: Bakugan Stand!

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.551
SELLON: Rise Ventus Spyron!

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:56.088
TRISTAR: Wha? What's going on?

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.524
Huh? Where did she come from?

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:00.025
SELLON: You should be more concerned with,

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.094
where you're going to.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:14.573
BakuNano Daftorix Destroy!

MARUCHO: Brow Bunker!

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:24.383
SELLON: How sad for you to think a pathetic defense like that

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.485
is any match for Daftorix.

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:30.489
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:33.726

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.194
MARUCHO: Hold Over!

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:37.396
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaah!

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.765
MARUCHO: Now, you're not only frozen, but also blocked

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:44.336
from using your abilities until the battle is over.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.705
TRISTAR: Aaaarrrrggghhh!

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.640
SELLON: It doesn't matter my friend.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.343
Daftorix still has you in his grip so it's too late.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.313
TRISTAR: Now guys! Hit it!

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:58.784
WOLFURIO: [rising mighty roar] BOULDERON: [rising mighty roar]

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:02.788
SELLON: Gentlemen. Meet my Mechtogan!

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:11.330
SELLON: Braxion!

WOLFURIO: Boulderon, go now!

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:41.293
BOULDERON: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.762
BOULDERON: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.998
WOLFURIO: You'll never take down a Castle Knight!

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:48.834
Haaaaaaah!

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.702
BOULDERON: Almost there.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.439
WOLFURIO: Open wide.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:58.644

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:01.847
BOULDERON: I got it! We win!

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.915
ANNOUNCER: Game over.

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.250
The Battle Brawlers take it!

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:12.825
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [insane cheering]

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:20.766

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.601
MARUCHO: Hah! It worked pal.

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:25.037
TRISTAR: Never doubted your strategy for a second buddy.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.039
TRISTAR: What a brilliant idea to have us distract

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:30.042
the main opponents while our two teammates snuck

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.744
around back and swooped in for the flag scoop!

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.313
TRISTAR: What's even more amazing is that

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.216
we were able to do it without any help from Shun.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.951
MARUCHO: Who says he didn't help?

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.085
TRISTAR: Huh?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.854
MARUCHO: I always knew he was going to draw

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:43.989
a large number of opponents to him,

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.259
which is what inspired the idea in the first place.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.628
TRISTAR: Whoa! Looks like you tricked your teammates too

00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:51.129
with that one.

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.798
MARUCHO: I wouldn't exactly say that.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:56.001
I only tricked you guys by not telling you.

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.202
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.138
PAIGE: What are you doing?

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:01.206
RAFE: Please forgive us, Marucho.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.976
We were quick to judge you and the Brawlers.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:07.212
We should have never doubted your abilities

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:10.682
and your vast battling knowledge.

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.718
RAFE: I promise that if you give us a second chance

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:15.120
to be your students we'd be grateful.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.555
MARUCHO: Uh, well. Well I guess I can...

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:19.725
PAIGE: Come on Rafe. We don't need to beg him!

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:20.859
RAFE: Be quiet!

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:27.432
PAIGE: Huh? Okay, whatever he says.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:32.538
MARUCHO: [laugh]

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.773
TAYLEAN: You okay?

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:37.209
SHUN: I was just thinking about Marucho.

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:40.112
His strategy actually worked.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.848
SHUN: Maybe I've been wrong all along.

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:53.859
MARUCHO: [gasp] I thought I heard Shun.

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.461
DRAGO: Dan, look. Up ahead!

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.397
DRAGO: What is that?

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:06.605
DAN: I'm not sure.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:09.341
MAG MEL: Go and fight.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:15.547
Free your Masters Mag Mel and Razenoid!

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.015
DAN: Did you see them?

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:23.689
DRAGO: Yes I did.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:27.960
DAN: Huh? [gasp]

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:32.030
DRAGO: It was the creature and the Bakugan from our visions.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:36.668
DRAGO: Wyvern, do you know who this Mag Mel and Razenoid are?

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.671
WYVERN: No but there's something strangely familiar about them.

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.707
They give me an odd feeling.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.710
DAN: I just realized something else, Drago.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.978
DRAGO: What's that?

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:50.148
DAN: That light was Code Eve.

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:53.485
MAG MEL: So Kuso has remembered the key

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:57.556
that will unlock everything. Code Eve!

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:00.192
MAG MEL: Soon he will know the truth about how

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:03.228
we are forever linked. [evil chuckle]

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.501
DAN: When Wyvern showed us the way into our inner minds

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.670
we learned that the evil looking dude and his Bakugan

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:13.572
were named Mag Mel and Razenoid.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.340
But we still don't know where they come from

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.042
or why they're invading our thoughts.

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:18.610
And what's their connection to Code Eve,

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.712
the mother energy of all Bakugan?

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.914
Marucho is back in Interspace trying to get things

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.150
under control. It's a lot for one person,

00:21:25.183 --> 00:21:27.419
so I sure hope he and Shun can squash their issues

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.854
and come together again.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.689
There's a crazy amount of stuff going on inside

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:31.957
and outside of my head.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.892
You gotta tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.928
I'm telling you, something huge is about to go down!

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:37.963
