WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.510
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.978
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.648
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.617
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.953
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel,

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.355
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.158
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.228
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.563
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.365
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.502
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Back against the wall, Yougotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:57.457
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.331
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.269
MAG MEL: Good work, Anubias, your powers...

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:13.940
have served us well; however, I'll be taking them now.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.042
ANUBIAS: [gasp] [grunt, pain reax]

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:20.780
But I'm not finished my battle with Kussssssoooo!

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.483
ANUBIAS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:27.053
DAN: Anubias! Come on! You gotta fight it!

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:31.958
ANUBIAS: I can't his powers are too strong for me!

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.394
ANUBIAS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.203
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Behind the Mask

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.808
[laser blasts and explosions in the distance]

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.909
DAN: You ready, Drago?

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.944
DRAGO: You bet!

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.345
DAN: Ability activate!

Thor Buster!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.748
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.351
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:01.921
DAN: That's right!

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.356
DAN: [gasp]

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.392
MAG MEL: Now that we have the gate and the key, Razenoid,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.095
our resurrection is nearly complete,

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.731
and our plans for domination can commence.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.334
MAG MEL: And no one will be able to stop us.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.136
MARUCHO: Are you sure?

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.905
Mag Mel is going to try and take over Earth?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.975
DAN: Ya, I overheard him tell Razenoid he was going to use...

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.644
Bakugan Interspace as his command central.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.847
TRISTAR: Well, we have to do something!

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.917
SHUN: Can we contact the outside world yet?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.687
MARUCHO: I've tried every method I know but still nothing.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.189
DAN: We can't let that stop us.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.457
ALL: Huh?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.393
DAN: We have to take Mag Mel and Razenoid down for good.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.228
It's our only option!

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.330
RAFE: But we're stuck in here.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.232
DAN: Then I'll link up with Mag Mel.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.233
RAFE: Mentally?

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.935
DAN: Yeah. It's the quickest way...

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.770
to find him and take him out.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.172
RAFE: But Dan, is it even possible?

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.508
DAN: I haven't got a clue, to be honest.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.410
But I gotta at least try, right?

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.411
SHUN: No way.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.746
DAN: [gasp]

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.581
SHUN: Every other time you've linked up with him,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.017
it's nearly ended in disaster.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.018
MARUCHO: Shun's right.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.119
DAN: [gasp]

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.121
MARUCHO: And not to mention the risky degree...

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.723
to which you're suggesting making this next link up...

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.225
could leave you in danger of getting...

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.493
stuck in his dimension.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.028
PAIGE: Huh? For real?

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.064
RAFE: Plus during the link up you're comatose.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.933
We can't afford to lose you.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:25.071
If the Chaos Bakugan decide to attack again you'll be toast.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.740
DAN: Huh, it's a risk we're just gonna have to take.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:28.841
ALL: [gasp]

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.410
DAN: You're all making good points,

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.946
but seriously guys, we don't have a choice.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.583
I mean we're down to the wire here and time is running out.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.719
It may be dangerous, but at least I know...

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.288
that all of my friends have got my back!

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.258
SHUN: [gasp]

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.828
Well, I guess you're right.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.698
RAFE: If you really think it's the best way, we're with you.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.466
PAIGE: Do what you need to do, boss man.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.535
PAIGE: We've got you covered.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.004
MARUCHO: I better find a way to get us out...

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.340
of Interspace quickly.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.714
SOON: Mistress...

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.683
SELLON: You should enjoy your final moments of life because...

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.986
soon the Earth will be destroyed under his wrath,

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.220
and you along with it.

CHRIS: This is really bad!

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:34.007
C'mon, we gotta get out of here!

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.642
Soon! Come on!

NOAH: I was.

CHRIS: Noah, that's right I remember you were...

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.616
the one who was always acting scared.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:22.922
NOAH: Well things are completely different now.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.525
I'm here to help you get out of here.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:29.896

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:33.066
CHRIS: Soon! That's not very nice!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.001
NOAH: Well to answer your question, ma'am,

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.070
I'm going to battle any Chaos Bakugan...

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.604
that stands in your way.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:42.141
I'll provide the distraction while you find a way to escape.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.249
I'll keep them occupied!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.451
CHRIS: Are you crazy?

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.653
You can't fight all of them by yourself.

SOON: Why...why even bother?

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.710
What's the point in fighting when the ones we trusted...

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.512
most turned their backs on us?

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.014
BEN: Hah! I may have fought under Anubias,

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.116
but I didn't fight for him, sister!

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.218
BEN: If you're gonna pack it in just 'cos your boss...

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.320
turned out to be a creep then maybe you...

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.623
were never fit to battle in the first place!

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.494

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:45.898
DAN: [gasp]

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.505
Did we link up?

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.241
DRAGO: Yes. It appears so.

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.743
DAN: Weird it looks like...

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:01.180
DRAGO: ...Bakugan Interspace. Only darker.

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.649

MAG MEL: I suppose a welcome is in order,

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.157
now that you have found your way to the dark...

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.526
reverse dimension of Bakugan Interspace.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.827
DAN: What's that?

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.029
DRAGO: The two dimensions are flipsides of the same world,

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:18.798
one positive, one negative.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.499

TAYLEAN: On it!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.993
CHRIS: But, why would you help us after...?

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.262
RAFE: We're not just protecting you two...

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:46.031
PAIGE: Dan and Drago are inside the base.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:49.368
RAFE: Our priority is to keep them safe!

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:51.337
RAFE: Right now those guys are our only hope...

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.207
of getting out of Bakugan Interspace in one piece.

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.611
RAFE: So be quiet and stay out of our way.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.013

SHUN: [panting, exertion reax]

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:13.993
SOON: What's the point? We'll never win.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:16.829
SHUN: Not with an attitude like that.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.633
SOON and CHRIS: Mistress...

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:30.009
CHRIS: We can't let her poison everything Soon.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.210
SOON: Huh?

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.279
CHRIS: We're here and she's gone.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.147
Now there's true goodness around us.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:39.819
We just have to open our eyes to it.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:43.422
CHRIS: And join the fight against Mag Mel, the true evil.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:47.092
What do you say? Are you up to it Soon?

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.294

CHRIS: Yeah, I know right? See it's not all bad.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.817
SOON: I suppose you're right.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.786
Perhaps we've found a new light.

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:18.858
SHUN: Huh?

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.963
CHRIS and SOON: Hey Shun!

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.298
SOON: We would like to join with you.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.634
CHRIS: That is if you'll have us?

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.003
SHUN: Hmmph. Let's go!

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.172
CHRIS and SOON: Right!

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.974
MARUCHO: Why can't I do this?

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.209
MARUCHO: I've tried every configuration I know of,

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:40.546
and then a few more and still I can't figure it out.

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.814
TRISTAR: Calm down, dude.

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:42.982
MARUCHO: I can't.

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.883
I need to get a message out to the real world.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.819
DYLAN: You just need to accept the fact...

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:48.821
that not all puzzles can be solved.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.490
At least not by a human like you.

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:52.625
MARUCHO: Dylan!

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.260
DYLAN: You should just give up,

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.628
and go join your friends for one last battle.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.962
DYLAN: [chuckle]

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:03.302
MARUCHO: Can't be solved by a human?

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.570
MARUCHO: It sounds to me like you think...

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:06.438
you're a lot smarter than a human like me,

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.073
is that right?

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.174
DYLAN: Of course.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.743
MARUCHO: Then why don't you prove it by solving...

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.611
the problem that's been baffling me this whole time.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:15.147
Show me how to get a message to the outside world.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.382
MARUCHO: If you think you can?

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.485
DYLAN: Hmmmph.

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:20.653
DAN: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.087
MAG MEL: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:27.726
DAN: Barodius?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.063
DAN: [gasp] So you're alive, huh?

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.064
DRAGO: What?

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.099
MAG MEL: No. Barodius is dead,

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.702
and now the mighty Mag Mel lives.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:37.936
DRAGO: So that means...?

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.440
RAZENOID: Yes, and I was once Dharak, but not anymore.

00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:43.976
DAN: What happened to you?

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.445
MAG MEL: What you see before you is an amplified version...

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.147
of my old self.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.150
A super manifestation of all anger and hatred...

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:54.286
that once fuelled me, kicked into overdrive...

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.356
after I came into contact with the Sacred Orb.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:00.225
DRAGO: It looks to me like Code Eve took your evil thoughts...

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.360
and encased you in them.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:02.728
MAG MEL: Silence fool!

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:06.131
What Code Eve did was use her powers to banish me...

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:09.735
to this reverse dimension. But little did she know...

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:13.939
Kuso and I shared a link. I was able to store the power...

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:16.108
you exerted from each battle you fought,

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.978
until I had enough power to surpass even Code Eve,

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:23.349
and could break free of her flimsy shackles.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:26.518
DAN: I beat you once before, Barodius!

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:29.121
And I'll do it again, you understand?

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:33.258
MAG MEL: I highly doubt that, I doubt that very much, Kuso.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.960
DAN: Then, bring it!

00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:37.162
MAG MEL: With pleasure!

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.197

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.326

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.236
[heavy ground impacts]

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.171
ZENTHON TITAN: I am Zenthon Titan,

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:22.908
here to unleash my fury upon any who oppose my Masters.

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.943
[computer beeps and trills]

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.053
DRAGO: Come on Razenoid! Let's see what you're made of!

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.255
RAZENOID: You're going down, Drago!

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.532
DREADEON TITAN: I will annihilate you!

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.769
ZENTHON TITAN: My three blades say otherwise!

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.073
DAN: Let's go, Mag Mel!

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:56.575
Haaaaaaaaah!

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.177
MAG MEL: Hmmmph!

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.178
Haaaaaaah!

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.413
DAN and MAG MEL: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.918
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.793
DAN: [angry grunt] You're toast!

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.440
DAN and MAG MEL: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.710
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.345
RAZENOID: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:42.855
DRAGO and RAZENOID: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.423
MAG MEL and DAN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:46.892
DAN: [gasp]

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:48.427
MAG MEL: Huh?

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.167
MAG MEL: Hmmmph! See you soon.

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.403
DAN: Mag Mel!

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.105
DRAGO: Dan!

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.974
DAN: [gasp]

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:04.209
Dang it!

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.145
Huh?

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.180
SHUN: Hey.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.816
DAN: Huh?

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.751
NOAH, ROBIN, BEN an JACK: [chuckle]

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.854
DAN: What are those guys doing here?

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.856
SHUN: Don't worry about that, now.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.425
How'd the link-up go?

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:23.395
DAN: We found him and we battled him, but in the end...

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.531
DRAGO: ...we lost the link and he got away.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.065
PAIGE: That stinks!

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.402
DAN: Yeah, but at least we know where he and Razenoid...

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.070
are hiding out now.

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.573
RAFE: We do? Where would that be?

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:37.042
DAN: The dark reverse dimension of Bakugan Interspace;

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:39.444
created by Code Eve as a prison for him,

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:41.947
except now he is able to get out.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.215
SHUN: Seriously?

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:47.319
DAN: There's more. We found out Mag Mel's true identity.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.555
Turns out he's... Barodius!

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.223
PAIGE: That old creep?

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:54.626
DRAGO: Yes, the former Emperor of Gundalia.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.095
BOULDERON: I thought those guys were history.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.397
PAIGE: Aw Man!

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.801
SHUN: So this place how exactly do we get there, Dan?

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:06.138
DAN: Without a link I don't know.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.812
MARUCHO: Okay, Dylan. Do your thing.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:19.384
DYLAN: [chuckle] With pleasure.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.688
[key click]

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.261
MARUCHO: Alright. This better work!

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.467
KYOSUKE: What if we can't get them out.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.235
KATO: Don't worry, sir. I'm sure there must be...

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.205
a way for us to rescue them from Bakugan Interspace.

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:42.207
KYOSUKE: I hope so.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.909
KYOSUKE: Huh?

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:45.344
MARUCHO: Hey Dad, is that you?

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.712
KYOSUKE: Yes son!

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.880
TRISTAR: Awesome! The kook really knew what he was doing!

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.816
KATO and KYOSUKE: Huh?

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.250
MARUCHO: Too much has happened...

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.552
to explain everything right now.

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.054
What we need to focus on is getting the Battlers...

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.223
trapped inside of here, out as soon as possible,

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.791
but I'm going to need your help.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:03.462
KYOSUKE: I understand. Just tell us what we need to do, son.

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:05.397
MARUCHO: Okay, here's the plan...

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.267
MARUCHO: With Dylan's help we were finally able

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.269
to get a message from Bakugan Interspace to

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:14.239
the outside world, but Mag Mel's attack was still imminent.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.174
Before we could deal with him though, we had to

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.543
evacuate the rest of the battlers from inside.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:21.913
But then we were hit by another wave of invading Chaos Bakugan.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.349
Things were getting so intense I wasn't sure we'd be able

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:27.285
to pull any of it off. Luckily we had my father and Kato

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:29.788
helping us on the outside. You've got to tune in

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.523
to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.959
I don't think we've ever faced such a tough challenge

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:37.095
before, but then again, the stakes have never been higher!

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:47.172
