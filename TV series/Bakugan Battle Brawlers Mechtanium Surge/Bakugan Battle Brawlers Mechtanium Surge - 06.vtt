WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.741
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.610
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.379
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.881
Bakugan Interspace the number of people accessing it

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.417
from around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.386
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.489
with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.825
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.260
DAN: The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.996
against some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.066
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.101
DAN: ...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.837
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.174
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.042
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.677
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.246
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.647
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.382
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.850
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.986
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.754
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.492
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.529
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.431
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:14.307
DAN: Huh. I'm here again. [grunt]

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.980
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle] Dan Kuso.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.551
DAN: [gasp] You again! What do you want?

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.321
MAG MEL: Haven't you been paying attention boy?

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.158
DAN: [gasp] Stop talking in circles.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.994
DAN: I'm sick of you hijacking my dreams dude!

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.597
DAN: [grunt] Huh?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.432
DAN: Whoa!

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.336
DAN: [grunt] Let go of me. Right now!

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.439
MAG MEL: We two are one. Dan Kuso!

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.974
DAN: What's that mean?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:52.912
MAG MEL: We share a bond that you can scarcely comprehend.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.247
Go forth.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.050
Battle for the energy to feed me before I unleash

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.818
Razenoid upon you!

00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.919
DAN: [gasp]

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.688
DAN: [panting]

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.157
DAN: [gasp]

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.459
DRAGO: So Mag Mel is his name.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.328
DAN: Huh? How do you know?

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.363
DAN: Did I talk in my sleep again?

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.765
DRAGO: No, I was in a kind of dream state.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.167
DRAGO: And I think I might have had the same

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.835
nightmare you did.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.939
DAN: Man, Drago. This is getting weirder by the day.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.277
DAN: I feel like we're losing control.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.348
DAN: [gasp]

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.120
[\u266a]

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.090
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Agony of Defeat.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.497
MARUCHO: I'm glad we found you.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.932
We've been really worried since you took off after

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.734
your argument with Shun.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.969
We need to work things out Dan.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.471
DAN: What's to work out?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.939
You guys don't want me to battle and I think you're

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.641
out of your minds.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.808
End of story.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.577
TRISTAR: You're not the only one on this team, Dan.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.979
Quit being so stubborn and listen to these guys!

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.416
DRAGO: Watch it!

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.718
DAN: Fine. If you've got something to say, just say it.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.420
MARUCHO: Well...

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.721
MARUCHO: ...We're concerned about the

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.758
current battle tournament in Bakugan Interspace.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.393
TRISTAR: You guys might still be number one in the

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.195
rankings, but it's obvious that something is bugging you.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.697
You're starting to slip.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.200
We can see it and even worse the audience can see it.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.801
DAN: What!

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.803
MARUCHO: We're not trying to gang up on you, honestly.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.439
We're just concerned about what could happen if

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.909
you're not on your game.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.011
DAN: I've told you a hundred times we're fine.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.314
Now quit wasting our time, okay?

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.448
DRAGO: That's right.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.216
TRISTAR: If everything is rainbows, how come

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.552
whenever Drago starts to lose it, Zenthon shows up

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.321
and starts blowing things to smithereens?

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.522
MARUCHO: Enough, Tristar!

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.523
TRISTAR: Why?

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.557
TRISTAR: Someone has to say it!

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.825
MARUCHO: C'mon, Dan.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.193
We're your friends no matter what, but that

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.829
doesn't mean you can ignore what we're telling you.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.533
Part of being a good leader is knowing when to listen.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.034
DAN: [angry grunt] Unbelievable!

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.603
Now you're gonna lecture me on being a leader!

00:03:56.636 --> 00:04:01.007
Are you kidding me? I'm outta here.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.742
MARUCHO: Hey wait! Hold on!

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:03.943
DAN: [angry grunt, exertion] Don't touch me!

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:04.944
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.179
TRISTAR: Marucho!

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:10.416
DAN: Just back off. I'm asking you nicely.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:15.188
DAN: What?

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.156
SHUN: Secrets are like.. their just like poison, Dan.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.591
Remember that.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.426
DAN: [gasp]

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.003
MARUCHO: What now?

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.404
TRISTAR: If he's still refusing to listen,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.806
maybe it's time we let him fall flat on his face.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.444
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: What an incredible end

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.246
to one of the most spectacular battles this

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.250
announcer has ever seen inside Bakugan Interspace.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.918
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: With the Captain of Team Anubias.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.122
Anubias himself taking the victory over Ms. Sellon

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.257
from Team Sellon!

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.493
This result means that Anubias is now tied with

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:57.230
Dan Kuso for first place in the rankings.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.098
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Which in turn means Dan

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.035
and Anubias will face off in tomorrow's headliner!

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.503
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Will Anubias have what it

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.372
takes to unseat the unbeatable Dan Kuso and

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.710
take the championship crown of Interspace?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.214
DRAGO: It didn't take him long to catch up.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.216
DAN: Un uh. [gasp]

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.953
DAN: It's that kid.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.855
NOAH: [gasp]

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.760
DAN: [frustrated grunt]

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.162
DAN: [sigh]

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.167
DAN: Ability activate!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.769
DAN: Dragon Hard Striker!

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:40.239
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.476
DAN: Ability activate!

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.212
DAN: Dragon Force Striker!

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.748
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.685
DAN: Nice one!

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:58.591
DRAGO: [panting]

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.993
DAN: [gasp] Drago!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.829
[grunt]

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.165
DRAGO: Sorry, Dan. That one took a lot out of me.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.233
DAN: Yeah, but it looks like you're starting to

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.768
get a handle on it.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.103
So don't sweat it, buddy.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:13.639
DRAGO: Yes. It did feel like I had much more control that time.

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:16.209
DAN: That's awesome! Think you're ready to have another go?

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.443
I don't want to lose momentum now that you're

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.945
getting the hang of this.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.513
ANUBIAS: So are you going to hit me with everything

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.482
you've got tomorrow, Kuso?

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:23.950
ANUBIAS: Or are you gonna hold back like you did

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:27.086
last time and treat me like a chump?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.555
DAN: I think you got that backwards. [grunt]

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.292
You're the one who just gave up and threw in the towel.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.994
ANUBIAS: Well, there's no glory in beating a legend

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.863
when he's only giving half an effort.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.064
DAN: [gasp]

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.966
ANUBIAS: Forget what you think of me, Kuso.

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.934
With a battle record like yours, you owe it to

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.971
yourself to defend your legend.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.407
ANUBIAS: With every ounce of your being Dan.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.509
DAN: [gasp]

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.880
ANUBIAS: Don't disappoint me. Heh.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.990
DAN: Aw man. What a day. [grunt]

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.626
MARUCHO: C'mon, Dan. We're your friends no matter what,

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.561
but that doesn't mean you can ignore us.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.963
SHUN: Secrets are like, their just like poison,

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:14.333
Dan Remember that.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.271
DRAGO: You okay?

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.772
DAN: It really stinks.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.940
DRAGO: What does?

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:24.343
DAN: Marucho and Shun not trusting us.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.078
It really stinks.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.381
Why can't they just believe that you and I

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:29.949
know what we're doing?

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.717
DRAGO: Perhaps it time that, we let them in on

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.986
what's been happening.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.556
DRAGO: I can't help but wonder that, if we remove

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.591
the stress of keeping things a secret, maybe

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:43.663
we'll have an easier time harnessing these new powers.

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:47.600
DAN: You know what? I've got a better idea.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.735
DAN: Oh yeah!

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.571
DAN: We stick with the plan.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:55.274
Keep quiet, until we win the battle against Anubias.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.843
After that...

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:00.746
DRAGO: Their faith in us will be restored.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.215
DAN: Hmmm.

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:08.421
MAG MEL: More my minions. I need more!

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.723
MAG MEL: Continue to battle for the energy...

ANUBIAS: It's time for us to take the crown, Horridian!

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.072
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: We are mere moments away from

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.241
the match of the century!

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:29.675
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: I'm talking about the

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.511
battle that will determine who wins the title of

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:37.116

DAN: [gasp]

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.591
DAN: Aw man. You aren't gonna try and talk me outta

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.793
doing this again are you?

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:51.430
MARUCHO: No Dan. We're not here to do that. Promise.

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.732
DAN: Huh?

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.100
MARUCHO: If you insist on battling, then we're in

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.801
your corner all the way.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.303
SHUN: Just be careful.

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.105
If things feel like they're starting to go

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.308
sideways, just pull the plug.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.911
DAN: Hmmm... Listen guys...

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:08.915
DAN: Everything will be clear after the match.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:09.982
SHUN: What?

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.584
MARUCHO: So, does that mean that you'll...

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.185
DAN: Just trust me okay.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.555
I promise I'll meet you in the park after the battle.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:16.555
See ya!

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.891
MARUCHO: Hah.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.226
SHUN: Hmmmph.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.962
DAN: Drago. It's all coming together.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.931
DRAGO: You bet! Now let's win this!

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.104
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Ding-dong!

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.507
The bells are ringing, but for whom do they toll,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.242
battle fans?

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.476
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: The roar of the crowd is

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.746
downright deafening here inside Battle Arena A as

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.250
our two mighty combatants face-off at centre field!

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.651

2nd SPECTATOR: Go home, Dan!

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:50.589
You're boring. Time to retire. [laughter]

CROWD: [cheering]

ANUBIAS: Are you ready to do this?

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:03.369

ANUBIAS: Why are you playing defense again?

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.110
Just bring it!

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.704
MARUCHO: Keep it up, Drago!

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.939
You've got this!

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.745
DRAGO: [punching and kicking]

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.747
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [Ooooohs and ahhhhhs]

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.016

DAN: Drago!

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.425
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.826
DRAGO: What happened?

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.094
ANUBIAS: Force Through makes it impossible for

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.863
the opponent to use any of his defense abilities.

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:41.133
Now Drago can't put up any more defense shields.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.168
DRAGO: What?

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.269
DAN: Oh no!

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:46.639
ANUBIAS: Oh yes , Kuso! Gate Card, open.

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:47.973
ANUBIAS: Record Freeze!

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.608
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.710
ANUBIAS: This is my favourite Command Card

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.013
because it prevents one's opponent from using any

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.083
ability they've already used in the current battle.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.118
So enjoy.

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:00.886
ANUBIAS: Hmmmph.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.355
ANUBIAS: If Drago hopes to win, he'll have to reach into

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.926
his bag of tricks and pull out his most powerful abilities.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.394
DRAGO: What! [angry grunt]

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.229
DAN: Keep it together, Drago.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:13.532
SHUN: If Drago opens up an ability that's too powerful

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.402
he runs the risk of losing control of his powers again.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.571
MARUCHO: Oh no! They're double whammied, because Drago

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:21.107
can't use his defense abilities either.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.343
SHUN: Let's hope that they can hang on.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:25.845
DRAGO: Dan!

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.980
DAN: You said it yourself before, Drago.

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:30.282
You're gaining more control.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.417
ANUBIAS: What's wrong?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.952
Why the hold up, Kuso?

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:38.824

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:47.066
[\u266a]

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.836
DRAGO: Aaaaarrrrrgggggghhhh!

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.571
DRAGO: [groan] Oomph!

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.706
ANUBIAS: You hear that?

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:57.610
That's the sound, Kuso of your victory disappearing.

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.545
DAN: We can't lose this battle.

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.915
If we do, then Shun and Marucho's trust is lost forever.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.283
DRAGO: Don't worry, Dan.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:07.887
I know what's at stake and I won't let you down.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.022
ANUBIAS: Hmmm? You done, yakking?

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:13.359
DAN: Anubias, there's something you gotta understand...

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.661
DAN: You might be in this for your own glory, but

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.329
it's a very different story for us.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:19.331
You got that?

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:22.735
DAN: The Battle Brawlers are a team that fight for each other!

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.136
ANUBIAS: Huh?

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.906
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.175
MARUCHO: Oh man! This is tense!

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.677
ANUBIAS: Hmmmph.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.313
Are you really so na\u00efve that you believe that, Kuso?

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:36.615
I always thought you were smarter than that.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.917
DAN: Pipe down!

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.188
ANUBIAS: Team! I only see a single opponent facing me, here.

00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.924
ANUBIAS: This battle will be won or lost based on

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.226
how you wield your own personal...

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.728
ANUBIAS: ...power.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.664
DAN: [gasp] My own power?

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:55.100

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:58.504

MAG MEL: I told you before.

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.855
We two are one.

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:19.825
We share a bond that you cannot escape.

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:24.697
No matter how hard you try.

You think you can take me down with just that?

6th BOY: You could've really hurt him.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.546
1st SPECTATOR: What an epic fail!

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.148
What's wrong with you, Dan?

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.282
DAN: [sigh]

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.817
2nd SPECTATOR: So Mechtogan Zenthon was with

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.085
them the whole time!

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.286

NOAH: How could you?

PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: Well, I'm at a loss for words fans.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.600
That was an outcome, I don't think any of us

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.102
could have predicted.

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.403
PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: For using an unsanctioned

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:34.473
combatant, Dan Kuso has been disqualified

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:37.876
which means that your new Bakugan Interspace Champion

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.980
is Anubias!

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:48.487
[\u266a]

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.925
ANUBIAS: His power was even greater than I ever thought.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:56.395
SELLON: That one almost got away from you, Anubias.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.596
ANUBIAS: Whatever.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:20:01.233
SELLON: Master Mag Mel will still be quite pleased.

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.911
MARUCHO: Dan must have gotten held up.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.112
TRISTAR: Are you kidding me?

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.747
After a battle like that he probably went and

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.516
buried his head in the sand.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:18.784
MARUCHO: Don't say that.

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:19.985
TRISTAR: Seriously.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:21.386
You can't expect him to not be totally embarrassed.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.156
He just lost his crown and got booted from competition!

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.024
I think I even heard some of his own fans booing.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.192
MARUCHO: But he said that...

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.895
TAYLEAN: Tristar's right. He's not coming.

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.964
SHUN: [grunt]

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.265
MARUCHO: But he promised me that he'd clear

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:34.866
everything up after the battle.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.068
Even though we're fighting.

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:38.403
It's not like Dan to break a promise.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:41.773
He wouldn't do that to us not ever, guys!

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:42.908
MARUCHO: Dan and Drago are coming.

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:46.545
I just know it. I know it...

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:56.021
[\u266a]

00:20:56.054 --> 00:21:00.892
DAN: I don't think I can face them ..ever again.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:05.497
[\u266a]

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:09.968
SHUN: Something is seriously wrong with Dan and Drago.

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.837
They just disappeared after the last battle

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.171
without a trace.

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.973
I know losing to Anubias was humiliating, but I've

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.576
never known either of them to give up so easily.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.111
SHUN: Unfortunately, before we can go in search

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:23.115
of them, this strange device shows up in Bakugan Interspace.

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:25.484
It's bad news, so I wonder if Dylan's behind it.

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.519
It appears to amp up the destructive powers of

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.454
all the Bakugan who are battling.

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:32.257
SHUN: You have to tune in, so you can check out just

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.925
how much raw power I'm talking about!

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.795
SHUN: Not Sellon again. What does she want now?

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:46.872
