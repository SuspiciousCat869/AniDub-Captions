WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.710
DAN: A long time has passed since we took down Mag Mel,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.679
and things have never been better.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.948
DAN: Now that peace exists throughout the universe,

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.083
Shun, Marucho and I have been able to focus on training,

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.619
and battling just for the love of the game.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.756
It's brought the Brawlers way closer to our partner Bakugan.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.058
DAN: But it's not just us. Things have been so great...

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.760
that all of the Bakugan have immigrated from...

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.929
New Vestroia and now live here on Earth amongst us humans.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.399
It's like we're one giant happy family.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:35.201
DAN: I guess you could say things are perfect!

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.171
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.474
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.644
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.914
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.117
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:57.157
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.959
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.829
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.165
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.302
DRAGO: Hmmph!

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.840
DAN: [grunt]

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.752
SHUN: Dan!

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.020
MARUCHO: Drago!

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.189
SHUN: Are you all right?

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.858
DAN: Yeah, but where did Gunz go?

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.159
MARUCHO: We're not sure.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.228
DAN: Huh?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.697
MARUCHO: He just disappeared!

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.932
DAN: Guuuuuuuuunz!

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.433
Where are you?

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.734
MARUCHO: Are you hurt?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.069
SHUN: Guuuuuuuuunz!

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.771
DAN: Shout out!

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.506
SHUN: We're here!

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.341
MARUCHO: Where are you?

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.509
DAN: Come on, dude!

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.711
Quit fooling around!

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.079
DRAGO: Hmmm? Dan!

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.415
DAN: Hmmm?

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.683
DAN: What is it?

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.951
DRAGO: Do you hear that?

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.319
DAN: Huh?

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.521
REPTAK: Gunz? Talk to me!

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.522
Gunz!

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.557
DAN: Whooooa!

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.658
DRAGO: Reptak!

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.161
REPTAK: Oh, it's you two. Have you seen Gunz?

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.197
DAN: We thought he was with you Reptak.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:19.005
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Wiseman Cometh

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.478
REPTAK: It all happened so fast.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.548
Those Mechtogan just showed up and kaboom.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.149
[explosion]

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.556
REPTAK: I was knocked out, but when I came to...

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.793
I couldn't find Gunz anywhere. It was like he vanished.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:41.861
REPTAK: Gunz!

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:42.929
Guuuuuunz!

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.231
JAAKOR: Are you sure?

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.966
REPTAK: Huh? What're you talking about?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.935
RADIZEN: How do we know this isn't a trick?

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.103
REPTAK: A trick?

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.205
RADIZEN: Yeah, what if he's trying to punk us?

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.806
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu!

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.243
RADIZEN: Um hum, exactly. It could be an elaborate strategy

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.778
to psych us out for the next battle.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:02:59.979
ROXTOR: Kyu!

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.648
MIRA: I'd say that's a bit far fetched.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.851
DAN: Something weird's going on. That's for sure.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.353
DAN: But at some point, he's bound to turn up.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.389
REPTAK: [sigh] I sure hope so.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.828
FOREMAN: We really appreciate your help guys.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.132
We couldn't have made this kind of progress without you.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.200
FANGOID: It's only fair we pitch in!

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.669
FOREMAN: That's the spirit!

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.604
MODELISTA: Yeah, this is our home now too!

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.940
FOREMAN: Yup! And we're sure glad to have you!

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.011
[computer beeps and trills]

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.185
[mighty roar]

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.489
[mighty roars]

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:49.862
ALL: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.434
FOREMAN: That's it, pal! Take it over there!

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.472
MIRA: Here's all of the DNA data from those strange Mechtogan...

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.909
I was able to retrieve from your Bakumeter, Dan.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:08.314
MIRA: Coredegon, Slycerak, Exostriker and Mandibor.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.816
REPTAK: Those are the guys who took down Gunz?

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.586
MIRA: That's right. And once they combined the four became...

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.093
...Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.097
MIRA: When you take a close look at the configuration...

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.065
we see that they all fuse onto Coredegon.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.501
That would suggest that he is their leader.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.970
DAN: What's it matter if we sent them packing?

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.739
MARUCHO: We have to be concerned in case they,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.441
or other Mechtogan like them find their way back to Earth.

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.510
SHUN: Especially since they don't need Bakugan...

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:38.745
to summon them.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.746
MIRA: I have a theory on that.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.980
DAN and SHUN: Huh?

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.982
MIRA: There were anomalies in each of their DNA strands,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.885
which could be the reason why they don't require the Bakugan.

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.755
JAAKOR: Are you trying to say they were some kind of mutants?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.424
RADIZEN: Sure, that would make perfect sense after all.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.559
RADIZEN: Mechtogan by their very definition need to come...

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.062
from Bakugan. They're born of their excess energy,

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.698
so the fact that these ones don't means they've become...

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.866
something else.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.000
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu?

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.568
RADIZEN: No, I don't know how to explain where...

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:03.836
Dragonoid Destroyer came from.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.371
Maybe he's a different kind of mutation.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.773
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.942
MIRA: Well it's hard to say for sure but I did notice...

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.980
an interesting pattern after analyzing the battle data.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.017
MIRA: It seems that Dragonoid Destroyer's...

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.854
power level increases whenever Drago is on board.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:25.258
DRAGO: Hmmm, interesting.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.527
DRAGO: I knew I felt a surge of energy hit me...

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.761
during that fight.

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.130
MIRA: There's something else, it appears as though...

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.900
Dragonoid Destroyer has the ability to launch Bakugan...

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.768
from both shoulders.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:38.271
MARUCHO: So maybe Dragonoid Destroyer's powers...

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.873
can be used when launching Bakugan into battle.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.842
MIRA: There's still too much we don't know about...

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.578
Dragonoid Destroyer, I'll keep analyzing the data.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.580
DAN: Thanks, Mira. You're the best.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.517
MUTABRID: Now that they've escaped and left us behind...

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.987
here in the Doom Dimension, do you think Coredegon...

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.989
and the others were successful in their mission...

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.359
to exterminate the Bakugan on Earth?

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.394
KODOKOR: Perhaps that's a question better suited...

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.896
for Professor Worton.

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.734
BETADRON: Well Worton, speak up!

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.636
WORTON: The answer to your question and many others...

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.371
will come in due time.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.174
SPATTERIX: Enough with the wishy washy answers Professor.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.642
STRONK: Yeah, start talkin'!

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.912
BALISTA: Hmmm? Who goes there?

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.718
WISEMAN: You can call me Wiseman.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.354
KODOKOR: Huh?

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.567
TREMBLAR: What is a human doing here?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.037
WISEMAN: I've come to free you all from the shackles...

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.173
of the Doom Dimension.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.975
BALISTA: What did you say?

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:52.245
WISEMAN: The four Mechtogan that left you behind for dead...

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:55.681
were defeated by the Bakugan Battle Brawlers on Earth.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.216
MUTABRID: Battle Brawlers?

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.551
TREMBLAR: Who are they?

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.454
WISEMAN: They are a mighty band of battlers who some say

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.257
are the best in the universe. They are led by a human...

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.693
named Dan Kuso and his partner Bakugan Drago.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.530
WISEMAN: He is the descendent of the original...

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.598
Dragonoid Bakugan who was responsible...

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.767
for locking you up in the first place.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.269
BETADRON: Is that true?

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.305
BETADRON: Worton! Why didn't you tell us this?

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:21.374
WORTON: What good would it have done?

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.075
We still would have been trapped here,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.144
unable to do anything about it.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.280
SPATTERIX: You still shouldn't have kept it from us.

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:29.816
BETADRON: Tell us what you want, human!

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.819
WISEMAN: I have the ability to free you from this prison,

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.887
but first I need your help with something.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.089
WISEMAN: I want to resurrect the four Mechtogan that...

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.559
the Brawlers banished: Coredegon, Slycerak,

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.427
Exostriker and Mandibor.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.230
The enormous power they possess will be of great use to me.

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:47.166
STRONK: Why would we help the ones who left us here to rot?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.769
BETADRON: Yes, what's in it for us?

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:52.772
WISEMAN: Well, your freedom to start with,

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.308
and then of course there's the matter of the vengeance...

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.643
you can enact for being trapped here for so long.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.812
WISEMAN: Our motivations may be different but we have...

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:03.716
a common enemy, the Battle Brawlers.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.685
WISEMAN: I'm only making this offer once.

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:07.920
STRONK: I dunno. What do you think, Kodokor?

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.523
KODOKOR: Are you serious, Stronk? Terrible idea.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.058
Mechtogan can't be trusted.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.060
MUTABRID: But isn't it worth the risk if it means...

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.428
a chance to escape?

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.097
BETADRON: Yes. Freedom and the chance to avenge ourselves

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.601

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.801
they will give us back our power to split.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.270
COREDEGON: Shall we?

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.838
COREDEGON: Integrate!

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.077
Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.380
[heavy ground impact]

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.216
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [mighty roar]

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.818
MARUCHO: Whooooa!

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.121
JAAKOR and RADIZEN: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.155
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.890
JULIE: Oh no! Drago's hit!

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.293
C'mon buddy, you have to get back up!

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.527
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: It's no use!

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.196
He's no match for me!

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:38.864
RADIZEN: Oh no!

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:39.932
MARUCHO: Radizen!

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:40.999
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: You're not worthy...

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.334
to stand in our presence!

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.969
JAAKOR: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.071
SHUN: Jaakor!

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:51.810
DRAGO: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.213
DAN: Drago!

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.749
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: This is too easy. Why not even up...

00:16:56.782 --> 00:17:00.018
the fight by bringing out your precious Dragonoid Destroyer?

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.522
DAN: Hah! You're a glutton for punishment!

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:04.823
You ready, pal?

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:05.991
DRAGO: You bet!

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:07.826
SHUN: Dan, let's try using Dragonoid Destroyer's...

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.228
extra powers.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.864
MARUCHO: Yeah, we could unleash a jumping attack.

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:12.865
JAAKOR: Radizen! Let's do this!

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.366
RADIZEN: I'm with you all the way Jaakor.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.368
MIRA: Hold on, guys!

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:17.836
MIRA: It looks like Dragonoid Destroyer can...

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.605
only launch specific Bakugan.

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:23.075
MIRA: Jaakor should be fine, but it looks like Radizen...

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:24.476
isn't compatible.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.278
RADIZEN and MARUCHO: Whaaaaaat?

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:29.715
MIRA: Hang on... Looks like Reptak is good to go.

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.083
DAN: Reptak?

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:33.986
REPTAK: Dan, please! Let me fight!

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:36.054
REPTAK: I can be a big help!

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.322
DAN: I dunno...

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.691
MECHTAVIUS: What's the hold up? Are we fighting,

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:43.695
or have you lost your nerve, weaklings?

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.665
DAN: Yeah, alright c'mon Reptak!

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.369
Let's go!

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.772
DAN: Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.808
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Well, well...

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:00.145
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:03.549
SHUN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.151
DAN: Let's go, Drago!

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.187
DRAGO: Right!

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.156
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.324
DRAGO: Ride on!

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:14.359
DAN: Jumping attack!

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:17.896
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.264
REPTAK: Huuuuuuuuah!

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.899
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:26.004
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: You're going down!

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.309
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:31.677
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Oooomph!

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.278
JULIE: Oh yeeeeeaaaah!

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.114
MARUCHO: Way to go! Great job, Jaakor and Reptak!

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.750
RADIZEN: Oh man, will I ever get a shot?

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:42.087
MIRA: I can create a Battle Suit for Radizen!

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.425
MIRA: Coordinate code, set. Battle suit, Blasterate...

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.893
MIRA: ...transport!

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.230
MARUCHO: Whoa!

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.231
RADIZEN: Sweeeeeet!

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.333
MARUCHO: Let's go Radizen!

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:57.402
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.675
RADIZEN: Oh man! Check me out!

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:05.143
MARUCHO: Our turn to fight!

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.912
RADIZEN: You bet it is!

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.649
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [grunt, pain reax]

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:13.919
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Now you've made me really mad!

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:15.053
SHUN: Let's go!

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:18.157
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.858
SHUN: Moonlight Shadow Slash!

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.227
JAAKOR: [punching, exertion reax]

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.098
JAAKOR: Say goodnight!

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.334
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:31.169
MARUCHO: Now Radizen!

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.337
RADIZEN: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.972
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I'm not finished yet!

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.607
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.178
[explosion]

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.448
SLYCERAK: Something is wrong!

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:44.750
EXOSTRIKER: I'm burning up!

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:46.652
MANDIBOR: I can't move!

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.520
DRAGO: Ready, Dragonoid Destroyer?

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.989
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Leave it to me, my friend.

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.194
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Earth Revolver!

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.629
DAN: Keep it gooooooing!

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.298
DRAGO: Engaaaaaaaage!

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.302
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.438
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Not again!

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.107
SLYCERAK: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.878
EXOSTRIKER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.081
MANDIBOR: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:19.184
COREDEGON: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:31.863
WISEMAN: So the Nonets weren't enough to effectively take...

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:37.202
the control of the four Mechtogan.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.474
DAN: Hold it right there, creep!

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.176
DAN: [panting, running reax]

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.745
SHUN: Forget it. He's gone.

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:50.082
DAN: Oh man! Who was that dude, huh?

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.117
REPTAK: He said his name was Wiseman.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.354
REPTAK: Funny thing is, the way he launches Bakugan...

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:58.123
is exactly like Gunz.

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:09.568
DAN: It's been several days since Gunz disappeared

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.403
during the battle with the Mechtogan from

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.705
the Doom Dimension. Reptak is totally freaked out,

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.941
and worried for his friend. We've welcomed him

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:18.310
into the gang and I've even partnered with him in battle.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.512
It certainly hasn't helped that that creep Wiseman

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:23.715
is causing trouble with his sinister Nonet Bakugan crew.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.084
I don't know why, but Reptak seems convinced that somehow

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.620
he's connected to Gunz, but I think he's imagining it.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:30.989
Either way, he's a problem! You should tune in

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:33.892
to see what I'm talking about. This dude is some serious evil,

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.828
I'm telling you. But he's still no match for the me and Drago!

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:46.905
