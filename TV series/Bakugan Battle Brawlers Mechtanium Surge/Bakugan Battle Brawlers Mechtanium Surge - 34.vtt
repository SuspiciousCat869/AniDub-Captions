WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.108
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.276
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.446
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded by these mysterious and

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.216
evil Mechtogan who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.317
Coredegon

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.451
Slycerak

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.652
Exostriker

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.287
And Mandibor were their names.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.289
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.258
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.894
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.663
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.866
So we fought back, because no one is going to

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.468
take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.911
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.355
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.457 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.498
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.973
SPATTERIX: Are you saying you've never stopped to ask...

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.375
yourself that question?

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.445
TREMBLAR: About Wiseman's true identity? No.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.679
SPATTERIX: But we're fighting for someone...

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.014
we know nothing about!

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.882
SPATTERIX: We don't even know what species he is.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.219
The way he teleports himself suggests he's not human.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.622
BETADRON: Spatterix is right. He may be humanoid in form,

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.292
but who knows what hides behind that mask of his.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.760
BALISTA: Do you have any thoughts...

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.295
on the subject, Professor?

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.730
WORTON: I have heard stories of a special ability card

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.366
that allows holders to teleport themselves at will.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.370
I had thought them to be fairytales but perhaps Wiseman

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.506
is in possession of such a card.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.343
Be that as it may I know nothing of his true identity.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.378
SPATTERIX: I don't think we should go any further...

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.148
with this guy until we know more about him.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.751
BALISTA: I agree. What do you say Betadron?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.622
BALISTA: Every time we have fought along side Wiseman...

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.358
we haven't been able to defeat Drago.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.962
Each time he summons Coredegon and the rest of the Mechtogan...

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:13.500
their strength continues to grow and we wind up with nothing.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.168
BETADRON: Spit it out, Balista.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.471
BALISTA: I think Wiseman has been using us and if we don't...

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.640
put our foot down, then we're the fools.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.676
BETADRON: Once again, you're being shortsighted Balista.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.212
Don't forget that it was Wiseman who freed us from

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.282
the Doom Dimension. Without him, we would have never had...

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.519
the opportunity to taste the vengeance you speak of.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.221
BETADRON: But now that we are free, perhaps it's time...

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.358
that the tables were turned and that we use Wiseman.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.832
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Gunz Blazing

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.005
MIRA: I can't believe I'm still here, Runo.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:55.008
MIRA: The doctors say the tests are taking longer to process...

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.443
because they've never treated someone like me from...

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.346
the planet Vestal, but I keep telling them I'm totally fine.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.651
RUNO: Be patient. By the way, I found this Bakumeter...

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.488
when I was cleaning the lab, do you know who it belongs to?

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.491
MIRA: Let me see... Oh, that's a prototype I was

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.093
working on for a new Bakumeter.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.262
MIRA: It's going to be pretty cool because it will allow you

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.097
to summon battle suits directly without...

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.400
the help of a remote operator.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.003
RUNO: Whoa, that's cool but does that put me out of a job?

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.005
MIRA: Haha! Don't worry.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.774
MIRA: There's still plenty of other stuff...

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.876
you can help me out with.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.658
KATO: Whaaaaaat?

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.093
KATO: Watch ouuuuut!

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:51.264
KATO: [gasping] What are you doing?

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:54.601
GUNZ: Can you please help me? [groan]

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:57.370
KATO: [gasp] Master Gunz!

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.739
Oh no! Are you okay?

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.010
RUNO: Here you go, Gunz.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.578
GUNZ: Thank-you.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.381
GUNZ: [sipping]

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.383
MARUCHO: It's really great to see you back.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:13.419
We were all pretty worried about you.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.554
GUNZ: [gasp] MARUCHO: Huh?

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.356
DAN: Hey! Check it out! It's Gunz!

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.590
REPTAK: You're alive!

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.759
GUNZ: Oh, hey Reptak!

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.327
GUNZ: I'm sorry I worried you.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.297
REPTAK: It's okay. I'm just glad you're safe.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.367
GUNZ: Dan. I heard you took care of Reptak while I was gone.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.603
I really appreciate it. I owe you one.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:34.007
DAN: So where the heck were you dude?

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.810
GUNZ: Well...the last thing I remember was being in...

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:41.080
Battle Stadium and getting blasted.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.685
GUNZ: And after that, it's a total and complete blank.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.153
DRAGO: Until when?

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.355
MARUCHO: Apparently, his memory only started to come back...

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.026
just before Kato almost hit him with the car.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.497
DAN: Alright then, well, I gotta go take care of some stuff.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.136
SHUN: Ah, Dan! DAN: Ya.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.105
SHUN: Wait up! You were acting awfully strange back there.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.141
Is there something you're not telling us?

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:14.080
RADIZEN: Whaaat? You think Gunz is really Wiseman?

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:17.250
MARUCHO: Would you keep it down, already!

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.585
DRAGO: We're not positive yet.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.188
DAN: Reptak mentioned it to us a while back,

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:25.892
but I didn't want to say anything until we knew for sure.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.728
JAAKOR: Do you have any evidence at all?

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.096
DRAGO: Not exactly.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.298
DRAGO: All we have is Reptak insisting that Wiseman's...

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.601
battle moves are identical to Gunz's. He's convinced.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.337
SHUN: Well he'd know.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.772
GUNZ: Hey guys, so what's going on up here, huh?

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.607
You having some kind of secret meeting?

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.876
MARUCHO: [gasp] No! No secret at all!

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.347
MARUCHO: [laughter] Uh...

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.515
GUNZ: What's wrong, huh Reptak?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.185
DAN: Nothing's wrong.

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.954
REPTAK: Actually, Gunz... GUNZ: Huh?

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:57.557
REPTAK: ...there is something I wanted to ask you.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.624
DAN: Huh?

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.160
RUNO: Dan! Our sensors have picked up Wiseman!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.495
DAN: No way!

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.230
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [terrified screams]

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.305
DAN: This doesn't make any sense.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:15.475
The sensors are picking up Wiseman, but Gunz is right here.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.711
.DRAGO: Maybe Gunz isn't Wiseman

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.814
GUNZ: So what did you want to ask me?

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.884
REPTAK: Uh, never mind. It was nothing.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.920
SHUN: We should go. Wiseman's going to be looking for us.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.388
DAN: Right!

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:33.292
DAN: Gunz! If you're up to it, it would be a big help...

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.762
if you and Reptak battled alongside us.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.563
GUNZ: Sure. No problem, argh!

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.166
DAN: Hmmm? SHUN: [grunt]

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.201
GUNZ: I guess I spoke too soon. Sorry fellas, but I think it's

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.738
probably best for everyone if I sit this one out. Thank-you.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:47.140
DAN: If you say so.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.575
Let's go, Reptak. You're coming with us.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.878
MARUCHO: Hurry guys! Who knows what kind of destruction...

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.579
Wiseman may be causing.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:59.919
DAN: Haven't you learned your lesson?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.357
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.959
DAN: Baku Skyraider, Jump!

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.262
Go Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid!

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.330
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.936
SHUN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.938
SHUN: Baku Skyraider, Jump!

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.441
Go Ventus Jaakor!

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.843
JAAKOR: [rising mighty roar]

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:29.248
JAAKOR: I hope you're prepared for the punishment...

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.616
coming your way.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.518
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.153
MARUCHO: Bakugan stand!

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.155
MARUCHO: Go Aquos Radizen!

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.026
RADIZEN: Oh yeah! Radizen is in the house...

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:44.263
with Drago and Jaakor. You are in some serious trouble.

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.608
RUNO: All the Bakumeters are powered up.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.777
RUNO: I'd better go prep the Battle Suits.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.720
DAN: What's wrong? Why don't you launch your Bakugan?

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.289
SHUN: Hang on, Dan. Something's strange here.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.292
MARUCHO: Yeah. Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.361
DAN: [angry grunt] I've had enough of this.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.963
DAN: If you're just gonna stand there like that...

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.831
I'm gonna rip that mask off your face!

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.167
DAN: [angry grunt] Whoa! What?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.703
SHUN: He went right through him! But how?

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.771
MARUCHO: I don't get it!

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.641
DRAGO: Hey! What's that?

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:32.945
DAN: Huuuuh?

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.413
RADIZEN: What the...? JAAKOR: This is bad.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.515
MARUCHO: Dan! Why would Wiseman waste his time...

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.950
with a trick like that?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.485
DAN: Guess he wanted to distract us.

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:40.853
SHUN: So it's a trap!

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.555
DAN: He's going after...

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:43.756
GUNZ: Ruuuuuuno!

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.559
RUNO: [gasp] GUNZ: That is your name right?

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.727
REPTAK: Try attacking now!

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.230
The blowback will take out your pod as well!

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.232
DAN: Way to go, nice one, Reptak!

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:22.901
We'll go after Tremblar's body!

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:26.638
DRAGO: Ready to finish this, Dragonoid Destroyer?

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:28.140
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: You bet, Drago!

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.609
Time to make the enemy hurt!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.579
DRAGO: Force Cannon Fire!

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.514
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Haaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:38.150
DAN: Ability activate!

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.952
Harvey Cannon!

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.158
WISEMAN: [angry grunt] Ability activate!

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.493
WISEMAN: Grudge Cannon!

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:51.330
TREMBLAR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.731
TREMBLAR: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:53.765
REPTAK: Hmmph.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.639
REPTAK: Are you ready to come to your senses, Gunz?

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:07.212
WISEMAN: [chuckle into open mouth laugher]

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:10.082
DAN: [gasp] [angry grunt]

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:12.784
DAN: Come here! [gasp]

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.088
DAN: Maaaaan!

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.393
SHUN: So it was true? Gunz was really Wiseman...

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:23.395
this entire time behind our backs?

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:24.696
DAN: Yup.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.632
REPTAK: I told you guys.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.101
MARUCHO: But still, it doesn't explain to us what...

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:31.203
his true motives are you guys.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.505
DRAGO: His demeanour is so different now.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.942
Perhaps he's been brainwashed, somehow.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:39.444
REPTAK: That would make sense,

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:41.580
because he sure isn't acting himself.

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:44.149
RADIZEN: But who would do that? Oh man, this mystery...

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.984
keeps getting deeper and deeper!

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.153
REPTAK: It doesn't matter. All I know is I have to get...

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.489
the real Gunz back and that means taking down...

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.791
this new Wiseman persona of his.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.693
REPTAK: And I'll do whatever it takes.

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:57.296
Do you hear me? Whatever it takes!

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.964
JAAKOR: You're part of our team now, Reptak.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.099
So we're behind you all the way.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:03.802
RUNO: Hey.

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:06.905
KATO: Please accept my sincere apologies, gentlemen.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:10.609
DAN: Apologies for what? RUNO: Uh...

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:15.514
SHUN: The trick that Gunz played on us with the Wiseman decoy...

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.417
was so he could steal the Battle Suits from the lab.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.851
He took them, Dan. They're gone.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.887
DAN: No way, dude!

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.566
BETADRON: There you are, Wiseman.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.868
I've been looking all over for you.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.737
WISEMAN: What is it, Betadron?

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.040
BETADRON: The others have questions about your identity.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.643
WISEMAN: [chuckle] I don't see how that's...

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:47.613
even relevant at this moment.

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:51.416
BETADRON: Don't ignore me. Who are you?

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:57.155
WISEMAN: My name is Wiseman and I'm here to bring an end...

00:20:57.189 --> 00:21:00.125
to the peaceful coexistence between Bakugan and Humans.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.962
WISEMAN: [evil chuckle]

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.034
DAN: Mira was finally well enough to be discharged

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.103
from the hospital, but unfortunately we only had

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:14.006
bad news waiting for her. That creep Gunz,

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.141
I mean Wiseman, I mean whatever you wanna call him,

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:18.377
he'd tricked us and had stolen the Battle Suits.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.579
And what's worse is he did it right under our noses.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.381
Now the pressure was on to get them back before

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.616
he could use them on us. We headed to the mountains

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.852
to do some emergency battle training but just as we

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.321
got started Wiseman and the Nonets showed up

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.423
and started causing their usual brand of trouble.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.659
Tune in to check out the heavy battle action.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:36.395
Poor Radizen still has the shakes over it!

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:46.471
