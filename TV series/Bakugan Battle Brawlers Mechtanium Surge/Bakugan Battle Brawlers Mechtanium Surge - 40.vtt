WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.308
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.377
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.278
But then, out of nowhere, we were invaded

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.614
by these mysterious and evil Mechtogan,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.383
who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.620
Coredegon, Slycerak, Exostriker, and Mandibor

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.022
were their names, and leading them was

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.556
this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.525
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.860
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.762
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.864
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.198
So we fought back,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.167
because no one is going to take our freedom,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.702
not now, not ever!

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.838
\u266a What are you going to do

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.208
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.244
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.347
\u266a Got to give it your all

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.450
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.018
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.887
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.757
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.560
\u266a You've got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.563
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:07.267
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.535
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Okay, battle fans.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.070
You've seen each of these battlers

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.439
destroy every opponent that's crossed their paths.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.141
And now, they're going head to head against each other.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.876
Who will be the last man standing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.279
in the battle of Dan versus Gunz?

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.980
GUNZ: You're going down, Kuso.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:21.981
Ready, Reptak?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.317
REPTAK: Yes.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.354
(Grunting)

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.924
Gunz, we can do this.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.393
GUNZ: Yes. It's just like we promised each other.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.894
Together, we'll be champions.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.596
This is our time, Reptak!

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.765
(Static squealing)

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.800
Huh?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.139
Where a-am I?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.342
W-What happened to me?

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.547
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.350
in \"Gunz Lives.\"

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.387
(Grunting)

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.392
(Grunting)

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.262
(Grunting)

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:13.299
(Panting)

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.936
I don't understand.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.005
I was fighting with Kuso, and then...

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.306
(Grunting)

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.908
What's going on here?

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.278
I got to find out.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.181
Ah!

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.649
Right.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:33.553
It was those Mechtogan.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.124
WORTON: Your last battle sent the brawlers tumbling off a cliff

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.292
and into the ocean.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.660
There's been no sign of them.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:41.995
No one could have survived that.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.297
So why are we still searching the island?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.698
Because, Professor,

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.801
the brawlers have the resilience of cockroaches.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.537
I won't believe that they're gone

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.307
until I see all of the bodies.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.843
One more question, Wiseman.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.612
I haven't seen Balista in a while.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.714
Do you have idea where he might be?

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.116
WISEMAN: No idea.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.786
Perhaps he got his nose stuck somewhere it didn't belong.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:17.096
\u266a

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.432
Hmm?

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.367
(Grunting) Ah!

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.336
I'm surprised you have so much energy

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.837
after such a long nap.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.072
(Grunting)

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.674
Are you the one who brought me here, you punk?

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.242
Come on! Answer me now!

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.743
I said answer me!

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.845
Ah!

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.247
(Wiseman laughing)

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.951
WISEMAN: Let me ask you a question first, Gunz.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.958
Do I...

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.093
Huh?

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:51.130
...look familiar to you?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.068
But that's... impossible.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.402
No way!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.472
I understand your confusion, Gunz.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:03.810
I can only imagine how shocking it must be

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:07.680
to come face to face with your doppelganger like this.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.782
But perhaps it's better if you just accept

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.517
that the truth is something too great

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.621
for your puny human mind to comprehend.

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.689
GUNZ: My... human mind?

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.658
WISEMAN: The one that created me.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.694
GUNZ: I'm going to take down Kuso and his partner, Drago,

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.596
no matter what it takes.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.099
So, do you remember that, Gunz?

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.100
How did you...

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.668
Those may have been only thoughts,

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.137
but they were so deeply rooted in anger and jealousy

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.139
that their dark energy seeped out of you.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.776
But that same energy was not content to just be.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.212
So in turn, it created me.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.780
You're wrong! It's true.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:43.583
I... I wanted to beat him,

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.953
but not because I was angry or jealous of him.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.656
My intentions weren't based in anything negative.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.324
WISEMAN: Then explain to me how I got here.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.359
Huh? Quiet!

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.294
I don't know how you got inside my head,

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.596
but you don't know me!

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.764
Huh?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.798
Wait!

00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.866
Where's Reptak?

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.267
What have you done with him?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.404
To be quite honest with you, I don't really know where he is.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:07.040
Feel free to take a look around the island if you like.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.041
(Growling)

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.876
But don't be surprised

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.878
if your old partner is unhappy to see you.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.881
(Gunz growling)

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.749
Good luck with your search, Gunz.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.184
You'll be back soon enough,

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.287
once you learn that there's no hope for you.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.189
(Laughing)

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.127
DAN: Ah, man. I can't believe it.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.364
That must have been at least a 100-foot drop we took.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.132
I'm just thankful that Kato was able

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.634
to scoop us up with the submarine,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.236
or we'd still be treading water.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.638
I've got Skytruss and Orbeum

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.139
running more recon on the island,

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.342
and apparently, the Nonets are still looking for us.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.744
If they're looking for us,

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.279
we need to be even more prepared

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.980
for the next attack against them.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.349
Hey, Reptak.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.750
What's wrong, buddy?

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.852
Huh? Oh.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.354
I was just thinking that pretty soon,

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:58.825
we're going to be facing off against Gunz again.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.993
Are you okay with that?

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.262
Whatever. Forget that dude, okay?

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.597
What?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.232
DAN: I know he was your partner at one time,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.433
but something flipped his switch,

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.135
and now, he's fighting on the side of evil.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.270
We'll try once more to turn him back, but if we can't,

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:16.075
then we have to put him out of business for good. Alright?

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.244
Dan, do you have any idea

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.880
how much the old Gunz looked up to and admired you?

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.082
What? You crazy, dude?

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.085
All I remember is that he couldn't stand me.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.855
That's why he was always challenging me.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:29.856
When Gunz first joined

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.958
the professional Bakugan brawling league,

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.226
he was an undefeated rookie

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.428
who had already made quite a name for himself.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.429
He was the one to watch.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.697
Sound familiar?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.233
Yeah, I think I remember hearing something like that.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.969
Gunz always modeled himself after you.

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:45.338
So you can imagine how excited he was when he finally

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:47.140
got to battle against his hero.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.641
But you defeated him pretty badly,

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:51.244
and... well, he was crushed.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.479
Huh?

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.481
GUNZ: (Growling) This stinks!

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:56.849
Gunz!

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.951
GUNZ: He took me down like a total noob.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:02.155
I looked like a fool in front of everyone!

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:04.223
Forget this, Reptak. Who needs it?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.224
I quit, dude.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.193
REPTAK: Wait!

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:12.398
Gunz...

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.668
I'm just... so ticked off.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:16.936
I'm not a punk.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.838
I've got some mad skills. But he took me down

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.706
like I'd never fought a battle before.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.442
Kuso totally humiliated me. Both of us.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.478
We got schooled in front of a packed arena.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.880
How do you come back from that, huh? Tell me.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.282
We swear an oath to each other

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.117
to keep going, keep getting better

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.586
until we're the best anyone's ever seen.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:34.587
Reptak...

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.522
What do you say?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:40.293
Are you with me?

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.028
You bet.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.097
I'm sorry I lost my head there like that, pal.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.165
You know what?

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.568
We could beat those punks.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.303
We just need a little more practice,

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.370
a little more experience.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.306
And in no time, we'll be able to take down

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.242
anyone who dares to cross our paths!

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.277
(Clinking)

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.282
REPTAK: And with that, we were back in action.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.651
We trained around the clock, nonstop.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.820
Every battle we fought, we won,

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.889
quickly working our way up the ranks.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.024
And before we knew it, it was our turn

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:15.828
to face off against you and Drago again.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.231
I'd never seen Gunz so excited.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.867
After all our hard work, he was getting a second chance

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.903
to go against his hero and number one rival.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.371
The only difference was, this time,

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.040
he was not facing you as an underling or a rookie

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.275
but as an equal.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.978
It was going to be his proudest moment,

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.913
which is what doesn't make sense.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.482
Gunz wouldn't have just left without seeing things through.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.651
DAN: Well, if we ever get the real Gunz back,

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.853
maybe we can have a rematch!

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.054
It's the least we can do

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:44.457
for the loyalty you've shown us, Reptak.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.658
REPTAK: Thanks, Dan.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:49.962
You have no idea how much that means to me.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.864
MIRA: Good news, everybody.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.700
Using the data files I had, I've been able to rebuild

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.770
new versions of the battle suits Wiseman stole.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.439
That means our arsenal is whole once again.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.041
Wicked. Let's head back to the hideout.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:05.912
Only this time, I say we kick down their front door.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.248
ALL: Right!

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.851
RUNO: Okay. Coordinate codes are set!

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.085
Battle suits.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.655
Defendtrix, teleport to Drago!

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:19.759
Combustoid, teleport to Reptak!

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.995
Fortatron, teleport to Jaakor!

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:26.399
Clawbruk, teleport to Radizen!

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:32.571
\u266a

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.073
RUNO: Connection complete.

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:35.775
Battle suit systems are powered up,

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.711
and synchro rates are 100 percent.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.112
Good luck, guys.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:43.115
I suppose this is as good a place as any to start.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.384
I'm sure they already know we're here.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:49.355
Let's go, then.

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:53.059
REPTAK: I'm coming for you, Gunz.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.029
(Drinking)

00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:05.071
\u266a

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.839
What that guy said to me can't be true.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.741
No way.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.477
He didn't come from me. I don't have that kind of darkness.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.614
Could I be that evil, deep inside?

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.350
Ah, who knows?

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.752
I'm just fed up.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.087
(Massive footsteps approaching)

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.088
Hmm?

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.789
(Massive footsteps approaching)

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.825
Huh?

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:31.530
Drago. What's he doing here?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.402
And Reptak, too?

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:39.438
Oh. Reptak!

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:44.577
(Gunz panting)

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.213
Reptak!

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.614
Huh?

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.282
Hey, check it out.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.118
Wiseman!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.386
Dan!

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.420
DAN: We came to settle this

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.656
once and for all, pal!

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.491
What are you talking about, Kuso?

00:10:58.524 --> 00:10:59.558
Hey, Reptak,

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.627
what's going on here, huh?

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.863
Why are you with these guys?

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:06.632
Gunz?

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.000
Don't believe him, Reptak!

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:10.836
It's just more of Wiseman's tricks!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.605
Who's Wiseman?

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:15.574
Must be... that other guy.

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.977
I'm not him! I'm Gunz, Kuso!

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.812
Yeah, right! We know!

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.481
You and Wiseman are the same guy!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.951
No, that's-- that's not true, guys! No!

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:29.088
There's some other guy out there with a face just like mine.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.923
Is that who you're talking about?

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.358
Is he Wiseman?

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.759
DAN: Yeah, nice try, buddy.

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.328
But we're not falling for your innocent Gunz act again.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.596
You got that?

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.964
It's not an act!

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.266
Well, then, prove it to us.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.467
(Growling)

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.969
Go on. If you're for real, give us a reason

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:48.574
to believe you really are who you say you are.

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:49.875
Come on, pal!

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:50.876
REPTAK: Huh?

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.078
GUNZ: We're partners, man!

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.646
If anyone knows for sure that I'm not lying,

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:54.914
it's going to be you!

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.949
Can you tell these guys I'm the real Gunz?

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:58.651
Come on, dude. It's me here.

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.086
You know it, right?

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.727
REPTAK: Gunz, if it is really you,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.628
then let me ask...

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:13.499
Do you remember the oath we swore to each other?

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:17.203
Huh? The oath?

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.504
REPTAK: If you're Gunz,

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:21.173
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:26.212
GUNZ: Forget this, Reptak. Who needs it?

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.213
We'll be able to take down

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.848
anyone who dares to cross our path!

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:29.849
(Static squealing)

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.584
Ah!

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.952
REPTAK: Gunz!

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.187
I can only see bits of it.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:38.557
My brain's so fuzzy.

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.360
Why can't I remember?

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:44.530
What did that guy do to mess up my head so badly?

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.866
How am I going to convince Reptak?

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:49.502
What if I can't?

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.103
Please-- Whoa!

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.371
--you got to believe me.

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:55.174
(Snapping)

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:57.409
Ah, Reptak!

00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:00.346
Oh, no.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.081
Not this place!

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.149
(Groaning)

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:06.185
Not again!

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.321
DAN: Don't believe his lies, Reptak!

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.456
Stick with us!

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:14.026
DAN: Keep your focus, Jaakor.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.795
The final battle is near.

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.430
Huh? What?

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.232
Huh.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.634
So Wiseman and Gunz

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:24.136
really are different people, then?

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.172
WISEMAN: Yes. And now that his partner Bakugan

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:27.373
has turned his back on him,

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.408
I'm sure that I can add him to my list of allies

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.510
who also want to destroy the brawlers.

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:34.613
REPTAK: You're going to pay for this!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.081
(Grunting)

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.118
WISEMAN: Bakugan brawl!

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:42.721
Rise, Subterra Stronk!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.390
Ventus Worton!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:47.159
Pyrus Spatterix!

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.695
(Grunting)

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:52.164
Battle suits ready!

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.532
Combustoid!

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.100
Now, Clawbruk!

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.136
Fortatron!

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:07.046
\u266a

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.749
Since we're fighting with the same battle suits on both sides,

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:14.019
this should determine who the superior battler is,

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:16.222
once and for all!

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.690
This should be a good distraction

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.958
for everyone involved

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.961
until it's time for me to reveal my big surprise.

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.128
SPATTERIX: Let's do this.

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:24.163
(Roaring)

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.164
Whoa!

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:26.332
(Roaring)

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.734
Dan, we'll deal with the Gunz thing later.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.736
Let's focus on this battle!

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:32.705
Uh... yeah, right.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.706
Come on, let's go,

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:34.940
Drago and Reptak!

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:37.977
Ready! On it!

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.115
Radizen?

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.516
Ready, boss!

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.218
Here we go!

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.953
(Grunting)

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.555
SPATTERIX: Watch it, you clown.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.657
That blast of yours nearly took me out.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.692
I'm on your side, remember?

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.160
You're welcome.

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:56.929
RADIZEN: I hate to break up your lovers' quarrel,

00:14:56.962 --> 00:15:00.132
but can we get back to the battle, please?

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.200
Ah!

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.201
Ah!

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.836
Heads up, Radizen!

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:06.672
WORTON: I'm going to crush you!

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.641
RADIZEN: You wish, lizard lips.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.842
Now, Stronk!

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.044
STRONK: Yeah, yeah. Keep your shirt on.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.046
Ah!

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.615
Oh!

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.284
Radizen, Marucho!

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:20.219
Let's get in there!

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.553
You're going down.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.589
(Growling)

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:29.695
REPTAK: I can't believe you turned me against my old partner, Wiseman.

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.997
I'm going to make you regret the day you were born.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.900
I promise. Hah!

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:36.502
(Grunting)

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.237
Get your head in the game, Reptak.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.772
Sorry, Jaakor.

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.575
He's right. I have to treat Wiseman like any other opponent.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.611
Revenge only clouds your mind.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:46.845
I'll make things right with Gunz

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.113
after we win.

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:51.984
Bring it on, Spatterix!

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:53.452
You'll have to be faster than that!

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:57.923
Ah!

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.024
Give up yet?

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.160
In your dreams!

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.294
That's it.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.264
All of you, keep battling.

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:08.400
Yes, yes.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:11.937
It won't be very long now.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.973
Wiseman, how long are you going to make me wait?

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.108
I want in!

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:18.577
Ha! Very well.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.814
Bakugan brawl!

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:24.016
Rise, Darkus Betadron,

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.718
Darkus Kodokor,

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.419
Darkus Mutabrid,

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:31.423
and Haos Tremblar!

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:33.792
(Roaring)

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.795
(Roaring)

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:43.702
Bakugan unite!

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.438
You're finished, Drago!

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:47.506
Ready?

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.674
You bet.

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.609
United ability activate!

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:52.144
Demille Panzer!

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.713
Smile, Drago!

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.049
Ah!

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:59.084
(Crashing)

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:04.823
Drago!

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.024
I'm okay.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.560
I'm not finished with you yet!

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:10.029
How do you like this action?

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.164
I'm going to wear you down, old man.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:16.201
I've got all night to do this dance, pal.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.638
Ah!

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:22.341
Huh?

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.510
Hold on.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.513
Combat mode. Deployment complete.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.015
Spare this, you! Hah!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.517
Ability activate!

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.286
Lagrange Shield!

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.355
Ability activate!

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.223
Goliath Floogle!

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:42.261
TREMBLAR: Target locked on!

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:45.964
(Shouting)

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.166
(Shun whistling)

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:50.636
SHUN: Skytruss, Orbeum!

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.737
(Whistling)

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.172
Over here!

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.773
(Whistling)

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.108
You rang, Master Shun.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:57.609
We're ready to rock.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.078
Hit them hard, guys!

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.079
Right. Yes, sir.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:02.514
Bakugan brawl!

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:05.984
Baku Sky Raider go!

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:09.088
(Roaring)

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.223
Ability activate!

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.292
Full Moon Wave Burning!

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.893
Hah!

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.562
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.565
Supreme Flame!

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:24.837
\u266a

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.971
Shun!

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:29.575
(Panting)

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:34.580
(Panting)

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:36.915
What's wrong?

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.351
You're looking a little tired.

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:42.454
You sure you've got enough juice to continue?

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.523
Quit running your mouth, Drago.

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.425
I know you're just stalling!

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.528
DRAGO: Don't you understand that Wiseman is just using you?

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.830
He'll destroy you as soon as this is all over.

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:53.098
Do you really think

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:55.901
you can talk me into coming over to your side?

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.636
The loathing the Nonets have for you

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.505
is like nothing you've ever known.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:02.541
We can never be turned! Not ever!

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:03.542
Watch out!

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:05.177
DRAGO: Hang on!

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.547
Get back here!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.451
Just a little more now.

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.419
(Roaring)

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.355
(Roaring)

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:17.356
What?

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:18.423
(Roaring)

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:21.126
Hey, if that's the way you want it...

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:24.897
Ah!

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:29.902
(Roaring)

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.705
(Crashing)

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:40.679
\u266a

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:41.880
We did it!

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.882
You certainly did, Dan.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:45.350
Huh?

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.952
REPTAK: What?

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:51.156
At last, I finally have the energy I need.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.491
ALL: Oh!

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:55.027
COREDEGON: Thanks for all your hard work, Nonets.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.262
I couldn't have done it without you.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:01.300
But now, you're all excused!

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.370
(Laughing)

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:14.346
\u266a

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:18.383
(Laughing)

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:23.388
What do you mean, we're excused?

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:25.390
What about our vengeance?

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:26.825
I don't believe it.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.794
Wiseman is...

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.796
DRAGO: Coredegon.

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:33.031
This just gets weirder and weirder.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.733
You said it, pal!

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:38.870
COREDEGON: The time has finally come...

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:43.442
for me to fulfil my destiny!

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.677
Ah!

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:48.680
Ah!

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.153
COREDEGON: I suggest you all say your final goodbyes,

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:56.989
because in a few moments,

00:20:57.022 --> 00:21:00.626
the world is going to burn!

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.661
(Roaring)

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:09.935
DAN: I thought things were confusing when we thought

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.336
Wiseman and Gunz were the same person.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.338
Turns out, not only are they different, but Wiseman

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.240
is actually Coredegon in disguise.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.441
And now that he's fully resurrected

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:17.709
and charged up to the max,

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.411
he's determined to destroy everything.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.647
Too bad for him, we're not going down without a fight!

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.048
But he's so determined to crush us,

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.983
he brings in all of his slimy Mechtogan buddies

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.318
to help him out. You got to tune in

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.986
just to see how serious things get.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.188
This is our most intense battle ever.

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.391
If we lose to Coredegon and the rest of his posse,

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.925
it's lights out not only for us

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:37.129
but for the rest of the universe!

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:47.172
\u266a
