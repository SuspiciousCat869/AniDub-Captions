00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.510
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.978
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.648
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.584
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.086
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.355
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.091
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.463
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.298
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.368
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.775
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.248
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:57.390
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.598
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.839
DAN: So you're alive, huh?

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.840
DAN: Barodius?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.074
DRAGO: What?

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.243
BARODIUS: No. Barodius is dead and now...

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.079
the mighty Mag Mel lives.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:23.216
BARODIUS: It's time for you, to say goodnight, Kuso.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.220
MARUCHO: Too much has happened to explain...

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.988
everything right now. What we need to focus on...

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.024
is getting the Battlers trapped inside of here,

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.793
out as soon as possible, but I'm going to need your help.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.994
MARUCHO: Here's the plan...

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.603
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Interspace Armageddon

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.476
MARUCHO: I'm going to completely delete...

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.444
Bakugan Interspace!

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.379
MARUCHO: If Mag Mel has been using the energy...

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.782
from the Bakugan Battles to fuel his re-birth,

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.084
and is now planning to use Interspace...

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.320
as his portal to Earth then we need to find a way...

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.522
to render him helpless, and the best way to do this is...

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:06.426
to wipe out Interspace. I know it sounds drastic,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.995
but we have to eradicate any chance of him getting loose...

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.630
and taking over Earth.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.365
ROBIN: Well, it makes sense.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.067
BEN: But what about us then?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.903
JACK: Yeah Marucho, won't we be wiped out too?

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.905
MARUCHO: As we speak, my father and Kato...

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.641
are working with a team of top engineers and programmers...

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.744
to reboot one of the emergency access points.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.746
MARUCHO: Once they're successful we'll slip through,

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.215
and back to Earth. And then when we're all safe,

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.051
we'll initiate the deletion program.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.486
TRISTAR: We better move quickly and quietly,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.455
otherwise Mag Mel might get hip to the plan,

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.756
and sneak out too.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.758
SHUN: There's a chance that because he's lurking...

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.261
in Bakugan Interspace's dark reverse dimension,

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.430
by deleting the Main Interspace we might...

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.833
RAFE: I see! You're thinking we can wipe him out...

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.202
right along with Interspace aren't you?

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.740
MARUCHO: Maybe, but either way the deletion program is...

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:58.011
so massive, once we launch it, it can't be stopped.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:02.148
MARUCHO: There's just no turning back this time, everyone okay?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.284
DRAGO: Are you sure about this Marucho?

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.452
Interspace is your creation after all.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.421
Can you really just give it up so easily?

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.456
MARUCHO: This isn't a decision I made easily.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.926
Bakugan Interspace was a labour of love,

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.830
but unfortunately, I just don't see anyway around this.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.534
Right now it's our only choice...sadly.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.404
DAN: Don't worry. We'll get rid of Mag Mel,

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:27.106
then help you rebuild Interspace better than ever.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.541
SHUN: Mmm-hmm.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:34.147
MARUCHO: Operation Interspace Armageddon is now a go!

MARUCHO: I read you loud and clear, Dan. What's up?

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.182
DAN: We're under attack. We'll keep the Chaos Bakugan...

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.517
occupied while you guys gather the remaining battlers,

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.986
and get them to the access point.

All the work that went into building this place...

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:53.159
and they just let it go up in smoke just like that.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.496
DYLAN: Well, let's see if it's as easy to leave...

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.731
Interspace behind as they think it is.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.299

The last remaining Battlers in Interspace.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.282
for real this time you guys?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.685

DAN: And there goes part two of the plan.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.251
MARUCHO: That's right. Which means we only have...

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:55.488
about twenty-minutes until deletion is complete.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.757

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.579
it wouldn't have been very hard for them...

MARUCHO: Fight back, guys!

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.242
Just be quick about it. We're running out of time.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.113
KYOSUKE: Marucho?

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:13.753

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:16.689
CHRIS: There's no way we can fight them off this time!

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.091
TAYLEAN: We're outmatched by all of these Mechtogan.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.627
SHUN: Not for long!

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.396

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:37.803
DYLAN: Well, well! The surprises never stop in this place!

00:10:58.724 --> 00:10:59.959
DAN: Who's that?

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.495
RAFE: I don't know. I haven't got the slightest clue.

HELIOS: [laughter]

ALL: [gasp]

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:08.701
HELIOS: I suppose I should introduce you to my Mechtogan.

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:13.005
SPECTRA: This is becoming a habit with you Battle Brawlers.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.176
DAN: Spectra!

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.911

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.695
HELIOS: Crush them like insects, Slynix!

HELIOS: Battle Warrior!

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.885

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.194

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:12.131

HELIOS: What's happening?

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.846
SPECTRA: Helios!

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.682
DYLAN: Interesting, mutated Krowl Krakenoid...

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:06.152
has activated Haos Hydrar.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.287

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.556

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:02.808

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.076
DAN: Seriously?

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.281
MAG MEL: [evil laughter]

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:11.584
DRAGO: Perhaps we should mutate too.

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.918
DAN: Huh?

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:16.188
RAFE: We could use Drago's powers to help combine...

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:18.390
he and another Bakugan together,

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.326
then release their collective energy.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.428
If we picked a Bakugan whose power matched...

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.964
Drago's then together they'd be unstoppable.

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.565
But they need to be in synch.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.633
DAN: Spectra?

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:31.270

DRAGO: Mutate Morph!

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.986
DRAGO: Are you ready to do this with me, Helios?

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.387
HELIOS: You bet your life.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.889
DRAGO: I'm glad we could overcome our past differences,

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.927
and come together to destroy our true common enemy Mag Mel.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.563
HELIOS: Hmmmph! Together, you and I will be truly,

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.832

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.042

Haaaaah!

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:33.499

SPECTRA: Well put.

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.008

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:21.213
SHUN: Does this mean Spectra and Helios...

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:23.515
are both Brawlers now?

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.151
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:27.419

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.389
DAN: Huh?

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.925
DRAGO: Sorry, Dan. I guess morphing with Helios...

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.993
took more out of me than I expected.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:37.563

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.376
RAFE: Dan and Spectra are coming next.

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.777

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.445
MARUCHO: Awesome!

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.913
KATO: I'm receiving readings that something...

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:57.816
is seriously wrong in Bakugan Interspace.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.827
HELIOS: More Mechtogan!

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.897
SPECTRA: It looks like Mag Mel is trying to overrun us...

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.767
with Mechtogan so we can't escape from Bakugan Interspace.

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:18.937
HELIOS: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.272

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:28.914
SPECTRA: Don't be so dramatic.

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.250
We're just giving you guys a head start.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.252

DAN: Spectraaaaaa!

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.696
HELIOS: How is it that we always wind up...

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.834
cleaning up the Brawlers' mess?

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:53.439
SPECTRA: Just luck...I guess, but they saved us in the past,

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.707
so it's the least we can do.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.242
HELIOS: Hmmph.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.114
HELIOS: Let's do thiiiiiiiis!

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.819
SPECTRA: Mag Mel is finished!

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.614

DYLAN: Well, I can't say it wasn't a blast while it lasted.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.089
Later!

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:30.335
SHUN: I can't believe Interspace is just gone.

MARUCHO: Spectra...

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:37.176
DAN: Oh man! They saved us and we just left them behind!

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.845

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:41.179

BYSTANDER #2: A dark moon?

DAN: It's Mag Mel!

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:06.038
DRAGO: I can feel him. He must have figured out a way...

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:08.907
to open the portal between the dark reverse dimension...

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:10.342
of Interspace and Earth.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.979
SHUN: And I think we're the ones who helped him do it.

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:15.881
MARUCHO: You mean he used the energy produced...

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:20.986
by the deletion program as it wiped out Interspace? Oh no!

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:31.563
RAZENOID: I can already taste the tears of those...

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:34.499
that we're about to destroy!

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.636
MAG MEL: They may seem sweet but nothing will compare...

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.137
to what comes next.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:43.041
MAG MEL: The complete and utter destruction of Earth!

RAZENOID: [mighty roar]

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.068
DAN: After we transported through the emergency access

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.671
point back home and then destroyed Bakugan Interspace

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.640
with a deletion program, we thought for sure

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.341
we were rid of Mag Mel for good.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.010
Turns out, we actually helped him to escape.

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:20.412
So now he's reborn and he's come to Earth to destroy it.

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.314
But there's no way we're gonna let that happen.

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.049
Mag Mel is even saying that thanks to us

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.518
he has unlimited power and is unstoppable.

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.453
But there has to be a way we can crush this clown

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.422
once and for all, right? So maybe you should
