WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.510
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.078
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.648
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.884
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.120
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.389
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.025
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.430
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.365
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.502
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.978
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.181
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:57.390
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.765
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

PAIGE: I've gotta go!

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.613
RAFE: [gasp]

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.315
PAIGE: Let's roll, Boulderon!

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.550
RAFE: Paige!

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.318
MARUCHO: Hey, slow down!

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.986
MARUCHO: We'll go with you Paige!

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.188
PAIGE: Are you sure?

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.889
MARUCHO: Of course! You're a Battle Brawler!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.992
That means you're part of a team and we fight together!

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.061
RAFE: Marucho's right.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.363
PAIGE: Cool!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.200
DAN: Hold up, guys!

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.002
DAN: I'm the original Battle Brawler.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.039
You're not cutting me out, of this fight!

The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Gundalia Under Fire

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:06.326
DAN: Hold on. We're on our way.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.660
DAN: [grunt]

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:15.034
SHUN, MARUCHO, PAIGE and RAFE: [grunt]

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.370
TRISTAR: Oh man, is this place a sight for sore eyes.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.371
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.573
TRISTAR: It is goooood to be back home.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.475
Whoa! Hey watch it pal!

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.010
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER A: State your business!

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.144
TRISTAR: Easy with the big pointy stick!

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.379
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER B: Are you the ones

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.814
who have brought the Chaos Bakugan?

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:29.249
MARUCHO: No, we're from Earth.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.717
We're the Battle Brawlers and we came to help.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.886
PAIGE: And I'm from Gundalia, so what's with you

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.021
pointing those things at me?

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.590
RAFE: Or me, a Castle Knight!

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.626
PAIGE, RAFE and MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.494
REN: Stand down!

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.863
REN: These are our friends.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:52.005
MARUCHO: Ya, that's right.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.339
MARUCHO: Hey Ren!

00:02:53.373 --> 00:03:01.147
REN: Dan, Marucho, Shun It's great to see you guys again.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.950
REN: Your timing is bang on perfect.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.919
We're about to embark on a full-out assault

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.221
on the invading Chaos Bakugan forces.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.624
DAN: And you're in charge of the Gundalian forces now, huh?

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.192
Impressive dude.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.228
MARUCHO: Lucky for us the inter-dimensional vortex

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.297
spit us out right at the Gundalian front lines.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.065
Otherwise we might have missed each other.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.501
REN: Your timing was perfect.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.503
NURZAK: It is good to see you all again, Brawlers.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:27.407
I only wish it could have been under better circumstances.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.510
Tell me, has Paige done well as your student?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:34.013
PAIGE: Yes Prime Minister! I have done my very best

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.849
to follow the instruction of my teachers.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.053
BOULDERON: I can vouch for that, sir.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.422
FABIA: Thank-you for coming, Battle Brawlers.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:43.890
DAN: Fabia!

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.994
FABIA: It's good to see you again Dan.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.863
RAFE: We came as soon as we heard, your highness.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.899
WOLFURIO: Let us know how we can best serve you

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.734
and we'll do it, Queen Fabia.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.202
MARUCHO: Huh? DAN: What?

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.606
MARUCHO: Fabia's the queen now? When did that happen?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.641
RAFE: You mean you didn't know Marucho?

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.010
WOLFURIO: After the last war ended Queen Serena

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.479
became an ambassador between the two nations

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.148
and kept alive the traditions of the Sacred Orb.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.516
BOULDERON: It only made sense

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.454
that Fabia would take over as Queen.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:17.223
SHUN: We should get back to the task at hand, guys.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.859
SHUN: Tell us how your latest troubles got started.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:23.196
NURZAK: Well it all happened very quickly.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.632
NURZAK: A mysterious figure, calling himself Mag Mel

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.468
arrived along with his brutish Bakugan Razenoid.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.136
Before we knew what was happening,

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.672
he had dispatched his legion of Chaos Bakugan

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.275
to wreak havoc. Our people were attacked...

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:36.843
and our cities burned to the ground.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:40.013
Darkness and destruction have returned to Gundalia.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.782
NURZAK: We do not know why they chose to attack us.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.718
What is clear, however is that we must fight back

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.788
with all of our collective might, do you understand?

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.356
FABIA: We're currently making preparations

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.292
to send the Castle Knights as reinforcements

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.260
to aid you in your fight.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.130
NURZAK: Thank-you kindly, Queen Fabia.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.099
NURZAK: In the meantime my warriors will hold the front.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:07.473
FABIA: Thanks for offering to help Battle Brawlers!

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.776
REN: The Chaos Bakugan have swarmed Gundalia

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.944
from all directions, but seem to be headed

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.546
toward the city centre.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.682
RAFE: Of course they are. That's the location

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.251
of the Royal Palace. This is bad.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.520
DAN: Don't worry, they won't make it.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:23.289
DAN: Not with us standing in their way.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.424
MARUCHO: Hold on a sec, Dan.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.725
DAN: Hmmm?

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.627
MARUCHO: I don't think you're ready to fight yet.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.330
DAN: Come on. Not this again, dude.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.564
We'll be fine.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.699
DRAGO: That's right.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.100
MARUCHO: But you haven't fully recuperated

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.735
from the last battle.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:39.205
MARUCHO: I really think you should hang back on this one.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.440
DAN: I told you we're fine!

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:43.643
MARUCHO: [angry grunt] DAN: [angry grunt]

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.511
REN: Am I missing something?

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.679
MARUCHO: Nothing.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.880
DAN: We're good.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.783
REN: [grunt]

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.286
SHUN: We need to figure out the enemy's target.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.787
DAN: Target?

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:58.725
SHUN: Mag Mel must have come to Gundalia for a reason.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:03.262
If we can figure out why then maybe it will help us stop him.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.031
PAIGE: Who cares what his reason is!

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.300
He's destroying my home world! We need to take

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.635
this sucker down. It's that simple!

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.070
TRISTAR: That's what I'm talking about!

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.272
Let's lay some major pain on these punks.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.907
MARUCHO: Fighting is useless without gathering

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.709
some information first.

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:20.079
Hey Ren, what can you tell us about the enemy's movements?

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:24.383
REN: How 'bout, I show you instead.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.719
REN: If you look closely at these satellite scans,

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:30.089
you can see the movement patterns of the Chaos Bakugan.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.692
DAN: What is Mag Mel after?

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.395
DAN: [gasp] [grunt, pain reax]

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.395
DRAGO: What's wrong?

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.563
DAN: [groan]

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.564
MARUCHO: Oh no!

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.565
SHUN: Dan!

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:40.933
DRAGO: What's happening? Talk to me.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.169
DAN: Aaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:50.376
DAN: It's my head... [grunt, pain reax]

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.646
MAG MEL: Head North! Past Dalia's Valley.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.115
That's how we'll take down the Palace!

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.450
DAN: Dalia's Valley!

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:58.951
DRAGO: What's that, Dan?

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.453
DAN: I just heard it.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:03.356
DAN: It's the route that Mag Mel is taking.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.927
REN: Come on, let's have a look.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.065
DAN: He said to go north and then go past Dalia's Valley.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.767
REN: Well if they did take that route,

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.170
it would lead them directly to the capital.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.873
REN: Tell me again, how you hear this?

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.376
DRAGO: You must've linked up again with Mag Mel.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.278
MARUCHO, RAFE and PAIGE: [gasp]

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.948
DAN: Mmm-hmm. It was like before.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.184
DAN: Sometimes the things he's seeing and doing,

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:35.288
just pop into my head.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:39.192
DAN: Trust me. He's passing through Dalia's Valley.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.227
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER A: Are you sure we can trust him

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.962
if he's linked to Mag Mel?

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.163
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER B: Yes, good point.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.465
DAN: You know you can trust me, Ren.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:52.371
REN: Huh, Sure.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:56.742
MARUCHO: Come on listen up...

00:07:56.776 --> 00:08:00.046
PAIGE: This plan of Marucho's totally stinks.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.281
PAIGE: I'm not a lie in wait type of girl.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.283
PAIGE: It's way too boring dude.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.285
BOULDERON: Maybe you should keep it down

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.187
before they hear us, Paige.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.188
RAFE: Exactly.

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.289
PAIGE: Hmmm?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.692
RAFE: You're gonna blow the element of surprise.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.294
RAFE: Just be quiet and trust Marucho's plan.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.530
WOLFURIO: And quit questioning his orders.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.232
PAIGE: Whatever.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.967
TRISTAR: Are you sure those Chaos Bakugan

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.702
are really coming this way?

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:24.303
TRISTAR: 'Cos if not we're playing

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.739
a one-sided game of hide and go seek.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.541
MARUCHO: Dan was right about the invasion...

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:30.943
so why not trust his vision about this?

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.412
Besides, we're completely outnumbered at this point.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.581
An ambush is our only play.

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:38.150
TRISTAR: Sure as long as everything goes to plan.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.886
MARUCHO: And why wouldn't it, huh?

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.355
Quit being so negative.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.657
TAYLEAN: The link Dan has with Mag Mel...

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.592
How do we know it's not an enemy trick?

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:55.067
SHUN: I'd rather not think about that right now, Taylean.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.602
DAN: [grunt, pain reax]

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.437
DRAGO: Is it happening again?

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:02.108
DAN: No, dude. Just some phantom pain.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.810
DAN: But I'm telling you, it's nothing compared to the pain

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:08.848
I'm gonna lay on Mag Mel, when he finally shows his ugly mug.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.584
DAN: He's gonna pay for all the grief he's put us through.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:15.354
DRAGO: Yes he will. He and Razenoid, both!

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.624

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:10.262
[lightning strikes]

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.397
[heavy ground impact]

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.134
DREADEON: Chaos, pain, and destruction are what...

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.170
I craaaaaaaave!

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:22.174
[computer beeps and trills]

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.609
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:25.110
RAFE: Two Mechtogans?

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:27.713
PAIGE: Oh man! This is gonna end badly!

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.281
SHUN: Stay sharp!

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.983
DRAGO: Zenthon, attack!

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:39.391
RAZENOID: Dreadeon, destroy! Leave no one standing!

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:48.734
[heavy metal impact]

00:17:48.767 --> 00:18:00.746
[laser blast]

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:05.717
DRAGO: Revolutional!

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.688
RAZENOID: Effective!

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.390
RAZENOID: You'll pay for that!

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.959
DAN: Zenthon!

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:17.529
DAN: Noooooow!

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:18.931
MAG MEL: Dreadeon!

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:22.401
MAG MEL: Defense!

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:24.603
MAG MEL: [rising mighty roar] DAN: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:25.838
DAN: I'm sick of this!

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:28.006
MAG MEL: I too have become weary of this battle...

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.508
Razenoid!

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.710
RAZENOID: Get ready to go down for good!

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.612
DRAGO: Not a chance, Razenoid!

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:37.549
DAN, DRAGO and ZENTHON: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:43.188
MAG MEL, RAZENOID and DREADEON: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:46.525
[laser blasts]

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.193
[explosion]

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:50.896
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax] Aaaaaarrrrggggghhh!

00:18:50.929 --> 00:19:00.038
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Whooooooaaaaa!

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:03.809
MAG MEL: [grunt] Hmmmm.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:09.214
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle] I wish I could say this

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:14.586
is a nice surprise but this result was inevitable.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.291
MAG MEL: The powers that lie within you are mine now,

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.894
and they will make me whole again!

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:26.131
MAG MEL: [grunt, exertion reax] What?

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.366
REN: Finally!

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:30.702
RAFE: The Castle Knights!

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.204
ELRIGHT: Really sorry we're late guys!

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:34.006
But we're here to help now!

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.340
Let's go, Aranaut!

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:41.179
ARANAUT: Right!

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.915
MARUCHO: Dan!

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.383
SHUN: Are you okay?

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.485
MARUCHO: We've got you now, buddy.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.721
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Oh hey guys...

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.224
MARUCHO: We better get out of here and regroup.

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:55.127
SHUN: Right.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.763
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:01.199
MAG MEL: I guess the gate and key that Kuso and Drago possess

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:05.504
will have to wait for another day.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:12.544
MARUCHO: Gate and key, huh? So what are those?

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.646
ELRIGHT: It looks like they're retreating.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.582
I think we've won this battle Aranaut,

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.417
at least we have for now.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:25.057
ARANAUT: It seems like we arrived not a moment too late.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.426
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER A: I really don't understand this.

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:30.729
I thought the Brawlers came here to help us fight the enemy.

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.097
GUNDALIAN SOLDIER B: And this whole time Dan was

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.665
linked to Mag Mel!

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.100
REN: What are you saying?

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.636
REN: Dan Kuso is not a spy, understand?

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:40.772
GUNDALIAN SOLDIERS: Yes sir!

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:42.474
REN: He couldn't be, could he?

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:45.944
DAN: [angry grunt] He played me!

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:48.914
RAFE: If this link still exists between the two of them,

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.516
we need to think about what that means to our security.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.052
PAIGE: We can't be compromised again like today.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.254
PAIGE: We may not be as lucky next time.

00:20:56.288 --> 00:21:00.192
DAN: He's in my head!

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:07.466
MARUCHO: What now?

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.501
MARUCHO: Even though they retreated from our last battle,

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.870
the Chaos Bakugan didn't stay gone for long.

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.273
They were back destroying large parts of Gundalia

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.642
in their wake. Luckily, the Castle Knights had arrived to

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.710
give us a hand, but right in the middle of fighting

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.879
something unexpected happened when Dan showed up.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.848
We learned the hard way that his psychic connection

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:25.350
to Mag Mel had made him a liability to us,

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.918
but he still insisted on battling.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.788
To the point where he was ready to fight Shun and I to do it.

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.790
Tune in to see for yourself!

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.759
I just hope that both of these guys can remember

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.995
who the real enemy is.

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.030
