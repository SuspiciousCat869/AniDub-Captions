[\u266a]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.909
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.579
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.115
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.617
Interspace the number of people accessing it from

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.420
around the world totally exploded!

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.489
The Grand Prix Tournament attracted hundreds of

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.424
new battlers in Bakugan.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.926
And the crowd was going wild!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.263
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.800
with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.836
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.338
DAN: The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.074
against some crazy serious competition now.

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.077
Challenged by team Anubias and Team Sellon.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.312
As we go head to head for the top spot.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.082
The stakes are high for the Battle Brawlers!

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.717
DAN: This is Bakugan battling like you've never

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.953
seen it before but we're in it to win it!

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.956

\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.231
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.633
\u266a this is the final stand

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.501
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.836
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.071
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.506
\u266a On the inside

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.745
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.748
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.550
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.456

Interspace Showdown!

[\u266a]

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.943
DRAGO: Not so fast, kids.

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.010
BATTLER A: Seriously?

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.679
BATTLER B: Oh no!

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:58.685
[\u266a]

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.822
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.390
DAN: Listen punks! It's gonna take more than

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.060
that to take down Pyrus Titanium Dragonoid!

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.061
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [wild cheers]

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.095
SPECTATOR A: You tell 'em, Dan!

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.296
SPECTATOR B: Nice one, Drago!

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.601
SPECTATOR A: The Brawlers rock! No one can touch them!

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.803
MARUCHO: It looks like Dan has this handled all by himself,

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.071
wouldn't you say?

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.272
TRISTAR: Hold up, Marucho!

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.707
It sounds like you don't wanna fight.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.642
You're not pulling wimp on me are you?

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.244
MARUCHO: No. I'm not saying that at all.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.579
I'm just saying Dan's got awesome skills.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.481
TRISTAR: I didn't pack up and leave Gundalia just so

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.383
I could sit on the sidelines and admire

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.120
another Brawler! You got me pal?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.989
TAYLEAN: Ancient Neathian wisdom says,

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.425
the Bakugan who talks loudly, battles weakly.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.462
TRISTAR: Oh yeah, well on Gundalia we have a saying.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.631
The dude who yaks and yaks should get to the point

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.366
instead of talking in circles.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.435
MARUCHO: [nervous laugh]

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.806

DAN: Yup!

Titanium Dragonoid!

Let's hear it for the Battle Brawlers!

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.522
With this win they're still undefeated in the

Bakugan Interspace Grand Prix!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.793
MARUCHO: Awesome! I'm telling you,

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.529
Dan and Drago are totally unstoppable!

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.764

DAN: Is everything okay, pal?

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.742
I've never seen you miss before.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.077
DRAGO: Umm, something got in my eye.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.278
DAN: So that's what happened.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.850
proportion comes to us from Area E, where the

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.986
leader of Team Sellon, the beautiful Sellon herself

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.489
has taken out her opponent with tremendous skill.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.859
fierce and formidable teammates Chris and Soon,

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.762
Team Sellon will surely become a force to reckon with.

of talent in the history of Bakugan Battle!

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.973

KID #2: Whoa!

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.282
MARUCHO: It looks like Dan's still sitting pretty on top.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.985
TRISTAR: That should be us up there on that board, Marucho!

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.487
TRISTAR: What do you say, Drago! Wanna dance?

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.790
DRAGO: Maybe another time, Tristar.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.825
DAN: Shun and Taylean have won all their matches too.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.694
DAN: But he hasn't fought as many battles as us

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.529
'cause he's so busy training, otherwise we'd

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:31.164
be tied for first.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.965
SHUN: It's important for a Battler to always be

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.401
honing their skills, Dan.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.303

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.671
you quickly, Dan.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.873
I know they're newbies, but you shouldn't underestimate them.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:44.243
They've got fearsome skills, and they're hungry to be on top.

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.978
DAN: Yeah, whatever, it's gonna take more than a

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.581
couple hungry Noobs to take me and Drago down.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:49.882

MARUCHO: Hey. Aren't you from...

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.889
MARUCHO: ...Team Anubias?

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.492
ROBIN: I guess we should feel pretty flattered guys.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.328
JACK: Yeah, the Brawlers remember us.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.965
BEN: Well pretty soon no one's gonna remember them

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.167
because they'll all be to busy cheering the new

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.670
champs, Team Anubias!

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.505
BEN: Enjoy your top ranking while it lasts, Kuso!

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.906
Because it won't last!

BEN: Huh?

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.810

DAN: Aw yeah?

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.685
MARUCHO: Calm down, Dan!

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:26.719
DAN: Bring it!

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.920
ANUBIAS: Hum.

ANUBIAS: Hmmmm? [gasp] DAN: Huh?

DYLAN: [laughter] Check it out I can see you guys are totally

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:35.328
anxious to throw down but let's not jump the gun here!

You're gonna need some stuff first.

DYLAN: Like a battle match up, or an ability card?

DYLAN: Lucky for you guys, I am the \"go to\" man in Interspace.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.470
DYLAN: Whatever it is you need I can get.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.173
DYLAN: That is for a small price of course.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:51.177
DYLAN: Call me. Dylan is the name, fellas. [chuckle]

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.012

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.732
Bakugan Interspace went open source.

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:15.635
MARUCHO: I thought we were making it a free world by

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.403
turning the administration duties over to the

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.205
automated computer system.

MARUCHO: I wanted to open Interspace to millions of

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:25.077
new Battlers, but instead.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.413
SHUN: It turned into a lawless land.

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:28.614
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.884
MARUCHO: That's a bit harsh. I think.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:33.386
MARUCHO: To be honest, I think the results have

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.188
been mostly good.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.290
MARUCHO: Battlers like Anubias and Sellon are

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.058
great additions to the tournaments but on the

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.327
other hand there are a lot of weirdoes...

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.728
MARUCHO: ...like that Dylan creep.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.497
MARUCHO: You know, it's not like the old days,

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.599
when Dan and I first met the Bakugan and came up

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.201
with battle rules.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:51.337
Things seemed so much more pure back then.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.540
SHUN: In order to grow, everything must evolve.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:59.145
SHUN: It is the natural path of progression.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.413
DAN: [groan, exertion]

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.682
You've been reading way too many fortune cookies, dude.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.983
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.085
DAN: People are flocking to Bakugan Interspace

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:07.687
because it rocks.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.189
DAN: It's as simple as that, guys.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:13.626
MARUCHO: Hmmmph. Yeah. You're right! Hah ha!

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.895
MARUCHO: You always cheer me up Dan.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.797
DAN: That's my job!

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.365
MARUCHO: And you're totally awesome at it.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:20.499
DAN: I know, right? MARUCHO: [chuckles]

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:26.239
DAN: [panting, running]

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:29.208
DAN: [panting, running] Whoaa!

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.677
DAN: [panting, running] Ahhhhhh!

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.213
DAN: Who are you? Answer me!

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.715
DAN: [gasp, grunt]

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.585
DAN: [panting, running] Ahhhhhhhhhh!

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.322
MAG MEL: You know what I want!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.157
Give it to me, Dan Kuso!

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.425
DAN: Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.329
MAG MEL: If you won't hand it over then I'll crush

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.531
you and take it myself!

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:57.069
DAN: Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.271
DAN: [gasp]

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.240
DAN: Oh whoa! [panting]

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.708
DRAGO: It's okay, Dan.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.810
DRAGO: It's just a bad dream.

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:08.948
DAN: Yeah. I'm so sick of those stupid things!

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.617
DAN: I know it sounds dumb but, it feels so real.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:16.389
It's creepy. The darkness. The freak masked dude.

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.225
I wish I knew what he wanted.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.394
DRAGO: I wonder if your dreams are connected to

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.931
the vision I had during the battle today.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:28.067
DRAGO: That's the reason I missed the shot earlier.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.469
DAN: Man!

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.338
DAN: Maybe we can figure this out, buddy.

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.941
Tell me what you saw in your vision.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:38.210
[\u266a]

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.747
MARUCHO: Whoa! Hold on, that can't be right!

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.616
TRISTAR: The big dude is ticked off at how Dan was

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.919
talking about Team Anubias yesterday.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.087
TRISTAR: So, Ben's challenged him to a battle.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.990
MARUCHO: That sounds like a really bad idea Dan.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:53.492
SHUN: Battling two days in a row is dangerous.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.694
DAN: Gimme a break, guys.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.861
SHUN: [gasp] MARUCHO: Huh?

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.764
DAN: He's all mouth. It'll be easy.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:09:59.865
MARUCHO: But Dan.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.769
DAN: Seriously, dude. I'll be fine. Later!

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.405
MARUCHO: Dan! Wait!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:10.443
TAYLEAN: Why is Dan so quick to accept this guy's challenge?

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:13.045
SHUN: Something's definitely up.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.214
ANUBIAS: Who do you think you are buddy?

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.149
ANUBIAS: Kuso was supposed to be mine!

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.617
BEN: I'm a battler too!

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.119
ANUBIAS: What'd you say?

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.088
BEN: Why should you get to have all the fun, and

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:27.960
leave the rest of us to only battle the weak?

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.362
ANUBIAS: Take these.

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.797
BEN: Huh? What?

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:35.735
ANUBIAS: If you're battling Kuso. You'll need those to win.

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:37.970
BEN: Thanks!

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:41.107
DYLAN: Hmmm.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.708
Let's see if I can't make this battle

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:43.943
a little more interesting.

BEN: I don't know whose idea this was but it makes

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.609
no difference.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:54.480
