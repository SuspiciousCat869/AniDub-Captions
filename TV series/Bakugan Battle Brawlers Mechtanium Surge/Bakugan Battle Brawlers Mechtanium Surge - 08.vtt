WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.641
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.177
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.279
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.949
a mega Bakugan Interspace the number of people accessing it

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.084
from around the world totally exploded!

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.953
Of course Drago and I are back in action,

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.256
along with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.493
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.328
The flood of new Battlers means we're up against

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.764
some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.500
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.869
...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.738
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.108
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.412
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.581
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.751
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:57.657
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.527
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.430
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone...\u266a

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:13.473
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.074
DAN: Check it, dude!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.243
DAN: Boy this place is a sight for sore eyes.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.379
I never thought I'd see New Vestroia again.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.814
How's it feel to be home, buddy?

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.715
DRAGO: Good, but kind of strange.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.387
Like a dream.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.125
[many feet stomping]

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:45.038
[bird cry]

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.106
1st YOUNG BAKUGAN: Whoa!

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.774
What's that funny looking thing?

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.710
2nd YOUNG BAKUGAN: I think it might be a human.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.878
1st YOUNG BAKUGAN: I've heard about them

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.279
but I've never actually seen one

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.647
in the flesh, before.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.782
2nd YOUNG BAKUGAN: Me neither.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.350
DAN: How can they not know who we are?

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.586
We rescued half the Bakugan here.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.155
DRAGO: Out of sight out of mind, I suppose.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.157
DAN: I didn't expect a red carpet but I thought maybe

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.693
some of our friends would be happy to see us.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.695
DRAGO: It's probably for the best.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.664
We're not here on a social call after all.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.967
I'd rather not be the center of attention,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.537
while we do our training.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.673
DAN: Okay. I hear ya.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.674
DAN: I guess we should head for

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.510
the secret training ground then.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.745
DRAGO: Let's go!

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:31.985
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Return to New Vestroia.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.162
DRAGO: There it is.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.266
DAN: Sweet.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.968
DRAGO: I used to come here when I needed peace and quiet.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.671
No one else knows it's here.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.839
DRAGO: Huh?

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.941
DAN: So much for being your little secret.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:59.012
AMAZON: Yeeaah!

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.346
AMAZON: Haaaah!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.347
Huuuuuah!

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.850
AMAZON: Hmmmph!

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.351
DAN: Who the heck is that dude?

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.720
I've never seen him before.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.689
DRAGO: I have no idea.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.191
DRAGO: It seems that quite a lot has changed

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.761
since we were here last.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.529
AMAZON: [mighty roar]

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.530
AMAZON: Aaaaaaaaaa...

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:21.000
... mmaaaa ... zzzzzooon!

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.102
AMAZON: Aquos Bomber!

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.606
Haaaaaaah!

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.041
DRAGO: The kid has some power.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.776
Too bad we can't stick around.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.711
DAN: Yeah, bummer.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.780
AMAZON: Hey! Where are you going, old man?

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:34.814
DRAGO: Old man?

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.050
Are you serious?

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.851
AMAZON: I don't see any other senior citizens

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.353
shuffling around, do you?

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.188
Why are you sneaking around like that, huh?

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:47.193
AMAZON: Did my awesome display of power freak you out?

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.261
AMAZON: Don't just stand there.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.495
I'm talking to you!

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:50.697
Don't make me give you a thrashing, old man.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.699
Answer. Answer. Answer.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.100
Huh?

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.802
AMAZON: Hey, did you know you've got an insect

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:57.470
or something on your shoulder?

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.539
AMAZON: Oh, never-mind it's just a human kid.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.407
DAN: Who you calling \"kid\"?

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.076
AMAZON: So gramps, is this twerp your battler?

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.944
I've heard of partnerships like that but I've never seen

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.279
how they work up close.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.715
DRAGO: Do you actually hear the words coming out of your mouth?

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:09.816
AMAZON: My sensei told me once

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.017
about his human battling partner.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.253
It sounded so cool the way you old guys used to brawl.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.954
I wish I could have been there back in the day.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.022
[giggle]

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.957
DRAGO: Listen! Quit calling me old!

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:18.958
AMAZON: Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.093
I've got an idea.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.094
Why don't we battle?

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.195
You two against me.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.063
I promise to take it easy on you first time around.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.131
DRAGO: I've heard enough.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.499
Let's go, Dan.

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.034
DAN: I'm with ya, pal.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.068
AMAZON: Awww c'mon dudes.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.169
Where you goin'?

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.504
All I wanted was a friendly battle.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:32.872
What's the problem?

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.641
Hey what, do you think you're too good for me?

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.143
AMAZON: Or is it because you're giant chickens?

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.645
DAN: What did you say?

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.080
DRAGO: Don't let him wind you up, Dan.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.081
PREYAS: That's right!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.184
Winding these two up is my old job.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.787
PREYAS: What's happening guys?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.724
PREYAS: Did you miss me?

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.292
AMAZON: Sensei, you know these guys?

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.661
DRAGO: Preyas!

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.062
DAN: He's your Sensei?

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.898
PREYAS: Amazon, say hi to Dan and Drago.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.800
DRAGO: It's good to see you old friend.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.169
PREYAS: When I heard the others talking about you two,

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.239
I thought they were crazy 'cos there's no way

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.740
you would show up unannounced.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.075
DRAGO: Hmm right.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.343
Sorry.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.778
DRAGO: It was kind of a last minute thing.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.413
PREYAS: So Dan.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.249
Ah where ... where's Marucho?

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.250
Did he come too?

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.986
DAN: [gasp] Um no,

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.588
he had to stay behind and help Shun.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.091
PREYAS: [laugh] Oh of course!

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:27.593
That sounds just like a Battle Brawler.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.929
Always helping a fellow teammate out.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.531
Nothing can tear you guys apart.

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.733
DAN: Yeah that's right.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.235
DAN: Don't try and cover for him, Marucho.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.637
Shun was clear.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.172
SHUN: It's not personal.

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:40.707
MARUCHO: We're your friends no matter what,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.077
but that doesn't mean you can ignore what we're telling you.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.211
PREYAS: Yoo-hoo, Dan!

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.180
Dan? You okay?

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.816
DAN: [gasp] Yeah, I'm good buddy;

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.184
so tell me what's going on

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:52.485
with this Sensei business?

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.620
PREYAS: Oh yeah, that's right.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.122
I'm a teacher now.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.424
PREYAS: And of course you've met my student, Amazon.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.026
AMAZON: His number one student.

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.828
DRAGO: His only student.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.129
DAN: Ha ha. Yeah.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.131
Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:07.366
PREYAS: I must have told Amazon at least a million stories

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.302
about you guys and our Brawling days.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.470
AMAZON: It's totally true.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.338
The way Sensei talked about you two

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.407
it was like you were superheroes.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.908
AMAZON: That's why I was so surprised to see

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.343
that you were so ... not young.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.978
But now that I know it's really you,

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.047
I just can't let you leave without having a battle.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.448
You guys are legends.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.518
I'd be nuts to pass up an opportunity like that.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.020
So how 'bout it?

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.188
AMAZON: Come on, Sensei.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.289
Can't you put in a good word

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.425
with your buddies for me? Pretty please?

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.893
PREYAS: Well, it's not the worst idea I've ever heard.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.796
DAN: Boy, talk about the blind leading the blind.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:41.167
PREYAS: Amazon kind of has a point and I would consider it

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.603
a personal favour if you'd do us the honour.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.971
Okay guys?

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.339
DRAGO: Um I don't know...

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.841
PREYAS: There's only so much I can teach him on my own.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.377
It would really take his skills to the next level

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.945
battling someone like you.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.715
DAN: So, what do ya think?

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.684
DRAGO: You're not serious, are you?

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.453
DAN: I dunno. What's the harm?

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:03.256
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.159
DRAGO: Maybe ... but still.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.528
That last battle was way out of control.

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.696
If I lose it like that again, I could put a hole

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.202
right through the middle of New Vestroia!

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.336
DRAGO: I'm still having a hard time

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.705
controlling these new powers,

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.775
on top of these dark visions I see while battling.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.312
I'm not sure what's going on Dan.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.514
DAN: Well, I got a new theory about that.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.484
PREYAS: Aww man, what's all the secrecy about?

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.386
AMAZON: What d'ya think? Are they gonna do it?

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.687
DAN: Every time you've lost control,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.455
it's been inside Bakugan Interspace.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:39.525
Maybe your powers are just too much for a virtual world.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.928
DRAGO: Hmmm, but now that we're in New Vestroia,

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.596
in the real world ...

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.864
DAN: Exactly!

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:46.699
Battling here might give us the key

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.001
to finally harnessing your new powers.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.404
DRAGO: Well, I guess there's only one way

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:52.972
to find out for sure.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:56.309
It's time we put your theory to the test.

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:57.376
AMAZON: Hey! C'mon guys,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.678
make a decision already would ya?

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.780
The suspense is killing me.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.348
AMAZON: Man, what a couple of Gabby Guses.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.984
How do they do battle when they spend all their time yakking?

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.053
PREYAS: Quiet you nincompoop!

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:09.622
DRAGO: And the truth is, Amazon's so new at this ...

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:13.092
I won't need to use anywhere near my full powers to beat him.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.294
DRAGO: That should give us the safety buffer we need.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.897
PREYAS: Hmmmm.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.899
DRAGO: What is it, Preyas?

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.000
PREYAS: Oh right!

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:23.269
Sorry to bug you, but I was just wondering

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.171
if you guys had made a decision yet.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.472
DAN: For sure.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.674
We talked it through, we'll take your boy on

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:34.313
if you think he's tough enough.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.282
PREYAS: Okay, is everyone ready to rock?

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.416
DRAGO: Yes!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.318
DAN: Just say the word.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.888
AMAZON: I was born ready, Sensei!

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.156
AMAZON: Yeeeeeeaaaaaaah!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.992
PREYAS: Okay, playas.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.260
Battle on!

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.394
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.395
AMAZON: Come get some.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.396
Hiii Ya!

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.397
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.398
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.399
Haaaaah!

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.534
AMAZON: Whooooa!

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:55.935
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.770
AMAZON: Aarrrgghh!

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.540
DAN: Ability activate.

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.174
DAN: Dragon String!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.175
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.176
Huuaaaaah!

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.879
AMAZON: Huh? Whoa! Yikes!

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.114
AMAZON: Not bad, gramps.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.115
AMAZON: Haaaaaaah!

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.116
AMAZON: Huuuuaaah!

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.617
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:13.619
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaah!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.322
AMAZON: Aaaaaarrrrggggghhhhh!

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:26.299
PREYAS: [sigh]

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.768
RAZENOID: There it is again, I can feel him

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.470
with every annoying beat of his heart.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:34.807
Drago is back.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.444
[mighty roar]

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:42.114
MAG MEL: His aura feels stronger.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:47.086
He must be battling in the real world.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.824
DAN: No holding back Drago.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.527
MAG MEL: Get ready, Razenoid!

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.762
!Soon Drago's power will be ours

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.064
AMAZON: Have a sip of this.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:03.402
Tornado Ocean!

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.271
DAN: Ability activate.

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.839
DRAGO: Titanium Screen!

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.708
DRAGO: Hmmmmph!

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.609
DRAGO: It's going to take a lot more than that

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.378
to take me down, junior!

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.647
DAN: Ability activate.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.449

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.317
AMAZON: Oh noooo!

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:21.020
DRAGO: Hmmmmph!

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.288
AMAZON: [grunt, pain reax]

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.592
AMAZON: Oooomph!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.861
AMAZON: [nervous laughter]

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.663
DAN: What the heck is he laughing at?

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.632
DRAGO: Maybe I knocked his last screw loose.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.632
DAN: Hey man!

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.501
What's so funny?

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.269
AMAZON: [stifled giggles] Sorry.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.971
It's just that when I get all wound up by a battle

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.874
I kind of lose control and start to giggle.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.409
AMAZON: With all the excitement flowing through me

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.077
I can't help myself!

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.846
DAN: Yeah! Well knock it off.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:47.847
DRAGO: Yes!

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.281
Control is the key in battle.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.983
PREYAS: Amazon may be young and wild,

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.085
but Drago shouldn't underestimate the level

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.186
of power he yields.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.023
He could be in for a bit of a surprise.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.358
AMAZON: The old man still had some tricks up his sleeve,

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.127
but maybe I should show him some of the ones

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.796
Sensei has taught me.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:04.797
AMAZON: Aaaaaaa...

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.798
...mmmmmaaaaa...

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:09.001
...zzzzzzooooon...

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:13.039
AMAZON: Attribute change! Subterra!

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.641
DRAGO: Huh! Maybe Preyas isn't such a bad teacher.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.977
DAN: We shoulda saw that coming.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.346
AMAZON: Keep your eye on the Amazon!

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.715
AMAZON: Desert Rocket!

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:23.716
AMAZON: Now you see me.

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:28.454
Now you don't!

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.622
DRAGO: Nice one, kid.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:30.790
DAN: Be careful, Drago.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:33.292
DRAGO: Hmmm... Let's see...

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.894
AMAZON: Here I am!

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:36.829
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:37.830
DRAGO: Lucky shot.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.499
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.967
DRAGO: Enough hocus-pocus.

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.203
Show yourself!

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.072
DRAGO: Huh? Now I've got you.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.908
Haaaaaaah!

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:51.343
AMAZON: Missed me by a mile.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.113
AMAZON: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:55.714
DAN: Crank it up Drago!

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:56.916
DRAGO: Not yet.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:59.218
DRAGO: I can do this.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.320
AMAZON: Special delivery!

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:02.688
DRAGO: Think again.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.458
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:09.128
AMAZON: [coughing] Oooomph!

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.129
DAN: Nice one.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:11.797
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.432
AMAZON: [coughing] Cheap shot!

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.867
DAN: Nothing cheap about it.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.035
DRAGO: Let's go.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.971

DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.914
AMAZON: Oh snap!

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.650
AMAZON: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.120
PREYAS: Oh! This doesn't look so good!

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.555
AMAZON: [giggle]

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.591
AMAZON: Did you run out of juice, old timer?

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:40.226
DRAGO: Seriously?

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.527
AMAZON: I thought you were supposed to be

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.995
the toughest Bakugan that ever was.

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.263
Is that really all you've got?

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.432
How pathetic!

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:47.700
PREYAS: Quiet, fool!

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.635
AMAZON: Why am I the fool?!

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.671
PREYAS: He's taking it easy on you to lure you into his trap.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.707
PREYAS: He's trying to make you overconfident.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.109
AMAZON: What! Are you sure?

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.478
AMAZON: If what Sensei says is true then maybe

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.080
I never had a chance against Drago.

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.283
But what if I changed strategies?

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:08.087
Maybe some smack talk will mess with his head.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.022
Let's give it a try.

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.992
AMAZON: Why are you insulting me by holding back so much?

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.026
DRAGO: What?

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.661
AMAZON: I'm young and I'm tough.

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.363
And I can take anything you can dish out!

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:18.898
So let's have it, gramps!

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.366
Hit me with your best shot!

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.934
DAN: Drago could blow you over

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.569
with a sneeze, buddy!

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.404
AMAZON: Yeah right.

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:27.339
AMAZON: I understand, you're probably nervous

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.340
that you're gonna get hurt

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.775
'cos you're getting up there in years.

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.343
Maybe that's why you're holding back

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.012
the way you are, but listen...

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.446
...you gotta stop it.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.215
AMAZON: Sensei is your former teammate!

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:38.450
You owe him the respect of giving his student

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.319
your 100% effort.

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.555
PREYAS: Okay. Enough Amazon! [sigh]

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:48.661
I'm sure Drago has his reasons.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:50.162
AMAZON: [sigh]

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:52.798
AMAZON: As you wish, Sensei.

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.267
DRAGO: [gasp]

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.069
DAN: Remember the plan, pal.

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.070
DRAGO: Right.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.139
We have to keep our eyes on the target

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:03.375
and not let some cocky kid get inside our heads.

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:06.478
DRAGO: Besides, maybe a good thrashing is exactly the lesson

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:12.184
this young punk needs.

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:13.752

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:16.622
DAN: Okay, let's rock.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.191

Well here it comes!

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:50.656

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.358
DAN: Drago. Snap out of it!

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.026
Don't hold back. Let him have it!

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.262
DRAGO: Sorry. I hear you.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.330

It looks like he's losing it.

PREYAS: What the heck is going on with those two?

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.922
The old Drago I knew would never be taken down so easily.

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:33.125
Their focus is so scattered.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.628
Something is seriously wrong here but what can I do?

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.666

AMAZON: Shouldn't we make sure they're okay?

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.075
PREYAS: They're okay.

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:53.112
They just need some time alone to sort some personal stuff out.

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.189
PREYAS: You fought well but, ah ...

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:07.025
Drago shouldn't have lost so easily to you. Okay?

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:10.562
If we stayed behind it would have embarrassed him.

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:12.231
PREYAS: I wish I knew what happened

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.066
that messed Drago up so badly.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.535
I just hope he and Dan are able to sort things out.

Who wants to fight next?

MARUCHO: Whoa! Maybe you should take a break for a bit.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:48.253
You don't want to burn out, Shun.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.027
I have to get us back on top.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.962
MARUCHO: Wait Shun, please...

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:00.599
SHUN: If you want to help, go find me another opponent.

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:02.568
MARUCHO: Well, shouldn't I have a say

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:11.476
with what happens with the Brawlers too?

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.545
DAN: I can't believe those visions have followed us

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:14.780
into the real world.

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:18.317
They were even stronger this time.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.452
DRAGO: Do you think that means my powers will be

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:23.755
just as destructive here, if I lose control of them?

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.258
How can we be sure?

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.060
DAN: I don't know!

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:33.065

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.306
That kid put me down really hard.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:52.985
DAN: [angry grunt]

RAZENOID: [mighty roar]

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:59.257
MAG MEL: [evil laughter] I can't believe we found them.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:01.560
MAG MEL: In New Vestroia of all places!

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:04.363
RAZENOID: I'm coming for you, Drago!

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.264
[maniacal laughter]

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:10.168
DAN: New Vestroia was supposed to be a fresh start for us.

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.037
A place where we could finally get control

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.805
over Drago's new powers.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.108
But as soon as we got here, not only was Drago taken down

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:19.645
by a newbie but we also got hit by those freaky visions again.

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:22.214
Then to make things worse, this mysterious battler showed up

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:23.949
and started causing chaos.

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:26.084
I know it sounds weird, but I think he was some kind of

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.619
messenger from our nightmares.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:30.188
I just hope Preyas doesn't get caught in the crossfire.

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:31.790
Things are getting way out of control.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.659
You should tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:36.962
Come on, Drago! Let's get to the bottom of things!

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:37.996
