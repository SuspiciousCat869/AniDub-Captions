And what about Westcott?

00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:20,317
As we expected,

A girl thinks,

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,067
"If only I could be
more honest,"

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,608
and she hopes with all her heart

10
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,900
that she can find
the courage she needs.

11

Wishing on every shooting star.

12
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:40,067
[SHIDO]
Maybe we went a little too far.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,608
I didn't realize
she'd get that upset.

[screaming]

Don't worry. It's really
not as bad as you think.

16
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:51,692
Look, that's her mental state,
mood, and happiness.

17
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,900
They've all risen up
to much healthier levels.

[chuckles]

19
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,400
She's probably not used to
being complimented and stuff

20
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:00,817
when she's in her natural form.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,233
Seriously, for someone
who's always so desperate

22
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,108
to be in the center
of the action,

23
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:07,317
girl has zero self-confidence.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,108
You know, now you mention it,

25
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,650
Natsumi talked about
how nobody ever paid attention

26
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,233
to her in her true form.

27
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:14,983
Sounds to me like
a few bad experiences

28
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,358
might've really done some damage
to her sense of self-worth.

29
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:20,983
Her beauty isn't
the real issue here.

30
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,317
I think, in general,

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,567
Natsumi just needs
to feel accepted for who she is.

32
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,692
Those liars.
They don't mean any of it.

[KOTORI] Hey, can I ask
you guys a question?

What do you think
about that Natsumi girl?

Think, meaning...?

You know, I mean, how gross
can you actually get?

43
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:06,775
She's so ugly that it's hard
not to pity her, right?

--Huh?
--Huh?

talking about?

Uh...

Excuse me, but I don't think
Natsumi's gross or ugly at all.

You must be blind because
that girl is a hot mess.

weird things.

[YUZURU] Doubt.
What kind of weird things?

60
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,858
Like, that Natsumi
is actually pretty

and not the pain in our
collective butts that she is.

saying bizarre stuff is you.

like something you would say.

Hey, by the way,

00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,733
I had a thought
about Natsumi earlier.

77
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,400
Here it comes.
At last, I'll get the truth.

78
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:27,442
I'm wondering if we should let
her out of the room for meals.

thinking about it a lot

and, well, she's gotta be
lonely eating by herself.

82
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,275
But if she got to sit down
to eat meals with everyone else,

83
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:40,275
I think Natsumi might
actually warm up to us.

but no sign of her.

Something you wanna know?

112

Indeed.

with you

to show herself again.
