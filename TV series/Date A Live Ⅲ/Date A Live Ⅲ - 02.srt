00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,108
[MURDOCH] What the hell
were you thinking, Mr. Westcott?

2
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,775
Please, do enlighten us.

3
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:20,192
[WESTCOTT]
Sorry, I'm not quite sure

4
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,483
what you're asking, Murdoch.

5
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,442
Now's not the time to play dumb.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,150
I'm obviously referring to your
many recent activities in Japan.

7
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,108
Interfering with
the Self-Defense Force.

8
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:33,108
Utilizing Wizards
for your own agenda, and worse,

9
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,650
transforming the city
into a war zone!

10
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,858
The Japanese government
is all over us, thanks to you.

11
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,233
How do plan
to rectify this mess?

12
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,733
Look, what does it matter?

13
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:45,442
We obviously achieved enough
to make it worthwhile.

14
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,483
Don't forget, we succeeded
with Princess's inversion.

15
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:51,233
Do you really not understand
what I'm saying?!

16
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,400
It's ludicrous!

17
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,942
What do Spirits have to do
with saving DEM?

18
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,733
The company can't afford
to take a backseat

19
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,775
to your selfish
little obsessions.

20
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,108
Everyone, I think
the time has come.

21
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,025
I move that
Managing Director Westcott

22
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,817
be relieved of his position.

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,233
--[MAN A] I agree.
--[murmuring]

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,067
[RUSSELL] Are you willing
to comply with this, sir?

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,275
Of course. Removing me
is well within your given rights

26
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,192
as the board of directors.

27
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,025
Well then, Chairman Russel,

28
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,942
I say we proceed
with a vote right now.

29
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,608
All right, all those in favor
of Wescott's dismissal?

30
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:27,775
Zero hands.
His removal is hereby rejected.

31
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:30,067
What? What are you
talking about, Chairman?!

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,525
All these people
agree with me--

33
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,650
--[screaming]
--[MEN gasping]

34
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:37,108
[screaming]

35
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:39,983
You'll find Realizers
ready at the infirmary.

36
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,567
If you get there fast,

37
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,275
you should be back to normal
in a few days.

38
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,275
[MURDOCH groaning]

39
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,483
And once I'm finished addressing
my "selfish little obsession,"

40
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,275
I shall hand over
the company, soon.

41
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,442
Don't worry.

42
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,650
At least compared to how long

43
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:56,983
we've already
been waiting, anyway.

44
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:07,400
[NARRATOR] A written challenge,
and with it, 12 photographs.

45
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,525
Her one question:

46
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,400
"Can you find me?"

47
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,942
[REINE] So, these must be
the photos that Natsumi sent.

48
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,983
[KOTORI]
"I'm here, among your friends.

49
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,108
Can you take a guess
which one I am?

50
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,608
Before everyone else
disappears, too?"

51
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,067
That was Natsumi's
entire message.

52
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,983
Well, if we take it
at face value,

53
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,192
then we have to assume Natsumi's
impersonating one of them.

54
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,608
And that if you can't
find her quickly,

55
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,817
they'll begin to disappear
one by one.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,192
Does that sound right?

57
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,983
--[SHIDO grunts]
--[KOTORI] Most likely.

58
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,567
Ugh! Notice, she gives
no specific time limit

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,942
or any other rules
for this little game.

60
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:13,817
That did stand out.
Can't imagine she forgot.

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,067
And while you're sitting here
trying to figure this out,

62
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,442
she's probably somewhere
overseeing the entire game.

63
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,150
No. It's not wise
to refer to it as a game.

64
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,817
Those who are erased by Natsumi

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,400
may very well
never be returned to us.

66
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:29,817
[gasps]

67
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,483
[KOTORI] That's true.
She seems different from Kurumi.

68
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,400
I have a feeling Natsumi may not
be satisfied playin' around

69
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,067
and keepin' it light.

70
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,983
The fact is, someone here

71
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,817
may already be gone
for eternity.

72
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,567
[SHIDO] No. I don't think
Natsumi is like that.

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,108
If I can just guess
who she's impersonating,

74
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,567
I know they'll come home
in one piece.

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,900
Sounds like you are putting
a lot of faith in this witch.

76
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,067
Think about it.

77
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,817
Could you open up
your heart to someone

78
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,733
if you didn't think
they trusted you?

79
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,067
As if you know women at all.

80
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,900
Though, I will admit,
that was accurate.

81
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:07,525
[REINE] Mm-hmm. Whatever the
case, we need to hurry.

82
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,858
Sorry, Kotori.

83
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,567
I'm afraid you'll have to
stay away from command.

84
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,025
Yeah, that makes sense.

85
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:17,025
I could just as easily
be Natsumi as anyone else could.

86
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,442
And you, Shin,

87
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,650
you have an awful lot
of work ahead of you.

88
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,692
[SHIDO]
Hmm. Okay, what should I do?

89
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,775
For the time being,

90
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,108
I'd start by deciding the order
you'll be dating them in.

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,692
To see through
Natsumi's disguise,

92
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:35,983
be careful not to overlook

93
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:39,025
even the smallest differences
from the norm.

94
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:40,608
You'll date them one by one,

95
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:43,733
in search of anything
that seems off.

96
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,942
Feels wrong somehow
to go out on dates

97
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,650
while I'm doubting everyone.

98
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,817
[TOHKA]
Oh, good morning, Shido!

99
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,858
I'm sorry,
were you waiting long?

100
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,275
[SHIDO] Not at all.
You're right on time.

101
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,983
[TOHKA giggling]

102
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,692
[SHIDO] This has to be Tohka.
I mean, look at her.

103
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,650
[TOHKA]
Is anything wrong, Shido?

104
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,150
You seem a lot more quiet
than usual.

105
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,275
[gasps]
Oh, you think?

106
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,192
Nah, I'm super great. Really.

107
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,025
[REINE]
Try to relax, Shin.

108
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,817
Remember, she's good at this.

109
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
You won't see through
her disguise easily.

110
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,108
Let's try to shake her up a bit.

111
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,733
[SHIDO]
Hmm.

112
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,233
Hey, Tohka.

113
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,442
Would you remind me
when we went out last?

114
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,150
I can't remember.

115
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,275
Huh? What are you talking about?

116
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,442
Have you forgotten that we went
shopping just a few days ago?

117
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,442
Oh, yeah, that's right.

118
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,858
[SHIDO]
She got it. So, what's next?

119
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,692
[TOHKA] But I don't mind
going out again so soon,

120
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,025
just so you know.

121
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:48,108
It's one of the things
that makes me the happiest.

122
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:49,567
Tohka.

123
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,692
[SHIDO]
Ha. I'm totally onto you.

124
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:55,775
Huh?

125
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,608
You play Tohka well.
Right, Natsumi?

126
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,567
[growls]

127
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,483
Wait, are you not...

128
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,900
Shido, who the heck
is this Natsumi?!

129
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,442
--Eh?
--Don't try to pretend

130
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,900
like you didn't just blurt out
another girl's name, Shido!

131
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,567
You better tell me where
this other girl is right now!

132
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,067
No. You misunderstood.

133
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,983
That's a kind of a greeting.

134
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,692
It started in an island
down south.

135
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,192
And now it's caught on
in Japan, too.

136
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,733
Natsumi! Natsumi! See?

137
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,275
[TOHKA]
Is that true?

138
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,483
Wow, what an incredible lie.

139
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,108
It's so bad
it almost has to be real.

140
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,817
[TOHKA] Oh, okay, well,
I guess that makes sense.

141
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,692
So, when they use "Natsumi"
as a greeting,

142
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,150
what does it mean?

143
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,150
Um, well, I'm pretty sure

144
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,733
it means "I love you,"
or something close.

145
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,442
[gasps]
I see!

146
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,108
[giggles]

147
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:46,525
Oh, also, what did you mean
when you said I play Tohka well?

148
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,108
[SHIDO whimpers]

149
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,567
Wow, Tohka, check it out!

150
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,275
That restaurant is totally
doing a lunch buffet!

151
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,858
We have to get in there
and take advantage!

152
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,942
You wanna get lunch?
Sure, I mean, I could eat.

153
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:00,942
All right.
Let's go do it, then.

154
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:04,358
[SHIDO] Wait a minute,
what is this reaction?

155
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,942
Normally, one mention of food
would instantly cheer her up.

156
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:14,025
[REINE] So far we've had
no detection of Natsumi.

157
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,150
How has it felt on your end?

158
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:18,775
I'm thinking it's gotta be
the real Tohka.

159
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,525
But, we're here to eat lunch
and she seems so...

160
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:26,400
--[REINE] Problem?
--What?

161
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,067
Is something the matter, Shido?

162
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
[SHIDO]
Oh, no.

163
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,400
No way. Tohka only filled
half her plate?

164
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:34,483
Strange.
I wonder if she's sick.

165
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,733
That's absurd!

166
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,775
She's always a bottomless pit
no matter what.

167
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,900
Hey, were you waiting for me?

168
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,400
Thanks, let's eat up.

169
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,608
Uh... right. Yeah, we should.

170
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,525
[SHIDO]
Is it true?

171
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,817
Is Tohka really Natsumi?

172
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,608
--[TOHKA] Thanks for the lunch.
--Huh?

173
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:52,650
You're done?

174
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,150
--[TOHKA sighs]
--[stomach growls]

175
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,858
What's wrong, Tohka?

176
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,275
That couldn't have been
enough food for you.

177
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:02,192
No, it's okay.
I saw something on TV.

178
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,525
[TV WOMAN]
You have to be careful.

179
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,358
Girls who regularly eat
a lot more than guys

180
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,358
can sometimes
be a real turnoff.

181
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,525
[gasps]

182
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:12,317
See, the thing is, I didn't want
you to be turned off by me,

183
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,858
so I thought I would eat less.

184
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,858
Actually, I really prefer girls

185
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:19,442
who are happy to scarf
down lots of food.

186
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,650
[gasps]
Do you mean it?!

187
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,692
[SHIDO]
Yeah, it's definitely Tohka.

188
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,275
Fine. But we still
can't dismiss her just yet.

189
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:31,692
Stay with Tohka
and let her finish eating,

190
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:35,483
but make sure to get back home
by at least 3:00.

191
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,108
Your next date will come over
and meet you there.

192
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,817
[doorbell dings]

193
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,108
Yeah, hang on, I'm coming.

194
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:47,150
--[YOSHINON] Boo!
--[screams]

195
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,650
[YOSHINON] Might wanna be
more careful, Shido.

196
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,067
Uh, right, thanks.

197
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,317
I just wasn't
expecting to see you.

198
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,567
Then I guess today's
your lucky day!

199
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,275
Ah, man. [sighs]

200
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,108
Sorry about that, Yoshino.

201
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:05,525
Yoshinon kind of surprised me.

202
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:06,650
[gasps]

203
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,025
[YOSHINO]
Uh, trick or treat.

204
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,817
If you don't give me any candy,
I think I have to prank you.

205
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,233
[gasps]

206
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,358
[YOSHINO]
Shido, this is so...

207
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,525
I have to say, I never thought

208
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:29,275
you'd come here
trick-or-treating.

209
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:33,483
Afraid we're all out of candy.
I hope the hotcakes will do.

210
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,942
This is a first for me.
I've never had them.

211
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,358
I see. Well, I hope you enjoy.

212
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:48,900
[gasps]

213
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,108
Ah! Ah! Ah!

214
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,775
--[YOSHINO chuckles]
--[SHIDO laughs]

215
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,025
You had the same reaction

216
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,775
the first time
you came here, remember?

217
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,150
Let me see...

218
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:04,192
Remind me what it was
you ate that day.

219
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,775
Oh, what was it?

220
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,567
That's right,
you made oyakodon for me.

221
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,358
Ah, yes, that was it.

222
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:17,358
[YOSHINON] Huh? What are you
talking about, Shido?

223
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,025
That doesn't ring
a bell to me.

224
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,817
You don't remember?

225
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,025
No. I wonder, though,

226
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,567
do you think it could've
been during that time

227
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,608
when I stayed over
at Origami's?

228
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,108
Oh, yeah, I forgot
that ever happened.

229
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,858
I actually had to invade
Origami's place

230
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:32,608
to get you back, didn't I?

231
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,733
--[whispering]
--Uh-huh. I should?

232
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:38,067
[YOSHINON]
Come on, just do it!

233
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,483
What would you think
about sharing this with me?

234
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,067
Huh? No, that's okay.

235
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,358
I mean, I made those
especially for you.

236
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,733
Oh. All right, fine,
we can share.

237
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,108
Give me a bite.

238
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,858
[gasps]
Say ah.

239
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:56,233
A-Ahhh...

240
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,983
Isn't that yummy?

241
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,942
[SHIDO]
Mm-hmm. It really is.

242
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,067
[gasps]

243
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,317
Shido, you've got
a little syrup.

244
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,150
Huh? Where is it?

245
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,733
[YOSHINON]
Ooh!

246
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,067
Um, hotcakes are like halfway

247
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,775
between a food
and a candy, actually.

248
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:21,150
So that's why...
Why I just...

249
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,108
It was just a prank, okay?!

250
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,442
[YOSHINON]
Woo-hoo!

251
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,233
You go, girl!

252
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,483
Hey, Reine.

253
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:31,858
I think that was
the real Yoshino, don't you?

254
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,150
[REINE]
Well, who knows, really?

255
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,650
[SHIDO]
So, who's up next on the agenda?

256
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:39,525
[REINE]
Right. Hiroto Tonomachi.

257
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,692
[REINE]
Tohka, Yoshino, and Tonomachi.

258
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,567
We're three dates down
with no real leads

259
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,150
on what we're looking for.

260
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,775
None of their behavior
seemed any different

261
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:52,483
than usual to any of us.

262
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,983
I'd prefer not to call
that whole thing

263
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,858
with Tonomachi a date
if that's okay.

264
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,525
[REINE] Shin, think you can
handle one more?

265
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,192
Yuzuru is already
waiting for you

266
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,108
at the designated location.

267
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,650
Absolutely.

268
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:08,317
--[SHIDO] Sorry, Yuzuru.
--Offended.

269
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Some nerve, inviting me here
and arriving late.

270
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,400
What do you have to say?

271
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,983
So sorry.
I was running a bit behind.

272
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,400
[YUZURU]
Hmm. Pardoned. It's all right.

273
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:19,733
You'll find I have a big heart,

274
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:23,233
so we will just call those
five minutes an anomaly.

275
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,025
[sighs]

276
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,358
[YUZURU] Are you unhappy
that I'm the only one here?

277
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,400
Huh?

278
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,900
No, that's not it at all.

279
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,400
I-I was just thinking
what a rare occasion this is.

280
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,942
Negative.

281
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,858
Please don't feel as if you need
to make some kind of excuse.

282
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:46,192
Kaguya and I are of
one heart and mind.

283
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,358
In fact, what you said,
it only serves to validate

284
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,775
how closely she and I
are bound together.

285
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,108
[chuckles]

286
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,942
[YUZURU]
Question.

287
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:00,150
Is there anything wrong
that I should know about?

288
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,400
You've never called me out
this late.

289
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, nothing.
I just thought it might be nice

290
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:07,567
to talk with you alone
once in a while.

291
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,567
Bad idea?

292
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,192
Negative. It's not bad at all.

293
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,525
But if that's the case...

294
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:15,817
[gasps]

295
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,150
Y-Yuzuru?

296
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,567
Selfishness. Just for tonight,

297
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,942
Shido is mine and mine alone.

298
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:25,442
And it's nice.

299
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,525
Suggestion.

300
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,317
Shido, shall we take
a walk together?

301
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,275
Whoa...

302
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:41,525
Admiration. It's beautiful.

303
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,358
[SHIDO]
Yeah, it sure is.

304
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,775
Advice. Whenever a girl says
that something is beautiful,

305
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:51,983
it's common knowledge

306
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,150
the only appropriate response
from a guy is,

307
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,733
"But you are more beautiful."

308
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:58,233
Huh? Is that really how it is?

309
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:01,108
[YUZURU] Affirmative.
That is just how it is.

310
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:04,692
Well, you are more beautiful.

311
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,025
[YUZURU sighs]

312
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,733
Happiness.
Do you mean it, though?

313
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,983
Uh... huh?

314
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,775
Confrontation.

315
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,817
--Shido?
--Yeah?

316
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,192
What is it?

317
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,942
Question. Answer, please.

318
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:23,733
When it comes to Kaguya and me,
which of us do you like more?

319
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,692
[SHIDO] I can't answer that
off the top of my head.

320
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,400
You're both too precious.

321
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:33,025
[chuckles]
Disdain. Good grief, Shido.

322
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,067
You picked the most pathetic
and lazy answer

323
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,608
that there ever was.

324
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:37,983
What did you expect?

325
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,650
You popped that question
out of nowhere.

326
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,817
[YUZURU]
Concession.

327
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,067
Okay, then,
if I gave you enough time,

328
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,442
do you think you would be
able to answer me?

329
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,025
[SHIDO]
Uh... Ah... Uh...

330
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:56,358
If I do that, which answer
are you hoping to hear?

331
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,692
[YUZURU]
Response.

332
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,775
If you end up choosing Kaguya,

333
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,275
then I'll agree
and you're a good person.

334
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:05,150
I'd be disappointed in you
if you chose me.

335
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,692
Yeah, I did not expect that.

336
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,733
[YUZURU]
Addition.

337
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,775
If you were to
choose me instead,

338
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,733
I'd be happy.

339
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:18,650
[SHIDO]
Hmm.

340
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,150
Well, which is it in the end?

341
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:24,025
[YUZURU]
Sigh. It's just like I said.

342
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,983
I'd be fine with your choosing
either one of us.

343
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,817
However, your answer
was gutless.

344
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,650
That was a bummer, Shido.
You're a big chicken.

345
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,608
[SHIDO groans]

346
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,942
--[YUZURU] Although...
--[SHIDO] Hmm?

347
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,317
[YUZURU]
Petition.

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,067
One thing. Promise me this.

349
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,650
If Kaguya ever comes to you

350
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,608
and asks you to answer
the same question that I did,

351
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,025
when the time comes,

352
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:50,025
I want you to tell her
that she's the one you choose.

353
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,233
Prediction.

354
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,358
Kaguya will get mad at you.

355
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,108
She'll want to know
why you didn't pick me.

356
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:00,983
But deep inside, she'll be
so happy that it hurts.

357
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,442
[SHIDO]
Yuzuru...

358
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,775
Confidence.

359
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,692
Kaguya may behave strangely,

360
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,442
but she really does
love you very much.

361
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,442
And this is me saying it,
so it must be true.

362
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:14,733
The things that Kaguya hates,
I hate as well.

363
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,317
And likewise.

364
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,567
The things that I love,
Kaguya loves just as much.

365
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,817
Careless.
I said more than I meant to.

366
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,025
Before I blurt out
anything else,

367
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,483
I should just go.

368
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,192
Come on, please stay.

369
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:34,108
Petition.
What I've said to you is no lie.

370
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,942
Kaguya really is
extremely taken by you.

371
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:41,317
So, please, do me a favor,
be good to her for me.

372
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,317
Uh... Wait, Yuzuru!

373
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,733
Come back!

374
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,108
[KOTORI] And? You just came
right home after that?

375
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,650
After a date, you made a girl
walk home at night

376
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,400
in the dark all by herself?

377
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,233
I gotta say,
you are not impressing me

378
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:01,525
with these choices.

379
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:04,275
Sorry. It all happened so fast.

380
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:06,525
There's not much else
that could've been done.

381
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,733
From start to finish,

382
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,858
Shin has worked very hard today.

383
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,567
Look, I'm well aware of that.

384
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,233
Going on four dates
in a single day

385
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:16,525
wouldn't necessarily be
an easy task for anybody.

386
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,233
So, Shido,

387
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:21,442
Tohka, Yoshino,
Tonomachi, and Yuzuru.

388
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,983
Any thoughts on whether
or not Natsumi

389
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,358
might've been impersonating
one of them?

390
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:28,817
[SHIDO]
Hmm. I just can't say for sure.

391
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,650
I want so much to believe
everyone was real.

392
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,192
Great, don't tell me
you ever thought

393
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,108
this would be easy.

394
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,275
No suspicious readings
on Fraxinus.

395
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:40,025
So I agree with Shin,
if that helps.

396
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,817
Until we get more data
from the next round of dates,

397
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,400
it's anyone's guess.

398
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,358
Ugh! Fine. Then go
and get some rest, Shido.

399
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:51,650
You'll be no help to us
if you're sleep-deprived.

400
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:52,942
Screw up your dates tomorrow

401
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,858
and it'll be a problem
for more than just you.

402
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,317
Thanks for that.

403
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,192
Reine, tomorrow starts at 10:00,
is that right?

404
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:04,150
Yes, and the first
of the day is Kotori.

405
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,525
Now, I see. That's why--

406
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,317
No. You are so wrong.

407
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,775
Just, as the commander,
I feel...

408
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:09,775
Ahh--

409
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,067
Why are you all spaced out?!

410
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,567
Go to bed already!

411
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,983
[YUZURU]
Return. Hello, I'm back home.

412
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,608
[KAGUYA]
Yuzuru?

413
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,775
Hey, what was
your urgent business?

414
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:27,275
Trivial. Just something
I needed to take care of.

415
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,733
It is time, Haniel.

416
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,942
I'll pick the first one.

417
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,108
Will you even be able
to guess who I am,

418
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:52,317
before every last one is taken?

419
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,567
[laughs]

420
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,442
--[doorbell dinging]
--[pounding on door]

421
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:05,942
[SHIDO yawns] What's the deal?
It's so early in the morning.

422
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,817
--Shido!
--K-Kaguya?

423
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,275
She's gone...

424
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,817
When I woke up, Yuzuru was gone!

425
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,275
[REINE]
How's Kaguya?

426
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,233
[SHIDO] Better than
she was this morning.

427
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:30,525
To be safe, I'm having Tohka
and Yoshino stay with her.

428
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,150
I think she'll be okay.

429
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,400
[REINE] Yuzuru had to be
taken to Ratatoskr HQ

430
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,358
for an urgent exam.

431
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,900
Or so we'll say.

432
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:46,275
Though, if Kaguya
is Natsumi disguised,

433
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,983
then it's a completely
pointless lie.

434
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:52,608
Reine, your thoughts?
Who could take Yuzuru?

435
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,067
Are we sure it was Natsumi?

436
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,150
Yes.

437
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,525
Look at this.

438
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,775
[SHIDO]
Is that...

439
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,900
[REINE]
Video from a security camera.

440
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,608
The 12 people Natsumi identified
with those photos

441
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,817
are being watched
around the clock.

442
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,983
This is footage
from last night.

443
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,733
I don't see anything
out of the ordinary here.

444
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,233
Keep watching.

445
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,192
[SHIDO]
Hey, that's Natsumi's--!

446
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,608
[SHIDO]
Yuzuru!

447
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,067
[REINE]
As you can see,

448
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,900
Yuzuru has been abducted
by Natsumi's Angel.

449
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:34,358
Also, it's likely that
whoever she's impersonating

450
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:37,567
has been erased this way, too.

451
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,942
Natsumi...

452
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,567
I don't understand.
Why do this?

453
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,025
Deciphering her intentions
can wait.

454
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:45,858
Right now, we have to focus.

455
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,733
Keep people safe.

456
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:49,733
I do believe in Natsumi.

457
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,067
I think this is
just a game to her.

458
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,442
Which is why I'm going
to put an end to all this.

459
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:58,442
Before anyone else disappears.

460
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:03,067
[KOTORI] I agree, Shido.
Let's not spare any effort.

461
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,525
So I guess it's about time
we begin our date.

462
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,525
[SHIDO] How can I know
that in the days that followed

463
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:13,317
I would learn just
how powerless I truly was.
