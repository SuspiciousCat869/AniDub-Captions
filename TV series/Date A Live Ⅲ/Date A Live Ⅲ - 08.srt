It wasn't exactly my first time

exactly easy on me, were you?

Well, then,

I'm gonna assume you haven't
come by for a tea party.

11
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:43,150
[ORIGAMI] I have an
important question for you.

12

[KURUMI]
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

13

I mean, I can't promise
I'll answer it,

15
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,525
but let's see, shall we?

16
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:53,275
Zaphkiel is an Angel
who manipulates time, correct?

17
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:56,150
Also, each and every
one of those 12 dials

18
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,567
has a different kind of power.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,942
So my question is,

20
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,650
of the 12,
does one have a bullet

21
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,733
that'll send someone
to the past?

22
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,358
Just out of curiosity,

23
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,483
what would you say
if there was one?

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,025
That I want to borrow
your power.

25
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,650
My, my.

26
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,525
You're actually suggesting that
I use Yod Bet for your sake?

27
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,775
Is that really
what you're asking me?

28
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:18,900
[ORIGAMI]
Yes.

29
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,067
Well then, here's my answer.

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,442
It's unfortunate.

31
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:26,733
I hate disappointing people,
you know?

32
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:29,442
You may be blessed
with incredible power,

33
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,900
but it means nothing
if you can't hit me.

34
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:35,692
Uh-oh. I think I'm being
rather underestimated right now.

35
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,858
Just 'cause
I'm a curious kind of girl,

36
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:41,942
what exactly would you be doing
with Yod Bet if I had agreed?

37
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:43,442
Simple.

I want to go

00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,567
I have to go back there.

41
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,817
I have to try and fix it

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,775
so that my mom and dad's deaths
never happened.

43
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:58,733
I'll change history,
if you'll help me.

[KURUMI]
How interesting.

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,108
I have to wonder,
what is your plan

46
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,942

Well, whatever.

50
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,400
As a matter of fact,
I was a little nervous

51
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,608
about using the Yod Bet

52
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:20,400
without having tested it out
on anyone first.

53
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,358
So I guess I can just use you
as my guinea pig,

that she would become a Spirit?

It seems like her reaction
suddenly vanished.

221
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,067
Do you think it's possible

222
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,775
she could have
Spirit wave suppression powers?

223
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,483
Is that what
you're thinking, too?

224
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:28,817
If she's a Spirit,

225
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,525
then she knows
she'll be hunted by us.

226
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:34,025
So of course
she would hide herself.

Maybe.

That would undoubtedly be smart,

such trouble

understanding their actions

231

is what makes Spirits Spirits,
wouldn't you say?

You never know.

233
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:49,858

over us right now as we speak.

If I had to say why,

the simplest answer
is that I want proof.
