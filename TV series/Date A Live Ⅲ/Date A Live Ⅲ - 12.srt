Got it down?!

164
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:08,858
[KOTORI] Listen, I wanna get
one thing straight

165
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,400
before we start.

166
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,817
This isn't the time to screw
around with our choices, got it?

167
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,692
Of course not, Commander.

168
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,817
Your lowly, unworthy dog,
Kyouhei Kannazuki

169
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,692
will surmount
dear Shido's defenses

170
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,150
no matter what it takes!

171
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,525
Okay, that wording
kinda creeps me out.

172
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,942
I have something
I'd like to say.

173
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,733
If we're using a beach, anyway,

174
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,733
I don't understand why
we didn't choose a nudist one

175
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,567
like I originally suggested.

176
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,025
--[gasping]
--Um, 'cause it's scary?

177
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,192
[ORIGAMI] But if our main goal
is to get Shido excited,

178
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,317
it'd be a lot more effective
to catch him off guard.

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,775
Just think about it,
if everyone was naked,

180
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,233
we would've already heard
that fanfare by now.

181
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,442
[KOTORI]
Look, that might be true

182
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,067
but there are lines
I'm not willing to cross

183
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,400
and this is one of them!

184
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:50,233
While I get
what you're saying, Origami,

185
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:52,983
I feel like that might have
the opposite effect.

186
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,733
His shock might actually
exceed his excitement.

187
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:58,692
I see. Guess I'll strip
bit by bit, then.

188
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,567
That's the way to do it!

189
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,108
I'd argue there are
many ways to proceed.

190
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:06,358
Origami and the vice commander,
they make a pretty good team.

191
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,692
Yeah, it seems like

192
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,525
they're always on
the same wavelength, doesn't it?

193
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,525
Must be all those hobbies
they both share.

194
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:12,817
Everyone ready?

195
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,775
Then let's get this conquest
of Shido underway.

196
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,900
Do we any volunteers
to go first?

197
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,067
Duh. A true warrior is always
the first to get to a battle.

198
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,025
Now, let's get
this ball rolling.

199
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,400
Honor. Kaguya and I
can get this done.

200
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,567
[KANNAZUKI]
All right!

201
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,525
The Yamai Sisters
are the first up to bat.

202
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,358
That's the Hurricane Children
for you.

203
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,900
Rushing ahead fiercely
like the wind.

204
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,483
[SHIDO]
Two girls at once, huh?

205
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,192
Be gentle with me, okay?

206
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,275
Kaguya. Yuzuru.

207
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:47,275
Sure, but prepare yourself.

208
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,483
You're about to fall
for us so hard, dude.

209
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,358
There's no doubt.
A knockout in a single round.

210
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,358
Here we go, everyone.

211
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,692
Please make your choice.

212
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,900
Huh, should it be one or two?

213
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,525
Aww! Why would you
ignore option three?!

214
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,692
Just do it!

215
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,025
Strap a rope around
his neck like reins!

216
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,733
It's the only way, you hear me?

217
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,317
You have to go with option three
and ride Shido like a human--

218
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,900
[KANNAZUKI]
Uh, g-guys?

219
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,067
What are you doing?

220
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,942
[gasps]
Coup d'etat? Revolution?

221
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,317
[KAWAGOE] The commander
left orders to tie you up

222
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,733
if you started
screwing around.

223
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,858
[KANNAZUKI]
Oh, what a commander!

224
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,483
In that case,
you can tie me up tighter.

225
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,733
What's wrong with you?
The left side is way too slack.

226
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,150
What does that idiot
even think he's doing?

227
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,983
I guess that means
it'll be number two

228
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,108
or the squeeze attack,

229
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,525
which is no big shocker,
if we're honest.

230
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,108
So, hey, guys.

231
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,192
--What's goin' on?
--[YUZURU, KAGUYA growl]

232

[SHIDO]
Hmm...

233
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,567
What do you think?
Like it, Shido?

234
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,317
Don't our feminine charms
make your heart go a-flutter?

235
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,733
Agreement.

236
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,275
It's no point in trying
to lie to yourself, you know.

237
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,275
Feel. See?

238
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:54,067
Of course,
what guy wouldn't like it?

239
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,858
But it's a little much
with both of you at once.

240
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,275
I can't really focus.

241

[KAGUYA, YUZURU]
Wha...

242
00:10:58,608 --> 00:10:59,775
Dumbfounded.

243
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,775
Shido doesn't seem fazed
in the slightest.

244
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:03,858
But, hey, thanks anyway.

245

You're putting
so much thought into this.

I want you to know,
I appreciate it.

--[KAGUYA] Wait, we failed?
--Embarrassment.

for some reason.

[REINE]
Wait, cheer up, girls.

250

Appearances can be deceiving.

but his excitement
level's climbing.

What gives?

You only got ice cream
for yourselves?

Not gonna lie,
I'm kinda bummed out.

[KAGUYA] Hmph. That's a
hasty conclusion, Shido.

Bestow.

One of these ice creams
is all for you.

Sorry to interrupt,

fall for you hard.

He's not kidding.
You two really got me good.

[SHIDO]
So, next is Natsumi, right?

You volunteered to go
next all on your own?

Thank you for that.

This condition
of yours is absurd.

to manage this,

but to make you fall for me?

That's definitely not true.

even own the game, does she?

just play by herself.

It is quite a shift in mood.

[KOTORI] I thought you might be
bored of the beach.

From now on, it's adult time.
Elegant, grown-up time.

How is it you manage
to be so handsome, anyway?

I mean, does it really
make a difference to you?

Whenever I spend time
thinking about you,

I get all warm
and tingly inside.

Something wrong?

365

No, it's just that
when I heard Origami

366
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,942
talking about how much
she loved Shido,

367
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,358
I felt my chest
clenching up right here.

I know saving Shido
should be my priority, but...

I'm having a pretty hard time
letting go of this feeling.

keep getting in the way.

I don't think that's a silly
thought at all, though, Tohka.

Yeah. It's probably
the most important emotion

you'll rely on to save Shido.

477
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,817
[TOHKA] But it's different from
how I feel for the others.

478
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,567
It's a love
that's only for Shido.

479
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,358
That's why...

480
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:09,400
Shido, I'm here.

481
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,442
[TOHKA groaning]

482
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,733
Hey, Tohka, sure you don't
want me to do that?

483
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,692
No, thanks.

484
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:27,067
This is important,

485
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,275
I'm the only one who didn't
get you to fall for me.

486
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,317
And so...

487
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,025
[SHIDO]
Tohka...

488
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,650
[TOHKA]
All done, Shido.

489
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:34,900
Tasty, right?

490
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,192
[SHIDO]
Mm! Yeah, it is.

491
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,192
Did it work?
Did your heart skip a beat?

492
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,275
[SHIDO]
You know, it totally did.

493
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:44,192
