[NARRATOR]
One girl transforms,

2
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,817
now bright, kind, and cheerful.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,817
But someone else changes, too,

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,942
into something dark,
fierce, and cruel.

5
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,858
[gasps]

6
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,400
I-I'm sorry.
Did it happen again?

7
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,025
Did what happen?

8
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:03,817
[ORIGAMI]
Nothing. My apologies.

9
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,733
Lately, I've been having
these blackout moments

10
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,483
where my mind goes blank.

11
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,650
It goes blank, as in...

12
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,733
[chuckles]
It's nothing to worry about.

13
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,817
I'm probably anemic
or something.

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,275
Anyway, I guess
you read your note?

15
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,858
The one I left on your desk?

16
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:19,067
Uh... Yeah.

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,567
Are you still free
on Saturday?

18
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,025
[ORIGAMI] Oh, sorry, there's
somewhere I have to be!

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,150
Kurumi, you can
stop hiding now.

20
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,442
[KURUMI giggles]

21
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,525
You know me too well.
Crazy, huh?

22
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,608
This really does make it
a lot harder to understand

23
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:38,275
why Origami turned inverse,
wouldn't you say?

24
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,817
Yeah.

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,108
But this Origami was able to
accept the death of her parents.

26
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:45,192
I don't get it.
What happened?

27
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,983
[KOTORI] Let me see
if I've got this straight.

28
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:51,067
So you're saying
this world exists

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,400
'cause you used Kurumi's
time travel powers.

30
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,358
And you did that
to save Origami's parents

31
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,317
who should've died
five years ago.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,942
And the purpose
of that was to avoid

33
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,525
what she would've turned into.

34
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,775
Yeah, that's the gist of it.

35
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:05,525
[KOTORI]
Hmm. Fascinating.

36
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:07,900
I think now I get why you've
been acting a little strange

37
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,692
for the last day or so.

38
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,067
It's true.

39
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,525
Maybe Origami shouldn't have
inversed in this world.

40
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,858
Regardless, she definitely did.

41
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:19,108
And now we have Devil
to contend with.

42
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:22,067
I've analyzed her encounter
with Shin on the roof.

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,317
He's telling the truth,
believe it or not.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,692
Origami Tobiichi
hasn't the faintest idea

45
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,692
that she's a Spirit.

46
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,192
But how can that be?

47
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,400
[REINE] Shin, you managed
to change the course of time.

48
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,067
So you and Kurumi
are the only ones

49
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,275
with actual knowledge
of the original world, correct?

50
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,608
Yeah.

51
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,067
And as for Kurumi,

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,692
considering her own powers
are what brought this about,

53
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,733
she's kind of an exception.

54
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:48,233
So if I had to guess
from everything you've told me,

55
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,817
in order to retain knowledge
of the original world,

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,733
two conditions must be met:

57
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,150
Being directly hit
by Kurumi's Yod Bet,

58
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:59,442
and having Spirit powers
flowing through one's self.

59
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,900
With both conditions met,
it's possible that one's memory

60
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:05,733
of the original world
may be recovered.

61
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,942
[KOTORI] We know that Origami
was shot by Kurumi's Yod Bet,

62
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,192
so the first condition was met.

63
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:13,442
Separately, she's ended up
living a peaceful life,

64
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,775
thanks to Shido's interference.

65
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,525
[KOTORI] But then, when
Phantom showed up on the scene

66
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,692
and gave her Spirit powers...

67
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,858
[SHIDO] She finally
remembered everything.

68
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,525
[REINE] However,
as a self-defense mechanism,

69
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,067
her memories were split in two.

70
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,150
Essentially, there's one Origami
who lives in peace,

71
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,317
and then there's
the Spirit hunter, Devil.

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,775
[SHIDO grunts]

73
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:39,775
[REINE] So now, as soon as
Origami senses Spirit power,

74
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,317
she loses control
of her mind and memory.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,067
[KOTORI] And then
the Inverse version of her

76
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,483
is awakened.

77
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,400
The theory works and is
consistent with what we know.

78
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:50,733
The question is,
what can we do about it?

79
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,233
As long as Origami's a Spirit,

80
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,775
there's only one thing
for Ratatoskr to do.

81
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:56,358
Huh?

82
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,025
Make her fall for me, right?

83
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,192
Correct.

84
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,192
That's how we'll seal
her spirit powers.

85
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:04,358
You'll need to convince Origami
to go out on a date with you.

86
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:06,983
Think you can handle that,
lover boy?

87
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,983
Ugh. What now,
is there a problem?

88
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,483
Nothing, it's just...

89
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:12,983
[KOTORI]
Huh?!

90
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,025
You've already promised to
meet up with her this Saturday?!

91
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,692
So you hit on her before even
knowing that she was a Spirit?

92
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,400
The heck?! Dude.

I wrote him a note.

Oh, it's from him.

Okay, gotta reply.

"Yes, thank you, that time
and date will work for me."

could we maybe do

Mm-hmm, that seems right to me.

I hated to pass up
the first choice,

but going someplace
where they can't talk

is a pretty classic blunder.

Plus, choice number two
is a safe and versatile option.

[SHIDO]
Origami is after me now.

Our only chance to seal her

00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,067
is to do it while
her armor is incomplete!

I sense a dreadful Spirit power.

00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,525
You're right. That's Origami.

[SHIDO] It's far too dangerous
to fight her.

I should probably
tell you all to run away.

But I am begging you
to help me save her anyway.

[ORIGAMI]
Where am I?

Did I lose...
consciousness again?

360
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,775
I thought I was
just with Itsuka.

such a copycat?!

I would've ended up
doing something else

I'd never be able
to take back.

[ORIGAMI] The fact that
I killed my mom and dad

go away for me.

Listen... I feel like
I need to apologize...

00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:38,775
The feelings I've had
towards you

463
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,275
weren't actually love.

I got two feelings confused,
I think.

I felt I could rely on you.

466

But now I realize
that when I lost my parents,

467
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,233
I had no other choice
but to cling to you.

Well, I'm honored.

But it took bravery to trust me.

Good morning, Shido.

483
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,525
Morning, Origami.

484
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,942
[chuckles]

485
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,608
[ORIGAMI] Here. I have something
to wipe your tears with.

486
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:11,733
Thank you.

00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,858
Wha...
Origami, what are you doing?!

School swimsuit.

491
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,275
It retains moisture well.

492
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,483
[BOTH gasp]

493
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:27,817
Oh, I picked these up
for you, too.

494
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,317
Okay, I'm a little confused.

495
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,567
Because when all that happened,

496
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,567
didn't you say you never
loved me to begin with?

497
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,983
Yeah, which means
our real love story

498
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,650
can start now.

499
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,650
[SHIDO whimpers]

500
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,692
You better stay away from Shido!

501
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:43,567
--Get off him!
