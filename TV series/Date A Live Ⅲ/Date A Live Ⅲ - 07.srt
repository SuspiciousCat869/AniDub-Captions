all alone in a bathroom stall

I forgot to lock the door,

so, of course,
a girl from my class came in

eating sadly on the toilet.

went back to class,

327
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,567
What if I really
could make that happen?

328
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,525
[SHIDO]
I see.

329
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,525
So Origami's a Spirit now.

330
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:24,400
I mean, I don't really know
all the details.

331
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,233
By the time she came back,
she was already...

[groans]

333
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,858
It's okay, you should rest.

[sighs]

335
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,525
[YOSHINO]
Um, are you okay?

336
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:44,067
[YOSHINON]
Wow, you really took a beating.

337
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,400
Nah, for real. I'm good.

338
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,650
Big sigh. Kaguya's faking it.

339
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,483
Shut up, Yuzuru.
I am perfectly fine!

340

[groans]

341
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,025
[NATSUMI]
I'm ugly and worthless and dirty

342
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,983
like a steaming pile of trash.

343
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,358
But trash can be recycled

344
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,900
so I'm actually
worse than trash.

345
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:03,942
[SHIDO] She used a bunch
of her power doing first aid.

[MIKU groaning]

347
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400
[SHIDO]
Miku, don't push yourself.

348
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:12,275
Heh. It's really sweet of you to
be so worried about me, darling.

349
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,483
But as long as
I have some power,

350
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,817
I still have a job to do.

351
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,025
What job is that?

352
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:21,442
Gabriel. Now Requiem.

353
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:27,067
Hello, and welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,192
You're in for a real treat
with tonight's special show.

355
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,608
Miku Izayoi, now on stage.

[BOTH gasp]

360
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:51,442
Amazement. It's like my pain
is fading away.

361
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,900
This song's especially
for pain relief.

362
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,817
Not that it actually
accomplishes all that much.

363
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,608
Thanks for that, Miku.

364
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:03,358
I know. Let's get you
to the hospital

365
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,358
while the song's still working.

Can you walk, Tohka?

367
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,650
[SHIDO]
I have to seal her, don't I?

368
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,567
[SHIDO] If the AST
are able to detect her,

369
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,108
they might sound the alarm.

370
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,067
[TOHKA]
What's bothering you, Shido?

371
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,317
[SHIDO]
Uh, nothing. But, uh, got a sec?

372
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,192
[TOHKA] Are you okay?
What are you doing?

373
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,275
Um, well, it's just...

Oh. I see.

376
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,400
So what you're saying
is that right now,

377
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,858
right here,
we're gonna have to kiss?

378
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,942
Um, I...

379
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,233
Yeah, I think
we kind of have to.

[TOHKA sighs]

381
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,858
Hey, Shido.

00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,525
Huh?

00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,358
[NATSUMI]
I can't see anything.

Shh. You have to be quiet.

Could you please stop moving?

Uh, hi, Ms. Tamae.

Whoa! What a hideous injury.

Huh?

394
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,317
I'm afraid you need
the hospital, not the infirmary.

395
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,442
Hold tight
while I make the call.
