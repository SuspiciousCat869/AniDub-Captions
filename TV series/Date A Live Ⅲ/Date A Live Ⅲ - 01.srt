1
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:53,400
[SHIDO] Thirty years ago,
an unprecedented disaster

2
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,150
called a "spatial quake"
assaulted our world.

3
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,900
[SHIDO] The female life-forms
which caused them

4
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,317
were called "Spirits,"

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,567
but whether the catastrophes

6
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,900
were unintentional
or planned was unclear.

7
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,608
The very existence
of these spirits

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,525
was kept secret
from the public.

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,025
[SHIDO] But I, Shido Itsuka,
know all about them.

10
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:19,067
--[SHIDO whimpering]
--[bubbling]

11
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,483
Go on.
You've gotta taste it, Shido.

12
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,317
[YOSHINON] There's no need
to be shy. Come on, eat it!

13
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:28,108
[SHIDO]
And this... is what?

14
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,650
It's stew. Obviously.

15
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,942
We each had different ideas

16
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,567
about what we should
make for you,

17
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,358
so we just combined them all.

18
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,192
Well, I really appreciate
the thought.

19
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,483
What the heck
did you put in there

20
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,858
to make it look like that?

21
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,650
[KAGUYA] Hm. We kinda
went all out this time.

22
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,400
Everyone got together and tossed
in their favorite foods.

23
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,983
[SHIDO]
Uh-huh...

24
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,275
Aw, well,
that's incredibly thoughtful.

25
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,692
Isn't that just
the most wonderful thing

26
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:55,192
you've ever heard of?

27
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,442
Go on.
Eat some while it's still hot.

28
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,983
[SHIDO groaning]

29
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,233
Hey, Kotori,
you should contribute, too.

30
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:07,025
Go ahead, and make a little
offering to the banquet.

31
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:08,025
Uh...

32
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,650
[ALL giggle]

33
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,067
Uh...

34
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,733
Oh! We keep making it
better and better.

35
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,900
And the color
is even more beautiful.

36
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,483
[SHIDO whimpers]

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,108
--[whimpers]
--[KOTORI] Hmm.

38
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,400
--[SHIDO] Holy crap.
--Well, how is it?

39
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,900
[SHIDO]
Surprisingly good.

40
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,317
--Yay!
--[cheering]

41
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:51,692
Thanks, everyone.
You guys ready to rock?

42
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,650
[KAGUYA] See? I knew
Yuzuru's fried chicken

43
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,817
would be able to tie
all those flavors together.

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,900
[YUZURU]
Negative.

45
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,775
It was Kaguya's
pork cutlet that did it.

46
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,942
It's what made
the broth so savory.

47
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:04,150
What? Nah, it was your chicken.

48
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,067
No way. It was Kaguya's.

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,067
[KOTORI] You two will
never change, will you?

50
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,650
[YOSHINON] Maybe we should
just recognize it

51
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,817
as the miraculous collaboration
that it is and leave it at that.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,483
On TV, they said stew's good
no matter what you put in it,

53
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,233
and now we know it's true.

54
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,817
[KOTORI]
Miraculous is right,

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,108
for something
that looks like this

56
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,983
to end up being edible at all.

57
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,567
Such a bummer
that Miku couldn't be here

58
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,192
to join us for dinner.

59
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,358
Just part of being
an idol I guess.

60
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,150
[MIKU]
Oh, darling!

61
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,858
--[SHIDO] Huh?
--[MIKU] You rang?

62
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,233
[SHIDO]
Huh?

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,150
Surprise!

64
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,317
I heard you calling out to me
through the ether.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,275
I couldn't resist,
so here I am.

66
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:42,150
Miku Izayoi, Spirit idol,
has now arrived.

67
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,858
--Miku?
--Wait.

68
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,900
How are you singing live on TV?

69
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,275
[MIKU] Oh, please.
That was prerecorded.

70
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,525
Anyway, what are you
crazy bunch up to?

71
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,692
It kinda looks like a party

72
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,650
with all of you together
like this.

73
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,275
Oh, as a matter of fact,

74
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,775
now that I think of it,
today's actually my birthday.

75
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,733
Don't worry, all I want
from each one of you

76
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:02,608
is a great big kissy-wissy.

77
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,275
[KAGUYA gasps]
What are you doing?

78
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,442
Defense. Kaguya Barrier.

79
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:07,525
[KAGUYA]
Wait.

80
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:09,817
Stop, Miku.

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,983
Get right back inside that TV!

82
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,150

Come on, don't be shy.

--[YUZURU] Don't move.

Oh, now I get it.

92
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,483
So that's why you're eating
such a strange-smelling stew.

93
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,733
Yeah. Anyway, it's really good
to have you here, Miku.

Here you go. Careful, though,
it's pretty hot.

That's why I warned you.

99
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,400
Oh, darling.
You'll never believe this,

100
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,567
but I seem to have
burned my poor lips.

101
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,733
I'm afraid unless you kiss them,
they won't ever heal.

102

[gasps]

103
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,358
I know what you're
trying to do, Miku!

104
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:06,150
That's not even
how burns work.

105
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,650
My lips hurt, too. Such pain.

106
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,983
It seems I've also
been burned by stew.

107
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,692
I think I require urgent care.

108
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,775
Hey, no fair!

109
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,108

just turn white?!

Let's get on with the next date,
then, shall we?

138
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,483
[KOTORI]
You all set down there?

139
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,400
[SHIDO]
Yep. Whenever you're ready.

140
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:48,025
[SHIDO]
What a weird place. So creepy.

141
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,733
[KOTORI] This park has been
completely abandoned

142
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:52,483
ever since
the Great Spatial Quake.

143
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,567
It's just far enough away
from the redevelopment

144
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,983
that it's remained
untouched to this day.

145
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,608
So, it's just as it was
30 years ago.

146
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:02,817
[KOTORI]
The Spirit we tracked

147
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,358
moved from the spatial quake's
origin site

148
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,858
to somewhere
around that area.

149
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:10,567
You need to make contact
before the AST shows up.

150
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,608
Roger that.

151
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,775
[gasps]
The heck?

152
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,108
What is it?

153
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,400
Strange buildings for a park.

154
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,317
This can't be what it used
to look like, right?

155
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,108
It's faint, but we are
detecting some Spirit waves.

156
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:30,692
Everything you're seeing was
manifested by a Spirit's powers.

157
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,942
Are you hearing that? Shido?

158
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,775
The Spirit we're after
is close by for sure.

--[WOMAN] Oh!
--[gasps]

160

[WOMAN]
What a rare sight.

161
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:40,983
Usually when I'm pulled here,

162
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,192
I never run into anyone
but the AST,

163
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,525
so this is
a pleasant surprise.

164
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:46,733
[chuckles]

165
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,483
There's nothing for you
to be afraid of.

166
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,900
It's not like I'm going
to eat you or anything.

167
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,983
Uh, no, I'm just...

168
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,067
Hey, you're actually
kind of cute, aren't you?

169
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,525
What are you doing
in a place like this?

170
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,442
Aren't there alarms
that warn you to take shelter

171
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,275
whenever a Spirit appears?

172
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:19,942
Well, yeah, but...

173
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,900
[KOTORI]
Shido, our choices.

174
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,983
Everyone, decide.

175
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,233
[beep]

176
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,567
[KOTORI] Well, this one was
pretty straightforward.

177
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,317
[NAKATSUGAWA]
It's gotta be one, right?

178
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,442
Without knowing her temperament,

179
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,483
it makes sense
to keep it direct.

180
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,108
[MINOWA] Wrong. We should go
with choice number two.

181
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,775
This Spirit's a big-sister type.

182
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:43,233
You might not expect it,

183
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,400
but Shido can really tickle
those maternal instincts.

184
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,650
[SHIZAKI]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,525
I'll admit,
there's some truth to that,

186
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:49,692
though I'm kinda shocked.

187
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,025
Not a single person
chose option three?

188
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:53,817
I thought I could
at least count on Kannazuki

189
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,358
to pick it as a joke.

190
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,525
Alas. Her boobs bounce too much.

191
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:00,233
My tastes tend to veer
towards the budding ones.

192
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,067
Now, if we were talking about
licking the back of her knee,

193
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,692
I might have to reconsider.

194
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,650
Huh?

195
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,108
[gasps]
Thank you very yes.

196
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,525
[KOTORI]
Shido, number two.

197
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,733
And give it to her with
your very best puppy dog eyes.

198
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,108
Yeah...

199

--What's the matter, young one?
--[SHIDO gasps]

200
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,567
Well, I, um...

201
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,983
The thing is,
I don't really know.

202
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:25,608
I barely escaped,
and then I ended up here.

203
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,650
Oh. Is that so?

204
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,900
What's your name, love?

205
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,525
Shido Itsuka.

206
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,108
Shido, then.

[chuckles]

208
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,567
That's a really cute name.

209
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,150
You can call me Natsumi.

210
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,525
Although, some of you humans
prefer calling me Witch,

211
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,358
if what I hear is correct.

212
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:42,900
Hello, Miss Natsumi.

213
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,483
[NATSUMI]
That sounds so formal.

214
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,150
Natsumi is fine.

215
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,108
Come here, Shido.

216
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:52,192
Big sis here wants to ask you
a little something special.

Hah. So, may I?

Sure, yeah. Go ahead.

What do you think?
Do you find me pretty?

220
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:03,858
[gasps]
Well, yeah...?

221
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,317
I think you're very pretty.

222
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,692
Yes! Knew it.

223
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,067
Tell me this.

Specifically, what is it
you find pretty about me?

Uh, your hair.

you're right on the money.

lots more compliments,

319
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,650
Then, we'll exchange
a deep, romantic kiss.

320
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,025
You'll pull off my clothes,
take my innocence as a woman.

321
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:51,442
Then you'll leave
your everlasting mark on me,

322
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,025
imbued within my body.

323
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:54,567
[babbles]

324
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,275
[TOHKA] Hold on! He hasn't done
that stuff with anyone, yet!

325
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,942
I'm yours, Shido.

326
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,775
--Do it.
--Look, this is kind of a lot.

327
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,400
Aha! There you are!

328
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,067
I'll give you this,
it's a ballsy move

329
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,650
sticking around school.

330
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,692
Small warning, you'll pay
for what you've done here today.

331
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,483
Oh, man, not you, too.

332
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:14,567
Are you saying I somehow managed
to assault both of you as well?

333
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,775
[KAGUYA]
Feigning ignorance?

334
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,942
Let me tell you something,

335
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,275
if you don't give me
those panties back,

336
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:19,358
you're in trouble!

337
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,567
We hold grudges.

338
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,525
Especially when someone
throws water on me

339
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,192
while yelling that you have
a wet T-shirt fetish.

340
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:27,192
[SHIDO]
Huh? But I would never do that!

341
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,317
It's as if he has
no boundaries at all.

342
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,942
No kidding. This goes beyond
playing around.

343
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,483
He's so lame!

344
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,692
In any case, we won't stand
for this, do you hear me?

345
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,442
It's a crime to defy the Yamai.

346
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,858
Which means you're gonna
have to pay for this!

347
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:41,900
To be specific,

348
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,067
I'll be stripping off
your undies.

349
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,067
Response. Additionally,
I shall use this spray bottle

350
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,108
until your entire naked body
is soaking wet.

351
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,692
No. That's not fair,
I didn't do anything!

352
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:53,942
Oh, you're here.

353
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,275
Look, I have no desire
to become a bride.

354
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,525
But after what you did,
I think I have to.

355
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,442
Wait, even Ms. Tamae?!

356
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,233
Hey, Itsuka, about earlier...

357
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,983
Were you actually serious?

358
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,067
I mean,
I don't know what to say.

359
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,317
[SHIDO]
Urgh!

360
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,483
--You gotta be kidding me!
--That's so lame!

00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:14,608
[MII]
So lame!

00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,900
[sighs]

365
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,608
What in the world
is happening around here?

Wait!

370
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,025
Hey, there. That was quick.

371
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:45,150
I don't get it. Who are you?

372
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,400
[FAKE SHIDO]
Hmph.

373
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,400
The one who was having
all sorts of nasty fun

374
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,358
with your friends
while you were away.

375
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,025
Yeah, I figured.
Who the hell are you?!

376
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,525
What are you after
by impersonating me?

377
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:57,942
[FAKE SHIDO giggling]

378
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,233
--[laughing]
--[SHIDO] Is that funny?

00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,442
It really is,
as a matter of fact.

380
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,650
'Cause, you see...

381
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,150
[NATSUMI]
Somehow, dumb little Shido

382
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,275
still hasn't managed
to figure it out.

383
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,400
You're Natsumi, aren't you?

384
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,608
[NATSUMI]
Ding, ding, ding! Well done.

385
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,233
Surely by now,
you must have realized

386
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:17,775
why I've been impersonating
you here at school, right?

387
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,275
Don't say it.

388
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,900
Shido Itsuka,

389
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:25,275
heed my words,
your life is about to be over!

390
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,733
[SHIDO] So did you do
all those crazy things

391
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:30,317
just so I wouldn't be able
to live here anymore?

392
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,858
[NATSUMI]
Pitiful. I'm docking points.

393
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,983
Fine, tell me why.

394
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,067
[NATSUMI chuckles]

395
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,442
Shido.

396
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,358
Don't you think
it'll be a great adventure

397
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,650
having two of you
out in the world?

398
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,942
Think of the fun.

399
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,858
We can see how far
everyone's willing to go.

400
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,358
From now on, I think
I'll take over as Shido, okay?

401
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,525
Don't worry, I have
quite the observant eye.

402
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:56,692
I won't goof around
like I did with everybody today.

403
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,942
That way, even if you're dead,
no one will suspect a thing.

404
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,567
Look, Natsumi, this is...

00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:06,900
Get off me!

I was here first.

If anyone is going to
track down Shido,

408
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:11,442
it's gonna be me!

409
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,275
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

There are two Shidos?

This guy is an impostor.

running around all day

[SHIDO]
Don't be fooled.

420
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,775
I'm the real one!

421
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:31,942
[FAKE SHIDO]
You're so full of it.

422
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,650
It's obviously me!

423
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:38,900
So I guess, now we figure out
who's the real Shido?

424
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,067
It's a baffling turn.

425
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,233
But if I had to guess...

426
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,650
[BOTH]
You must be the impostor!

427
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,900
Bu-But how could you guys
possibly think that?!

428
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,025
I'm the real Shido.

429
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:51,942
[TOHKA]
You are most definitely not.

430
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,900
Sure, you look
exactly like Shido,

431
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,775
but he has a totally
different smell.

432
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,275
If you were here alone,

433
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:59,650
you might've been able
to deceive me.

434
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:00,942
But standing
next to the real one

435
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:03,900
makes the choice obvious.

436
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:06,150
For example,
compared to the real Shido,

437
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,317
you blink
50 milliseconds faster.

438
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,483
And your center of gravity

439
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,817
is angled point-two degrees
to the left.

440
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,608
[BOTH]
There's no mistaking it!

441
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,650
Ugh, what is wrong
with these girls?

442
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,858
They're all messed up.

443
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:19,150
Well, I won't even
try to deny that.

444
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,567
[NATSUMI] Ugh! This is
just... unbelievable!

445
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,525
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

[NATSUMI]
Unforgivable.

449
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,192
Not only was my secret exposed,
which is unacceptable,

450
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,358
but you also saw right through
my flawless disguise!

451
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:41,525
Never happened.

452
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:43,858
I will never acknowledge
this day.

453
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,150
And don't think
you two are off the hook.

[SHIDO]
Hey, wait!

455
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:58,067
[TOHKA] Shido, who in
the world was that, anyway?

456
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,275
And what's your relationship
with her?

457
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:03,358
[SHIDO] Oh, that's... I mean...
I don't know?

[SHIDO]
It's been five days.

No movement from Natsumi at all.

463
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,608
[SHIDO]
What is she planning to do?

464
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,358
Sorry, but you
totally deserved that.

465
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,775
Kotori, seriously, why...?

466
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,900
Because you screwed up somehow.

467
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:30,983
For whatever reason,

468
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,483
Natsumi now views you
as her enemy.

469
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,067
You'll never be able
to seal her power

470
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,983
unless you can raise
her happiness level.

471
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,608
Yeah, I know that stuff already.

472
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:40,983
Of course,
there's really no knowing

473
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,733
when she might
next appear to you.

474
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,692
Look, though, this showed up
in the mail today.

475
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,067
What is it?

476
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,108
[KOTORI] I don't know,
I haven't opened it yet,

477
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,150
but I did check
to make sure it was safe.

478
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,692
At least you can rest easy.

479
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,900
It shouldn't go boom
or anything like that.

480
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:01,483
[SHIDO]
This is...

481
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,150
Shido, what's wrong?

482
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,733
Twelve photos. And this...

483
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,775
"I'm here, among your friends.

484
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:17,108
Can you take a guess
which one I am?

485
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,483
Before everyone else
disappears, too. Natsumi."

486
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,525
What the heck's that mean?

487
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,400
[KOTORI] Well, if we take
the message at face value,

488
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,525
Natsumi's using her powers
to impersonate someone.

489
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:31,567
And we've got 12 guesses
as to who that might be.

490
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,233
One of your friends.

491
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,983
Yeah, but who?

492
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,400
[KOTORI]
I don't know.

493
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:39,608
But it's possible
she's pretending to be me, too.

494
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:41,192
[gasps]

495
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:44,858
Shido, this is
a direct challenge from Natsumi.

496
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:48,025
Unless you decipher
who she's impersonating,

497
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,400
I imagine that your friends
will continue disappearing.

498
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:52,983
[SHIDO gasps]

499
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,067
[KOTORI]
Find her, Shido,

500
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,608
before we are all gone.

501
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:03,817
[NATSUMI laughing]

502
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,442
[NARRATOR]
Dating.

503
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:16,025
So sweet, agonizing,
and torturous.

504
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:20,650
The curtain has been raised,
now, for the third time.

505
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,192
