1
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:16,608
[TOHKA]
I'm so hungry, Shido.

2
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:18,525
Shido, gotta potty.

3
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,567
Darling. Darling.

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,358
Um, Shido, what's going on?

5
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:27,150
[overlapping chatter]

6
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,108
Kaguya, isn't that my candy
you're about to eat?

7
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,317
[chuckles]
Come on, don't sweat it.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,817
If stupid little things
like that actually get to you,

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,317
then you might as well be
as old as you look right now.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,692
Agree, it's much nicer to share
and you have plenty.

11
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:42,233
--Hey!
--[overlapping chatter]

12
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:43,608
Everybody, listen!

13
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:46,442
I need all of you to calm down
right this second!

14
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:50,858
[chatter continues]

15
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:51,858
[SHIDO groans]

16
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,608
Natsumi, what have
you done to me?

17
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:57,858
[REINE] You've got a lot
on your hands today, Shin.

18
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:01,192
[SHIDO]
Reine! Thank goodness.

19
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,858
I appreciate you coming.

20
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:05,358
It's hard to keep up
with all of them on my own.

21
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:08,108
Sure. I'm sorry for
having to leave them here.

22
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:10,400
House guests are a lot of work.

23
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,733
Hmm.

24
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:13,442
[YUZURU]
Ponder. Do I want a cookie?

25
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,692
[giggling]

26
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,233
[SHIDO]
Um...

27
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,775
So what happened to Natsumi?

28
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:22,525
[REINE] I deployed
observation devices to find her,

29
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:23,983
but no luck yet.

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,692
I'll let you know
if that changes.

31
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,192
All right, thanks.

32
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:32,358
It's strange, why would
Natsumi do something like this?

33
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,858
I've asked myself that.

34
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,900
It could have been
some sort of last resort.

35
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:38,817
Emergency measures
she used to escape.

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,608
The Spirits no longer
have the ability to fight.

37
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,775
It could be this is
actually a warning

38
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:46,108
not to go looking for her.

39
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,317
Of course, she could also
just have a grudge.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,608
[chuckles]

41
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,858
[sighs]

42
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,525
[WESTCOTT]
As far as we've confirmed,

43
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:58,983
there are six Spirits
gathered around Shido Itsuka.

44
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,900
So as soon as
you're feeling ready,

45
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:03,567
I'll have you make
your move, Ellen.

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,192
Right. Who shall I
start with, sir?

47
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:13,275
Ah, yes, this is the Spirit from
the AST's report the other day.

48
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,608
She hasn't been confirmed
lost as of yet,

49
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:18,483
and seeing as she turned up
in Tengu City,

50
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,650
she's our primary target.

51
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:29,192
[NARRATOR] A grand opening
amidst the chaos.

52
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,608
"My Own Personal Zoo."

53
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:35,400
Now, Shido's fathering skills
are put to the test.

54
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,525
--No way.
--Seriously?

55
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:12,858
That's so lame.

56
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,983
[SHIDO]
Well, at least it looks like

57
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,275
Natsumi spared everyone here.

58
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,275
--Morning, Itsuka.
--Uh...

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,858
--Hey.
--You okay?

60
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:22,150
Oh, yeah. I'm super good.

61
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,192
[TAMAE]
Excuse me, Itsuka?

62
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,275
[SHIDO]
Yes?

63
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,483
You have some guests here
to see you

64
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,400
but I'm not sure if, uh...

65
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:29,525
What guests?

66
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:31,108
Yeah, about that...

67
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,067
--See? I knew he was here.
--[gasps]

68
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,650
Hey, what did I say?

69
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,400
You were to stay in the office
and behave until I came back.

70
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:39,025
Well, well, what have we here?

71
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,025
Bother. You're blocking the way.

72
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,650
[KOTORI]
Shido, do you copy?

73
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,358
It's an emergency!

74
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,983
Tohka and the others
have disappeared from the house!

75
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,733
Yeah, that's because
they came here.

76
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:52,317
Hey, Shido, would you please
do us all a favor

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,567
and have a talk
with these teachers

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,775
and set 'em straight?

79
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:56,983
They refuse to believe
we're really Yamai.

80
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,775
[YUZURU] Sigh. These adults
don't have enough imagination

81
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,567
not to judge on appearances.

82
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,817
Why are you here
in the first place

83
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,650
when I asked you all
to wait at home?

84
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,983
It's a school day
so we didn't think

85
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,400
you actually meant it.

86
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,942
Yes, I know it's a school day.

87
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,483
--Hey, cutie.
--Wanna tell us your name?

88
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,733
Uh...

89
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,442
I'm Chiyogami Itsuka.

90
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,775
And I'm so happy to meet
some of Papa's friends.

91
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,608
--Hold up. "Papa"?
--No, no! Don't misunderstand!

92
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:23,525
These, uh... These girls are,
uh, my relative's kids!

93
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:24,983
I'm just looking after them.

94
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,067
Heh! You know,
"Papa," it's only, like...

95
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,733
I-It's their nickname for me.

96
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,108
Oh, now I get it.

97
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:32,525
It's funny, but knowing you,

98
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,567
I almost believed
the kids could be yours.

99
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,317
Well, that's terrifying.

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,275
Come on, everyone,
let's get you back home now.

101
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,150
Oh, weird. What was that?

102
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,150
[TOHKA screams]

103
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,900
Tohka, wha... [grunts]

104
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:46,483
What... What have you
done to me, Shido?!

105
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,983
Bastard! What the hell
did you just do?

106
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,150
--Uh...
--You're the worst!

107
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,400
That is so lame!

108
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,608
But I didn't do anything!

109
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:56,317
Wait, the light. Don't tell
me...

110
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,900
[grunting]
Come on, time to go...

111
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,150
Ugh! You coward!

112
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,233
--[KOTORI] Shido!
--What, Kotori?

113
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:04,858
--[KOTORI] The house!
--The house?

114
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:06,442
Hold on, what about the house?

115
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,233
Of course. Why not?

116
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,400
She's really done it this time.

117
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,400
[laughs]

118
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:20,567
Now, I wonder what I can do
to mess with these fools next.

119
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,317
You seriously
don't intend to react

120
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,275
after what Westcott did to us?

121
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:27,192
I'm not sure what to tell you.

122
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,358
The incident did make
one thing clear.

123
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,567
Westcott's on
a whole different level.

124
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,108
We were foolish to think
we could stand against him.

125
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:35,108
Maybe so.

126
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:36,108
But he still deserves

127
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,733
every single ounce
of retribution

128
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,317
we can serve him.

129
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,317
Retribution, huh?

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,775
What exactly
is it you have in mind?

131
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:47,692
Right now, as far as we know,
Westcott is in Japan, correct?

132
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,442
Yeah, and what of it?

133
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,192
I'm home, girls.

Why is there so much cake?

[TOHKA]
Shido, wake up.

138

Are you okay? Hey, Shido?

[yawns]

140

These past few days have been
one thing after another.

all out this time.

Although, thanks to that,

I've been able to
track down her location.

Wow, for real?
Well, where is she?

and it only serves you right
for embarrassing me.

What will I do next?

160
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,150
Shoot, who's coming this way?

161
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,483
Some friend of Shido's maybe?

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,567
Yeah, that's kinda why
I told you to be careful.

326
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,567
How is Natsumi's mental state?

327
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,733
Well, it's been
incredibly unstable.

328
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:20,608
Sealing her is out of
the question at this point.

329
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:23,233
Figured as much.
She's miserable.

330
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,733
She just doesn't have
any confidence

331
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,025
in her current state.

332
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,400
Obviously.

333
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,275
Otherwise, she wouldn't
always be changing herself.

334
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:30,775
You know, I actually think

335
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,192
the real Natsumi
has a charm of her own.

336
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:36,150
I just wish there was a way
for her to see it.

337
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,067
She'd rather transform
than to look in the mirror

338
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,608
long enough to see that.

339
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,483
[BOTH]
Transform?

340
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:49,775
[sniffs]

341
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:52,858
Uh...

342
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,650
[sighs]

343
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,942
[sighs]

344
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,358
Can I ask you something?

345
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:08,983
What is it
that's so disappointing

346
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,650
about the current you?

347
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:14,942
Come on.
Who would be fooled by that?

348
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,692
Once I can finally
use Haniel again,

349
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,525
I am so done with this.

350
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,900
[NATSUMI]
Uh. What's this?

351
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,067
--[SHIDO] Captured!
--[NATSUMI screaming]

352
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,108
[NATSUMI]
Let me go!

353
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,983
[SHIDO]
Okay, we're good.

354
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,150
[grunts]

355
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,817
Hey, where am I?

356
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,233
Hi, there.

357
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,983
This is a pop-up beauty salon.
You're in Salon de Miku.

358
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,108
Huh? What's going on?

359
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,567
What do you mean?
Miku just explained.

360
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,900
It's a day of beauty.

361
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,067
[NATSUMI]
No, nothing's ever that simple.

362
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,775
I bet you're really doing this
to make me believe

363
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,983
you think I'm pretty while you
laugh at me behind my back! Ah!

364
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,358
Whatever. Would you
lie down already?

365
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:56,400
You're really holding up
the schedule.

366
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:57,608
[NATSUMI]
Schedule...?

367
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,692
Natsumi,
for the rest of the day,

368
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:03,192
our goal is to transform you
in a way that makes you happy.

369
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,567
If we succeed,
then that's our win.

370
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,900
If you don't see a difference,
then we lose.

371
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,108
And you can do as you please.

372
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,233
What exactly do you mean,
"do as I please"?

373
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,025
Let's see.

374
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:17,858
What if we let you run away
to wherever you might wanna go?

375
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:20,025
[NATSUMI]
Hmm.

376
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,233
--Fine. Deal.
--[BOTH chuckle]

377
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:23,692
[SHIDO] It's about time
for you to learn.

378
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:26,108
A girl can transform
even without an Angel

379
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,567
if she wants to.

380
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,400
We're gonna start
by oiling up your skin.

381
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,775
[NATSUMI groans]
How could this help?

382
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:36,567
[MIKU] Now, we're just going to
warm you with some hot stones.

383
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,567
How does that feel?

384
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,483
[NATSUMI]
I mean, it's all right.

385
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,650
This will help any swelling
in your legs, too.

386
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,525
[NATSUMI]
Oh. Really?

387
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,858
[MIKU chuckles]
Doesn't that feel nice?

388
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,358
You really ought to be
taking better care

389
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:50,942
of your gorgeous skin.

390
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,150
Why should it matter
what I do when...

391
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,983
I mean, it won't change.

392
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,483
[snoring]

393
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,775
[gasps]

394
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,775
Somebody had a little nap.

395
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,817
Move along to the next room now.

396
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,358
--[chuckles]
--[NATSUMI] Sure, okay.

397
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,775
You can sit back
and trust our mad skills.

398
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,733
[NATSUMI]
Eh...?

399
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,817
[KOTORI] Clothes are important
for your confidence.

400
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,275
Come. Follow us.

401
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,692
Step right on in.

402
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:31,900
Oh, that looks awesome.

403
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:33,317
Yeah, it's really cute.

404
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,858
[KOTORI]
Try on this one next.

405
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,233
That brings us here

406
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:39,525
to the final room
of your transformative journey.

407
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,025
Hi, my name's Shiori.

408
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,692
Makeup's my thing
and you're getting a makeover.

409
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:46,567
[NATSUMI] I just... I don't
think it'll change anything.

410
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,567
Do you honestly believe that?

411
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,025
Of course I do.

412
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,858
[SHIORI]
What if I told you...

413
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,317
[SHIDO] ...underneath here,
I'm really a man?!

414
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:57,858
[NATSUMI]
Weirdo.

415
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:00,025
[gasps, groans]

416
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,900
[KOTORI]
Poor thing, look how hurt he is.

417
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,525
[MIKU]
I wouldn't worry about it.

418
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:04,900
Besides, if you ignore
the silly part

419
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,942
about Darling being a guy,
he's still a girl.

420
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,233
Yeah, anyways,
I'll be utilizing these skills--

421
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:13,733
the same technique you couldn't
see through just now--

422
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:16,108
to prove that I can
transform you.

423
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:17,900
[NATSUMI sighs]
Do whatever you want.

[SHIORI voice]
I'm all finished.

426
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,525
How is it, Natsumi?

427
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,567
I don't know, is this me?

428
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,483
[NATSUMI] Wait. What the
heck is going on here?

429
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,900
And why does everyone
look so happy?

430
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,983
I did those terrible things.

431
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:44,275
If this is me, that means
I just lost because...

432
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,650
I might... I think I'm...

My name is Ellen Mathers.

441
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,067
I'm trying to reach
Master Sergeant Tobiichi--

442
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,650
is this she?

443
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,775
Ellen Mathers, huh?

444
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,817
What is this about?

445
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,317
I like that.
Let's get straight to the point.

446
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,567
Master Sergeant,

447
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,483
I want you to consider
coming to work for me.

448
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,067
[ORIGAMI]
No way.

449
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,150
I'm not aiding any organization
that would bring harm to Shido.

There she is! That way!

452
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,192
[ELLEN] Uh-oh. Looks like
you're in quite the predicament.

453
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:47,733
Five years ago,
there was a fire in Tengu City.

454
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,775
If you do decide
to work for me,

455
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:54,650
you would be given access
to information on that event.

456
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,817
You want to avenge
your parents, don't you?

457
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,525
I'll do it.

458
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,275
[thudding]

00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,525
You're a smart girl.

Welcome to DEM Industries.
