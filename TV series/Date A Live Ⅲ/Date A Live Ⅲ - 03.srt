1
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:13,983
[KOTORI]
It's crazy.

2
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,317
I still can't believe
she vanished.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,317
And it was right at midnight.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,525
The instant the date changed,

5
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,025
Yuzuru was erased.

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,275
We've got to figure out

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,150
which of these 12
Natsumi is impersonating.

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,108
Because it looks like
if I don't,

9
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,567
we run the risk of losing
another person each night,

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,900
one by one.

11
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:36,108
Yeah, that seems to be the case.

12
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:38,400
The process of elimination
will help.

13
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:39,650
Not much of a consolation

14
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,692
when friends
are vanishing, though.

15
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,900
[grunts]

16
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:45,400
I've gotta find out
who she is in a hurry.

17
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:49,442
Not just for us,
but for Natsumi's sake, too.

18
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,942
Well, in that case,

19
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:54,067
isn't it about time for you
verify my identity?

20
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,067
What if I'm her?

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,358
No way, you're the real deal.

22
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:01,400
At least, that's what I'm hoping
is the case with all my heart.

23
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:03,692
What the hell does it matter
what you want to believe?

24
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:06,525
Your mission is to do
what you can to verify it.

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,817
You could grill me
with questions, or...

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,983
I mean, to judge my reaction
or whatever,

27
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:16,400
you could, like, kiss me
or something dumb like that.

28
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:17,900
I see.

29
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:18,900
Then...

30
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:20,483
Well?

31
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,233
Oh, okay.

32
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,650
[whimpers]

33
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,317
Big brother! What are you
doing?! Give me those!

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,608
Come on, they're mine!
Give ‘em back. No fair!

35
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,942
--Oh, yeah.
--You're bigger than me!

36
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:34,358
--You're Kotori all right.
--You're bigger than me!

37
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,983
Natsumi couldn't play
this side of you so perfectly.

38
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,692
--Isn't that right, Kotori?
--[KOTORI growling]

39
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,067
Oh, crap.

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,983
I'm sorry? Not the face!

41
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,858
[REINE] I think we need to
speed up this dating process.

42
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,233
[SHIDO]
I agree.

43
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,775
I know we've already
scheduled a pretty packed day,

44
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,025
but I don't care.

45
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,858
Let's fit as many more in
as we possibly can

46
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,525
before tonight.

47
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:01,275
I'll leave all the
arrangements to you.

48
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:03,775
[REINE] Understood.
I'll do the best I can.

49
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,567
As for right now,
you're due to meet Miku.

50
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,192
--Better hurry.
--I'm on it. Thanks.

51
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,608
Thanks for coming, Miku.

52
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,400
But, hey, why did you
want us to wear costumes?

53
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:15,733
It's kinda weird.

54
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,733
Oh, it's kind of
an occupational hazard,

55
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,108
I'm afraid.

56
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:21,900
Being such a huge star
means having to hide sometimes.

57
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,442
But I don't want you to worry.

58
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,108
As you can see, we'll totally
blend in if we cosplay here.

59
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,025
We're finally on a date
by ourselves.

60
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,067
I just didn't want anyone
getting in the way of that.

61
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,442
Huh. That actually
makes sense.

62
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:35,858
--Wow!
--Wow!

63
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:38,775
It's Kanon Tsukishima
and Seig from Valkyrie Misty.

64
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,733
[WOMAN 1] And you're in
the rarely cosplayed masks

65
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:43,067
from episode six
when they saved Misty!

66
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,942
[BOTH]
Can we please take your picture?

67
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,275
Wait, what?
Oh, no, I don't think we--

68
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,150
Of course.
We would be delighted!

69
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,150
Darling, your turn. Go on.

70
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,067
[SHIDO]
What, me?

71
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,275
[sighs]

72
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,692
[BOTH]
There it is!

73
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,942
The signature
pose of our beloved Seig!

74
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:08,567
[AI] So, you gonna tell us
why we're here or what?

75
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,983
Because, FYI, if you're making
amends, this isn't enough.

76
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,650
That's so lame, yo.

77
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,692
Nah, this has nothing
to do with that day.

78
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,983
Just thought we should hang.

79
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,275
I mean, we're classmates,
after all.

80
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,025
I should know you better.

81
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,900
[TAMAE] So, what is it
that's troubling you, Shido?

82
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,400
Why is it you're
suddenly interested

83
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,317
in talking about the future?

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,942
[SHIDO]
Uh, well... How do I put it?

85
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,358
I guess I just feel like

86
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:37,233
I need to start taking
my life's path more seriously.

87
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,067
Oh, now I see.

88
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,650
Hmm.

89
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,567
In that case, do you remember
the promise you made me?

90
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,525
Because I haven't forgotten it.

91

--Shido.

No way!

[laughs]
Did you see that?

95
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:58,483
It was my signature move.

96
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,442
You just witnessed
the Dunkelheit Windhose.

97
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,358
--[SHIDO] Uh...
--[KAGUYA] Hmm.

98
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,733
You'll never beat
my crazy skills, Shido.

99
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,483
Not now that I have this guy.

100
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,983
With this legendary relic
in my possession,

101
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,900
you stand no chance
of defeating me.

102
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:12,900
So, there.

103
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,108
Wait, how is it "legendary"?

104
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:18,108
I mean, didn't you
just buy it from that lady?

105
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:22,067
Well, if I were you,
I would try to focus on my game.

106
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,442
Don't forget, we promised
that the loser of this match

107
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,942
would do whatever
the winner wants.

108
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,942
[SHIDO]
I'm well aware.

109
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,983
Get ready for a comeback!

[SHIDO]
Yeah, okay.

114
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,775
My first order is,
for the next ten minutes,

115
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,733
you won't act surprised
or flustered.

116
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:51,233
Nor will you try to stop me,
no matter what.

117
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,942
And you'll promise me
to never speak of it again.

This is even more comfy
than I thought it would be.

Be good and I'll turn you
into my full-time pillow.

You've got to be kidding me.

I'm sorry, are you
complaining, my pet?

[KAGUYA] I know you said
she was taking an exam,

but really,
you don't know where she is.

I can tell.
You think I'm stupid.

I would never.

So, I'll trust you.

the one who gave me
and Yuzuru a third choice,

I meant the opposite of that.

You beat the schedule

11 different dates in two days.

00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:39,275
There's no doubt in my mind
that Miku and Kaguya are real.

162
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,858
And neither my teacher
nor the girls seemed off to me.

163
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,192
This is hard.

164
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:47,483
I know we need
to figure it all out,

165
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,692
but I dread knowing
who Natsumi is.

166
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,317
Yeah.

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,900
Sorry, bro.

168
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,608
Unfortunately, I think it's time
for you to give her an answer.

169
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:58,025
I know.

170
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,858
Except, even if I wanted
to make some kind of guess,

171
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,733
how am I supposed to do that?

172
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,275
[KOTORI] Hmm. We don't
really know that, either.

173
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,983
This game seems guided
by nothing but Natsumi's whims.

174
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,650
She's holding all the cards.

175
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:10,858
I imagine even right now,

176
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:13,733
she's observing us
from somewhere close by.

177
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:15,400
[NATSUMI]
Right on the money!

178
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,358
You stay back!

179
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,858
[SHIDO]
Natsumi.

180
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,900
Ah, good evening, Shido.

181
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:27,317
Day two of the game
is now at an end.

182
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,900
Tell me something,
are you having fun yet?

183
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,108
What is this even about,
Natsumi?

184
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,233
I never asked to play this game.

185
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,650
Just bring Yuzuru back now

186
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,942
and we can talk about
anything you want.

187
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,567
Sorry, no chance.

188
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,692
It's a bummer if you're not
feeling up to the task,

189
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,733
but the cork's kinda
already out of the bottle

190
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:44,900
if you know what I mean.

191
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,317
So, no time
like the present, right?

192
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,983
Why don't you give me
your guess for today?

193
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,317
Who am I impersonating?

194
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,608
I... I don't...

195
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:56,275
Shido, some will be erased
if you don't answer her.

196
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,567
Even a wild guess'll do.

197
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,233
[growls]

198
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,692
I think the one
you're impersonating...

199
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:07,650
...is Yoshino.

200
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,983
And I'm not confident in that,
but she did seem unusually bold.

201
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:14,900
I see.

202
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,358
Well...

203
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,108
[SHIDO gasps]
Natsumi, wait!

204
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:21,067
She's gone.
Do you think you were right?

205
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,567
[REINE]
Shin. Kotori.

206
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,067
Do you copy?

207
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,275
Reine? We're here, what's up?

208
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:29,483
Just now,
Natsumi's Angel showed up again.

209
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,358
Two more people
have disappeared.

210
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,942
Both Ai Yamabuki and Yoshino.

211
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,525
[SHIDO gasps]

212
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,233
[SHIDO]
Two more days have passed,

213
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,608
and I still haven't
guessed correctly.

214
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:49,317
Ms. Okamine, Mai Hazakura,
Mii Fujibakama, and Tonomachi

215
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,983
have all been erased.

216
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:54,108
[REINE]
Shin, you're almost to the spot.

217
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,358
Sorry. Did you wait long?

218
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,150
[ORIGAMI]
I just got here.

219
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,358
[REINE] For the record,
I've been observing her.

220
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,900
She's been waiting there
for over an hour.

221
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,025
[chuckles nervously]

222
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,942
[ORIGAMI]
Well, what are we seeing?

223
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,275
[SHIDO] I don't know.
I hadn't really decided.

224
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,358
So in other words,
you invited me

225
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,900
not because you wanted
to see a specific film,

226
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,817
but instead because you wanted
to spend some time with me.

227
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,567
Uh... Um, yeah.
I mean, I guess.

228
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,650
Sure.

229

As far as you want.

Shido, I want you to touch me.

No bra for easy access.

What? Here?!
You don't mean that!

What are you doing
out this late?

246
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,858
I wanted to check on you.

247
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,983
These past few days,

248
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,067
you've just seemed
so preoccupied.

249
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,108
I've been
a little worried about you.

250
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,650
[gasps]

251
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:16,692
Sorry.

252
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,775
Oh, no,
you don't have to apologize.

253
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,275
You're doing something important
that you have to do,

254
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:22,983
isn't that right?

255
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,233
It's just...

256
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,775
It's sad not being able
to see you, that's all.

257
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,233
If there's anything
I can do to help,

258
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,025
just say the word, okay?

259
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,233
Thank you. You're so sweet.

260
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,275
I already feel like
a whole new man.

261
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,567
Yay! That makes me happy.

262

I'm so sorry to bother you.

265
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,483
If I wanted to get
to Tengu Street,

266
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,317
would this be
the right direction?

Yeah, that's right.

and you'll run directly into it.

that you young lovers

[OLD MAN] What do you think?
Did I sound awkward back there?

No, I highly doubt
they suspect anything.

Hmph.

as well as the famous Princess.

any worse for wear.

You're the one
who didn't come home

when you were supposed to.

I assumed you were
forfeiting your guess tonight,

303
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,650
so I did the thing
and erased another person,

You are the worst.

Still, though,
I'm kinda thinking

I wanna end this pretty soon.

What it means is,
if you guess correctly,

I'll return all the people
who have disappeared.

if you don't guess right,

That Shido...

But that's not
nearly enough for me.

I know it's a lot,

but at least now you understand
what we're facing.

344

It really would've helped,
when Yuzuru disappeared.

345
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,775
This is embarrassing,

346
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,567
but I think I'm the most sad
to hear that our date

347
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,900
was just a part
of a research operation.

348
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,483
I have a long list
of questions about this.

349
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,025
But for now, I'll let it go
and cooperate.

350
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,025
Thank you all. I mean it.

351
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,233
Okay, let's go
through it all again.

352
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,483
Natsumi is impersonating
one of these 12,

353
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,942
and it could be anyone.

354
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,442
These have been
Shido's guesses so far:

355
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:36,108
Yoshino, Ms. Okamine,
and Mai Hazakura.

356
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,400
I think we can
exclude these three.

357
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:42,733
In turn, Natsumi has erased
Yuzuru, Ai Yamabuki,

358
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:47,025
Hiroto Tonomachi,
Mii Fujibakama, and Tohka.

359
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,858
It's possible that she was
actually one of those five.

360
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,317
And then there are
the five of us, of course.

361
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,192
That makes us
strong suspects.

362
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,817
Although, to impersonate
one of us

363
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,150
might pose a little more
of a challenge for her.

364
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,358
Huh? Wait, What do you
mean by that?

365
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,483
I get it.

366
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,192
Our traits are too unique
and complex.

367
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,608
And that makes us hard
to imitate, right?

368
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,108
Sure, yeah. Let's go with that.

369
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,317
[ORIGAMI]
This Witch,

370
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,442
the Spirit
you're calling Natsumi,

371
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,483
why would she take
such a huge risk?

372
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,108
[ORIGAMI]
The way she's handled it so far,

373
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,025
every time a person disappears,

374
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,942
it just increases our
chances of guessing right.

375
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,567
So by the end,
it'll be hard for us to lose.

376
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,733
Which means, the Witch is
confident we won't choose her.

377
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,108
She knows that no matter
what we might come at her with,

378
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,275
it will never be
the correct answer.

379
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,608

A good point.

That is exactly
the sort of creative thinking

we need right now.

385
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,733
Don't you think,
maybe it's possible

386
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:50,275
she isn't impersonating
anybody at all?

387
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,900
I really can't imagine
that's the case.

388

[SHIDO]
Origami is right.

389
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,983
Why am I trusting Natsumi
to play by the rules?

390
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,275
She'd do anything to win.

391
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:03,358
Which means, she could even be
one of these five.

I can't imagine you'd bet

you're somewhere among the five

Yuzuru was the real deal.

that she was my sister.

Wear this?

Vanish?

What? What are you
thinking, Shido?

[gasps]

482
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,275
I've got it, Natsumi.

483
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:40,817
I mean, I know the reason
you're so confident.

484
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,192
[NATSUMI]
Hmm?

485
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:43,983
While it's true that you're
impersonating someone

486
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,858
in one of the 12 pictures,

487
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,817
it is not one of the people.

[NATSUMI grunts]

489
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:53,317
This was you. I know it.

490
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,442
You're Yoshinon.

[gasps]

492
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,858
No way.
Why in the world would she...

493
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,692
Now that I think back,
it was strange.

494
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,150
[SHIDO]
Yoshinon is Yoshino's puppet.

495
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:10,025
It shouldn't be able to see
something that Yoshino can't.

What Miku just said
made me realize.

498
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,650
When Yoshino disappeared,

499
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,525
Yoshinon vanished
right along with her.

500
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,275
Well then? I made my guess.

501
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,650
You were impersonating
Yoshinon, right?

So weird.

511
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:52,233
I feel like I've been
taking the longest nap ever!

512
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,025
Doubt. Why exactly am I here?

00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:57,025
You're back! Yuzuru!

Oh, thank goodness.
You all look okay.

Care to explain
why you did this?

00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,775
Because we're all listening.

519
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,692
Holy crap. Are you Natsumi?

520
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,817
Huh?

Haniel, now!

Oh, I get it.
She has this filled-out form

524
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,400
only after she transforms
using Spirit power.

525
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,692
You saw. You saw!
Damn you, you saw everything!

526
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,442
You've now seen my secret
not once but twice!

527
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,483
No, it is unforgivable.

And none of you
are getting away with it!

Huh?

I hope you enjoy
this farewell present.

We'll meet again.

I'll have my revenge.
