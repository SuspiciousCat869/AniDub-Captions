00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:20,608
Does this mean I managed to
make the world a peaceful place?

[door clicks]

3
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,525
Oh, cool. You're already awake.

4
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:28,567
Good morning, Big Brother.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,900
Kotori. You're all right!

6
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:32,400
What about Fraxinus?

7
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,817
How's the crew?
Is everyone okay?

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,733
Is it possible
you're still asleep?

9
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,442
Uh, no, I'm...

10
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,233
Hold on. What day is it?

11
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,567
Huh?

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,567
It's the third of November,
don't you know that?

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,942
If it's November third, then...

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,400
It's the day after
Origami went Inverse.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,483
[SHIDO]
Thank goodness. What a relief.

16
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,942
What the heck?!
What's happening?!

17
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,150
[SHIDO]
I did it.

18
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,275
I managed to change
the world, after all.

19
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,108
[NARRATOR]
Daily life.

20
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,942
On the surface,
we think we know what it is.

21
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,650
Then, reality rears its head

22
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,608
and we discover
all is not as it seems.

23
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,733
--Ah.
--Uh...

24
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,983
Hey, there you are.
Morning, Shido.

25
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,025
Morning. Sorry to make you wait.

26
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,400
Here, don't freak out,

27
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,483
but I brought you
one of your favorites.

28
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,067
[gasps] That's right,
you were gonna cook

29
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,442
those bite-sized cutlets
for me, weren't you?

30
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,775
Huh?

31
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,858
Uh, isn't that what you said
you'd make yesterday

32
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,692
or am I not remembering right?

33
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:00,858
Yesterday?

34
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,108
[gasps]
Oh, right, I did.

35
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:06,692
Sorry, didn't end up
having those ingredients.

36
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:10,525
So I made you a rice bowl,
with sweet eggs, too.

37
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,108
Oh, my God.
That sounds so good right now!

38
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,525
Ohh! I mean, I literally...

39
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,483
[SHIDO] Does this world
have a whole different history

40
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,358
that I'm not aware of?

41
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,900
Well, what a nice morning.

42
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,067
It was good of you
to pick me up, servant.

43
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,358
Salutations.
Good morning, everyone.

44
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:28,567
Shido. Tohka. Kotori.

45
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,900
Yeah, hey. Morning.

46
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,358
What's with you?

47
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,150
If I didn't know better,
for a second there,

48
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,650
I would've sworn you were
totally checking out our boobs.

49
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,692
Explanation.

50
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,817
While gross, it still isn't

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,067
an unheard-of reaction
for a man.

52
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,650
Care to add anything, Shido?

53
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,567
[SHIDO]
Nope. I'm good, thanks.

54

55
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,067
[SHIDO]
Origami hasn't shown up yet.

56
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,525
[TOHKA]
Hmm...

57
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,525
Huh? What's the matter?

58
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,608
I don't know,
I can't explain it.

59
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,608
It's as if something
is incomplete.

60
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,525
Just kind of a weird feeling.

61
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,900
--Incomplete?
--[door rattles]

62
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:10,775

Good morning, everyone.

--Suzuhara?
--[SUZUHARA] Here.

64
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,650
--Setouchi?
--[SETOUCHI] Here.

65
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,317
[SHIDO]
Is she absent today?

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,150
Or maybe
she's just running late.

67
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,900
[TAMAE]
Next is Tonomachi.

68
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:24,192
[TONOMACHI] Yo. Hiroto Tonomachi
is present and accounted for

69
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,942
and ready to face the day,
my love.

70
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,900
[TAMAE] Right. So, Tonomachi
is very much present.

71
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:30,900
--Next is Nakahara.
--[gasps]

What's wrong?

73
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,692
Did I say something weird
or are you just having a moment?

74
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,692
Um, no, I'm...

75
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,983
Her name should come
after Tonomachi's.

76
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,775
Sorry, but what about Origami?

77
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,233
Who's Origami?

78
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,650
I don't think I've ever known
anyone by that name.

What the heck
kinda name is that?

82
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,067
What, did Itsuka, like,

83
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,192
fold a bunch of paper cranes
for the teacher?

84
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,483
[gasps] Hold on, does he think
he can steal my Tammie

85
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,942
with arts and crafts?

86
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,775
That's so lame.

87
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,400
[SHIDO]
Now I see.

88
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,150
I guess, here, in this reality,

89
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,442
Origami doesn't live
in the city.

90
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:07,775
The Origami of this world

91
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,775
probably doesn't hold
a grudge against Spirits.

92
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,358
She's just off somewhere
living happily with her parents.

93
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,942
It's better this way.

94
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,108
This is how
it always should've been.

95

[TOHKA]
Shido?

96
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,692
[SHIDO]
What's up, Tohka?

97
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:25,025
Are you all right?
Is something bothering you?

98
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,775
[SHIDO]
Huh?

100
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,442
Oh, no, I'm fine.

101
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,400
[SHIDO]
I hope that she's happy.

102
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:38,858
Though, I would've loved
to see her again.

103
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,858
Even just once.

104
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:44,275

new Origami, smiling.

[YOSHINON] Yeah, seems like
he's in the dumps.

Look at how zoned-out he is.
Has to be a girl.

What do you mean?
Why do you think that?!

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,983
I mean, I might be wrong,

so don't get
your panties all in a twist.

Hey! If you know, out with it.

114
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:06,692
It's just that when it comes

115
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,192
to the troubles
of high school boys,

116
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,983
you can lay money down on it
being about some girl.

117
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,150
Someone treating them badly

118
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,192
or not reciprocating
their feelings.

119
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:17,025
Typical guys worry about
these things all the time.

120
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,608
Really? They worry
about that stuff, too?

121
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,067
Yeah, even though,
when you ask

122
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,733
if they want to group up
for a project,

123
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,650
they say "Ew,"
and try to act all disgusted.

124
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,442
And when you pick up
their eraser they say,

125
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,067
"You can just keep it now
that you've touched it,"

126
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,233
or something dumb.

127
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,983
Hold on, back up a minute.

128
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,483
How the heck does a Spirit
like you know

129
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,900
so much about
student life, anyway?

130
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,733
Uh... Listen, the point is,
I think it's obvious

131
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,692
that something happened
to him at school.

132
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,733
He'll probably be fine
if we give him time,

133
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:45,067
but I can't help but worry.

acting so depressed like this.

00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,858
Isn't there anything
we can do for him?

137
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,942
I don't know what to tell ya.

138
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,233
I'll say one thing,

139
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,233
if it's girl trouble
that's giving Shido grief,

140
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,275
then the only thing to heal
his heart is another girl.

141
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,525
Huh?

142
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,442
Oops, too close.
Man, I've got to focus.

143
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,733
[KOTORI]
Hey, Shido, need some help?

144
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:10,942
Huh? Sure, thank you.

145
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,275
Why don't you wash...

146
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,567
[SHIDO]
What kinda outfits are those?!

147
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,983
And what's with those bodies?!

148
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,650
What? We all have a body,
what's the problem?

149
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,025
Yeah, she's right.

150
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,608
Don't think
about that right now.

151
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,442
What's important
is that we help.

152
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,150
Right, it's just that, um...

153
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,817
Natsumi! Was this your idea?!

154
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,025
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.

155
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,400
Wait a damn second.

156
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,650
Why aren't you in a bathing suit
like the two of us?!

157
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,108
I thought we all agreed that
we'd get dressed up together!

158
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,650
It's true, we did.

159
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,150
But once I thought about it,

160
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,567
I realized that wearing that
would be super embarrassing.

161

I was afraid I might
feel stupid, you know?

these stupid outfits!

Ahh! I'm being violated!

please knock it off?

I apologize, Shido.

Yeah, sorry.

No worries. I'm sorry
that I had you all concerned.

Thank you.
I really am better now.

but, man,

182
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,358
After all, you never know

183
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,567
when another Spirit
is going to appear, right?

184
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,025
Yeah.

185
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,775
There are Spirits
we don't know about.

186
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,692
Not to mention the fact that
Kurumi and Devil are out there.

187
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:43,567
Wait, who's Devil?
I don't know that Spirit.

188
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,025
What are you talking about?

189
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,692
I mean
the Spirit Hunter, "Devil."

190
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,900
And if you thought
that Nightmare was bad,

191
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,442
this one can be
every bit as dangerous.

192
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,317
As bad as Kurumi?

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,108
Are you for real right now?

194
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,942
What the heck's
with you today, Shido?

195
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,275
It's almost as if
you've forgotten

196
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,608
everything up until yesterday.

197
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,650
[SHIDO] Sorry, could you go
over some info again?

198
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,442
The stuff about this Spirit
named Devil?

199
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,317
[KOTORI]
Ugh. Fine.

200
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,650
We've confirmed she exists,
but she's an unidentified Spirit

201
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,483
who's evaded all attempts
at contact so far.

202
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:19,983
Also, not surprisingly, I'd say,
Devil's an Inverse.

203
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,650
Wait, what do you mean?

204
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:25,025
An inverse Spirit
just shows up here sometimes?

205
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,525
Well, I'm trying to tell you,

206
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,608
we don't know very much
about her, yet.

207
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,442
Tell me this, though.
What's a Spirit Hunter?

208
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,150
It's just like it sounds.

209
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,067
Devil never shows up
anywhere on her own.

210
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,483
She only appears whenever
another Spirit manifests itself.

211
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,483
Then, suddenly, she's there
and she attacks them.

212
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,900
If Tohka and the others
hadn't helped her out,

213
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,942
Natsumi would've been
in big trouble.

214

Wait a minute. Is this her?

She wasn't in her apartment.

00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,150
And she wasn't at the house

225
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,192
where she lived
with her parents, either.

226
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,275
Why did she become a Spirit?

227
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,692
Why an Inverse?

[KOTORI]
What are you talking about?

268
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,733
I know her because
she fought against Tohka

and the others
a bunch of times.

But she retired
not too long ago.

Now that you mention it,

it does seem like Tobiichi
left the AST

started appearing regularly.

talk about something?

Oops. Sorry. We haven't met yet.

I guess it's kinda rude
to talk as if I know you.

When you saw me this morning,
did you try to ask me something?

Oh. Sorry if that's
been bothering you.

295
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,525
It's just that
I was a little surprised.

The thing is, you look just like
someone I met a long time ago.

No, I don't think we've met.

I saw around five years ago.

You would've been
in elementary school.

Besides... that person
actually passed away.

Five years ago,
right before my eyes.

Oh, my gosh. She means me.

305

So, shouldn't we go back
to class now?

Uh, wait. Hold on a sec.

Five years ago.

308
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:58,733
This didn't happen during
the Nankou area fire, did it?

have been your older brother

both of my parents' lives.

318
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,567
If he hadn't been there,

319
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,650
my mom and dad
would've both died for sure.

320
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,233
I'm forever grateful.

321
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,442
Oh, sure.

322
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,108
That confirms it.

323
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:33,567
Sounds like I was able to save
Origami's parents, after all.

324
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,275
[gasps]
Sorry for blurting that out.

325
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,275
No, it's okay.

326
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:41,733
I'm so thankful for what he did
for them that day.

327
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,650
Even though,
as fate would have it,

328
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,858
my parents then died
in a car accident a year later.

329
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,150
No...

330
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,400
But thanks
to your wonderful brother,

331
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,150
that last year they were alive,

332
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,483
my mom and dad
were able to give me

333
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,108
so much love and happiness.

334
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,983
Wow. I'm glad.

335
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,442
[SHIDO] Is that the hand
of fate at work?

336
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,900
Are you okay?

337
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:04,025
[SHIDO] Well, I was
kind of wondering why

338
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,775
you joined the AST.

339
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,858
I mean, since they survived.

340
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,608
Wait, how did you know
about that?!

341
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,108
Oh. I don't know. I just, uh...

342
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,817
Did you go outside?

343
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,775
In the middle of
a spatial quake alarm?

344
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,692
You know
you're not allowed to do that.

345
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,025
Uh, yeah. That's what I did.

346
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,567
That's very dangerous.

347
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,483
You always have to evacuate.

348
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,983
Right, sure.

349
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:30,817
Would you like to know
the reason I joined the AST?

350
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,858
I would. But only if you
don't mind telling me.

351
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:38,400
[ORIGAMI] So, the fact that you
know about the AST has to mean

352
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,025
that you know the reason
for the alarms

353
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,400
in the first place.

354
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,858
The Spirits.

355
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,025
During the fire five years ago,
it was actually a Spirit

356
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,733
that killed your older brother.

357
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,442
But that was...

358
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,983
[ORIGAMI]
I kept thinking.

359
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,775
I didn't want more people to
have to suffer the way he did.

360
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,067
[ORIGAMI]
I wanted to become a person

361
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,692
who could protect others
from Spirits.

362
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,442
[SHIDO]
She did this because of me.

363
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,858
Can I ask you one more thing?

364
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,567
Yes, of course.

365
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,525
I'm just wondering
why you became a Spirit.

366
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,067
Huh? What are you talking about?

367
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,275
What does this mean?

368
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,983
--That had to be--
--[school bells chiming]

369
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,275
[ORIGAMI] Sounds like
lunch time's about over.

370
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,025
Thanks so much, Itsuka.

371
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,858
I'm glad we were able
to chat like this.

372
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,900
Hold on. Can't we talk
a little bit more?

373
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,942
But I think class
is about to start.

374
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,608
Some other day is fine.

375
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,400
If you're free sometime,
can I see you?

376
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,942
Huh? Like on a date?

377
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,817
Eh? Yeah. I guess so.

378
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,275
Thank you.

379
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,442
Do you think I could have
some time to think about it?

380
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:51,442
Uh, yeah, of course.

381
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,775
[ORIGAMI]
Thanks. Goodbye, then.

382
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,525
[SHIDO] So strange,
talking to her now.

383
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:02,483
Am I too used
to the other Origami?

384
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,108
Shido, where the heck did you
disappear to during lunch?

385
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,275
Oh, I just got
a call from Kotori.

386
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,358
She's fine with curry
for dinner.

387
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,025
Ah, that's terrific news.

388
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,108
My mouth's already watering.

389
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,692
[SHIDO]
Huh?

390
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:30,525
[SHIDO]
Saturday, huh?

391
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:33,483
Guess I need to have
that talk with Ratatoskr.

392
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,942
[yawns]
Oh!

393
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,150
[gasps]

394
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,442
Oh, man.
[yawns]

395
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm so tired.

396
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,608
I'll just rest a bit.

397
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,275
[SHIDO groans]

398
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:54,692
[KURUMI]
My goodness.

399
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,025
[gasps]

400
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,858
Big boys like you
should watch where they sleep.

401
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,775
Dear Shido.

402
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,483
[yelps]
Kurumi?!

403
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,108
Heh. Last I checked.

404
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:07,317
Well, that was quite
the greeting, wasn't it?

405
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,817
Who knew you had such
a cute little sleeping face?

406
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,650
Eh. Uh...
[growls]

407
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,525
Uh-oh, what's wrong?

408
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,317
You know, I'm honestly
deeply hurt

409
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,567
that you seem
to fear me so much.

410
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,108
And here I thought
we were comrades

411
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,483
who were
changing the world together.

412
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,483
Kurumi, do you...

413
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,650
Yes, I remember everything.

414
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,400
All about the original world,
and about Origami, too.

415
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,192
Oh. Good.

416
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,733
Then tell me,
why did things end up this way?

417
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,775
What happened to Origami
in this world?

418
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,900
[KURUMI]
I'm afraid that's something

419
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,817
even I'm not aware of, Shido.

420
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
However, with Origami
the way she is now,

421
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,483
there are definitely
certain ways for us to find out.

422
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,192
Are there really?!

423
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,442
[KURUMI]
Indeed.

424
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:00,525
[growls]

425
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,858
[giggles]

426
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,775
Oh, come on, there's no reason
to be so scared.

427
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,650
[KURUMI] All I have to do is
shoot Yod at Origami.

428
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,817
Once I've done that,

429
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,525
I'll be able to see
all kinds of things

430
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,525
about what sort of life
she's lived in this reality.

431
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:17,108
You have Yod. That's right.

432
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,900
Then, I don't understand.

433
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:23,483
Why didn't you go ahead
and use Yod on Origami before,

434
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,067
back when she went Inverse?

435
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,608
[KURUMI]
Don't be silly.

436
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:27,692
Do you actually think I could

437
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,608
get close enough to her
at that point?

438
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,150
Look, whatever, forget it.
Let's do it now.

439
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,275
We can still find out

440
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,442
why she inversed
in this world, right?

441
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,692
Kurumi, please,
I need your help.

442
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,400
[KURUMI giggles]

443
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:41,233
Whatever shall I do with you?

444
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,067
[ORIGAMI]
Where could it be?

445
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,233
I don't get it.

446
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,483
How could I lose
my hair clip like this?

447
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,817
Huh? Wait, what if...

448
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,983
[footsteps]

449
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:54,400
Yes, I knew it.
This is where it was.

450
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,150
Thank goodness.
I should be more careful.

451
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,983

Please I need your help.

452
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,900
But in that case...

453
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,983
[ORIGAMI]
Is that Itsuka's voice?

454
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:08,025
Itsuka and who?

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,817
--[door creaks]
--[SHIDO] Uh. Huh?

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,025
Uh... No, this... I can explain.

What's she doing?

459
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,358
One way to find out.

460
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:43,108
Let's see, how should
I greet you here in this world?

461
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:45,400
Do I say, "Nice to meet you"?

462
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:46,983
Though, it does seem
quite possible

463
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,025
that we've already run
into each other several times

464
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:50,942
before this moment in time.

465
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:53,233
I will... kill you...

466
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,525
[grunts]

467
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,108
Armor? I knew it.

468
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,150
I knew you were Devil!

00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,358
Satan.

[grunts]

472

That's a pretty violent way
to greet a person.

473
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,900
No. Kurumi!
