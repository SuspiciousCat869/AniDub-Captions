1
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,775
Change history? Oh, boy.

2
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:17,150
[KURUMI]
Yes.

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,525
I want you to prove
whether or not it can be done.

4
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:22,817
I'm curious to know
if this unsalvageable ruin,

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,692
this tragedy
devoid of all hope,

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,317
could possibly
be prevented if we tried.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,567
So you think
there might be a chance?

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,025
I mean, I've always
heard it said

9
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,567
that history
will correct itself, but...

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,275
Sure, but do the people
who say that

11
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,442
typically have the power

12
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,650
to put their money
where their mouth is?

13
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,900
Well, no, I guess not.

14
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:45,692
Doesn't matter how crowded
this world may get,

15
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:49,733
the only one around who can
interfere with time is me.

16
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,733
And don't you forget it.

17
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,233
A little pointer, though.

18
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:56,108
Remember that whatever you see
before you is real,

19
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,942
and whatever moment you're in
is the only truth there is,

20
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,192
so be present.

21
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:03,317
Will I really be able
to save Origami?

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,358
Hard to say.
That really depends on you.

23
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,942
All right.
I'm in, let's do it.

24
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:14,025
Huh?

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,483
[KURUMI] Would you care
to explain what you're doing?

26
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,525
Cutting through this way'll
be a lot faster.

27
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:26,775
Hmm?

Uh... Sorry. Gotta go!

00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:39,233
Hey! You get back here.

[KURUMI]
Shido?

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,317
[SHIDO] Shoot. I can't afford
to waste time like this.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,733
What now?

35
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:47,608
What do I do?!

36
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,858

Yep, just me.

00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:58,067
Have you seen anyone sketchy
come through here?

40
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,733
Uh...
No, I haven't seen anybody.

41
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:02,983
[SUZUMOTO]
Really? That's weird.

42
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,275
Is it?

43
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,817
Huh? Oh!

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,400
Never mind,
don't you worry about it.

45
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,442
Tell your mom hi for me, okay?

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,400
Whew, that was a close one.

47
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,067
[KURUMI giggles]
Good thinking, I'm impressed.

48
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,983
[SHIDO]
Yeah. Never would've imagined

49
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,317
that I'd use Natsumi's
transformation powers,

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
but they came in super handy.

51
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,858
[KURUMI]
I'll say they did.

52
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,650
Looking like that,
no one will bat an eye

53
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,275
seeing you in the past.

54
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,817
Yeah, sure,
but how do I get back to normal?

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,567
[KURUMI] Aw, you're so cute,
why would you bother?

56
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,900
Yeah, very funny.

[KURUMI]
So it would seem.

Let's go!

Origami.

[KURUMI]
Not really.

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,650
For someone like Origami to have
ended up in her current state,

99

[SHIDO]
No way.

105

So I guess this means

Origami wasn't able
to change history after all.

this anger is mine alone.

I'm going to kill that thing.

carry everything for me

till I'm ready
to kill the Angel.

Uh...

So that's what happened.

How unexpected.

This is disappointing.

I'm sorry.
You used Yod Bet,

do anything to fix this.

what I'm talking about.

00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,317
What?

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,192
Shido, we just learned Origami's
the one who killed her parents,

167
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,025
and that means
this whole situation

168
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,692
wouldn't have happened
if not for my Zaphkiel.

169
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,483
So I have to be honest,

170
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,775
that's more than
a little upsetting to me.

171
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:30,817
Hold on.

172
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,067
I think you're being
a little unfair

173
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,567
to yourself, don't you?

174
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,150
I mean, you didn't
want this to happen.

175
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,858
[KURUMI]
No, of course not.

176
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,858
Anyway, it doesn't matter
'cause it's all over now.

177
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,983
[grunts]

178
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:48,358
[gasps]

179
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,775
[KURUMI]
Is that really what you think?

180
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,150
It's true, as far as
that world is concerned,

181
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,317
what's done is done.

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,858
Full stop.

183
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:58,567
However, I just happened to be
presented with a new method

184
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,150
to fix this mess
only a moment ago.

185
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,983
What are you talking about,
"presented"? By who?

186
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:07,608
Believe it or not, by you,
a few dozen minutes from now.

187
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,233
You mean the future me?

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,358
I don't get it.
Why would I do that?

189
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:14,733
[KURUMI]
Because the method future you

190
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,067
told me about isn't one

191
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,692
that the you who went
to the past was aware of.

192
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,900
Do you understand?

193
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,983
You're saying
that for this me, right now,

194
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,442
there's still a chance
I can save Origami?

195
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:26,775
[KURUMI]
You got it.

196
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,567
Apparently, this isn't over yet.

197
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,775
Let's go!

198
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:30,900
Indeed.

199
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,692
I agree, it's about time
we went ahead

200
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,900
and fixed this poor excuse
for a world.

201
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:38,567
Yes. I'll do literally anything
to save her.

202
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,692
[KURUMI]
Attaboy, that's the spirit.

203
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:43,608
[SHIDO]
So, how do we that?

204
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,692
It's pretty simple in theory.

205
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:48,608
Basically, we're just
going to have you try again.

206
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,775
[SHIDO]
Huh? What do you mean?

207
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,733
If you think about it,
what was the main reason

208
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:55,150
you weren't able
to stop Origami?

209
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,942
It was because you had no idea
what was about to happen.

210
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,442
Do you see where I'm going?

211
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,817
Yeah, I think I get it now.

212
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,442
The gist is that
you're suggesting

213
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,233
we use Yod Bet on me again,
is that right?

214
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,025
[KURUMI]
An interesting guess, for sure,

215
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,650
but I'm afraid
that's impossible.

216
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,608
As it stands now,
I'm simply sharing your senses,

217
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,983
or have you forgotten?

218
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,775
I can't physically interact
with you in any way.

219
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,317
[SHIDO]
Then... what?

220
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,858
There's another option.

221
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,650
One single method that only
I know and can make happen.

222
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,483
[SHIDO panting]

223
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,775
Is this the right place?

224
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,483
[KURUMI]
Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt.

225
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,983
I don't see anything.

226
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,817
--[gasps]
--Well, well, lucky me.

227
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,608
I will say,
it's definitely not every day

228
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,733
that a guest
stumbles upon us out here.

229
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,275
Kurumi?

230
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:46,858
When you know my name
right off the bat,

231
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,692
that's another story.

232
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,233
Who are you?

233
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:53,733
--[gun cocks]
--And what the hell do you want?

[grunts]

235
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:02,650
You, five years ago?

236
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,858
[KURUMI]
Yes.

237
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,858
It so happens
I was also near the scene

238
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:06,942
when this all occurred.

239
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,900
What the hell
were you doing there?

240
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,358
[KURUMI] Just checking out
what was up with that blaze.

241
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,775
I had this sneaking suspicion

242
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,150
that a Spirit might be part
of an inferno that size.

243
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,483
That makes sense.

244
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,108
So, then, what you
want me to do is...

245
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:23,483
Yep. You get to go
ask me to shoot you.

246
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,442
With Yod Bet.

247
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:28,192
[SHIDO]
Listen, I need your help.

248
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,858
[KURUMI] You are not to move
without my permission.

249
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,567
I can't guarantee
you'll survive.

250
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,317
I'm Shido Itsuka.

251
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,525
I came from five years
in the future.

252
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,525
And, Kurumi,
you're the one who sent me.

253
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:42,483
I swear, if this is
some kind of joke--

254
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,067
--This is not a joke!
--Oh?

255
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,567
Listen, please,
I need you to listen.

256
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,067
[KURUMI]
My goodness,

257
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,233
the old me sure was a cautious
little thing, wasn't she?

258
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:53,733
Let's try something.

259
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,775
Shido, do you think
you could have that me

260
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,275
physically touch you?

261
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,692
I'll try.

262
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:01,317
Did you just mumble something?

263
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,025
[SHIDO] Kurumi, would you
come touch my hand?

264
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,233
You can keep the gun on me.

265
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:09,692
Future Kurumi wants to talk.

266
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:11,567
Wait. I said that?

[SHIDO gasps]

[KURUMI]
Scale of one to ten,

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,650
how weird is it if I start with
"Long time, no see"?

270
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,025
Very interesting.

271
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:27,108
You definitely have my voice,
so that's a good start.

272
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,317
Wanna tell me
what this is all about?

273
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,983
[PAST KURUMI]
I see.

274
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,525
So you're saying
all you want me to do

275
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,025
is point Yod Bet at him
and shoot, is that right?

276
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,983
[KURUMI] Yes. I'd say
that's precisely what I want.

277
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,650
Very well, then.

278
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:44,858
[SHIDO]
Really?

279
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,483
I can't very well
refuse myself, can I?

280
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,192
Now, come to me!

Zaphkiel, it appears
your time is now!

Zaphkiel.

283
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,525
Yod Bet.

284
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,983
All right,
shall we proceed, then?

285
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,525
Yeah.

286

the best of luck, stranger.

[KURUMI giggles]

295
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,983
Can I assume you have
some sort of plan, then?

00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,983

Hmm...

297

[KURUMI]
Tick-tock, time's a-wastin'.

298

Look, stop pressuring me, okay?

299
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,525
I haven't really had time
to think about it.

300
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,525
[KURUMI] Remember, you and I
both know exactly

301
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,358
what's about to happen next.

302
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,358
So I vote you prevent Origami

303
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,608
from realizing
who killed her parents.

304
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,692
Sound like a good plan to you?

305
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,317
[SHIDO]
I considered that, too.

306
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,108
But it doesn't address
the enormous problem

307
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:58,025
that her parents will still die.

308
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,317
[KURUMI]
Hmm...

309
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,983
[SHIDO]
Let's be real.

310
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,192
As long as her parents
are killed

311
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,108
at the hand of a Spirit--
any Spirit--

312
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,525
she could end up
directing that grudge

313
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,692
towards anyone at all.

314
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:14,192
On Kotori,
who caused the inferno.

315
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:17,275
Or Phantom, the one who gave her
the power to do that.

316
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,317
[KURUMI] What's going on
in that head, Shido?

317
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,317
[SHIDO]
Wouldn't it work out if...

318
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,733
If Origami appeared
but there was no enemy in sight?

319
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,942
Well, yeah,
it's possible, but...

320
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,525
Good. There's something
I wanna try.

321
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,858
[KURUMI]
Okay, you do realize

322
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,233
you're creeping around
like a pervert?

323
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,025
[SHIDO]
Oh, shut up.

324
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:42,817
[KURUMI] By the way,
I assume you know this,

325
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,525
but it never hurts to clarify,

326
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,650
you can't interact
with Kotori or the others.

327
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,483
Yeah. I get that.

328
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,442
I shouldn't tamper with history
any more than necessary.

329
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,650
The only thing I'm here to do
is to save Origami.

330
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,358
--[KURUMI] Shido?
--It's here.

331
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,442
[gasps]

332
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,275
[KURUMI]
Try to refrain, would you?

333
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,317
[gasping]

334
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:24,108
[KOTORI screams]

335
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,858
Kotori, I'm sorry.

336
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:38,025
[grunts]

337
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,317
[SHIDO]
Hey!

338
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,775
So you're Phantom.
Been waiting.

339
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:45,525
[PHANTOM]
You're...

340
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:49,275
It can't be. Why are you...

341
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,358
Wait a minute,
how do you know me?

342
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:53,692
[KURUMI]
Better hurry.

343
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:54,900
[SHIDO]
I'm on it.

344
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,567
[KURUMI] Didn't see
that reaction coming, did you?

345
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,525
Is that someone you're already
acquainted with, Shido?

346
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,692
Nope, can't say I know anyone
who censors their entire body.

347
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:06,900
[KURUMI chuckles]

348
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,358
I have to admit,
I never would've imagined

349
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,275
that your big plan
would basically consist

350
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,192
of chatting with Phantom.

351
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:13,650
Is that a problem?

352
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,942
'Course not,

353
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,400
and it's so incredibly like you
to attempt that.

354
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:20,775
But I can't say
it'd be my recommendation.

355
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:23,983
The fact is, that one
is impossible to predict.

356
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,275
Do you know who she is, then?
[gasps]

357
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,358
[SHIDO]
Phantom.

358
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,150
[PHANTOM]
Huh, Phantom, is it?

359
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:35,067
Am I to understand
that's the name I've been given?

360
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,942
I apologize for running off
like that before.

361
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,525
I thought it would be better
to do this away from her.

362
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:45,025
[PHANTOM] Oh, sorry.
Should've done this sooner.

363
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:47,067
Is that what you look like?

364
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,317
Well, no, this isn't
my real appearance.

365
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,567
I don't think I can show you

366
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,317
what I actually
look like just yet.

367
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,858
So do you know
who I am or something?

368
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,608
[PHANTOM]
I do.

369
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,150
Very well, yes.

370
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,775
[PHANTOM]
So?

371
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,150
Is that really all you wanted?

372
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,400
You went through the trouble
of using a time travel bullet

373
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,817
to come back here.

374
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,650
This isn't just
a vacation, is it?

375
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,692
How do you know all this...?

376
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:16,275
Fine, I'll get straight
to the point, then.

377
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:18,650
I need you to disappear
right now.

378
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,275
Is that your poetic way
of saying

379
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,108
that you're here to kill me?

380
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,692
[SHIDO] No, this is about
saving someone.

381
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:27,900
I just want you
to get out of sight, fast.

382
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,650
[PHANTOM]
I see.

383
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,983
--Sorry, but my answer is "no."
--[SHIDO] Huh?

384
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm afraid that I still have
a few things I have to do.

385
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:37,733
Please just go!

386
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,233
Origami is about to...

387
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,192
[gasps]

388
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:43,442
[KURUMI] Shido, what's going on?
What's wrong?

389
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,025
[SHIDO] Wait, why does
this feel so familiar?

390
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,400
[PHANTOM] When the time is
right, we should meet again.

391
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,608
[chuckles]

392
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:59,400
I promise you,
this time, I'll never let go.

393
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,025
I won't make
that same mistake again.

394
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,483
[SHIDO gasps]

395
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:09,983
[SHIDO grunts]

396
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,775
[coughing]

397
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,317
[KURUMI]
Are you okay, Shido?

398
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Breathe.

399
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:16,025
[SHIDO]
Yeah, I'm fine.

400
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,442
[SHIDO]
Who the heck was she?

401
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,942
[grunts]

402
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,358
[SHIDO]
Don't tell me...

403
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:29,692
Origami!

404
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,692
[inaudible]

405
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,400
Don't, Origami!

406
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,192
[SHIDO]
No!

407
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,733
I won't let it.

408
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,483
I can't let that happen
to her again.

409
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,817
[SHIDO]
I will change the past!

410
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,358
Just hold on, okay?

411
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,275
I'm coming!

412
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,442
[ORIGAMI'S PARENTS]
Origami!

413
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,858
Mom and Dad. There you are.

414
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,983
No, Origami, don't!

415
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,400
[KURUMI]
There's no use, it's too late.

416
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,817
Dammit. No, it's not!

417
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,067
[KURUMI]
Shido, wait!

418
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,775
[SHIDO sighs]
I did it...

419
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,233
[SHIDO gasps]

420
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:54,900
What the...

421
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,942
Wait. Wasn't I...

422
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,442
Kurumi? Kurumi!

423
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,525
Did it work? Did I do it?

424
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,650
Was I able to save them?

425
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,775
[SHIDO]
Origami and her parents?
