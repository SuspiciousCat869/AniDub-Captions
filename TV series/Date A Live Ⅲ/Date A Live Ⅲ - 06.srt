in this kind of nasty debauchery

No, I'm not,

transform, anyway?

Right, I never told you
about that.

What? Wait, was the seal
incomplete or something?

35
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:52,108
Oh, no. The seal itself
was actually successful.

36
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,775
So are the transformations
triggered by her emotions, then?

37
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:58,900
[KOTORI] Yeah. I guess
that's one way of putting it.

She's not the most stable

about over there?

Fear of missing out has always
been kind of a thing with me.

Just look at her.

You gotta do something
about transforming

Listen, I totally get
that you're jealous

Origami Tobiichi will be
transferring to another school

Unfortunately, I don't really
have any other details.

I got a call from her
out of the blue

and all she said was
that she was transferring.

She said she'd send in
the forms later on.

No. Did she say
what school she's going to?!

Oh. Well, she sort of did.

about a school in England.

some kind of grudge

and came to get revenge.

107
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:41,650
The truth is, I was thinking
that, since you just moved in,

108
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,733
you probably don't know
the city all that well

That's right. That has to be it.

all there is to know, either.

all that helpful to you.

until all the others were gone

161
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,192
Gotcha.

162
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,025
Well, I'd hate
to make everyone worry,

163
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,608
but we can't keep it
from them forever.

164
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:04,358
We need to find Shido fast,
before all the others get home.

165
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,525
[groans]

166
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,067
Huh? Where am I?

167
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,942
[grunting]

168
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,858
What happened at Origami's?

169
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:25,108
Huh?

170
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,067
It's you! Where have you been?

171
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,275
Why were you...

172
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,233
Water? Bet you're
a little thirsty.

173
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,358
[SHIDO]
I...

174
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,983
Um, yeah.

175
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,525
Hey, stop,
what are you doing?!

176
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:43,192
Yes, I want some,
but only the normal way!

177
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,608
Thanks, real slow--

178
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,692
[coughing]

179
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,858
Look, can you help me out?
Just untie me.

180
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,192
[ORIGAMI]
That I can't do.

181
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:02,942
It's true--
you really joined DEM.

182
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,067
Yes.

183
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,442
And my abduction?

184
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,108
Did Westcott order you
to do this to me?

185
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,233
This is all me.

186
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,567
I brought you here
of my own volition.

187
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,025
DEM is completely
unaware that I kidnapped

188
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,442
and brought you here today.

189
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,567
This is the only way
to get it done.

190
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,608
If I was going to
keep you out of it,

191
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:23,525
this method held the
strongest chance for success.

192
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,483
Hold on a sec, what do you mean,
"Keep me out"?

193
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,983
Out of what?

194
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,400
[ORIGAMI] My fight is
only with the Spirits.

195
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,942
And by Spirits, you mean...

196
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,233
Of course.

197
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:37,400
You know I mean them, too.
No exceptions.

198
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,650
Wait, I thought the point was
that you were after the Spirit

199
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,942
who killed your parents!

200
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,817
Tohka and the others
had nothing to do with it!

201
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,942
But Spirits are all the same.

202
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,692
If we're going to keep
more humans like me

203
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,358
from being created,

204
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:53,192
then we simply cannot allow
them to continue existing.

205
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:56,108
But Tohka and the others
don't even register as Spirits.

206
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:59,233
Remember? You told me you didn't
have to go after them anymore.

207
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:01,567
[ORIGAMI] That was
a Self-Defense Force decision.

208
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,733
It has nothing to do
with me now.

209
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,775
[SHIDO]
Think, Origami.

210
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:12,483
It's been over six months
since I met Tohka

211
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,608
and she transferred
to our school.

212
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,525
Man, time flies.

213
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:18,317
Now, the Spirits
you guys used to fight

214
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,942
are a regular part
of our society.

215
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:24,358
Not only that,
they're a part of our lives.

216
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:25,858
So how can you?

217
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,983
You, who have been here
through all of it,

218
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,608
how can you look at them
and say they haven't changed?

219
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,900
That it's once a Spirit,
always a Spirit?

220
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,275
That they're so dangerous,
they need to be murdered?!

221
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,442
[ORIGAMI] You really think
I don't get it?

222
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,942
Tohka and all the others
have drawn me in, too.

223
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,150
But they're Spirits,
all the same.

224
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,483
Seeing them should
feed my revenge.

225
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,192
And yet it hasn't.

226
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:52,942
I can never forgive myself for
slowly losing sight of my goal.

227
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,317
Five years ago,

228
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,733
I swore I'd get revenge
for the death of my parents.

229
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,317
But now, I live
amongst my enemies.

230
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,442
I've been so weak.

231
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,983
The reason I decided
to join DEM

232
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,025
was because I realized
how wrong I'd been.

233
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,775
That in accepting
Tohka Yatogami,

234
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,525
I was betraying
everything I believed.

235
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,067
But that's because
what you believed was wrong!

236
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,108
You know them as well as I do!
They're peaceful.

237
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,858
All they want is
to live normal lives!

238
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,858
[ORIGAMI]
No. I can't allow that.

239
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:27,067
They are what they are, Shido.

240
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,025
I have more to destroy
than just Spirits.

241
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,358
I have to kill the girl in me

242
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,858
who chose to take
the easy way out.

243
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,525
[ORIGAMI]
I'll regain the person I was

244
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,567
by taking the life
of Tohka Yatogami.

245
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,192
Origami, wait!
Please come back!

246
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,817
[slam]

247
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,900
[ELLEN]
And you're okay with it, Ike?

248
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,608
Allowing her to act
on her own like this?

249
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,317
[WESTCOTT]
Doesn't matter to me.

250
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,775
I'm glad she's showing
some initiative.

251
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,858
There's no sense
dampening the enthusiasm

252
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:01,942
of a young Wizard,
in my opinion.

253
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:05,067
Remember, in the end,
what we're after are Spirits.

254
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,067
And the only way to measure
the power of a bomb

255
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,733
is to simply let it drop.

256
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,608
Be honest, aren't you
a little curious

257
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,400
about how far she'll go
if given the chance?

258
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:16,525
Very well, then.

259
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,858
I'll do whatever
I can behind the scenes.

260
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,483
You're displeased, though.

261
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,692
I can tell because
your brows wrinkle right here

262
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,358
when you have to lie.

263
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,317
--[gasps]
--[WESTCOTT] Just kidding.

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,025
[laughing]

265
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,817
Come on, don't be mad at me.

266
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,233
It just so happens that I have
another target in mind

267
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:33,942
for you this time.

268
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,442
We have another target?

269
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,858
Yes. Ratatoskr.

270
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,025
They have a certain ship

271
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,108
that's going to
get in Origami's way,

272
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:45,650
and I want you to stop it
using Goetia, naturally.

273
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,275
Can't believe a tummy ache
sent Shido home.

274
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:49,442
He's too weak.

275
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,275
We need to train him
back up into shape.

276
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,900
Agreed.
He's turned into a wimpy-wimp.

277
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,525
Starting tomorrow,
we'll make him run laps.

278
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:59,025
I'm sure he had
a good reason for leaving.

279
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:02,108
Question. I've heard people
saying that Master Origami

280
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,025
has transferred schools
for some reason.

281
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,400
Do we think Shido leaving
could be related to that?

282
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,983
[TOHKA] Yeah. In fact,
that's exactly when he left--

283
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,442
right after he found out
about Origami.

284
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,400
[laughs]
See? I so knew that.

285
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,567
It smelled fishy
to me the whole time.

286
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,858
You can smell fish?

287
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,692
How weird.
I can't smell anything.

288
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,442
That's not really what I meant.

289
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,942
[BOTH gasp]

290
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,775
--[chuckles]
--[groans]

291
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,358
Hey, Tohka!

292
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:32,567
And Kaguya! And Yuzuru!

293
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,150
Huh?

294
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,275
Why on earth would you choose
to dodge my expression of love?

295
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,733
Oh. That's what that was?

296
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,233
Well, duh, of course.

297
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,067
It's the new thing
everyone's doing.

298
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,733
Come on. Bring it on in.

299
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,400
Don't be fooled, kinswomen.

300
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,817
Warning.
I definitely smell a liar.

301
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,442
A-ha. I knew it.

302
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,108
For starters, what the heck
are you doing here, anyway?

303
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,358
Right, 'kay.

304
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,733
I came out to visit darling,

305
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:56,192
but no one was there
so it was super boring.

306
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,567
And then, the house
next door was empty, too.

307
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,233
Ah. So you mean Shido
hasn't come home yet?

308
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,775
What about the Origami thing?

309
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:05,567
I have a feeling that she has
something to do with this.

310
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,858
Agreement.

311
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,733
I think we might actually
be on to something.

312
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,442
You guys. Would someone
please tell me

313
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,067
what the heck is going on?

314
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,858
Did something happen
to my darling?

--Here's the deal.

318
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,775
I guess we should assume
another Spirit showed up.

319
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:24,692
Curious. Should we all go see
who this Spirit is?

320
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,275
No, we can't do that.

321
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,650
You know that if
the alarm is sounding,

322
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,400
that means we have to evacuate.

323
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:30,817
I know, but Shido--

There is no spatial quake.

[TOHKA] What do you mean?
There must be, just listen.

329
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,400
The alarm is sounding

330
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,067
because I put in a request
for it to do so.

331
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Neither a Spirit nor the AST
are going to show up.

332
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:51,233
But why? What would make you
do something like that?

333
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,608
To make it easier
to kill the rest of you.

I said,
the point is to kill you.

To kill all Spirits.

Look at your eyes. Oh, no...

Why have you gone back
to before, Origami Tobiichi?

Respect. This is our
Master Origami.

343
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,692
Now then, how about explaining
what this is all about?

344
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,900
Inquiry. Please answer our call,
Master Origami.

345

We have no desire
to fight you today.

Hey, you guys. Is everyone okay?

we'll be killed.

Where the hell
did she come from?

00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,650
Such great magical power.

00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,233
She's on a whole other level
than before.

Without their full Spirit armor,
the others aren't safe!

Let's go get them out of there.

If it gets ugly,
deploy the Yggdrafolium.

Wait, you're Ellen Mathers.

you've heard of me, then.

It's an honor,

You honestly believe

that you could take down
Fraxinus, don't you?

396
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,733
All I'll say is I can't
deny the possibility

397

that it might happen.

But seriously, "Fraxinus"?
As in, the tree of life?

I assume Elliot
must have chosen the name.

Don't you think you might be
underestimating Fraxinus

00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,608
just a little bit?

perhaps you're the person

the underestimating here?

you wanna say?

Yes, only to the one

you should do it now.

I would have done so
a dozen times before now.

Yeah. Leaving all this
behind and running?

424
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,067
How is that any different
than death?

What was that speed?

460
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,858
[KANNAZUKI] I think
they must have thinned out

461

the Territory
surrounding the ship.

462
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,400
That would maximize
their mobility.

As for that driving force,
best guess?

464
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,525
They probably used Territory
to flick the ship aside.

Wait, you're saying
that's actually possible?

Oh, sure.
Theoretically, it could be done.
