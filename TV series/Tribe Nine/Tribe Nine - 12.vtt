00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
Your Immanence. These
miscreants are beneath you.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
You needn't have
gone to the trouble.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Will you stay
the course and fight,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
or will you bend the knee?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
--[HARU] We'll fight!
--We're not goin' anywhere!

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
So be it.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
Please, Highness,
I can handle this. I--

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
There is no true victory
without sacrifice,

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
just as there can be no glory
in battle without honor.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Your sins are as grave as
Tenshin's. You disgust me.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
Now leave. Never appear
before me again.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Sire! Everything
I've done was for you!

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Need I repeat myself?

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
Very well then,
let the game resume.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Ojiro, wait!

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
Is this what you want?

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.000 position:50% align:center
Ojiro!

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:28.421 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:32.300 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] So cool! We get
our own bats and gloves?

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Mh-hm.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Whoa!

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.971 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oops.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
It's all right. I'll get it.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
See? You're a natural.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
It's your turn to be
pitcher now, by the way.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.199 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
When we're older,

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
you and me are gonna
play for the same Tribe.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.288 position:50% align:center
And then, one day, after
we've beaten everybody else,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.874 position:50% align:center
we can form the best new Tribe.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.013 position:50% align:center
Nothing but the single
best XB player in existence

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.056 position:50% align:center
will bring me satisfaction!

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center
Anything less is a travesty.
Trash to be disposed of!

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Winning is all that matters.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50% align:center
The strong shall survive.
The weak shall perish.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.950 position:50% align:center
Only a fool would deny it.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Banished, am I?

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
Then obeying you is
no longer my concern.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
Let's skip a few
steps in my plan,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
bring the mighty Otori
clan to heel.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
Erecting a puppet government
will be simple enough.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
I'll rule Neo Tokyo
from the shadows.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
No glory in battle
without honor?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
I say there can be no real
power without cunning.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Chiyoda.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE]
Just a moment!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
You again?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you doing?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
Surely you know.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.813 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Look skyward, gentlemen.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
The judgment of heaven
is upon us.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
That's real cute--

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
It's been fun.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Harpy!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
Can't say I don't
like her style.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Not the time, Yaji!
Just deactivate the damn thing!

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Agh. This'll take too long.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
We have to go and
warn the others!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Wait a second!

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
[groans] Why's it always
gotta be complicated?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
You've done well,

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
but agreeing to continue is
the extent of your strength.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
That fighting spirit
will be summarily crushed.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
Victory shall be mine.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
The hour of your
eradication has arrived!

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
Losing doesn't
scare me. However...

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
...I'm not just
fighting for myself.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
Very well. I will exterminate
all you hold dear.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
For my family.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
And the memory of the
person who taught me...

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
...how to fight!

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
That ball is outta here!

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
[HANNYA A]
We're losing altitude!

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Chiyoda Castle!

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
No way. This doesn't bode well.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Heads up!

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
The chick with the
legs has lost it!

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Anyone who values their
life needs to evacuate.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
At that vector and speed,
it's most likely to land...

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
[gasps] ...on Neo Tokyo Station!

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
That'll be sick!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
Haru!

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
The lad's makin' a
B-line for first base.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
Will you snap out of it?

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
The city's about
to be pulverized!

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
We can't keep playing like this.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
Haru, do you read me? Come in!

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
Sorry, he's too
hyper-focused to stop.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
It's like he said,
he's doin' this all for us.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
And what about you?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
Right. Fantastic point.
I'll go and help.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
I'll join you.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
Huh? Good!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
There's no profit
in carrying on.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
In fact, we'll incur a loss.

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
Sensei! You'll take care
of everyone, yeah?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
Heh. Pupils don't tell
their masters what to do.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
Just shut up and go.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Taiga! Kazuki!

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
Bring him back.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Haru!

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
Wait for us!

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
Here he comes.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
Your "secretary" is bringing
down Chiyoda Castle!

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
I don't give a damn.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
This fighting is never
going to stop, ever.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
Not until everyone submits.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that so?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
Well, then I guess
you've made your peace

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
with how lonely things
are at the top.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
Don't be coy.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
It's my destiny.
The mark of my strength.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
No! XB is about your teammates!

00:07:56.393 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
Camaraderie doesn't exist.
It's all an illusion!

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Hey, who do you think
you're callin' an illusion?

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
You don't impress me.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
You vermin can resist
to your heart's content.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
It won't change anything.
I will triumph!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Go. Get out of here, now.
I'm ending this fight my way.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
We can't just leave you!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
Haru, do what he says.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
And yet you've succumbed
to the delusion after all.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
Ojiro, you'll never know
the shame that I felt.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
Leaving the facility
cast off and alone.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] But the worst part
about tasting freedom

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
was knowing you were still
trapped in that horrible place.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
If I could, I would have
wanted nothing more

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
than to take you with me.

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
Ojiro, you okay?

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO sighs]

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
Only the strong
can survive in here.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Friends are a liability.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
'Cause they don't really exist.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
All I want is to live.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
That means, one day,
I'll have to defeat you,

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
before you can stab
me in the back.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN] Number Thirty-one.
Kazuki Aoyama.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
"Cast off"?
You mean I defeated you.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
Now I know what
happened to you.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
I think you're
motivated by fear.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
You crush your opponents to dust

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
because you're scared
that otherwise,

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
they'll rise up and
follow your example.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
You're paranoid.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
Though to be fair to you,

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't be.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI yells]

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Keep it together.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
This reminds me of the old days!

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Except one fact. I'm not
the child you remember.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
All right, then.
That should do it.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get in!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
The three of you better
get home safe and sound.

What's the matter?

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
Overestimate what your
arm was capable of?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Lucky for you, I suppose.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
You'd be six feet
under now otherwise.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
That a fact?

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
There's more to you
than meets the eye, boyo.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
Who? Me?

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Who else?

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
You stood your ground against
Ojiro proper fierce-like.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Yeah. Guess I've
changed quite a bit, huh?

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
It's really all thanks to Shun.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, him and everyone
else I've played XB with.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
Back in the day,
when something scared me,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
my first instinct was
to always run away.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
The difference now is,

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
I have people to
face those things for.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
I'm done with running away.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
Having friends gives me the
strength to stand my ground!

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Huh. Nice.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
So, in other words,
you draw a boatload of strength

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
in your life from
just knowing me.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center

Shite!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You think yourself
impressive all by your lonesome?

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
So sure you can take us out
when we stand together?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center

on their own!

[TAIGA yells]

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
And what happens next exactly?

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center
Where d'you think
you'll go from here?

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
What's the follow-up
to being top dog?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
Absolute power is
its own reward.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
There's nothing else
beyond that.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
You're wrong.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
There's so much more.
To life, and to XB.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
You can't stop moving.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
To hide behind power
is cowardice.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
Don't be absurd.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

Kazuki.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
In the end, I guess it's
just the two of us left.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Whatever. I'm not about
to lose to you.

[KAZUKI groaning]

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
Just an illusion.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Ojiro. Please. No!

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
So, wha'cha think?

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
When we both become XB players,
which Tribe do you wanna join?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll just
go where you go.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
We'll fight alongside
each other then!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
Fair warning, though.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
Heh. If we join the same Tribe,
I'm gonna take up the ace spot.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
I can live with that.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
As long as we're still friends,
that's the only reason to play.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Kazuki...

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
Guess it's just
the two of us again.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
I took a train for you.
Believe in friends now?

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
Ojiro.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
The castle's hit the city!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center

Kazuki!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Minato.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
It would appear I've been
traded back to Chiyoda.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
So now it's my duty to ensure
Ojiro sees this through!

would've been a tag out.

you're the winner.

not say this was fun?

Pushing past your limits.

That's what XB does.
