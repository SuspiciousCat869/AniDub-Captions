Ugh. Guess the jig's up.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
So much for keeping the
underground tunnel system

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.308 position:50% align:center
our best kept secret.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
Who gives a damn?

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.353 position:50% align:center
You make it sound like
that's the only thing

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
that gives us an edge.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
These guys are done for.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
We could tear 'em a new
one with our eyes closed.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] What's this guy's story?
When did Shun ask him to join?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
And why haven't
I seen him before?

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
Our next play requires
precision timing.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.594 position:50% align:center
But don't despair,
I'll give you a signal

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center

yourself with thinking.

What? How is that not cheating?

Accident? That's a load of bull.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
Excellent defense.

we go on the offense?

Told you. That is how you pull
one over on the Adachi Tribe.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
You can't just dangle
heaven on a string

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
This is a supreme

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
Right, boys.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
He's squeezin' into places

feeling about you!

Hey, if we keep it up,
we just might win!

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
Why the sour faces?

turning things around.

Or hadn't you noticed?

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
That's a good thing, yes?
Or am I mistaken?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
Catch yourself on!

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
We wanna win.
But this just... I dunno.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
It feels like the wrong
way to go about it.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.948 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't we rude?

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
I don't care for the implication
that I'm underhanded.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Wait! No, I didn't mean that!

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.956 position:50% align:center
Come now, what about that
game against Chiyoda?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
How would you classify
your tactics?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
They don't seem like
a far cry from my own.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
Right, look, usin' the
oil was a cheap shot.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Uh, all of 'em?

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
Bear in mind our real goal.
This isn't about winning.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
It's about rescuing a colleague
being held against her will.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
Anything goes in a
hostage situation.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
Surely you don't disagree.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
Use your brain.
Or is it all tuna?

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
You leave tuna out of this!

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
Listen here! Nobody
takes me for a scut!

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
I'll break Saori out... somehow.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
And I won't need
dumb tricks to do it.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
Look, no offense,

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
but Shun would've done
it while playing fair.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
And what exactly does
that word mean to you?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] If it's such
an important concept,

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
help me understand.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
I can orchestrate a victory
around whatever you've got.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
Orchestrate how?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
What, we're just like
game pieces to you?

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center

with bein' your pawns!

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Really? Just as well.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
No tactician should
stoop to using you.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
The fact of the matter is,

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
you're absolutely
garbage XB players.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
Face it, friends, you made
one hit against Shinagawa,

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
and calling it a fluke
would be generous.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
What?! One hit?
That can't be right.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
Heh. You can't even manage
to keep track of the game.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
Well, it would seem
I owe tuna an apology.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
The only thing between
your ears is hot air.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
That hit was the real deal.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
World-class tuna fishermen
don't do flukes.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
You've done even less
than this doormat.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
Who, I might add,
is a liability.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
But I just--

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
Easy. There's no
reason to be mean.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
Real talk, on a good day,
Taiga stops more runners

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
than the rest of us combined.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! Suck on that.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
I'm the best dang defender
this team's ever had!

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
Anyone who crosses my path
curses the day they were born!

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Yeh! Yeh!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Points aren't scored
by playing defense.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
You only wrack up runs by
being a competent batter.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
The fact you fail to grasp
that rather cinches my case.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
Come on! Now you're
pissin' me off!

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI] Infighting doesn't
accomplish anything!

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Gimme a break!
He ain't one of us!

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Things are
gettin' kinda heated.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
Not exactly what I was
hopin' to see here. Damn.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
All right. Prepare for
us to take the lead! Uh.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
Ohh, the big bad boss
finally steppin' up

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
to try and save the day, huh?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
This one's just for me.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
What's that mean?

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Huh?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
Uh. Did he just...?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I've seen this before.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
Don't get cocky.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
It ain't over till it's over,
wiseguy. I can still--

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
Easy. XB's not goin'
anywhere soon.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
Try to relax. There's time
for you to get good.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
Practice. We'll pick this
back up down the road.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
XB might not've gone anywhere,
but you sure as hell did.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
It's not the same anymore.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
Have a good look. This here
is my signature weapon.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
From now on, it'll be
what people think of

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
when they hear the name Minato!

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
See, when I'm done
with you losers,

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
there'll be nothing
left but ash!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I'd be intimidated,

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
if I didn't remember Shun
always striking you out.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
Too bad he's not here
to save your ass.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
Screw you! There's more to the
Minato Tribe than just Shun!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
We'll see about that.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[bell dings]

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
What are you doing on a bicycle?

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's just as cool!

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI]
This is what I'm talking about

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
when I tell you to
get your license!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna!

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
As soon as they take all those
trick questions off the test!

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
Have fun keepin' up!

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
[SABURO]
Hm?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
Incoming.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Damn!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
No need to panic.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
Their field provides
plenty of space

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
for someone to back you up.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
Nice pick!

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Now find a place to lay low
and ready an ambush.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Stop tellin' me what to do!

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
Heads up. This is
where you get lamped.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
Heh. Dunno what that means,
but you're goin' down!

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Shut your bake!

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
Taiga, no!

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Oh! So close!

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Son of a--!

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
You gotta stop broadcastin'
your moves, dude.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
You're givin' Shun's
legacy a real bad name.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
What do you know?

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
You haven't seen
what I'm capable of!

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
Let me give you some pointers.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
There's two things you need
to be worth a damn in a fight.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
Brains! Guts! And determination!

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
Two things?

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
Just let him have this.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
It's like anything else.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
If you expect to win,
you gotta want it!

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Huh?

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You may know
how to hold your own,

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
but you don't know me.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
Ha! At least you got guts,
I'll give you that!

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
You're a disgrace to the sport.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
If Shun were alive, he'd be
hangin' his head in shame.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
Don't do it! Sit down!
You're injured!

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
Still haven't had enough?
Glutton for punishment, huh?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
Don't even! I ain't
finished with you yet!

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] You're not
gonna beat me, Red.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
You're only gonna get burned.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that?
It matches your hair.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center

Dumbass.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Uh...

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Strike!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Forget to swing?

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I wasn't ready
that time, hot shot.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
Toss me another.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Strike two!

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
Yer outta here!

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
There, see?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
I wasn't being sarcastic
about the hit he got earlier.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
It was pretty evidently a fluke.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
Is this really all you got?

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
Two down in the
top of the ninth.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
It's all over now unless
Taiga manages to get a run.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
Doubt it though.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
Hm? Wait, that bat belonged to--

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
Yes, and he left it to me.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
I see. Can you actually use it?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
[HARU gasps]

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
He might as well have given
a rocket launcher to a baby.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
I know I'm not ready...

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
...but still, it's the only
thing I can do to help us win!

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[HARU yelping]

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Strike one!

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
Yo! Watch it!

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
I think you got it
backwards there, champ.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
Take it easy will ya?

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
You swing the bat,
not the other way around.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
[HARU] I may not be ready,
but I have to try!

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Strike two!

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
Ugh. The secondhand
embarrassment.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
Without Shun, you really
don't have anything.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
You just rode on his coattails.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
You're parasites,
pretending you had skills.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
Mine are wasted on this team.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
Pearls before swine.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
God. He's crying?
Now's not the time.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
Is-Is he doing that
because of me?

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
You don't know
anything about us!

[ALL gasp]

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
Quit babbling about Shun.
He's not here to call the shots.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
We're still the Minato Tribe,

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
and with or without him,
that's how it's gonna stay!

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Um, how did you get here?

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
You let her go?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so. Look, boss,
I tried my damndest.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center

[SAORI]
We're stronger than this, guys.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
How are we losing to a bunch
of greased up pompadours?

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
It's a joke!

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
Well, not on my watch.

00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
Yes, Shun is gone, but we've
all fought our own battles.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Haru!

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
Your bat, which it is now, since
he specifically left it to you,

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
you're holding it for a reason.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
He believed in you.
Now try believing in yourself.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
Saori...

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
I can do this!

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
Heh. If you say so.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
You've got way better
eyes than you think.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
The trick is learning
how to see.

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
Just keep them open
and use them both.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Booya!

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
Now go!

Oh, please. That was weak.
Get him at first base!

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
[HARU] I did it! I hit a ball
with the beam bat!

Uh-oh. Come on! You can make it!

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Too slow!

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

Hell yes!

With the hostage safe,
the stakes are gone.

[SAORI]
Shut your trap.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
This is Minato versus
Adachi proper.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah? So?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
I'm ending it regardless. Sorry.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I am the next one up to bat.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
Better luck next time.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
I suppose this just
isn't your day, huh?

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
Hey, quit takin' the mickey.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
I'm only being rational.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
Positive thinking doesn't take
the place of requisite skill.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
You can say that again.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Hm?

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Hmph.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
Why do you think I'm here?

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
I'll be your pinch hitter.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
Grab some pine and
stay outta my way.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
You're aware his
fireball's the real deal.

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
Get your head out of your ass
and watch how real I can be.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
Hey there, sweetheart. Heh.
Couldn't stay away, could ya?

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
I have fond memories of
you callin' the pitches.

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
It really was a thing of beauty.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
That's cute.
But if memory serves,

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
I just kept calling fastballs
and you couldn't hit one.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
Shoe's on the other foot now.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
Let's see how well you handle
the heaters I'm throwin'.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
Ready when you are.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
Whatch'a gonna do with
those noodle arms?

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I'm bringin' the fire, baby.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Look out. It's hot,
dangerous, and fast.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
So? Stop talkin' and throw.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
I used to handle whatever
Shun tossed my way.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
I'm used to the sun,
not a matchstick.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
Let's dance!

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
Seems we can finally get
this team off the ground.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] The Minato Tribe
is going all the way!

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
That's what the
game's all about!

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
This is the Minato Tribe.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
Scrappy, but fierce.
Cornered, but still fightin'.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
Seems weak, but they're
tough as nails.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
We just need
reminding sometimes.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
When the chips are down,
we're fighters.

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.978 position:50% align:center
Even without the one
who brought us together.

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
XB is in our blood.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you telling us
this whole thing was...?

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
A much needed kick in the pants.
Adachi-style encouragement.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't be lookin' at me

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
like I know what
you're talkin' about.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
Been a while since anybody hit
one outta the shopping center.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Gonna take forever to find it.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
I'm postponing this match
till further notice.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
Best damn hit I've seen
in I don't know how long.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Kudos to you.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
Hyakutaro!

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
What do you want?

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
The magic's gone.
I'm not into it.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
We'll come for ya
sooner or later.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
Don't get comfortable.

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI HOST A]
Here. From the boss.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
Just a little partin' gift.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50% align:center
Um, okay. Thanks.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
Guys, I'm so sorry.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Get outta here with that mess.
You don't need to apologize.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
'Specially if you're
offerin' to share that cake!

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Mm-hmm!

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Whaddya say?
Let's reform the Minato Tribe!

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
But Ojiro said that--

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
He did tell us to disband,

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
but that technically means
we're free to re-form.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
Not surprised. How are you
always two steps ahead?

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
Anyway, who's in? Who's out?

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Right!

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
Okay, the results of the poll

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
have been all counted
and tallied up,

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
and our new leader is
none other than Saori!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
I demand a recount.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.337 position:50% align:center
Hey, boss. Give us
a rousing speech!

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Uh. Right now?

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
As your new leader,

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
it is my solemn oath
to ensure that we all--

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Speeches aren't my thing!

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Huddle up! Hands in, everyone!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
[ICHIRO, JIRO chuckle]

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
[HARU gasps]

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
Right. You all know the drill!

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center
Minato Tribe...

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Bombers!

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
So fluffy.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
Hey, about this Ojiro Otori
schmuck. He's a psycho.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.416 position:50% align:center
What happens to the
people he beats?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
Severed tendons.
Mangled arms and legs.

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:18.505 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that those
are the lucky ones.

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:21.383 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. That's no good.

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:22.926 position:50% align:center
C'mon, boys!

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:26.846 position:50% align:center
Whaddya say we go teach the rat
bastard a lesson in manners?
