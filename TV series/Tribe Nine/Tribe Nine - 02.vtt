00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN] This day, Ojiro,
your campaign begins.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Sir.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Has it been so long
since I anointed you

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
with the title of protégé?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
Seems only a fortnight ago.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
How meager your talents were

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
when first I took
you under wing.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
Indeed, an heir less
worthy of my attention

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
scarcely bore imagining.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] You have worked
marvels, Lord Tenshin.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
Do not grow complacent.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
There is much work
still to be done.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
One day, dear boy,

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
the tribes of Neo Tokyo
as one shall bow to you.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
Crush them. Nothing
less will suffice.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Of course. That is my intention.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
How insignificant.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
Good evening.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
Nice to see everyone.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
Hello, sir!

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
Beg pardon!

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
Ugh. What do I say?

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
Why are you like this, mate?

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
No idea what you're
talking about!

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Sure. Whatever. Try having
no idea inside. Go on.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
What? Are you kidding me?

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
This had better be a joke!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
'Cause if you're for real,
I smell some serious--

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
We're interrupting.
I'm so sorry!

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
They doin' some kind of bit?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Great timing.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
So, uh, heard anything
strange lately?

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
that's s'posed to mean.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
Eh. Nothing big, it's just some
rumors coming down the XB pike.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.538 position:50% align:center
Forget I asked. They
never pan out anyway.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, I hope you
two aren't here to tell me

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
you couldn't get your head
around the homework.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
--When did we get homework?
--Right.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Here ya go.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Nice.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Good.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
Looks like you've got
a handle on the rules.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, Haru.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
Rules are for gobshites.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
You hit, you run, and
you crack some skulls.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
Let the other guy write it down.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Not that I don't appreciate

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
your enthusiasm
for random violence,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
but Extreme Baseball
isn't a street brawl.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
Right! Ow! I get it!
Point taken!

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
First things first, you hit
a ball thrown by a pitcher.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
Cool? Do you need
me to slow down?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
N-No.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
All right, then.
Now let's talk defense.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
The only way to get someone
out is by tagging them.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
That means you have to touch
the runner with the ball.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
If you like force-outs
or fly-outs, too bad.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
They aren't a thing in XB.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
What we have instead

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
is straight-up
runner-fielder combat.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
While holding the ball.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
Combat being the
game's main appeal.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
With me so far? Great.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
Here's where it
gets interesting.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
If the runner dodges you,

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
or counters with their
own brand of "piss off,"

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
you're popped and they're
clear to claim base.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
It's only an out if
the ball makes contact.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
I repeat, the ball
has to make contact.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.115 position:50% align:center
Next up we have the gear.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
Your bat. Your glove. The ball.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
Spiked shoes
if you're into that.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
Basically, unless the umpire
says otherwise, it's legal.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
Make sense?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
Let's talk plates.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
Home base is located
at Azabu Intersection.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
So, first would be where?

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, I, um...

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
--[TAIGA screaming]
--[SAORI yells]

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Take a stab at it, Haru.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
That would be Shiba Temple!

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Second and third?

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
That's Minato Tower and Roppongi
Super Hills, respectively!

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
Excellent!

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
For all intents and purposes,

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
the whole city's
our playing field.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
I know someone who needs
to review XB's homepage

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
so he can internalize the
relevant information!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Ahem! That is,
if he expects to play.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
Fine. But seriously, come on.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Where's the craic in
tying this whole thing down

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
to a couple of stupid rules?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
I sympathize with
ya point, friend.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
But reducing the game down
to a total free-for-all

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be much fun either.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50% align:center
'Fore they had the
smarts to follow XB law,

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
rival gangs just beat
the crap of each other

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
without rhyme or reason.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
The whole country was
like a demilitarized zone.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
This Tribe prides itself
on playing by the rules.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
That's what separates us
from common hooligans.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Don't like it,
go somewhere else.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Hell no!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
I'm stayin' right here
so I can beat Shun!

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
Extreme Baseball's
gonna be my slut!

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Um, there's a lot to
unpack in that statement.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
Not sure you get how this works.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
I said what I said and meant
every single solitary syllable!

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
Everybody quit splittin' hairs!

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
That's right, Shun!

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
Enjoy this while it lasts,
'cause I'm your downfall!

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh. Is it
time to eat yet?

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
You were asleep?! You and your
stupid coffee hangovers.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
What can you do?

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Wake up, ya bodach!

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Fire in the hole!

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
Ugh. If you ever wonder why
Minato is the way it is,

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
blame the fact that
he's the one leading us.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
[HARU] If you lose a game
of XB, what happens?

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
The winner can tell
you to do anything.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
Uh. That could end badly!

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
So don't lose.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
I'll have to keep that in mind.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
Good, 'cause it's
survival of the fittest.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
Hey, I was teasing about Shun.
He's actually awesome.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Don't rely on me too much.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
You guys would be up a creek
if I got abducted by aliens.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA chuckles]

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
Don't get all twisted by the
doubletalk. I'd still be here.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
Right. Just don't rely on
him as a study partner.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
You're getting catty.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
[NEKOMARU meows]

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
Whaddya say we ditch
the rule review?

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
Far as I'm concerned,

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
the best way to learn Extreme
Baseball is by playing.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
I don't know about
the rest of you,

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
but to me that sounded
like a challenge!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Hm?

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever floats
your tuna boat.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
For now, we'll
keep things simple

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
and call it a run if
you make it to first.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
Easy enough, right?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
And while we're at it,
instead of using Shiba Temple,

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
let's go ahead and say first
is that pole over there.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
Other than that, all the
normal XB rules still apply.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! How are we
doin' the teams?

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Two of you bat first.
I'll go afterwards.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Huh?

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
It's a me versus everyone deal.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Are you outta your mind?

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Nah, trust us, it's fair.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Been a little while, though.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
So, like,

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
you're essentially a
team all by yourself?

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
Yup. Well, I'll have Saori
be my catcher, of course.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Like I wouldn't
have your back.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but what happens if we
manage to get a hit though?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
I'll run after it.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
You know what,
as a matter of fact,

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
let's go ahead and call it a
run if you just graze the ball.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
Shove your pity where
the sun don't shine!

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
Come hell or high water,

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
I'm planting my foot
on first base!

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
So what's our lineup?

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:02.000 position:50% align:center
Heh. Isn't it obvious?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
I'm leading off.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] This one'll be
right down the middle!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why is he broadcasting
the pitch like that?

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
It's called a handicap.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, this wouldn't
be much of a contest.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wait. He seems so chill.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
Maybe it won't be that fast?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
What? How'd he do that?
His form was so slack!

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
Guess he wasn't really
broadcasting it after all.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
He's keeping it around 30%

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
so you have decent chance
of hitting something.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
Ah. You're coddin'
me, right? 30%?

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Yup. He's holding back.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I hate it.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
I'll be throwing the next one

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
exactly like I did
the first, okay?

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
--Huh? Crap. Okay!
--Ready when you are!

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna say this with love:

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Timing's the least
of your worries.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
Hold on, that wasn't even fair!

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
He's hypnotizing me!
Is Shun a wizard?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
Compared to you maybe.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Uh! It didn't look that fast!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
Right! Gird your loins!

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho. I've got just the swing.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
Heave-ho!

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
Neat. And that's a strikeout.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yells]

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50% align:center
This game wasn't real...

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
Oh, grow up. Stop
being a sore loser.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Out here acting like somebody
pulled one over on you.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
We call that strategy.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
You floundered.
Get over it and move on.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Did you just call me "Flounder"?

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
Haru, c'mon. You're up.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
You're batting second,
right? Get to it.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
Haru, make them pay
for what they did to me!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wh-What?

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
Avenge your brother-in-arms!

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
This one's coming
right down the middle!

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
Right! Yes!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
He throws like a monster.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
But I know the pitch, so if I
time things just right, maybe--!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
No! Wake up!

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Man, you gotta
keep your eyes open!

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
Do you need me to
chisel it in stone?

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
Look, mate! Like this.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Got it!

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
Here comes another!

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Eyes on the ball. Just look!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
Argh, you almost had it!
More of the same! You got this!

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Kid has the
timing down at least.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
[HARU] What happens
if I actually hit it?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
Haul ass!

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh!

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Curb stomp the bastard!

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
I believe in you!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
Guess that makes one of us.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wait, do what?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
Huh... What if I could?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Whoa, hey.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Um. Thank you, I guess.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
In a real game, that
would've been a tag out.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
But since you grazed it,

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
by tonight's rules,
you're the winner.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
Whoa. I can't believe he
actually took a swing at him.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
That kid's got the
heart of a lion.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
They say ignorance is bliss.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
Maybe file this one away,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
but Shun used to be
called "The Destroyer."

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
The Destroyer? Like of what?

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
You need me to
spell it out for ya?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Dude. People--!

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
Quit being a jerk.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
What? Where's the lie?

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
Intense.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
He's calmed down a lot
since the old days.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you,

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
the way Tribes used to
hash it out was the worst.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
Shinjuku and Toshima
were forces to reckon with.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
They'd still give you
a run for your money.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
Don't get me started
on Bunkyo Tribe.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
--Really?
--[HARU] Huh?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
Defeating me changes nothing.
I'm only one man.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
The Bunkyo Tribe
still stands strong!

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
Toru Akamon does not yield.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Pride comes before the fall.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
So much for your reputation.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Heads up, he'll
demolish the first pitch,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
so stand back.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
How far back we talkin' exactly?

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
Loser's gotta do a
little dance routine!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
--[HARU] What?
--[TAIGA] You're on!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
Let's see you take
a bite outta this!

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
Savage! That's a homerun, yeah?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Homeruns don't exist
in XB, idiot! Grab it!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Haru, you go,
then pass it to me!

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
Time's not on our side.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
You do this now?!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
Please just tell me
you're not about to die.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Bathroom break.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
Ah! Found it!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
Okay. This is the chop,
and this is the knife-hand!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Nope. Other way around.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Um, I threw it
back to first base!

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Should be there any moment now!

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
He needs to work on his aim.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
Welp. I got it!

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yelling]

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, hello.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
Face me! Don't run away!

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
At least he's got the concept
of tagging the runner now.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
All things considered,
that's progress.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
You're goin' down!

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yelping]

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Huh? What? Where'd he go?

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Getting warmer.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
How the--? You are a wizard!

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
That's one run. You owe us
a dance. Make it sexy.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait! Hold on!

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Hm?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
How many dance routines
am I wracking up?

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
You sayin' I have to perform
one for every inning we lose?

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
Start thinkin' of stuff,

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
'cause at this rate,
you'll be on all night.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
It'll be so much fun!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
"On" as in "on stage"?

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
Hey! You never
clarified the details!

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
Meh. Thought they
were self-evident.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
he dodged your roundhouse

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
before jumping up
on the traffic light.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ugh! Yeah, well, bully for him!

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
This ain't over yet!

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yelling]

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Whoa!

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
That's 17 runs total.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.478 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Son of a whore!

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Language.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
Out of curiosity, why don't
you conserve your energy

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
and just wait for
him by first base?

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
Holy shite!
You tell me this now?

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Knew he was dumb,
but this is ridiculous.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Fine. Now I'll beat Shun Kamiya.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm not the type of guy
who relies on a team carry.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
XB is supposed to
be mano y mano.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
Not all the time.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
I'll get you on the next one!

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
Enough practice for now.
Let's call it a night.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
[HARU chuckles]

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
What's the verdict?

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
You good? Got all
the rules down now?

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.732 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh, mostly. I think.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
Sweet! Figured you would.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Manami, I'm starving.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
I'll whip somethin' up, then.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
Haru! Taiga! Whaddya say
we stuff our faces?

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
It'll be dope! Welcome party!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Tonight's menu:

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
The Minato Tribe's famous
coffee jelly sandwiches,

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
some creamy meat rolls,

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
a plate of ground
chuck baseballs,

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
and of course,
French fried potato bats.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
Bon appetit!

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
Whoa-ho! Don't mind if I do!

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Excuse me!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
What? Are there more rules?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
We give thanks before
helping ourselves.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are we,
a bunch'a kids?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
No. We're a civilized tribe.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
O-Okay! Okay! Chill out.

00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the meal.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Thank you for the meal.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
You okay, Shun?

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
I thought you said
you were starving.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
I was. But actually, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
That's typical.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Can't focus on anything
for more than ten minutes.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
Hey, if he wants to sleep on
this grub, that's his loss.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
Manami, my friend,
you are an artist!

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU] Do me a solid, Haru,
take this to Mr. Sandman.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Sure. Yeah.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
Here y'go. Nice n' hot.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Hm?

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Thanks, just what I needed.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
That catch your eye?

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
Uh. A little, maybe.

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
Why don'cha try it out?

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Are you sure?

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Wouldn't offer if I wasn't.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
Wow. I can't believe
how heavy it is.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[HARU yelling]

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Look out!

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelling]

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Don't come over
here with that thing!

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
Nice job, Manami!

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
Much obliged.

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
What was that about, Shun?

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you never let anyone
hold your beam bat.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
Why the change of heart?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Just a whim, I guess.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
Yo. What do we say?

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
Sorry! That was my fault!

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Heh. Not what I meant.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
My bat. Yeah, what
did it feel like?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, um... It was...

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] That was awesome!
I want a crack at it!

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
Uh, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] That's clear favoritism
and it's not cool!

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
I'm not big on you
destroying my stuff.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
Says the tool they
call the Destroyer!

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
I prob'ly ought to pass
that title on to you.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Don't you dare!

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
I'm perfectly capable of
earning my own nickname,

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
thank you very much!

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh, no, what's happening?

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Nothing.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
Just can't believe I
found a place like this.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
It's all so...

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
It's just so much fun, you know?
And you're so nice to me.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
I really love it here!

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Sorry. Weird thing to
cry about. What's my problem?

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[SHUN chuckles]

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
Is it just me, or was
that a confession?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Sounded like one.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
A confession of what?

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
Sorry, man, tough break.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
I like you as a friend,
but that's as far as it goes.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Oof, that sucks.
You'll get 'em next time.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
Do what?

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to them.

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
That's just their way of saying
we're happy to have you.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
Stay here as long as you like.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
Glad you've taken a shine
to our little family.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
Welcome to it.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
What about me?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Jury's still out on that one.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[SAORI, MANAMI,
SANTAROU chuckle]

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
He walked right into it.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Harsh.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] On to the next.
I need a proper challenge.

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
[HANNYA A]
Sir.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ugh... I ate too much.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've had beef.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, tuna.
You're still my first love.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
Will you stop it?

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
Good idea! The next party can
have a seafood theme then!

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll inspire him
to put on a better show.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You suggesting
my dances weren't--? Ugh...

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
I'm in if Taiga can still fish.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Hey! Nobody catches 'em better!

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
This time tomorrow, you'll be
knee deep in tuna tartare!

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
Just let me digest.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
Sweet. Sounds like a solid plan.

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
You gotta love his attitude.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
Listen, Shun. 'Member the
whole "Destroyer" persona?

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
Ha. Yeah. More or less,
I suppose.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] You used to always
school the newbies.

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
I did. What can I say,
I like makin' the game fun.

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
How'm I doin'?

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm having a blast!

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
Ask me what I think!

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Why?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] He's not worried
about your opinion.

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:02.238 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Why you gotta be mean?

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
You know what I would love?
If things could stay like this.

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
Playing XB with friends,

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.746 position:50% align:center
doing what we love
without a care in the world.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.791 position:50% align:center
Just good times and camaraderie.

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:14.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:17.212 position:50% align:center
You say that like things
aren't gonna stay this way.

00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:18.963 position:50% align:center
Is there something
happening at some point

00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
that'll make things change?

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.633 position:50% align:center
Remember what I said earlier

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
about some ugly rumors
making the rounds lately?

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
Well, word is, someone's using
XB to do something bad.

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:30.642 position:50% align:center
Like, real bad.

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:33.061 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
How does that work?

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.146 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
What's wrong, Nekomaru?

00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:37.941 position:50% align:center
Terrible news!

00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
The Bunkyo Tribe...

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:40.110 position:50% align:center
...and Shinjuku...

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
...and Toshima were
all decimated!

[ALL gasp]

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:47.409 position:50% align:center

you talking about?

[MANAMI]
Here's the latest info on them.

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:54.374 position:50% align:center
Just updated tonight.

00:22:54.457 --> 00:22:56.209 position:50% align:center
How is this even possible?

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:58.753 position:50% align:center
Three powerful tribes
wiped out just like that?

00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.213 position:50% align:center
Who's responsible?

[helicopter blades whirring]
