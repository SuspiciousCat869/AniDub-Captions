[HANNYA A] Lord Tenshin,
the border is compromised.

[TENSHIN]
I am fully aware.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
These Adachi cretins are
rather full of themselves,

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
it would seem.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
Ojiro!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Sir.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
Make an example of our
presumptuous visitors.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
Woe betide those who would
besmirch our domain!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center

the power of the Otori!

My compliments to your spine.

[HARU]
Oh, no. It's already started.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
We can't let them go
through with this, guys.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
The Adachi Tribe's

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and what makes you think
they'll take our word for it?

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center

[KAZUKI]
They're morons.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
Well, there's no
arguing about that.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
But what's with the
fashion accessory?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] You like it?
I'm setting a trend.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Pretty soon they'll
be all the rage.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Cool... I guess.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
It's a shame they
don't block sound.

[KAZUKI]
I'm Minato's secret weapon.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center

[HYAKUTARO]
Duh.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
You think the Sox gave up

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
when they were down
three to nothin'?

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Look, all I'm tryin'
to say is you can't--

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
Don't give a damn.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] We're doin' this
to avenge Shun for you guys.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
You don't understand
what you're doing!

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
This team is on a whole
different level than you.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
We got the stronger lineup.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
Besides, I don't remember
canvassing for an opinion.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Fine. Sorry for worrying
about your dumb ass.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Shaddup, Pigtails.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Okay, okay. That'll do. Relax.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
You've said your piece.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Best thing now is to
keep our distance.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
Nothing we can do, Haru.

What the--?

There better be a reason

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
that was nothing like
the one he threw me.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
Oh, there is. It's called
energy conservation.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center

Oh, boy. Throwin' in

Slaughter them all, Ojiro!

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
Wipe their Tribe

Of course.

Well, you have to admire
how he's keepin' up.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you do. He's pretty good.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] Not that it
makes much difference

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
if the balls keep going out.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
Aw. You gettin' tired?

But I'm this close to my limit.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
If there was just some way
to slow down his pitches.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
How 'bout this?

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
I'll be the bat!

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center

Take your shot, then.
You got nothin'.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] I fail to comprehend
the point of this.

Why not accept your

Yes! This is my absolute
favorite part about training!

Maybe, um... I should
grab you a bib, buddy?

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't do any good.

Uh, 'cuse me.

If you could eat like a

That was grand!
Just what I needed! Hoo!

gone off the deep end?

Do you need a hand?

[TAIGA] How long you
been standin' there?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
I'll toss it to you
if you want.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Yeah, go for it.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
You ready?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Sure.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry. Totally my fault.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
Never mind.
I'll do somethin' else.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
You've been acting
kinda strange.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Ever since the game
up in Chiyoda City,

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
it's like all you ever
do anymore is practice.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
Look, mate, it's simple.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
The Adachi Tribe was
totally wiped out.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
And they totally trounced
me at our match.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
So until I can
majorly up my game,

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
there's no point in me
even tryin' to help out.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
I'm just dead weight.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't talk like that!

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
You've got tons of
good qualities, Taiga!

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
Give an example.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
You have a cool foreign accent!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure. That helps.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
[HARU] You're great at
getting us all hyped!

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
Uh. And you're super strong!

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Too bad I can't
hit the ball though.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
[HARU] It's not that hard.
You just need to concentrate.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Come on! If I can learn to
swing a bat, then so can you!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
I could teach you!

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You showin' off isn't
gonna make me a better player.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
So good now you can coach me?

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
That's not what I meant.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
Then what do you mean?

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
I just thought--

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
Quit wastin' my time and
get the hell out of here.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Damn it!

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] You seem to have
a lot on your mind.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Oh, great.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
If you're here to lecture me
like Haru, then scram.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
Bit sensitive to input, are we?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, but this
isn't a lecture, per se.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
Just a rundown of cold
hard facts for ya.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] You're an
absolutely worthless batter.

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
I'd go far as to say that's
really your only defining trait.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
What makes you think
I don't know that?

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
Nothing. But your only hope
is to get a lot stronger.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure, shattering
revelation, that.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] I only care because
it presents a problem for me.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
Ah, but I just happen
to know an XB player

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
who is second to none.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
Care to learn from them?

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna debase myself

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
in front of someone who
thinks they're all that.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
Unless whoever you're on
about is as good as Shun,

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
this conversation is ov--

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] I'm speaking of the one
person Shun couldn't beat.

I gotta say, for a hideout,
this place is pretty damn fancy.

But pull yourself
together, Taiga.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE]
Please. He wasn't that awful.

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
Whoop!

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] Damn it!
No trick shots, I told ya!

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
Try paying attention next time.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Excuse me!

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Hm?

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
I've dressed myself in the
traditional garb of your Tribe!

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA screams]

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
Ah! Don't think for a minute
this means I won't be back!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
Bone apple teeth!

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
You filleted my koi!

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Here! Kept 'em
nice n' toasty for ya!

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Blue's really your color.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
You busy right now?

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Get out of my damn house!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
Tch. He just won't let up.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
Well, if nothing else, you
have to admire the persistence.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
I don't have to do squat!

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
I don't have the time or the
energy to waste on lost causes.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hi! What'll it
be today, Sensei?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
Piss off! And while you're
at it, stop calling me that!

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
Come now. Just accept your role.

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Whose side are you on?!

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
What do I have to do to get
you to change your mind?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Fine. I'll give you
one chance and that's it.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Yes, but the deal is,
if you lose,

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
I never wanna see
your ugly mug again.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Right! You're on!

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
Kick his butt, Hana!

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And hurry, I'm starved!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Me, too. Finish him fast!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
Right. You get one out.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
If you manage to hit my pitch,
I'll take you under my wing.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
If you can't do it,
then that's all she wrote.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Bring it on!

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
I'm likin' the confidence.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:18.616 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE]
Strike!

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
Wha--? How'd he do that?
I didn't even see it.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Gimme a break.

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
You can't throw faster
than the naked eye!

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
He's doin' some
kinda tricky tricks!

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
You got two more. Good luck.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Okay, think!

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be a workaround
for pitches like this.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
Watch the ball like a hawk!

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Idiot.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
He's fallin' for oldest
trick in the book.

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
I pretend to throw,
Yaji pretends to catch.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
Wash, rinse, repeat.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I've met dogs
that're too smart for this one.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Focus. Eyes on
the prize. Don't blink!

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
And swing!

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Two down, one to go!

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Are you a sorcerer?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE] This fellow's
starting to grow on me.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
Such a con artist.
He's not throwing anything.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
--[ESCORT A] Shh!
--[ESCORT C] C'mon!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Strike him out so we
can fool around!

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
I'd say my instincts
were spot on.

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
The only real talent
you have for this game

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
is being its comic relief.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
Says the man currently
pulling a prank.

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
How the hell am I
s'posed to get a hit?

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE] Don't give yourself
an aneurysm over it.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
Logic's quite useful,
as far as it goes.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
But it isn't the only solution.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
In other words, don't think.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's this?

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
He's right.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
I don't have Haru's eyes,
or his feel for a bat.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
There's no thinking
my way through this.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Only thing for it is to go in
blind and swing like hell!

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
What're you doing now?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
Prayin' your overseas
ancestors will help?

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
Fare thee well, copper top.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Clear your mind.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Even the greats can't
catch fish in haste.

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
Just let it... happen!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Okay, then.
Didn't see that comin'.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
[ESCORTS scream]

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
[laughs] But I could get
used to this view!

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
I can see the ball rolling!
Yeah! That was a hit!

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
You have to teach me!

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, actually, I--

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
Good or bad, a hit is a hit,

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
which means you are now
officially my sensei!

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
I am? Oh, I said that?

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
Don't try to play dumb with me!
We had an agreement! Say it!

00:21:58.276 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
Son of a...

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
Technically you did lose.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
True fact!

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA groans]

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] Whatever.
I'm a man of my word, I guess.

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! You won't
regret this!

00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50% align:center
Sure I will.
Take it down a notch.

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Whaddya wanna
to train me on today?

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
[ALL chattering]

00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:21.383 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
All of you pipe the hell down!
