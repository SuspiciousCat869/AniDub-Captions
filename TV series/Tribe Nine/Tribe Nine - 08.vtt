[FUCHO]
Aw. Sorry. Does this hurt?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
Well, too damn bad!

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
This is exactly what you
asked for, you little bastard!

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
[ROKU]
He's more useful alive, Fucho.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Does that mean I have to stop?

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
Kazuki Aoyama is
the one we're after.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
Kiyoshiro doing this
stupid crap again?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm sorry.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
I promise not to try and
murder you again, Fucho.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
You mean it?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
'S all good then.
Water under the bridge.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.959 position:50% align:center
Let's head out.
Kai, you're driving.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! It's about time!

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Want this?

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Don't wrap us around a pole.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
[KAI laughs]

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.342 position:50% align:center
[KAI]
Whatever! I got this!

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
Damn you. I'm gonna enjoy
slaughtering you one day.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
[KAI laughs]

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! I love this song!

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
[ROKU]
Turn the volume down.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.484 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI] Eff this noise! Play
something I can lip sync to!

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Wakey-wakey, Minato City.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Chaos has arrived.

[HARU grunting]

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
Forgive my saying so, but it
feels like you're holding back.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
Come on now, Haru.
Swing with more confidence.

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
I can do that, sure.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
Okay. It's all me.
Best batter ever. Bar none.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
Nothing can stop me!

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.939 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the
right idea, but no.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
Try this. It's
brain-boosting bread.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
No thanks. I'm not really
into "health" food.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
It's tastier than it looks.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[HARU] So, like, how do you know
so much about beam bats?

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
Classified.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
C'mon! I promise
not to tell anybody!

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
Nope, sorry. I prefer
to stay mysterious.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
What have we here?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
Wait, aren't you guys...?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
I suggest running.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right!

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
After them!

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI]
Hold up!

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
[ROKU]
Huh?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
A moment of your time.
I've come here to warn you.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
Well, much as I appreciate
the thought, I don't know you.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
I brokered a deal
with the Ota Tribe.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
They've been contracted
to dispose of you.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
The Ota Tribe?

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
You mean those grubby waifs

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
who have to forage through
the trash for sustenance?

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Only a fool judges
people by their reputation.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
Ha. Next you'll tell me
the explosion at Setagaya

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
was their doing, yes?

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
[YUI chuckles]

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
I'm prepared to call them off.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
But you must first agree to
stay out of Lord Ojiro's sight.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
This is your first
and final warning.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
This way! Over here!

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
Question for you.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
When specters from
one's past appear,

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
one should exorcise them, no?

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but what are
we talkin' about?

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Hm?

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
Oh. Nothing. Forget I asked.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
You say you're mysterious,

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
but it feels more like you're
just cryptic for the sake of it.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Mh-hm.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
Ah! There you are!

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] What, am I
laying it on too thick?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Take cover!

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
That was close.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
Die, losers!

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
Where're they all coming from?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Haru! In here!

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
Hey, man. Are you okay?

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
Yasuhiro. Wha--?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
What a stroke of luck.
Thank you, whoever you are.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Save all that for later!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
Right now, we gotta get
the hell outta here!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
[YASUHIRO]
Did you hear what I just said?

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
That's unfortunate.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
Still, felt good to let
loose a little mayhem.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
[KAI yelling]

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
I'm so pissed! Damn! They
were two feet in front of me!

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
He's shacked up with Minato,

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
so he'll scurry back to their
hidey-hole eventually.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Here ya go!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
What's your angle in all this?

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
Can I not just wanna
help a friend?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Shouldn't have
put it like that.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
If it hadn't been for you,
we really woulda been in a jam.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
It's all right. I'd be
suspicious in your shoes, too.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
Look, I just...
It was dick move for me

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
to throw you to the
wolves the way I did.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yasuhiro.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
Seems a little weird that
Ota would just attack.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.879 position:50% align:center
No kidding, right?

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
I mean, when we saw 'em
at the batting contest,

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
they just looked like a
bunch of hard-luck cases.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
What did you do to get
those bums riled enough

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
to try and send you packing?

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Honestly, your guess
is as good as mine.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
I'm the target.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
They're not quite as
downtrodden as they seem.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
That street urchin façade
hides a ruthless nature.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
Evidently Mr. Todoroki found
himself on their bad side.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
And as luck would have it,

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
they've turned their sordid
sights onto me now.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
But what do they
have against you?

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
I'd really rather you
not ask, thank you.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
Fine then. You can
play coy for now,

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
but when the time's right,
I expect to be given

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
all the gory details.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.424 position:50% align:center
'Kay, we've established
it's none of our business,

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
but you might wanna consider
apologizing to them.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
Santaro!

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
Always in the face. Ah!
Ain't this a bomb? What do I do?

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
Swing for the fences, Saori!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Go on! Toss it!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
Whatever their beef,

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
we're settling this with XB
like civilized human beings!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center

[FUCHO]
Uh-oh.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
Someone's gutsy in there.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
Anyone wanna explain
what's happening?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
The diner's under siege!

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
This puppy's heavy.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center

it backwards, genius!

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
[OTA TRIBE scream]

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Whoops, my bad.
That one's on me.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
[KAI laughs]

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
That's hysterical!
They're all pancakes!

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
Clearly you guys've got
a problem with Kazuki.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
But we're XB players,
so if you wanna resolve this,

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
let's solve it on the field.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
Yeah! We're only cool
with in-game violence!

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
[KAI laughs]

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
You think killing you has rules?
You sweet summer children!

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
Inter-tribal conflict
is strictly forbidden!

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
Cease fighting and
disperse immediately,

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
or consent to playing
a regulation game.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO groans]

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
So do we explode the
robots, too, or what?

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Sorry, officers,
we were just screwin' around.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
Nothin' serious.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
But yes, I totally agree
that a quick game

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
is the best way to wrap this up.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
Mh-hm.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Looks like the head guy's more
reasonable than you'd think.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
I doubt it.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Let's get this party started.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
I wanna play so bad I
can practically taste it.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
Heh. That makes two of us!

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] If we win, you gotta
hand over Kazuki Aoyama

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
without makin' a fuss.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, I guess.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
And if we win,
and believe me we will,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
you have to fix the
damage to our diner.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
All right, all right.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Hang on a second.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah. You guys don't
have enough people.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Oh. They're on the way.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
--[ALL] Huh?
--[engine whirring]

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
Up there!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Uh! I feel like we
should take cover.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Oh, dear.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[KAI]
Whoa!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
Wha--? The heck
is going on here?

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Yo. Anybody alive in there?

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Ugh...

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
Hey, "team," get over
here and dig out

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
whoever's intact enough
to play so we can start.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50% align:center
--[ENOKI] Aye-aye, sir!
--[KAI] You got it!

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
What the hell is wrong with him?

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Oh, quick question.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
This whole XB thing...
how does it work?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
Wait, Yasuhiro's
going to play, too?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Your buddy wouldn't
take no for an answer.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
If we hadn't caved,

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
he'd've probably run out on the
field and got beaned by a pitch.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
You won't regret this.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Look, I might not seem it,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
but I'm actually halfway
decent at this game.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
Oh, you are, huh?

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
Well, Minato has a few of
its own special rules.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
First, rookies have
to carry all my stuff.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
That's not remotely true.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
Right. Look sharp.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
Push comes to shove,

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
we have no idea what
these guys'll try to do.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
Stay on your toes. Understood?

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out, Haru.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Of course! I'm all right.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Remember, we don't win
or lose based on strength

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
but on attitude!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
Keep your head in the game!

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah!

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
Under no circumstances are
they taking one of our own!

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
Minato Tribe!

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Bombers!

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
Show me that spirit!

00:11:57.008 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
XB! It's the perfect
game made just for we!

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
There. Fucho, come on, man.
What? You on break?

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO yawns]

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
I'm sleepy.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
We haven't even started playing
the game yet! Get up!

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
I don't wanna.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
--Oh, bull--
--[ROKU] He'll join us

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
when he wants to.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
We'll be fine!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
Get the stick outta your ass
and come play with us, Kiyo!

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO snores]

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Whacha doin' there, champ?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nothing.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Aww. Tryin' to kill me again?

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
I said I wouldn't!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
That's a shame.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
There are fewer
things I enjoy more

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
than giving you
a good thrashing for it.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
Shithead.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna hit the ball.
It's gonna go far!

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're pretty cute,
but I never stick it in crazy.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
So don't get comfy,
you're outta here!

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
What the--? That was
my super fastball!

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
If that was fast, I don't
wanna see your quickies.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Right! It's landing near first!
All right, Haru? Snag it!

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
Quick! Tag her out!

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Right!

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
--[stomach growls]
--[groans]

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
I really should've
eaten beforehand. Huh?

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Where'd she go?

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI]
Hm? What? I'm busy.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
I just tagged you out?

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI]
Huh...?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
God, he's speedy.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
[KAI yells]

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Somebody help me! I can't swim!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
Heh. Think I'm intimidated by a
hulking wall of meat with eyes?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Um, what?

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Safe!

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
[ROKU]
Hm.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
What's the deal?

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Do they not even know
how the game is played?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT] Physical contact
without possession!

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
What's in this thing?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Safe!

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] That's the way!
Keep bringing 'em in!

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Hm?

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Ooh. That's not good.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
Not to rag on the
amateurs or anything,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
but this is pretty ridiculous.

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Yeah, kinda.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
Don't get cocky before
the curtain closes.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
It's not over till it's over.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Ain't that the truth.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Hey. How's it goin',
Kazuki Aoyama?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but you gotta die now.

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
Ah, indeed.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Of course, that requires you
managing to slit my throat.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
Can you really get the
job done before I can?

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Severe rule violation!

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
Return to the bench immediately!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Yes, sir. Just jokin' around.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Yo, Enoki. Get it ready.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI]
M'kay!

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Real talk, though,
just let me kill you.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
Dragging your friends
into it can't end well.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
How presumptive.
Friends is a very loaded word.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
I think of them
more as my pawns.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Heh. You're a real dick.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
And you're one to talk.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
It's not about me, is it?

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
According to Yui,

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
you're stealing all of little
Prince Ojiro's focus.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
The man's obsessed.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
Heh. Personally, I think the
whole thing's a waste of time.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
You're not worth the trouble.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
A valid opinion.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
Though I can be a great deal
more trouble than I'm worth.

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
But nothing that involves money

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
is a waste of time
to you, is it?

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Money? I don't
give a damn about money.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
I'm a man of principle. I'm here
for the beautiful chaos.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO chuckles]

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
Here comes the good stuff!

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Okay, then,
let's give XB a whirl.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
What is that exactly?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Huh? Oh, this? My bat.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
The umpire doesn't care?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
Man, I'd tell you to
loosen up, but damn! Heh.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Dude's a whackjob!

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
Nice! Huh?

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Touchdown!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Fore!

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
Um, actually... Uh?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Slapshot.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] None of those
are baseball terms!

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
Little help here, ump!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
How is he allowed to do that?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] The umpires aren't
doling out penalties.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
