00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50% align:center
I humbly beseech
Your Grace to wait.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
It is unnecessary for you
to make an appearance;

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
your time is far too valuable.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.446 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Meaning what?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
A precaution, my liege.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
We must first determine whether
Minato is worthy to compete.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
Indeed, such skill as
yours mustn't be wasted.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
Once done, you, sire,
are then at leisure

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
to make the grandest of
entrances and finish the job.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
What are you planning?

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Nothing less
than a demonstration

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
of your full power.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
I sincerely hope that
wasn't an expression of fear.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, please! If anyone
here's proven himself

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
to have the bravery of
a honey badger, it's me!

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
Dunno about that,
but he's got a point.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for us to be scared.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
No time to be scared anyway.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's bring our A-game!

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.472 position:50% align:center
I don't see Ojiro.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
He will not be your
first opponent.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
That honor belongs to us.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
His lordship is an
extremely busy man.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Thus, you're required to
first vanquish this team

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
before he deigns to play.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
The conceit is astounding.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
[YUI chuckles]

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
Are you not grateful?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
These athletes are
the crème de la crème,

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
handpicked by Ojiro himself.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
They sure don't bear
much of a resemblance

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
to the other players
we've seen from Chiyoda.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, we're not gonna
let ourselves be intimidated

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
by a bunch of showoffs, are we?

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
[whoosh]

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Totally random, but I just
remembered I need to go

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
set my DVR to record tonight's
episode of <i>Puffy Pudding</i> .

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
I'll only be a minute. Yeah.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Nice try, but we all know

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
that show's streaming online.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
Show us what the Minato
Tribe is made of.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
Um, if we die, I love you guys.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Pull yourselves together!

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
You're shakin' out of your skin
and we haven't even started yet!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
Now buck up!
You got this! All of you!

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
And you know that if I'm
sayin' it, it's true.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
And besides,
you're never gonna win

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
if you won't even
step up to the plate.

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center

Who gave him the spirit stick?

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ah-ah-ah! No griping.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
Where's the spunk
I'm lookin' for?

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center

Did he just say "spunk?"

Hey, Saori.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
What's on your mind?

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
I just need you
to know I like you.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Huh?

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
--Yeah?
--[SANTARO squeals]

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
What? Huh?

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
I'm winning this one for you!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
Me? Wait! I--!

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
Wow, okay. Did you
lot know about this?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
All right, Haru!

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
I must admit,
I didn't see that coming.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Let's crush this in honor
of our boy shooting his shot!

I got it! I got it!

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
Right on! Nice one!

--First! Uh.
--[SAORI] Hold up! Third!

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center

He's rounding second already!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
Yo! Third! You've got
a runner incoming!

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
I'm ready!

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
Bring it!

How in the--?

Bastards! You're in for
a world of hurt now!

Oh, no!

[HANNYA B]
Bullseye!

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Shite. Throw the ball to me.
I'll take him down a peg.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
You did this to yourself.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
No comrade's death
shall go unavenged!

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center

Hey, get back here!

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
Muppet!

That'll bruise. Screw you!

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
This is disconcerting.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
The entire team, each of
them has skill sufficient

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
to be an ace.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Change!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Bollocks! Minato's
only gettin' warmed up!

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
You've just opened up
a whole can of hurt!

Millie up, Haru!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Focus. We can't afford to lose!

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
See? Ha!

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Weird. There was
nothing on that pitch.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Suck it!

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Come on, these guys aren't
so special after all.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
In fact, at this rate,
how could we not push ahead?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
Sweet! Let's bring
'em home! Booya!

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Is there anything more
pitiful than stupidity?

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
There are hard lessons ahead.
Take my word for it.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center

dodged that one.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center

Wait, how is that possible?

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center

Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh!

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I'm guessing
somebody hasn't heard

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
how balls-to-the-wall
I get in berserker mode!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center

[JUDGE ROBOT]
Three outs! Change!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
What the--? But we had
just started that inning!

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
You, sir, are a wanker!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
Why's he still attacking
after the third out?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
That shouldn't even be legal!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
He's just so swept up in the
moment, three wouldn't satisfy.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
My word, it's almost criminal

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
how effortless this is
when we actually try.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center

A puny band of riffraff,

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
scarcely worth the energy it
takes to say their name aloud.

Bring this to a close,
if you please.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Tribes are a thing of the past.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
At their core,
every one of them

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
is but a loose collection
of human scum,

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
devoid of purpose or direction.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
Wonderful.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] We're bringin'
somethin' unexpected

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
to this game.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
That's what XB is all about!

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] No worries.
I'll take it from here.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
So, you good with
'em subbing out

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
someone from another
tribe, sweetheart,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
or would that chap
your lily-white ass?

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
Fine, do whatever you like.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
They aren't even putting
up enough of a fight

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
for me to care.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] Now which'a you
wants me to light up their life?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
After it!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI]
Roger that!

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI]
Ha!

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
Kickass!

00:11:55.674 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI]
Aw, crap! I overshot it!

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Sorry, this game is going
too quickly for my taste.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea the price
Chiyoda's raw battle data

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
would fetch on the open market?

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
Uh, hello?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Greetings, I'm prepared to offer
a full profile on your opponent.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
Act now and the comprehensive
metric is yours for 50% off.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
[YUTAKA]
This is the ideal opportunity

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
for testing Gungnir Alpha Zwei!

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
Well-earned muscle.
Yes, quite nice.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
But I fear you're
in for a surprise!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Brains and high-tech wizardry
make an unbeatable pair.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Things are livening up, I see.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's time for me
to get a bit more serious.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
This oughta be good.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
Is that catsuit s'posed to be
for business or pleasure?

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
Don't let her psych
you out, bro!

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Go hard! Slug it like a boss!

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
If you'd be so kind,
allow me to expose you

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
for the lamentably insignificant
piece of trash you are.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
[MINAMI]
She kicked a fastball?

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
So weird it's worrying.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
Well, that's something.
She pitches better than Ojiro.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
Even if by some miracle
a player could hit it,

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
the bats aren't able to take it.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI yells]

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Three outs! Change!

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
Holy show.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
Now what's she plannin'?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
What's that stance?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
This ain't no circus!

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
No. How can she possibly
be a slugger, too?

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
What's happening?!

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
Her gear's a custom build.
Made for agility.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
In an open space, she has
the advantage. I advise--

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
[YUTAKA]
Minami!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
You're unquestionably brilliant,

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
but your analysis tends
to be a trifle slow.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
Come to papa.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
Right arm destroyed!

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
She's even faster
than predicted!

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
I recommend retreating at once!

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
[YUTAKA yells]

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yutaka!

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Huh?

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Now this is chaos.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Oh, what?
No way you dodged that!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
Come on, we gotta
duke this out proper!

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
Guess the padded
wagon's pulled up.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
[ENOKI]
Hey, nerd. Where's my Taiga?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but the whereabouts
of your boytoy are not currently

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
a top priority for us.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
Don't make me ask you a
second time, grandma-pants.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Um, hey. Why don't I go look
for him, how 'bout that?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
What could you
possibly want of me?

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
You and your kind
are beneath contempt.

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Ugh. I get it.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
Leaving Kazuki alive was
my bad. But hear me out.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
What if I obliterated the
entire Otori family instead?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Our whole society
would be thrown into chaos!

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
Fare thee well.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Perfect!

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
Get outta here!

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
[splash]

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Now you decide
to rear your head?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
What's your real goal here?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
I can't accept that you're
just Ojiro's lap dog.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] I wasn't done
playing with her yet!

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
This is BS!

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
It was Fucho's idea
to rip off Chiyoda,

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center
I didn't want anything
to do with it!

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
But just look at me now,

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
carting the goods around
like his personal errand boy!

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO yells]

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Hey, jackass! Wouldja
quit screwin' around!

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Oh-ho! Nice timing!

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Hm?

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Hm?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
Hold up! Why are
you running away?

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO, KAZUKI yell]

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO laughs]

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Didn't kill me,
but hopefully she's 'splode'd.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI, FUCHO]
Huh?

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
Was that poor fellow
a friend of yours?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO] Seriously, lady.
You immortal or somethin'?

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
I still have work to do.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
Now breathe deep and
save me the trouble.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yells]

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Safe!

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Perhaps I judged too harshly.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
There is at least one thing
about you deserving of praise:

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
Your ignorant recklessness.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
Which, incidentally,
ends tonight.

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
Calling yourselves XB players is
an insult to the mere concept.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Your impudence is shameful.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[HARU] You can't even
begin to understand!

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
We're wholly dedicated
to what we love.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
Why should there be
any shame in that?

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
It's a game. One for anybody
who wants to play.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
You can try to turn it into
a warzone, but you're wrong!

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
That so? And who said?

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
You go off on her, lad.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[HARU gasps]

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
We all know XB
is meant to be fun.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
To be fun? Do you really
believe that? Ridiculous.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
You're talking about
a game invented

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
purely to muzzle
undesirables like you.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
You speak in empty platitudes
only halfwits would stomach.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Even still--! Whoa!

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's the big idea?

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Fuego.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure the finer
nuances of this discussion

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
are yours to articulate.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Hanafuda Sakura.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Although I totally get what the
hothead's tryin' to get at here,

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
XB was 100% better the old way.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
Whaddya say you an' me
have a spicy li'l romp

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
and see if I can't win
you over to my side?

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
The man conceptualizes
everything

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
in terms of seduction.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
Uh! The whole Taito Tribe, too?

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
If he can't persuade
her, no one can.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
Very well. I'll play along.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
And then, I shall relish

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
offering your head to
Supreme Lord Ojiro.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center

Huh? Wait, crap.
I forgot my bat.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
It's all right, love! Catch!

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
Sweet! Thanks!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
Ah, I get the impression
you're a touch worried.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
An all too human response to
the situation, but just watch.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey. There she goes.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center

[TAIGA]
He hit it straight up!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
You pitch a mean one,
I'll give you that much.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
Your battle sense ain't
too shabby either.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
Word of advice, though.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
Rank is as fleeting as a
cloud on the wind, y'know?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to say?

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Eh. Nothin'. Just a
little homespun wisdom.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
Woo, nice gams girl.
I might be in love.

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. That's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
Hana!

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Sensei!

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
Come on. Give me a break.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
better than this.

00:21:55.065 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
'S not every day I compliment
a woman's legs.
