[SAORI]
That's the Otori family crest!

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
Just follow my lead.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
Salutations, all!

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
To what do we scraggly
peons owe the pleasure

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
of your most honorable presence?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Get on your knees!

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
The hell is wrong with you?
Who even are these dossers?

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
Can it! They'd gut us like a
salt cod for breathing wrong!

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
Your kindness knows no bounds!

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
Forgive the reprehensible
state of our paltry residence!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
I see that you've got a
flair for the dramatic.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
That wouldn't be
the reason behind you

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
laying waste to all those
other tribes, would it?

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
This isn't just theatre, right?

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
Ah! Shut up!

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] The weak are not
worthy of compassion.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
Hell of a slogan there.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you don't think
they deserve respect either.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Extreme Baseball as
it is now is child's play.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
Those fond of it get
no respect from me.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
Contests should be warfare.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
What this game needs is blood--

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
to revel in the agony and
carnage from days of old!

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Oh? No offense,
but you sound kinda psychotic.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Hmm...

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
[YUI] My liege, I bring
most gratifying news

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
regarding Lord Ojiro's campaign.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
The Bunkyo, Toshima, and
Shinjuku Tribes are no more.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
And?

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
Well, sir, tonight, his
lordship plans to expedite

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
the Minato Tribe's annihilation.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Are they formidable?

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50% align:center
[YUI] According to many,
they are the best.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:43.019 position:50% align:center
Ah! Yes! Their city
streets shall run red!

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.354 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
Thus is strength!

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
Our destiny rides on
a steed of scarlet!

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
None shall challenge,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.071 position:50% align:center
none defy or resist
the Otori right to rule!

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
The world shall kneel and quaver
in the shadow of our reign!

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
Is it not so?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.954 position:50% align:center
No words were ever as true.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Very good.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
Then it is our pleasure--nay,
our duty to show mankind

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
the breadth and
scope of our power!

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
And what better
means for doing so

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.591 position:50% align:center
than to rekindle the ferocity

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
Extreme Baseball
was meant to quell?

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Quite so.
A noble aim, my liege.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50% align:center
And rest assured, one that
will come to fruition.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.562 position:50% align:center
Can he emerge victorious?

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
Without a doubt, sir.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
Lord Ojiro will
fulfill the purpose

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.734 position:50% align:center
for which he was created.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center
Cool. So now what?

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] All shall bow in
subjugation to our Tribe.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
I take it that this is your way
of challenging us to a game.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
All right, then. Let's do this.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
You have absolutely no idea
what we're up against here!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
Not to mention everybody's
still kinda worn out

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
from the game we literally just
finished not that long ago.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Yeah! Totally that!

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
And besides, I have episode
138 of <i>Puffy Pudding</i>

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
waiting for me to watch it!

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
Right. I can see where'd
you be concerned.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
I'll make it quick.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
--Not what I--
--[SANTARO] Hold on!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
Chiyoda. Okay.
The government--

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Yo!

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
Try not to let those nerves
get the better of you, boyo.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Huh. Haru, Taiga.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
The game we're about to play

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
might seem a little
different from the norm.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
Cherish it, all right?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
You tellin' me I should
treat every other game

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
we'll play like it
doesn't matter?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
Heh. Good point.
I'll quit bein' a sap.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
We're about to start!

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Cherish? That was
weird even for him.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
What did he mean by that?

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
It can't be legal for them all
to be bunched up like that.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
We not gonna say
anything 'bout this?

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Looks like the umpire's
not takin' issue with it,

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
so no.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
Yikes, he dead?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
I think so, yeah.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Yup. Fatality.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
Brutal fatality.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Next.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Not cool.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
He just thrashed his own guy!

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
That probably freaked
you just out a little bit,

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
but just relax, you'll be fine.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Easy, Santaro.
Don't forget to breathe.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
All right. Get out there
and show 'em what's up!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
Sure. Yeah.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Play ball!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Come on, man!
Don't let him scare you!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
I've got this.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
Just have to keep
my eyes on the ball.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
Wow. He packs a lot more punch
than that Shinagawa suit.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Okay, I know this'll
sound arrogant,

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
but with me up next,
you can all rest easy.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yelling]

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
Okay, I know this'll
sound arrogant,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
but with me up next,
you can all rest easy.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Son of a--!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] How am I supposed
to compete with that?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Not very well.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
What're you up to, Saori?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
Pulling up his data.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
What? How's that possible?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
There's no scouting
report on this guy!

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
You're tellin' me someone as
powerful as that is a rookie?

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
Must've waited till he was
ready for his big league debut.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
No matter who he is,
don't get discouraged.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
Anything can happen, 'kay?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Right!

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
We're golden.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
Just leave the pitching to me.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you serious?

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
Hey! For your
information, Cap'n Ahab,

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
I'm what's known as a prodigy!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Simmer down, ace. I'll do it.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Not like you to
get out there so early.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
Look, I told you I'd
make this quick.

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
He's got a beam bat.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Saori, get ready.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since we've
seen Shun at a hundred percent.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] That wasn't
even close to your best.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
Quit stalling and
turn up the heat.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Okay!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
He hit it!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
Between Shiba Temple and
Minato Tower. Grab it!

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
I couldn't have hit
that pitch if I tried!

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Throw it to Minato Tower!

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Taiga!

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
Haru, eyes to the sky!

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
I'm ready!

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
[HARU yelps]

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.584 position:50% align:center
Here it comes!

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
That's how it's done.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Very well.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
Let's see what Minato's star
player is really made of.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
[SHUN laughs]

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
You gotta leave
the emotions out of it.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
What?

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Brute force can't be all
you have in the toolkit.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you gotta creep up
on people like a shadow.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Impudent fool!

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Hm?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Hm?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
And the runner is out!

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
to even notice
I'd passed the ball.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
That's embarrassing.

Haru, got a sec?

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
Great. I think I've
come up with a way

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
to take our masked friend
down a few pegs.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're insane!
That idea's never gonna work!

Or so I thought anyway.

Sorry. It's nothing personal?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd say our little ruse
worked perfectly, wouldn't you?

Good on ya!

[SAORI] Get a load of this

Let's dip our toe
in and find out.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Um. He does realize it's
customary to swing, right?

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
This whole team
gives me the creeps.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Oh, come on!
He didn't even flinch.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
Ugh. What the hell was the point
of him just standing there?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Seems bunk. No idea, man.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
They're just blowing
through the lineup.

The big guy wants
Shun all to himself.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
So like, there's
no honor for him

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center

out single handedly.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
Pretty much, yeah.

Cool with me.

You have to bear in mind,
whatever team they're on,

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
everyone here's playing
a very personal game.

in your own head.

first step to expertise.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Yes. Indeed it is.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
Don't swing,
just get a feel for him!

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Like that's worth a strike.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
A certified badass never
misses the first pitch.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
He smashed it!

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
Well, okay. Dude's less
busted looking than expected.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Careful, Shun.

Hm?

Whoa-ho-ho!

Wow. You're faster than
I gave you credit for.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
That fancy mask must've
weighed a ton.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
It's like I said, though, you
gotta leave the emotions out.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
No, I'm being serious.
Makes you too easy to read.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center

of a mystery yourself!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center

You should be
watching this, Hana!

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
Shun Kamiya just got
his ass handed to him

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
by the freak with the eyes.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What of it?

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
You say that like
they're not gonna win.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
Heh. Good point. Fair enough.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
I suck.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center

So, how you feelin'
there, buddy? Y'good?

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
I really think you oughta
take a little break.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Guys, there's a reason
they call it "extreme."

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
Leave him alone and
let him do his thing.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
Easy now. Deep breaths.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center

Uh, what's wrong with
him all of a sudden?

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should check
for a concussion.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
Welp, I guess he's fine.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Wrong!

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
When I say "Minato Tribe,"

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
you're all supposed to say
"Bombers!" together!

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
I take it back. Did you
fall on your head?

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to say "bombers"?
Oh, like a cheer!

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center

to be more like Haru.

Seems kinda late to
start cheerin' now.

Of course, a team cheer!

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
Some pumping up is
exactly what we need!

Huddle up, everyone!

He's closing in on third base!

I'll cut him off at the
anti-gravity wall on Super Hill!

Now see, this is one
of those instances

is appropriate.

Stomping all your
enemies like bugs

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
And hey, we'll always bond

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
over Manami's coffee
jelly sandwiches, right?

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
So glad he's okay.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Now, now. Don't cry, Haru.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
Taiga, do somethin'
to make him laugh.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
Why's that my job?

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
'Cause why not?

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
Come on, help our
baby boy smile for me.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
Tell that joke from the other
night about bein' a tuna.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
It was, "You can tune a piano,
but you can't tuna fish.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
Glub. Glub. This is
how fish laugh..."

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. You've got competition.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
You're thick. It was
way better than that!

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing, chattering]

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
By any reasonable standard,

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
your debut has
proven satisfactory.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
But our work has
only just begun.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
XB is an ideal tool.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
The nation as a whole
must now see our power

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
and learn to live in abject
terror of defying it.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
And so they shall.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Indeed!

00:18:56.302 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
Now, which unsuspecting tribe
will be made an example of next?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN laughing]

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
You all must be starving!

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
Voila! I give you my
Lovely Ocean Special!

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
You actually incorporated
coffee jelly sandwiches!

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
You actually incorporated
creamy meat rolls!

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
And your ground chuck baseballs!

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
And your world-famous
potato bats, too!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Outta my way!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Taiga, you're
not an island anymore.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
I am on an island--
this is Japan!

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
Ah, you're all idiots,
you know that?

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Hey, Shun.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Hm?

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
There's something I don't get.
You tagged him out at the end.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
Way to keep your
eyes open, kid.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
Not even the robot umpire was
sharp enough to catch that.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
Then we should go and
say something about it!

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Not necessary.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
See, what matters more to me
is that you upped your game.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ahh! That was bangers!

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Shun.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
Bottoms up.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.
Go ahead and set it over there.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
So, what's going on?

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
With what?

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb with us, man.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
Look, Shun, we're sincerely
worried about you.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
Yeah, stuff like tonight
happens way too much.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
You need to get it looked at.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
Guys, there's nothin'
to get worked up about.

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
Listen, the longer you put off
doing something about this,

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
the worse it'll get.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
[SHUN laughs]

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
I don't disagree.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Uh-uh. Nice try, boys.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
Get your butts in here
and help us clean up!

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
Yikes. Better go.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
Hell hath no fury,
comrades. Meanwhile...

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Wait.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Gimme a few minutes,
guys. I need some air.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but come right back.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
I know I'm not the only one

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
with a scrub pad in my hand!

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Careful with the dishes!

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] Bravo. Very funny.
That's not what they're for!

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
[NEKOMARU meows]

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Hm?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
Ah. You couldn't
let me go alone, huh?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Would've been nice
if I coulda played longer.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] But time waits
for no one, I guess.
