00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
I refuse to follow blindly

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
as you turn our victories
into underhanded deceit.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
Neo Tokyo deserves
a more fitting ruler

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
to sit upon its throne.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Lord Ojiro?

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, sire.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
I have looked forward to
this moment for so long.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
If it's not too bold of me,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
let us inform the public of
your most fortuitous rise.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
Your uniform is sullied
in his contemptible blood.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
I'll prepare a wardrobe
befitting your status

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
as our exalted new Supreme Lord.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Citizens of Neo Tokyo,
behold your new sovereign.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
I am Ojiro Otori.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
Effective immediately
I have assumed

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center
complete and total control.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.505 position:50% align:center
Upon the wings of my
ascension comes a new era.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
Welcome to Murderers' Row.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.887 position:50% align:center
Clearly Lord Tenshin didn't
just agree to abdicate.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
I think he's been assassinated.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
From this point forward,

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.688 position:50% align:center
I restore the game
to its former glory.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
No longer will it
be a pale imitation

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
of the violence it
was meant to quell.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
Injury and death are fair play.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:55.532 position:50% align:center
To this end, all weapons
may be used with impunity.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
And under no circumstances
can a game be stopped

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.620 position:50% align:center
until it has run its course.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:01.413 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.164 position:50% align:center
Is this guy serious?

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
So we can kill whoever we want
and walk away scot-free?

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
When a clear victor emerges,

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
the losing Tribe must
obey their every command.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
There will be no exceptions.
Thus ends my imperial decree.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
Well, that really oughta
raise the stakes, huh? Damn.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.725 position:50% align:center
Man, think of the power
that gives the winner!

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.185 position:50% align:center
We could just order our
enemies to off themselves!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?
Then it's my kinda game.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
There will be no constraints

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.108 position:50% align:center
with respect to these orders.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
All laws regarding human remains
or surviving third parties

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
are null and void,
effective immediately.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50% align:center
In addition,
the winners of each match

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
will be handsomely rewarded
by Supreme Lord Ojiro himself.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
[KID A] Does that mean there's
gonna be money in this now?

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.916 position:50% align:center
Uh. This is bad, right?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.335 position:50% align:center
[GIRL B]
Mhm.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
[BUNKYO GUY A] Guess we're
just gonna have to be

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
damn sure to win.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
Any game could be your last.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.761 position:50% align:center
So play as dirty
as you want, boys.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
Let's usher in this new era.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Only the strong survive.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
Let blood be the
proof of your worth.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
Carve a path to
everlasting renown

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
through the viscera
of your enemies.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
--[GUEST A] Nice!
--[GUEST B] Oh, God.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Ka-ching!

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
[GANGSTER A]
You heard me.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
Make sure he doesn't live
to see the next inning.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
[GANGSTER B]
Die!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[MAN B whimpering]

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT] Insufficient
number of players! Game over!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Your lordship.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
As a direct result
of your reforms,

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
there have been a
total of 38 games,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
57 serious injuries,
and 8 deaths.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
Little by little the old
Tribe pecking order

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
is finally being overturned.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Spare me.
Data doesn't interest me.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
All that matters is
that the strong rise.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
One more report,
if you would, sire.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it is rather prescient.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
Supreme Lord Ojiro, doubtless
you'll be pleased to know

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
the rabble are requesting
more battle arenas.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
Also, a fair number of
them are petitioning

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
for a standardized schedule,
if you will.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Is that so?

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
If that's what it takes,
give them whatever they want.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Understood.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Chiyoda will battle
the Minato Tribe next.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Inform them at once.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
Of course, my liege.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
As I'm sure you all know,
Neo Tokyo's new ruler,

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
Ojiro of all people, has turned
the game of XB upside down.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Ya ain't kiddin'.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
Everywhere you look people
are talking about it.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a 180.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
Remember when everyone used
to think it was just a way

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
for squabbling gangs
to settle their differences?

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
Look, either way this is wrong.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
We're not... We're not
a form of entertainment!

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
But you gotta admit, it's kinda
nice to be taken seriously.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
Hey, say what you will about
the freak in the mask.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center
He's a psycho, but at least
we've gone mainstream, y'know?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
People are finally startin'
to see the game as legit.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but--

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] He's turned us
into glorified murders!

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
The public tunes in
to watch a bloodbath.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
They only care about
seeing someone die.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
That's not what it
should be about.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
[helicopter blades whirring]

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
What are these guys doin' here?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
What's your problem?
You wanna piece?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
That's enough!

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
[YUI chuckles]

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Yui Kamiki.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're familiar already?

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
I happen to be Supreme Lord
Ojiro's personal secretary.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
Heartless bitch.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
You re-formed your Tribe

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
in defiance of Supreme
Lord Ojiro's orders.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Not a good first impression
on your new regime.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
Worse still, you've abetted
the undesirable Kazuki Aoyama

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
in his vendetta against
our illustrious lord.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
Such a shame.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
Now, I hereby inform you all

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
that his worship challenges
Minato to a match.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
You are not free to refuse.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
--[SANTARO] What?
--[MANAMI] Against Chiyoda?

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed, quite so.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
Now, said match will occur
in Chiyoda City at 9 P.M.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
No deferral will be accepted.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
Failure to show will be
considered an act of treason.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Hold up!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you to tell us
what we can and can't do?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
Your superior.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
Allow me to dissuade
you from the notion

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
that anything about this
matter is open to debate.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
You have one option
and one option only:

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
Total obedience.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
And thus, I do believe
we're all caught up.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
I've done due diligence.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
You've been apprised
of the situation

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
and will no doubt be
utterly destroyed.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
Good-bye.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[HANNYA A]
Move out!

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Hmph!

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
The nerve of these jerks,

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
storming in here saying we
have to play or be executed.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're kinda
the government?

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how much
things have changed.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
What're we supposed to do?

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
I say we make a little
lemonade outta these lemons

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
and arrange to take a dive

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
after putting everything
we have on Chiyoda to win.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! That was
s'posed to be a joke!

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Beside the point!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
I won't be strong-armed
into playing by their rules.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
Bastards have no right.
This is a free country.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
But is it, though?

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
This isn't just any
challenge. I mean, c'mon.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Manami! If I didn't know better,

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
I'd think you were saying
we should just roll over

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
and do what they want.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
Are you?

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
Yo, she said we're not
allowed to refuse.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
And we can't just
choose not to show up.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Refusing Ojiro is
considered treason.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
Even if it wasn't,
we'd forfeit the game

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
and still end up having to
do whatever the guy said.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
I simply won't do it.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
XB should be a contest
between two willing Tribes.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less
about all these new laws.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
Shun wouldn't have wanted this.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
Don't get any ideas.
That clear, Mr. Hero?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
Who? Me?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Who else would I mean?

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
Ugh. For your information,
I'm not interested

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
in playin' those
rank dossers either.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
What's with the faces?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
No offense, but I
thought out of everyone

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
you'd be the
hardest to convince.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.607 position:50% align:center
Oh, I wanna kick their
asses, believe me.

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
It's just, this isn't how
things should pan out.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go grab some air!

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
W-Wait a minute!

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
Taiga.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
Hey, Manami, I'm craving a big
fat bowl of ramen right now.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
Sounds like that's two of us.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
I want some ramen!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
I want ramen, too!

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
[SHIRO]
Ramen all the way!

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
Make that ramen times six!

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Great. That's that.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
[NEKOMARU meows]

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?
Are you hungry?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
Let's get you fed.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
What's the matter?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
It's right in front
of you. Go on.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
You were acting like
you were starving.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
That's not Nekomaru's brand.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Is there anything
you don't know?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
Quite a bit, actually.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
For example, I have no clue
what you intend to do.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
I say with respect.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
I don't either.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
All I know is,

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
I'd really rather we not
walk into Ojiro's trap.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
That alone still doesn't
solve our problem.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] So what exactly
are our options?

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
Are you saying our only
choice is to fight?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
However, I still intend
on helping Ojiro.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
Uh, but why on earth would you
take on that kind of burden?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
He-He's the reason
your arm's in a brace.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
I know.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
This isn't about forgive
and forget, but...

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
...I still consider him
incredibly dear to me.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
We may not be related by blood.
Even so, we're bound together.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
That's why I just can't
turn my back on him.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
Sorry, is this a bad time?

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
You're fine!

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
We were just having
a conversation

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
about what to do next.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
Trying to figure out
the best way to handle

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
the whole Ojiro thing. Right?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
Why don't we
continue this inside?

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
What a nightmare.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
I don't like this new XB.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
And I don't wanna
accept Ojiro's challenge.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
That said, if we wanna save
the game Shun loved,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
we don't have a choice here.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
We have to go toe-to-toe
with Chiyoda and win.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, he'll just
keep introducing

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
more and more extreme edicts.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:56.002 position:50% align:center
Yes, he only values strength.
He's blind to everything else.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
And won't stop until
one Tribe wins.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Which means... if we play,

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
there's no chance of coming
out of this unscathed.

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] The Minato Tribe's not
the only thing on the line here.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
Oh, what? You gonna shame me
for having priorities now?

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
I won't be called selfish
by the guy who--

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
We should fight!

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
[HARU] I think we have
to face the Chiyoda Tribe.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Where is this coming
from all of a sudden?

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
This doesn't seem like you.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
The way I see it,

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
the old XB is the game
that bonds us together.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:47.595 position:50% align:center
And if we have to step up to
protect it, then we should.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, you don't play
to beat another team.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
You play to do
right by your own.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
This team. My family.
You deserve my best.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
I'm stuffed to the gills!

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
Tappin' out already, man?

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
Gotta make a call. Bye.

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
But, um, do I know
you from somewhere?

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
How d'ya know my name?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
Well, first off,

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
how 'bout you take your
hand off my breast, please.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Right, right.

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
Now, you wouldn't happen to know

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
where the Fluffy Dream Choux
shop is around here, would you?

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
Uh, do what?

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
[ESCORT B]
Fluffy Dream Choux Pastries!

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center

Mmm! It's delicious!

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
[ESCORT B]
Oh my god!

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you had it
in you to be this quiet.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Shut your bake.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
So, Ojiro has you
shakin' in your boots.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Dream on! I wanna
mop the floor with him!

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
I just... I just
really hate the idea

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
of being told I have to, is all.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you're a rebel, huh?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
No.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
It's that I take too
much pride in this game.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
Pride? Seriously?

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
[grumbles] I--

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
But I respect it.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Kid, lemme tell ya.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
There are only two things
you need to play:

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
An opponent and a team.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
Hard stop.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
Anything else you're
worried about

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
hasn't got a damn thing
to do with the game.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] I mean, look at me.
I only do it for Yaji.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I admit,
I like to impress him.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
Beyond that, it doesn't
interest me at all.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE sneezes]

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
Ugh. No. Damn it.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
Uhhh. Oh, great. Where are you?

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
Yes? Who is it?

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE]
Oh... You don't say?

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
Only two things you need.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
What's wrong now?

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Headed out?

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Minato Tribe's
got a choice to make.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
I should be there with 'em.

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
I mean, after all, what are
teammates for, right?

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, without a doubt, yes.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'd be
lost without you.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
Yeah. It's a good idea.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
Go, and help your people

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
figure this whole thing
out for themselves.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Right! See you around, Sensei!

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
Don't call me that.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's talk this out, team!

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
Wow, if it isn't King
Fish-for-brains himself.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you,

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
but anyone else thrown by
how diplomatic he sounds?

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
What do you need to
talk to us about?

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
So, in life, some things are
more important than others.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
Is he launching
into a monologue?

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] I value my pride.
I value this diner.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
This Tribe. Its members,
obviously. And Minato City.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
And XB's on that
list too, right?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
Duh, how could it not be?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Right, anyway,
look, I'm not about to let

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
some headcase destroy
what's important.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
In other words, you guys
are prepared to fight.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
--[HARU] Yes.
--[TAIGA] Hell yeah!

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Well, okay, then.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
But we still have to talk
with Santaro and Manami.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
No need! We heard it all!

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
Real talk? Look, if you wanna
do this, we've got you.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
And not just 'cause
it's good for the Tribe.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
We'll do this to save XB.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
And hopefully to
make Ojiro see.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
See what? You mean...?

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
His mistake.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
He was taught the game's only
purpose is to showcase strength.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
If XB fails to satisfy
that philosophy,

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
he'll just corrupt
something else.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
Power is all he cares about now.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Goodness.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
I only just realized what a
terrifying prospect that is.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Listen, we play to win, sure,

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
but it's not the only reason.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Not that we should strive
to lose or anything.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying--

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
Right. It's the love of the
game. That's the point.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
It's important in and of itself
because it's who we are.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
You know what? I think Shun
would absolutely agree.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
Yeah, was that ever in question?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Well, once upon a time,
he was like Ojiro.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
But he valued "respect"
instead of "strength"

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
when he went by "the Destroyer."

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Get up. 'Fore I make you.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Shun, that's enough!

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] The only thing
you're destroying is yourself!

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Can't you see that?

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
Don't give me that
bleeding heart crap.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
'Sides, this guy's the enemy.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
No, he's not! He's us.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
He's someone who loves this
game, just like you and me!

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
Then, finally, he woke up.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
He realized that he was happiest
when everyone was having fun.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, he let
go of the nickname.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey, now that
you mention it,

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
I don't think Shun ever
once refused a match!

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
If someone challenged
us, he accepted.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
Took them head on no
matter who they were!

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
Yep. He wouldn't turn 'em down
even if they were total garbage.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
True, he really lived
and breathed XB.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
Nobody loved playing
the game more than him.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Hold it right there.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
I think we can all agree the
world's greatest XB lover is me!

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, I love it, too!

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
Uh, I think you both
need to take a step back

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
and just accept that you're
standing in my shadow.

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
If they were talking about a
love of inappropriate humor,

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
not XB.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Excuse me?

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
So much love on this team.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
I'll give you that...

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
When do you think we
should chime in, guys?

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
Uh, hard to say. The timing
seems a little bit too delicate.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
Me! No one loves
it more than me!

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
Dude!

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
Look, no offense,

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
but you're way too new to make
that kinda claim, dude.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
Shut your face! We can all be
the ultimate at something!

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
The ultimate leader!

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
I am?

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
The ultimate beam batter!

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
The ultimate hairdo!

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
The ultimate Manami!

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
Uhh?

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] The ultimate
snarky commentator!

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.733 position:50% align:center
The ultimate recurring
background characters!

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uh...

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
Thank you?

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
Then me, Taiga!
The ultimate at loving XB!

00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
Put it all together
and you've got

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
the world's best Minato
Tribe, hands down!

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
Well said. All right,
then, that decides it.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:14.209 position:50% align:center
Minato Tribe!

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:17.003 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Bombers!
