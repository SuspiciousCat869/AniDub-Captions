Rebelling against a social order

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
they felt had bankrupted
their future,

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
young people everywhere cast
off the yoke of civilization

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
and formed restless,
exclusionary tribes.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
Fierce. Proud. Warlike.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
Inevitably, this
partisan zeal gave way

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
to blistering
sectarian violence,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center
transforming the country
into an abattoir.

No one was safe. The world
was steeped in blood.

Desperate to contain the
mounting pandemonium,

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
Neo Tokyo's government mandated

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
that all inter-tribal
disputes be resolved

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center

This was known
colloquially as "XB Law."

As one might expect,
with their pride on the line,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
the nation's youth poured its
collective heart and soul

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center

Now quit wasting my time.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
Heads up. Customer.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Might I have the pleasure of
addressing the Minato Tribe?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um, yeah.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
[YUTAKA]
Outstanding.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
My business card, if you would.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, sure.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, Yutaka Gotanda,
Shinagawa Leader?

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you
trying to pull here?

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
Shinagawa's leader's Kitahama.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
Was. I'm afraid he's been
compelled to step down.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
The Shinagawa Tribe is
now under our control.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
I've heard about you people.
You're all about fancy XB gear.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
'S how you been carvin'
a path to the top.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
We pride ourselves in being
versed in cutting-edge tech,

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
but none of our
preferred accouterments

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
are prohibited by XB regulation.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
Yeah? How nice for you.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
Look, if you're here to try and
hock your wares, get bent.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Ah! My!

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
I can assure you we've not
come in a sales capacity.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
if by using said wares,

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
we managed to summarily
quash the top-ranking team

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
in Extreme Baseball,
a.k.a. the Minato Tribe,

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
a.k.a. yourselves,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
it would be quite the shot
in the arm for our revenue.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
Uh, could somebody
translate this, please?

00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Shh!

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
I'll be unambiguous.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
On behalf of the
new Shinagawa Tribe,

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
I hereby cordially throw
the proverbial gauntlet.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
So in terms more frank...
I believe it is now on.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
Hmph. I don't think so.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
If you refuse, we'll simply
have to broadcast the fact

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
that the Minato Tribe
chickened out.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see you try!

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
We're game.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
'S what we do, right?
It might be fun.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
Besides Tuna and Boring'll
help even the odds.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
Wait, we're playing?

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
If you're talkin' a real live
game, I'm 100% onboard!

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
I don't think you want me.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
If this ain't a joke,

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
you're playing at.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
I was thinking they
could play in my place.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Huh?!

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
Sure! I'll have a better
debut than Joe DiMaggio!

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
Um, okay?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
Hey, nothing to
worry about, guys.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
It'll all work out great.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
You're joking.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Let's get to it.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
[HARU, TAIGA yelp]

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
All aboard!

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wait! What're you doing?

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Yeah! Livin' the dream!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is that?

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
An XB umpire. Think of
it like a judge-y robot.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
Power's good!

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
Hydraulics're good!

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
Safety's good!

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
Everything's good!

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
Am I seeing things?

00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
No worries. Just a part of our
lineup. They're quadruplets!

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
Right. Bench open, now!

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wow.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU] I present to you
the Minato Tribe's mobile bench.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
[SHUN]
Alrighty then, let's play ball.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Here ya go.
Can't play in street clothes.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
I... can't play at all.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Uh-huh. Whatever you say.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
You'll want these.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
One transmit badge and
one bracelet glove. Cool?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
It's only your basic
Extreme Baseball gear.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you,
I can't do this!

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
Quit bein' such a wimp.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
How do you know you can't play

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
if you've never even
bothered to try?

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
[HARU] But what if I'm
the reason we lose?

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Just try your best!

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
[HARU groans]

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
What about trying is such
a difficult concept?

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
It's just an opportunity
for self-discovery, right?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Quit it!

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
It's all good. Leave this
to Joltin' Joe-Taiga!

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] For now, you guys just
remember one simple thing.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
Once you've got the
ball, crush them!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
Like, beat 'em up?
Oh-ho-ho, yes!

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
Watch your backs.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
The opposing team will
get just as violent.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
Okay! Let's get up and running!

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
You got it!

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
Um, so, like, what
position do you play?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
Oh. Have a look.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
Catcher.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Ahh.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
Yup. Saori's also the best
playmaker in the game.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Playmaker?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI] Physically,
she's an absolute beast.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
Mentally, she's a supercomputer.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
It takes a certain kind of
person to catch Shun's pitches

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
when he's serious, and she's it.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Play ball!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Perfect.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
[SAORI gasps]

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
There it goes!

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
Fifty meters north of
Block 3! Track it down!

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
I got it! Going to cut it off!

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
Uh! Incoming!

you're doing?!

[TAIGA] You're not
goin' anywhere, lass!

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
What? How's this legal?

[screams]

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
Interference!

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.679 position:50% align:center
Physical contact
without possession!

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Did you or
did you not hear me say

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
crush them after
you've got the ball?

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
You're just handing
'em unearned runs!

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
Got it! That one's
one me! Sorry!

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
Totally the noob's fault.

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
Definitely the noob's fault.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
Absolutely the noob's fault.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
No question the noob's fault.

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
All right! We get it!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Okay, Haru. You're up.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
No. Please. I can't.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
If all you're gonna
do is sit on your ass,

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
let me go out there for you.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
Um, sure.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
Way to be worthy
of your nickname.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center

Hm?

[TAIGA]
You're never gonna win

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
if you won't even
step up to the plate.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the advice,

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
but not everyone's as keen
on picking random fights

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
like you are.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
Well then, by all means,

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
keep sucking your thumb
from the sidelines,

"Mega Boring."

Oooh, someone's nickname
just leveled up.

C'mon! Let's do it!

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
[YUTAKA]
Ah, blunt and stupid.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
I adore the simple types.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center

Dial it back, Taiga!

No way. Trust me on this.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
You wanna catch a fish,
you gotta set your hooks right.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Tuna don't mess with
bait thrown by a wuss.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
Same deal here.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
Why even bother to play if
you're not gonna go all out?

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
Playing not to lose
is a loser's game!

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center

correctly, or like,
