Right. You can consider
this your dojo.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
Please tell me you're
havin' a laugh.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] This's how
you'll stay up on XB,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
and make sure you do.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
Keep the place spotless.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] Your homework'll
be to swing this bad boy

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
10,000 times a day.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
If I were you, I'd get started
on it bright n' early.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Come off it!

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
You can't seriously expect me
to up my game with a log!

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
Meh. I don't know.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Don't know? You're the teacher!

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
Look, odds are you'll never
be able to hit worth a damn.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
But we might be able
to compensate for it

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
with brute strength.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
Okay. But how'll that
work if I can't hit?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
I'll explain it when
you're older! Jeez.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
Have fun.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA]
I'll be back in a week.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Remember, a hundred
thousand swings every day.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
That's not what you said!

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA] Whatever.
Just keep swingin' the log.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.738 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
One! Two! Three!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
Wait, so like, spam?

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I always block
'em immediately,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center
but then they just end
up getting through

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
from another address.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
[phone beeps]

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
Uh. There's another one.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
You idiot! I thought I taught
you better than this!

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Always use a throwaway
email for your porn!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
That's not what this is.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
We miss somebody drunk
in the bathroom at close?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
I dunno. I don't even remember
us having any customers?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Well...

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
I've been meanin'
to tell you guys.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center
This place has a bit
of a gory reputation.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Wh-What does that mean?

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
Could use a bit
more detail here.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Legend has it, an evil
spirit wanders the area

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
carryin' a blood-spattered bat.

--[SANTARO, HARU scream]
--What happened to the lights?

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, sorry. There was
a bug on the switch.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
Just a bug, okay, cool!

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haru, ol' buddy ol' pal!

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
Why don't you go in there and
see if someone's lurking around?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
[NEKOMARU meows]

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Uh, excuse me.
I'm afraid the diner's closed.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
Uh. You shouldn't be--

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My beam bat!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
[NEKOMARU hisses]

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Um... Intruder!

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center

Go after them!

[SANTARO]
Get back here!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
You don't wanna do this!

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
It's over now!
That way's a dead end!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Excuse me?

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
They must've just
vaulted over the wall.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
Wait, what're--?

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
[HARU, KAZUKI yell]

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
Stupid idea. Huh?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
--[HARU] Wait, K-Kazuki?
--That was uncalled for.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
Um, where'd they--?

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Ugh. You falling from the sky
scared a few of them off.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
This is where they congregate,
and I stop by sometimes.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hold on, I'm talking
about the thief.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
There was a thief?

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
They tried to steal my beam bat.
Had a mask on and everything!

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
You didn't see anybody?

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Sorry. Can't claim I did.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
But this is the only way
that they could've gone!

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
Really? You don't say?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Minato can be quite
disorganized.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
My advice, not that you've
asked for it of course,

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
is to keep your beam bat close.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Five of Hearts.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center

be it! Here it comes!

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center

Ha-ha! Dobon!

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center

Oh-ho! Well played, Kazuki!

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] No way! I call
shenanigans! Bet you cheated.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
I take umbrage with that.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
If anyone's liable
to cheat, it's you.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center

Like hell!

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
"Wait," the doctor tells him.

"I see. You've been
using the wrong hand."

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
Ha! Oh, that's awful!
Can you imagine?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
True story!

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
[HARU] I'm probably overthinking
this, but still...

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
Don't bother coming back
till you're stronger.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Yeah, yeah, sure! Got it!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI sighs]

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI chuckles]

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
So simple.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
[HARU] The whole point
of that conversation

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
was getting rid of Taiga.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
Had to be. What is
this guy up to?

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
No clothes! You're not
wearing any clothes!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you
wearing any clothes?

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
I was takin' a shower.
That's usually how it works.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
Could you go away now?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh. Right. Makes sense.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
I heard screaming!
Is everything okay in here?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
'Cause, uh, you know,
if it's not...

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[HARU yells]

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO yells]

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Look out!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
How do I make it stop?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Oof.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
Guess this stuff really adds up.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
I am so sorry.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, sure
hope you're happy

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
with the hash you made
of things, genius.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
It was your fault!

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I'll come
up with the money!

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Haru, wait!

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
Well, well.
Talk about convenient.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center

[HARU]
"King of Batting Contest"?

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
There's quite a prize.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Ten million. Are you kidding me?

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Is that real?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Apparently, someone with the
Setagaya Tribe is the sponsor.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
The rules say anyone
who cares to can join,

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
regardless of which
Tribe they're from.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
Word is, all the members of
Setagaya are insanely wealthy.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
Still though,
talk about generous.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
'S like celebrities
givin' to charity

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
for more than just tax breaks.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] Imagine all
the things you could do

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
with this kind of scratch!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we could afford to
get the diner fixed up.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Playing XB for money
just doesn't feel right.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
I don't disagree,
but you have to admit,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
it's also kind of exciting
to think about.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
Could be fun!

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] What if this
is how the Minato Tribe

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
makes its big,
triumphant comeback?

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
We'd be rich!

[KAZUKI] It's a shame
Taiga can't participate...

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
Okay, then, I can
cheer you guys on.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] I'll earn twice that
in the time it takes you

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
to say it again.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
Yes. You heard me.
Not interested. Full stop.

Good news, sir, all of

Excellent work, Miss Ikejiri.

[EIJI]
Hmm?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Oop.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
That'll be all.
Get that jacket dry cleaned.

[gasping]

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Mr. Todoroki!

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
Apparently when I said "rich,"
I meant "obscenely loaded."

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
Okay, note to self,
don't touch anything.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Money can buy happiness.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
Hey, has anybody seen Kazuki?

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
Who knows? That guy's always
wandering off on his own.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
Wait, is that who I think it is?

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
[TATSUTO] Listen to me, you
can't play in your condition!

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
You can't even hold a damn
bat, for Christ's sake!

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
Shut up! Where the...

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
Glad to see they're
all feeling better.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
Seems a bit of a stretch
to call that "better."

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
Excuse me.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
Please, sir. We need help.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
Can you spare some change?
Anything. Thank you.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:34.050 position:50% align:center
Well, I... Sorry,
I just have this.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
Thank you for this kindness.
We're most grateful, sir.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Okay.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
That's gotta be the Ota Tribe.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
The who?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
It's so sad.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
Industrial pollution reduced
their city to a cesspool.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
I can only imagine how
hard their lives must be.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
Wow, I can't even
remember the last time

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
I heard about them
participating in a match.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
Attention XB players! Get ready!

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
Because the "Slam!
King of Batting Contest"

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
is about to begin!

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
Who wants to win a cool
ten million bones?

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
Me! I want it! It's mine!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
The rules couldn't be simpler!

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Three players from each
team will step up to bat

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
and show us their stuff!

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
Each batter gets only one hit!
That's right, one hit!

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
After that, the hitting
distances will be tallied up!

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
The team with the
largest total distance

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
moves on to the next round!

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
It's Tribe against Tribe
in a contest of skill!

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
Good luck! May the
best batters win!

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
So gross. What's
with the bikinis?

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
I thought this was XB.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
These floozies are
dressed for water polo.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
Let's get started
with round one!

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
And strike!

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
That's three strikeouts,

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
which unfortunately
means zero meters.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
Looks like Minato is the winner!

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
Out in the first round?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
Okay, but that ball
was impossible.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
Eh. I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Ota's the worst
team in the whole league.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
They can't tell a bat
from a hole in the ground.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
Not tryin' to be
insensitive or anything.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
Just sayin' being against them

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
is like gettin'
pennies from heaven.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
[IKEJIRI] Excellent.
This wasn't even necessary.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] I just love it when
a plan comes together.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
[EIJI chuckles]

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
So much fun.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
This is beautiful.
Everything is going to plan.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Reporting in, sir.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
The new boy with Minato,
he isn't letting his guard down.

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
[EIJI grunts]

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Then try another tactic.
Must I think of everything?

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. As you wish.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
How marvelous it is
to live in a world

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
where everything has its price.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
[EIJI laughs]

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
All right, gentlemen.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.947 position:50% align:center
Saori's not up to it,

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
so winning this baby's
on our shoulders!

repair the diner.

[BIKINI BABE C]
I know, right?

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
I'll take getting stepped
on for ten grand.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
Heads up, it's time
for the final round!

We're facin' off with Minato!

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna go all out

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
and break 'em into
little pieces, guys?

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI MOB]
Hell yeah!

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Boss, the only thing
broken here is you.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
[BIKINI BABE A]
You poor things.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
Looks like you boys need
to quench your thirst.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
How about a nice energy shot?

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
If that's okay!

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
Bottoms up, love.
Hit a long one for me.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever,
it'll be a cinch.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
Okay, we've made it this far,
now let's bring 'er home, yeah?

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
Grab victory by the cajones!

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center

[SANTARO] Wait. Dude!
Where the hell have you been?

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Nowhere. Just giving

Yo! Losers!

Huh?

[HYAKUTARO] Move, or they'll
teach what I do to you next

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
in med school as an
"exceptional case."

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
Uh. That seems
aggressive even for you.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Something
isn't right here.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
Are you feeling okay?

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Shut your face. And get
the hell outta my way!

Huh?

[IKEJIRI]
What a white-knuckle finish

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
to this contest of contests!

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
But I'm pleased to announce the
winner is: The Minato Tribe!

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
We only won because the
Adachi Tribe dropped out.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
Something about
"intestinal distress."

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
Pretty convenient timing.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, somebody
slipped 'em something.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
Don't care! We won, baby!

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center

stage to claim your prize!

[KAZUKI]
One moment, Haru.

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Huh?

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
Why don't you leave
that with me?

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
Look, you can't accept
the prize holding a bat.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
It's unbecoming!

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:14.581 position:50% align:center
Excellent!

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
Here to present the prize will
be the contest's sponsor.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
It's the benevolent
philanthropist himself,

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
Eiji Todoroki!

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
Even among Setagaya members,

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
this guy's known
for being a slimeball.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
No wonder this whole thing

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
played like a cheap
EDM festival.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
What does he care about taste?

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
Hell, the bills don't
know, am I right?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
Yo, get up there.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
A most spectacular
performance. Congratulations.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Now, then, your
well-earned prize.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
I can't accept it.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
Not sure I can explain.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
It just feels wrong
taking your money, sir.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
We didn't actually
beat anyone today.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hat-Hair doesn't
speak for all of us!

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
Heh. Are you stupid?
This is good money.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
You can't use ten million?

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand that, sir.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
But couldn't you just donate
it to a worthy cause, then?

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
I'm a very worthy cause--!

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
Eloquently said, Haru.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
You're quite right to refuse
this bloated vulgarian.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
That seems like a bit much.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
The man standing before you
is the would-be thief.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
Huh? Baseless accusations!

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is that my phone?

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
I've been over these grounds
with a fine-tooth comb.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Just for future reference,

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
your security's a
total dumpster fire.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
He's had his eye on Haru's beam
bat for quite some time.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
The barrage of emails didn't
have the desired effect,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
so he went a step further.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Hm?

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
I don't remember any emails.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, but you did receive
them. Think back.

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
[phone beeps]

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.938 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Hm? Now what?

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Hm?

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
Why do I keep
getting this stuff?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
Spam folder it is.
Ugh. So irritating.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
I don't know why I'm getting so
much junk mail, but it sucks.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
Wait, I thought those
emails were spam!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
And when you failed to respond,

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
our corpulent capitalist
lost patience.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
He plotted to steal it outright.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
Of course, we all know what came
of that ham-fisted attempt.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Alas there were a few more
tricks up his sleeve.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
This entire contest
has been a charade.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
A pretext for luring us here
and catching Haru unawares.

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
What he didn't anticipate was
how vigilant Haru would be

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
after the first attempt.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
He's kept it so close,
the chance to snag it

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
has yet to present itself.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, it was only
a matter of time. Observe!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
[THIEF gasps]

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
I knew it all along!
Never trust an 8 or above!

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you're too late!

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law!

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
Right you are, madam.
I couldn't agree more.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
Wait, how'd you do that?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] Foresight
and a very slight hand.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Enough talk! How much
do you want for it?

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
A billion? A trillion?
Fine! It's done!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
It's not for sale.
It was a present from Shun.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
He entrusted that bat to me,
and I can't put a price on that.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
Sure you can!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
What if I sponsored you to be

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
a full-fledged
member of Setagaya?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
People would kill for
that sort of clout!

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't you
wanna live the high life?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
No way.

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
You little--!

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
That stuff doesn't
really appeal to me.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
Heh, and besides, I'm happy
with the tribe that I'm in.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
They're my family now.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
Ugh. But what about the diner?

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
We can fix it up by ourselves.
Not a big deal.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Sure! That sounds fun!

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
Now that's the spirit, man!

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
[HARU chuckles]

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] You still don't
trust me, do you?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
What? No, I do?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
That's a relief.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
[HARU] So, uh, what
happened to your hand?

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
Did Nekomaru go to town
on it or something?

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
No, actually,
it was from the strays.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
One of them's a little
bit of a brat.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
Well, well!
Speak of the devil!

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Aw. There now.
No need to be afraid.

[KAZUKI chuckles]

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Work in progress.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no kidding.

Dammit! Dammit!

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Who the hell
does he think he is?

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
Money makes the world go 'round!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center

[EIJI]
What the hell is this?

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Authorities say
that the identity of the bomber

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
remains unknown at this time.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
No suspects have been named.
The incident is still...

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
[HARU] Do you think
it could've been...?

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
Uh? Who, me? Gosh, no.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Phew. Okay, then.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
Opportune timing on the part
of whoever is responsible.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
His kind of money
always makes enemies.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Someone was bound to pull a
stunt like this sooner or later.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
Y'think so?

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
We're done.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Ah.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
The plan worked perfectly.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
And the explosion
covered our tracks,

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
so everything's hunky-dory!

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
We're all in the clear.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center

Nice. Oooh, shiny.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
Just a minute, Fucho.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Huh?

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
Heads up, there's someone
who'd like a word with you.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO grumbles]

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
Is this a bad time?

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Who're you s'posed to be?

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
I'm with Chiyoda Tribe.
Yui Kamiki.

Let us not waste any time.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
We need you to dispose
of Kazuki Aoyama.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
This come from the top?

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
I'm not at liberty
to disclose that.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center

Fine, keep your secrets.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center

Is this sufficient?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Heh. It'd better be.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center

won't mind if we count it.

[FUCHO]
Sorry, champ,

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
you're gonna have to
do better than that.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
Don't let your
guard down, boss!

00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center

[ENOKI chuckling]

[FUCHO] Hm? Nah, I dunno
what their problem is.

00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.715 position:50% align:center
They just despise me.
