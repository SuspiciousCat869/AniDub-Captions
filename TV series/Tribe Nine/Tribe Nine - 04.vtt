Shun died that night.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
We found his body
sitting outside.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
We were blindsided.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
The days that followed
blended together.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
None of us saw it coming,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
and none of us knew
how to handle it.

--Hey.
--[TAIGA yells]

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
Dammit. Could you
not scare the fish?

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
I'm havin' a hard enough time

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
gettin' the little
wankers to bite.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Time's a blur even now.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
One minute it feels like
he left us forever ago,

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50% align:center
the next, it might as well
have been yesterday.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.864 position:50% align:center
Everything feels wrong.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
The only thing I know anymore is
that the Tribe is in shambles.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
We can't move on without him.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
How could you?!

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
I'm owed an explanation!

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
Why the hell would you
not tell me he was sick?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
Whoa, easy!

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
It's not his fault, though!

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
Shun made us both promise him
never to tell anyone about it.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.235 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
So what?!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
I wasn't important
enough to know?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
What kind of crap is that?

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
After everything we've been
through together as a team!

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
[SAORI cries]

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
[SAORI] Whatever.
We're not a Tribe now anyway.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't talk
like that. We're--

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
Um.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
Um. Hi, guys.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Yo. Careful, don't put the
fur ball down over here.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
There's a bit of broken ceramic.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
Saori has a point.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. Maybe we
should'a just told her anyway.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
It's a question
of timing, really.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
She'd have been beside
herself if she'd known.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
Shun just didn't
want her to worry.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're prob'ly right.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
So, um, I'm guessing he
was sick for a while?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
That coffee we used to give
him? Actually medicine.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
And Chiyoda was the final straw.
If we hadn't played then--

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Stop. Don't do that to yourself.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
"Ifs" won't help anything.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
Why make things worse, ya know?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
C'mon, don't tie
yourself into knots.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
Ow! That hurt!

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
Right, okay. I think ten
is definitely my limit.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, really?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
But that'd only get
us up to three outs.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yo! Don't look at me,
I'm the backup pitcher!

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
Strictly for emergency use!

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
I'll catch, then.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
It's not as easy as
it looks, you sure?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, there's only
one way to find out.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Don't you go easy on me.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
There's a trick to it.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Seems we can finally get
this team off the ground.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Hey. You know
you're not out yet, right?

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
This is when you're
s'posed to run.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
This ain't for the
faint of heart.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
disrespect the game.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
Get up, 'fore I make you.

[SAORI]
Shun, that's enough!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Stop. Seriously. You don't
want to traumatize him.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
[SAORI]
I can't believe him.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
How could he keep me
in the dark like that?

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
Guess that pride of his went
with him, too. That jerk.

[HYAKUTARO]
Ooo, a feisty one.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Your leader may
be six feet under,

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
but that attitude's
alive and kickin'.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center

Get your hands off me!

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center

Uh! What the hell do you
mean she was kidnapped?

Oh, no!

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
Are you a hundred
percent on what you saw?

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
'Cause she can
normally handle herself.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Guys, I well know
what it looks like

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
when a pack of eejits takes a
gal somewhere against her will!

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
Trust me, they were
faster than sailfish!

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever game
it is they're playing,

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
they've messed with
the wrong woman.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
But even she can't take
them all on at once!

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
She's not exactly in the
best state of mind, either.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Come on!
Was that necessary?

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
What's the deal with the paper?

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
It's a note! Get a load of this.

If you want her
back in one piece,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
then come to Adachi City."

Hm? Where's that?

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
Put 'er down.

Am I s'posed to eat this?

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO]
It's just pudding.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
I had this idea in my head

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
of Minato's underboss
bein' a lot tougher.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
Can it, Momotaro.
What're you after?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
Please, you know it's
"Hyaku." Hyakutaro Senju.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
Seriously! How many times
do I have to say this?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
It's not a hard name!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
I really don't find it
worth remembering.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
Before this is all over
and done with, sweetie,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
you're the one they'll forget.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
The exploits of the Minato
Tribe cast a long shadow.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
Even with Shun dead,
you're still a legend.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
Which means the only real
way for the Adachi Tribe

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
to utterly conquer Neo Tokyo is
to turn you guys into compost!

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
Like it or not, we're gonna
lock horns with youse guys.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
And you wanna know
the best part?

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
Your teammates aren't in
a position to refuse us.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
I think you overvalue me.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
I'm not important--
worthless as a hostage.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be familiar
with Chiyoda,

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
their psychotic leader?

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
Named Ojiro Otori?

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
He ordered the Minato
Tribe to throw in the towel.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
Hate to spoil your plan,
but nobody's coming for me.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
Tch. That's the most pathetic
thing I've ever heard.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
Sounds like he shattered
your will to live, too.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI] Meh. I couldn't
care less if they show up.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
See, the longer it takes
your buddies to get here,

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
the more time I've
got alone with you.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
Ah, as far as I'm concerned,

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
that's carte blanche
to do whatever I want!

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO, RANKICHI laughing]

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
They probably heard
the news about Shun

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
and figured this was their
best chance to make a move.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Who gives a damn
what their reason is?!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
Let's just go get Saori back!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
So reckless.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
Extremely reckless.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
Phenomenally reckless.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Reckless to a fault.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
Oh, come off it!

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
We can't just sit on our
butts and let her rot!

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
I say we load the truck
an' get rolling.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center

Think about it, though!

We can't just go in
there guns blazing.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center

probably a trap!

Hey. Cool if I raise a flag?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
What's that supposed
to mean exactly?

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
Y'know, a death flag.

C'mon. In my head I'm divvying
up who gets what when I die.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
Classic death flag, right?

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't joke about that.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Who's joking? It's a
classic bait-and-switch.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
If anything, it'll mean
I'm more likely to survive.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
As a subversion.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
That's messed up.

[SHUN] Manami, you get my floor
cushion. Cool with you?

Naturally you get my mug, Ace.

That way you'll think of me
whenever you drink coffee.

If he ever learns
to hit with it,

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
I think I'd like Haru
to have my bat.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
What about her?

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
[SHUN] Oh, right.
Totally forgot about Saori.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
That's cold.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
I don't think I need to leave
her anything specific, honestly.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
She'll find something to keep.

Hello?!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
If you're just
gonna stand there,

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
least you could do
is wipe down a table!

Okay, um, could you not
say it like a euphemism?

Could you act like you're
not picturing it right now?

been disbanded, though!

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Home? But I don't
know where. Guys?

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Right? No, I mean east.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Wait. What am
I supposed to do?

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
Ugh, where the hell am I?

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
Somebody tell me
which way to throw!

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry about it.
We're too late.

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
How pitiful.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
It's almost depressing how easy
this is turning out to be.

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Dirty cheaters!

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU] How many times do I
have to tear this place apart

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
looking for a ball?

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Um, I, uh... Guys?

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.232 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Uh! How'd he get here already?

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
[SHIRO]
The motorcycle!

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE ROBOT]
Safe!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
And that gives us ten.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center
Look, I get this is difficult,
but do you have to suck?

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
Time out!

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU] Ugh! I wanna
quit--this blows!

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you quit giving up
hits if you hate it so much?

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Screw you!

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
Gosh. It's hard enough finding
the ball in this labyrinth,

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
but every one of their runners
is on wheels to boot.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
We don't stand much
of a chance, do we?

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
They went around the order in
a single inning--we're toast.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Humiliating.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
So humiliating.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Extremely humiliating.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
I've never been so humiliated.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[HYAKUTARO] Without Shun,
you guys are nothin'!

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
Yo, boss. Dial it back.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI] Face it, kiddos!
The Minato Tribe is all hype!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
I really hate to admit it,

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
but they've got us
completely pegged.

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
Shun was this team.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Knock it off!

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
The hell's gotten into you?

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I just...

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI laughs]

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Sorry, sorry.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
It's just that you all
remind me of wind-up toys

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
that are all out of juice,
going around in circles.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Uh...

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
And who the hell're you?

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
My bet's that he's a spy
from the other side.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
That dude with us?

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Never seen him before.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
Indeed, who am I?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
'Case you hadn't noticed, pal,
we're a bit busy playing XB,

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
so piss off with your riddles!

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
I'll join the Minato
Tribe if you want.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
I might've promised
Shun I would offer.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
Wait, you what?

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
And when did you talk to Shun?

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
He never said a thing
about this to us!

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
It's a mystery.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
You're puttin' one over on us.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
Can you even play the game
with your arm like that?

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] My arm is
of little consequence.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Games aren't decided
by physical skill.

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
Victory is born of
superior intellect.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
Which, if I may say,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
neither side appears to
possess in any abundance.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sounds to me like
little boy blue

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.944 position:50% align:center
thinks he can turn this around.

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Quite so. I bet my
good limbs on it.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
Fine, then. Suit yourself.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
[ALL gaps]

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's not up to you!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.915 position:50% align:center
Hey, what do you want from us?
We're bored to tears.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
At least this way you've got a
shot at making it interesting.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:37.255 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Let's evaluate, shall we?

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:42.469 position:50% align:center
Not only does the Adachi Tribe
have the home field advantage,

00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
they also have the benefit
of greater mobility.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.099 position:50% align:center
You zoo animals can
only give chase.

00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
And poorly at that, I might add.
Your situation is hopeless.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
Where do you get off
calling us that?!

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
You are definitely a lemming.
Because you're stupid.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey!

00:21:58.902 --> 00:21:59.903 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know that lemmings

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
are historically
misrepresented in media!

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
Now tell me, with the
Adachi Tribe living here,

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:09.162 position:50% align:center
what're the odds they know
more than they let on?

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you see here.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:12.957 position:50% align:center
[SANTAROU]
Huh?

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
Well, um...

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
What is this, civic planning?

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
They're manholes. Big deal.

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.964 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's very observant.

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:22.801 position:50% align:center
Mr. Red-Faced Macaque, I'd
like you to connect the dots.

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.761 position:50% align:center
I'll connect your face!

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, he might
be on to something.

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:30.850 position:50% align:center
Check out the tire marks.
They stop right at the edge.

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.185 position:50% align:center
Do you guys see that?

00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:35.105 position:50% align:center
Yes! Granted,
the bar is rather low,

00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.899 position:50% align:center
but you're clearly the cleverest
animal at the zoo.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.693 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:42.570 position:50% align:center
Well, I must say I'm
pleasantly surprised.

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:46.116 position:50% align:center
Hope may be on the horizon yet.

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.164 position:50% align:center
Now it's not even fun.

00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:56.001 position:50% align:center
We're just going
through the motions.

00:22:58.128 --> 00:22:59.629 position:50% align:center
Here's a little-known fact.

00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
The original plan was to build
the shopping center underground,

00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:05.093 position:50% align:center
but the recession
had other ideas,

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:08.138 position:50% align:center
so the project was abandoned.

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:10.807 position:50% align:center
[RANKICHI]
Huh?

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.729 position:50% align:center
Tch. It's exactly like
the new guy said.

00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:19.691 position:50% align:center
You're not sailfish. You're
just a bunch of mole men.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.695 position:50% align:center
Outta my way!

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:25.864 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yells]

00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:28.116 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:33.038 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Such a
rudimentary scheme.

00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
I'm rather shocked
you didn't catch on.

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] I neglected
to introduce myself.

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.964 position:50% align:center
Kazuki Aoyama.

00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
Now go and snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:50.347 position:50% align:center
That is to say, if you can.
