00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare hold back.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Hmm.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
What a pathetic show.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
I am disappointed
beyond measure, Kazuki.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.006 position:50% align:center
My dream that you might
become the ultimate champion

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
worthy of glorifying the
Otori name was foolish.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
You are an abject
lesson in false hope.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
Seventy-four--no, Ojiro.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
Shatter his arm. This reprobate
is no longer fit to play.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
I will not have his
failures become mine.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
Please, Ojiro.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center

[FUCHO]
Nighty-night!

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
So sorry, lad. Minato's best
player's back in the game!

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
And just to clarify,
I'm talkin' about me.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
I believe that's three outs.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
Um, Taiga?

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
I thought that you were
still training over in Taito.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
I ran away!

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
[HANAFUDA growls]

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
Damn kid! How dare you
waste my precious time!

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
Don't be upset.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Granted, he didn't exactly
take off with your blessing.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
But hey, look on
the bright side,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
at least the regimen
did him some good.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
Like how?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, that
doesn't excuse him

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
from disrespecting his <i>sensei</i> .

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
All right, Haru.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
Let's go, we've got
ourselves a game to win.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
Hm? What's wrong?

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I...
This whole thing's a mess.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
even playing anymore.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
Because Kazuki's using
us to get revenge.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
Huh? Right.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
You'll have to explain to
me why that's even close

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
to a good enough
reason to give up.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
'Cause, he...

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] Save it for after
you've hit a home run.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
Wha--? I don't think
this is a good idea.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You, too, nerd!
Get the lead out!

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, things just
got interesting again.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groaning]

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
Son of a--

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
You lot are lookin' rough.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] So the only ones
who can keep going

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
are me, Haru, this guy,
and who else?

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
You? Assuming you're up for it.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
I'm more than capable
of winning single handedly,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
if you'll excuse the pun.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Count me in.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Do as I instruct and
victory is assured.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
Fine. I am, in point
of fact, a traitor.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
Lord Tenshin cast me out
after I fell behind Ojiro.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
The only reason I joined you
was to exact my revenge.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
What?

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
I got the ever-living
piss knocked outta me

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
just so that you could
scrap with maskface?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
More or less.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
No one asked you to put
yourself in harm's way.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
You-- Ugh...

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
Be careful!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
You shouldn't be moving!

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
I say we hand this conniving
snake over to the psychos

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
'n get on with our lives.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
That's an option.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
I hate that he used us
and the game for revenge.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
Still, though...

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Snap out of it!

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
Or what? You just gonna
lick your wounds?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
And what if we are?
You enjoy being tricked?

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
Who knows what else this
guy's lying to us about?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Why're you so mad all of sudden?

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
Nothing's changed.
Drop the pity party.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
We all knew the cute hoor
wasn't to be trusted

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
from the moment we
laid eyes on him.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
An excellent argument if I could
tell whose side you were on.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
If it's vengeance you're after,

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
then as far as I'm
concerned crack on.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Why not? We all wanna
kick Ojiro's ass, right?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
Hey, last I checked,
we play to win.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
Who gives a damn
what Kazuki wants?

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
The only thing on our
mind should be victory!

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Taiga.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
You know, can't believe
I'm saying this,

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
but the moron's right.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Moron?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
So then.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
Shall we commence with
our counter strategy?

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna knock their balls
into the stratosphere!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sure you'd like to.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
But just focus on
getting through this.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Houl yer whisht!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
I helped you,
so let me have this.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
Look, it's unnecessary.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA]
Huh?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Play it safe.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Don't waste energy
trying to hit.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
You might get yourself injured.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
If you were smart, you'd let
yourself be struck out here.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Whatever.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
Since when is it
"smart" not to score?

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA yells]

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
My training's bore
a fruit that's me!

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
How'd the whiff machine
hit the first pitch?

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
I guess we need to
reconsider that assessment.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
No.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
You might wanna
take another look.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.200 position:50% align:center
That idiot really took my BS
about brute strength

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
straight to heart!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
Quite.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
His remarkable innate
physical strength

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
actually creates a
vacuum around the bat,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
which in turn changes
the ball's trajectory.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
Very nice.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
It takes a ridiculous amount
of power to accomplish that.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
Yup. And so the ball will act
like he's actually hit it

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
even if he misses.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
Which he will.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE]
I can see now why you insisted

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
he focus on improving
those arms of his.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
An inspired choice.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
[YAJIROBE] Gracious me,
he did a number on this place.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's been
ravaged by a tornado.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Way to go,
Hanafuda- <i>sensei</i> !

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, don't call me
that in public, y'hear.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
So now what?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
Way things are goin',
we're gonna lose.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
Hey, if we're down by 101,
all we have to do is score 102.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
Guess I have to pitch.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
Don't get in your head.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
You just gotta get
the ball in play.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
And let your defense
do the rest.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
Heh. No big deal.
I'll pan 'em out real good.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
Right, and in the meantime,
I'll fetch the balls.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
Dead center.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
[KIYOSHIRO]
No damn chance!

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
Second and first.

Wait. What? This isn't--!

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
Fucho!

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Hm?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
What? You get points when
your runners make it home.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
I mean, I thought
that's the rule.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
Those guys there?
They're on our team.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! What is this?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
Hey, you! Don't ignore me!

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
Wait, uh...

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
Now this is fun!

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
They're handing our asses
to us on a technicality.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
What do we do?

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI] All's well that
ends well, I guess.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO] True that. Ota had
to learn to play by the rules.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
[MANAMI]
One hundred percent.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
[SANTARO]
Those umpies were...

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
Kazuki!

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
You're leaving, aren't you?

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
Correct.

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
[HARU]
To go find Ojiro?

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
We're tangled by fate.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
Raised by the same
pair of hands.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
Tenshin swooped in and whisked
us away to his facility.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
He was fixated with shaping us
into the ultimate XB players.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Tragically, Ojiro hasn't
cracked a smile since.

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to
save him from himself.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
And it felt like I could.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Especially since joining
the Minato Tribe.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
For the first time I dared hope.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
Kazuki.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] I'd even go
as far to say I had fun.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI] Imagine what we
might've achieved as a team

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
if this wasn't where
we had to part ways.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
[TAIGA] You're above
saying goodbye, too?

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
Sauntering off like
you're going somewhere.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
FYI, we've got a hard and
fast rule in this Tribe.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
Defectors get fed to Nekomaru.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
You can't leave our
Tribe that easy!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you didn't mean
to leave this behind.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you, so
don't be so forgetful, Kazuki.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
[KAZUKI]
My apologies.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
I must've put it down
without realizing.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[ALL chuckle]

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
Interfering with the robots?

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
Oh, how very clever.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
I must confess, I hadn't
thought of that tactic.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Dispatch all units to Ota City!

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
I want that tech in my
possession at once!

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[HANNYA]
Sir!

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Why would we need
such a contrivance?

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[TENSHIN]
To ensure victory. Why else?

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Do we no longer place
strength above guile?

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
Be mindful of your
tone with me.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
We pay whatever price
victory demands.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
The finer points of ethics
are of no interest.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
I win by skill or not at all.

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Hold your tongue, boy!

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
Do not suppose to tell me
what's worthwhile!

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
I recoil from the
idealistic folly of youth!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
If our path must be crooked,
so be it--provided that we win!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
The Otori ensnare triumph by
any and all means necessary!

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
We are adaptable.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
Nay, rather it is the world that
must adapt to our prerogative.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
Yes! I, and I alone,
decide what's permitted!

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
Come to think, I can very well
shape this world as I see fit!

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
Yo. Took ya long enough.

00:21:54.189 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
[FUCHO]
Yes. That's it. Give it to me.

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
Chaos.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:20.632 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Despicable.
