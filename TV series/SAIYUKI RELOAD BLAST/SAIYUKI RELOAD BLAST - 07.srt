1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:13,708
[HAKKAI] You were so lively
not that long ago.

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,250
All good things must come
to an end, I suppose.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,916
[GOJYO retching]

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,208
What's wrong with you two?

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,166
You've been puking your
guts out for miles.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,125
[HAKKAI]
Altitude sickness most likely.

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,791
It appears we've already
climbed over 11,000 feet

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,000
above sea level if
you can believe.

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,541
Can you not drive like
a bat outta hell?

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,291
Can you not bark orders at me

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,583
until regaining your
ability to walk?

12
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,833
[GOKU] I don't get it.
I feel fine.

13
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:42,583
Alas, some people have
especially weak constitutions.

14
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,625
Lest we forget, Sanzo is
only a human being.

15
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,416
That said--

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,416
[tires screeching]

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,916
[GOJYO groans]
Jeez, Hakkai!

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,458
Spoke too soon.

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,666
Seems those of us part demon
have our upper limits as well.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,041
You're kidding me.

21
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,041
Well, well, if it ain't
the Sanzo Genjo Party!

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,666
Who'd a' thought these
high-end bounties

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
from the east would
scuttle their butts

24
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,583
all the way to no-man's land?

25
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,916
Aw, c'mon, seriously?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,791
[GOKU] Why I gotta be
the only one not sick?

27
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,583
Hey, Hakuryu, can you move?

28
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,458
[HAKURYU chirps]

29
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,333
I'm gonna keep these yahoos busy

30
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,041
as long as I can. I need you
to throw it in reverse

31
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,666
and make like you're
leavin' me for dead.

[HASSAN]
You a'right?

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,541
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

39
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,166
[HASSAN] You fellas aren't
from around here, are ya?

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,833
No, uh, we're travelers.
My buddies are kinda...

41
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,583
[HASSAN] The altitude gets
to everyone at first.

42
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,541
Part of the reason it's so
dangerous 'round here.

43
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,166
Tends to leave folks
vulnerable to attack.

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,458
[MAN 7A] Hassan!
Take a look at these robes!

45
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,791
This guy's...

46
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,375
A Sanzo priest?

47
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,291
Oh. Yeah, that's right.

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,875
But... He seems sorta young,
don't'cha think?

49
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,541
Could be he's just a beggar
done up in fancy dress.

50
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,750
Get your hands off of me.

51
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,666
We'll lead these guys
to HQ. Watch your backs.

52
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,666
Wait, you sure?

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,083
Come with us to the temple.

54
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,958
We've got some medicine
for the altitude sickness.

55
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,416
That'd be nice, but who
are you again?

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
The Kouten Corps.

57
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,916
We're Sanzo Sharak's
support squad.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,541
Good to meet'cha, gents.

59
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,875
[GOKU]
Whoa. It's like a secret base!

60
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,666
I'm good.

61
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,083
Can you walk on your own?

62
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,000
Huh. That concoction they
gave us worked like a charm.

63

[GOJYO]
If you don't mind wantin'

64
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,916
to rip your own tongue
out afterwards.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,583
[HASSAN]
Sanzo Sharak.

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,750
The pilgrims have been brought.

67
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,916
[gasps] A chick?

68
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,583
What?

69
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,083
[SHARAK laughs]

70
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,291
Pleased to meet you.
Sanzo Sharak, 28th in Arhat.

71
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,916
Yeah, Sanzo Genjo,

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
31st in China,
at your service.

73
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,708
You've traveled quite a ways.

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,208
Allow me to welcome you
and your companions to the West.

75
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,083
I didn't know Sanzo
priests could be--

76
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,333
Shush.

77
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,458
They certainly came out
with their guns drawn.

78
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,458
Was that a dad joke?

79
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,708
[SHARAK] I've locked in on
the dark aura's source.

80
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,791
It's what we expected.

81
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,958
[SANZO] The Gyumaou Resurrection
Experiment, right?

82
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,041
[SHARAK]
Right.

83
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,583
You'd think as the
highest-ranking

84
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,916
priest in the West I'd be in
a position to do something.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,791
March into Houtou Castle
and shut it down.

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,958
But lo and behold,
the Sanbutsushin say no.

87
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,458
Apparently, it's important
to sit on my ass here,

88
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,625
protecting locals from demons.

89
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,125
Was this region hit hard?

90
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,791
Ha. You even have to ask?

91
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,916
Couple of nights after
the initial incident,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,375
demons went to town, literally.

93
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,250
The devastation was immense.

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,708
Smaller settlements got lucky,

95
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,166
but all the larger ones
were totally decimated.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,208
There's a hot zone
to the west of us.

97
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,666
One of the highest
concentrations

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,166
of demons in the region.

99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,541
Villagers unfortunate
enough to call it home

100
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,750
live in abject terror.

101
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,583
Hardly ever venture
more than few feet

102
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,291
from their doorstep.

103
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,416
It's our job to protect them.

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,125
We patrol regularly to make
our presence known,

105
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,125
trying to maintain some
aspect of law and order.

106
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,000
At the end of the day,
the Kouten Scripture

107
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sworn to defend
till my dying breath

108
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,500
is what governs our resistance.

109
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,333
[HASSAN] Chang'an, huh?
Must've been a rough journey.

110
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,833
I'm more n' little impressed
you're still alive.

111
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,291
No disrespect.

112
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,583
Do you mind if I enquire
to the frequency

113
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,583
with which this temple
is set upon by demons?

114
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,791
[HASSAN]
Oh, uh, actually,

115
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,291
the building is protected
by an invisible barrier

116
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
generated from
the Kouten Scripture.

117
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,958
Demons can't get in.
Shields nearby towns, too.

118
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,833
You're telling me
Sanzo Sharak can project

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,375
a force field that big
all by her lonesome?

120
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,708
That's impressive.

121
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,583
[HASSAN] Well, to be fair,
she uses mediums, too.

122
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,291
Wait, what's that mean?

123
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,166
[HASSAN]
Think radio waves.

124
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,208
The altar fittings scattered
across the region

125
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,166
act as receivers.

126
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,750
See, the bell in our
shrine emits holy power,

127
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,083
artifacts in other shrines
boost the signal.

128
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,916
The relay's strong enough
that demons can't get through.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,416
Our temple's safe, the
surrounding villages are safe.

130
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,750
You get the idea.

131
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,958
Yes, indeed. So I presume
that's why Sanzo Sharak

132
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,125
isn't permitted
to leave the area?

133
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,791
There are five
Founding Scriptures

134
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,541
of Heaven and Earth.
My predecessor carried two.

135
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,166
Maten and Seiten were entrusted
to Sanzo Koumyou.

136
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,333
There ought to have been four
of our kind in this generation.

137
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,250
One of them was
killed by a demon,

138
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,416
eaten while trekking
through the desert.

139
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,958
Sadly, he carried
the Uten Scripture,

140
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,166
now in possession of
Gyumaou's followers.

141
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,583
Word has the Seiten
Scripture that was stolen

142
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,458
shortly after Sanzo Koumyou died

143
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,833
has also fallen
into their hands.

144
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,125
By my reckoning, I believe
there are three of us

145
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,416
left alive to carry the
remaining scriptures,

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,791
are there not?

147
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,291
One of them has had
a change of heart.

148
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,541
The Muten Scripture was
bequeathed to one Sanzo Ukoku,

149
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,250
who, well, who now resides in
Houtou Castle of all places.

150
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,291
He's a bio technician on
the Resurrection Project.

151
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,333
What? No.

152
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,333
[SANZO] His true motives
for aiding the demons

153
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,000
is as yet unknown, but one
thing is beyond a doubt...

154
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,708
[SANZO]
He's no longer one of us.

155
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,166
What I'm hearing is
that there are only

156
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,958
two scriptures the enemy
doesn't have in their grip.

157
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,708
The Maten Scripture
currently in my possession,

158
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,000
and the Kouten
Scripture in yours.

159
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,333
Seems we're the last holdouts.

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,041
Huh. Sobering thought.

161
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,583
Damn it.

162
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,875
The five scriptures together are
said to have immense power.

163
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,291
Enough to create new worlds.

164
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,833
Makes sense.

165
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,166
So, the only reason demons
consistently attempt

166
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,708
to infiltrate the temple is
to grab the Kouten Scripture

167
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,541
and dissolve the
barrier protecting us

168
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,333
and the surrounding villages
from their attack. Great.

169
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
[SANZO] Three scriptures
are more than enough

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,375
to do some damage.

171
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,250
As long as Ukoku
is on their side,

172
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
harnessing that power
won't be an issue.

173
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,041
Whatever made him feel
the need to join them,

174
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,166
we won't shame our title.

175
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,958
We'll keep what's left
out of their reach.

176
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,208
Roughly two years ago,

177
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,458
the Sanbutsushin told me
they'd ordered the heir

178
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,583
of the Maten Scripture
to travel West

179
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,125
and subdue Gyumaou
once and for all.

180
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,833
He was a monk ten years
my junior, they said.

181
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,500
The youngest to ever
hold the title,

182
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,666
let alone the Seiten Scripture.

183
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,583
So, now it's been made
off with by demons, is it?

184
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,750
I was half expecting you
to bite it on the way here.

185
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,333
Congratulations.

186
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,125
You and you buddies have
been on one hell of a trip.

187
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,083
Job well done.

188
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,958
[SANZO]
Hmph.

189
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,416
We're just getting
to the good part.

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,666
[gasps] Oh, no.

191

He's been in there a long time.

192
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,125
Well, I'm certain they have
much to discuss.

193
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,416
It isn't every day that
such high-ranking priests

194
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
get a chance to talk shop
with one of their own.

195
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,000
True that.

196
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,458
Not to mention it's been forever

197
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,958
since Genjo's been alone
with the fairer sex.

198

[GOKU]
Can I just go and check on him?

199

[HAKKAI]
Don't you dare.

200
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,416
I'll have you know
that Sanzo Sharak

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,083
has transcended
gender in service

202
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,916
to a profoundly higher calling.

203

[GOJYO]
Whatever, dude.

[GOJYO grunts] What is it about
priests that make 'em think

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,041
they're above romanc--? [groans]

214
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
I have to admit, Genjo,

215
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,125
your followers are a rather
amusing bunch.

216

[SANZO] Feel free to
take 'em off my hands.

217

Amusing is about all
they're good at.

218
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,708
Help you?

219
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,250
Nah. I'm good. Just glad we
made it all the way here.

What?

221
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,958
So, I'm assuming you've
got some sort of plan.

222
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,708
Whatever you fine gentlemen
might need in terms of food

223

or weaponry, we're more
than happy to supply.

224
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,375
Some modest provisions
and an updated map

225
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,875
of the area would be nice.

Hassan.

227
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,208
We do have a fairly
recent map lying around,

228
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,958
I just wouldn't swear
to it accuracy.

229
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,083
The incident did a real number
on the local geography.

230

We haven't strayed
far enough West

to make revisions since then.

232
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,375
That will have to do,
though I wonder if we could

233
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
impose on you for an evening's
lodging as well?

234
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,625
I'd just as soon let you
rest here for three nights.

00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,916
Is there anyone else that
can't make a run for it

316
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,375
on their own?

317
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,375
[MAN 7G] Uh, there's
another one over here!

318
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,166
[GOKU]
Got 'em!

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,833
[SHARAK]
Let's go! Everybody, follow me!

320
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,000
Hold the children close,
keep 'em covered!

321
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,000
[MAN 7F]
Uh. Okay!

322
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,750
[DEMON 7R groans]

323
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,125
[gunshot]

324
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,500
Looks like the villagers
are already headed this way.

325
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,458
[GOJYO]
Can we be done, please?

326
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,250
Hey, what're we waitin' for,
Sanzo? Clean house!

327
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,083
Don't talk to me
like I'm your maid.

328
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,291
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

329
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,916
[SHARAK, SANZO]
Om! Manihatsumeiun.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,791
Makai Tenjo!

331
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,291
Ra sati unu is!

332
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,750
[DEMONS gasping]

333
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,791
[MAN 7H] The villagers
whose homes were lost

334
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,958
have been moved out
of harm's way.

335
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,125
The fire's been successfully
extinguished.

336
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,541
The rebuilding effort will start
first thing in the morning.

337
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,416
[SHARAK]
Thank you. Well done.

338
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,291
Ugh. I tell you to rest
then turn right around

339
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,708
and put you to work.

340
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,541
Eh. We're all in the same boat.

341
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,125
No rest for the wicked,
am I right?

342
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
[SHARAK]
Yeah.

343
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Here I am, able to
single-handedly carve a chunk

344
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,958
out of the demon hoards,
and I'm forced to stay put.

345
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,541
Something tells me they're
finally catching on.

346
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,041
You could've put a stop to
this mess all on your own.

347
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,041
But channeling
your strength 24/7

348
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,833
to boost the Scripture's power?
Must be exhausting.

349
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,958
[SHARAK] You don't know the half
of it.

350
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,416
Ideally, I'd like to spread
enough receivers

351
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,541
to extend the barrier throughout
the entire region.

352
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,916
Trouble is...

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,750
[HAKKAI]
I see your problem.

354
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,250
By doing so, you'd potentially
feed into the idea

355
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,416
that demons don't exist.

356
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,416
[SHARAK] If we were talking
natural selection,

357
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,166
that'd be one thing. But the
"mess" we're in is man-made.

358
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,125
The wholesale elimination
of one side

359
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,125
would have consequences
impossible to foresee.

360
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,625
Count on it.

361
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,791
Well, that's a relief.

362
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,583
The last high-ranking priest
is actually a decent person.

363
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,041
Don't'cha think, Sanzo?

364
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,833
There a reason you're aiming
that question at me?

365
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,375
Is anybody else, like, confused
that we have two "Sanzos" now?

366
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,625
I mean, is it like
a job title or what?

367
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,458
I'll admit it's a trifle odd.

368
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,041
We might as well have
been referring to you

369
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,125
as "general manager"
this whole time.

370
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,708
If we're going that route,
call me CEO.

371
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,916
Long as you don't expect
us to use "Genjo."

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,583
Way too awkward.
What about "Joe?"

373
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,958
[GOKU laughs]
Lame!

374
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,375
[HAKKAI]
I have to agree.

375
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,166
Why not something fun like
"Chief," or "Hoss"?

376
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,500
[SANZO] Here's a better idea:
"Idiot's Bane."

377
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,208
[laughs] Oh, my. Say what
you will, Genjo sweetheart,

378
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,791
your friends are nothing
if not entertaining.

379
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,750
Please don't encourage them.

380
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
'Scuse the interruption,
friends.

381
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,125
We're handing out rice
to the refugees

382
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,416
if you'd like to help us.

383
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,750
Hey, there's a decent square
meal in it for ya.

384
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,500
Ooh! Count me in!

385
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,583
If there's any way we
can be of assistance,

386
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
consider us on the task.

387
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,541
[HASSAN]
Appreciate it.

388
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,875
Tell you what: when we're done,
let's grab a drink.

389
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,375
I got the good stuff.

390
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,000
Hey, Sharak.
Mind if I have a word?

391
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,541
[GOKU]
Do you guys have soda?!

392
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,333
[HAKKAI] Much obliged.
One gets so tired of butter tea.

393
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,125
[HASSAN] So, uh, what were
you and that Genjo fella

394
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,291
talkin' about earlier?

395
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,000
Work, for the most part.

396
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,083
I'm not sure whether
you realize this or not,

397
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,375
but combing two or more
scriptures in unison

398
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,791
is capable of forging entirely
new fighting techniques.

399
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
I knew that.

400
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,916
Never seen it done
before, though.

401
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,041
[SHARAK]
That makes both of us.

402
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,166
Why do you suppose Sanzo
priests are so spread out?

403
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,291
Our masters like to keep
things predictable.

404
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,416
Today, Genjo and I
accidentally evoked

405
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
our powers at the same time.

406
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,125
We were standing at
a safe distance.

407
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,083
So, you felt the same thing?

408
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,625
I did. Strong, but subtle.

409
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,833
Like the scriptures
were resonating.

410
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,333
[SANZO]
The Maten and Kouten in tune.

411
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,291
Imagine if we were
standing closer.

412
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,958
What sort of new power would
their intertwining give rise to?

413
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,291
The Founding Scriptures
of Heaven and Earth.

414
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Not everything they can
do is necessarily good.

415
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,083
Meaning we ought to
follow the time-tested

416
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,833
wisdom of tradition and
keep the pieces separated.

417
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,625
Better safe than sorry.

418
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,166
Still, though, aren't you a
little curious? I mean, c'mon.

419
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:09,750
[SANZO]
Hm?

420
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,833
Nothing.

421
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,750
[SANZO]
No. You said what I'm thinking.

422
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,333
[SHARAK] You and the men'll
start rebuilding

423
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,500
tomorrow morning, yeah?

424
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,583
If you need more resources
or manpower,

425
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,625
I can probably convince
our guests--

426
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,750
[SHARAK]
Don't.

427
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,041
We're perfect for each other.

428
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,083
[HASSAN groans]

429
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,208
How many times do I have
to drill it into you skull

430
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,583
not to look at me
like a woman?

431
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,083
Aw, c'mon! Why you always
gotta be that way?!

432
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,291
I don't care if you're a
high-ranking priest or demon,

433
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,041
how if feel is how I feel!

434
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,416
[SHARAK]
How you feel is absurd.

435
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,750
[sighs]

436
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,666
[GOKU] You're really
into Sharak, aren't ya?

437
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,916
[gasps]

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,958
My bad. I got lost on
the way to the bathroom

439
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,750
and heard voices coming from
in here, so, I thought, yeah.

440
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,875
[sighs] No, it's fine.

441
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,041
And, the bathroom's
just down the hall.

442
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,583
[GOKU]
Hey.

443
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,750
If you're worried about Sanzo
and Sharak becoming a thing,

444
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,500
I don't think it's like that.

445
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,958
[HASSAN] Mm? Wha--
What're you talkin' about, kid?

446
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,666
[GOKU]
I've known him for a while.

447
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,291
Since before we set
out on this journey.

448
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,833
Here's the deal:
we're definitely his friends

449
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,458
and everything,
it's just he's a priest.

450
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,625
Noble calling, sure. But lonely.

451
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208
'S gotta be.

452
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm sure Sharak could
tell you all about it.

453
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,416
Sanzo's special.

454
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
There aren't a lot of
people who can relate

455
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,333
to what he's been through.

456
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,833
The chance to meet
someone who knows

457
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,833
where he's coming from,
someone who'll let him unload

458
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,208
all the stuff he keeps
bottled up. That's rare.

459
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,458
Guess what I'm sayin' is that he
only sees Sharak as a friend.

460
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,083
Well there's no denyin' he's a
lucky man to have you as one.

461
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
[gasps]

462
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,166
[HASSAN] Me an' Sharak met way
back in her training days.

463
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,500
I've been head-over-heels since.

464
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,291
[HASSAN]
'Course she's out of my league.

465
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,583
I told myself I'd make do
keeping her safe,

466
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,000
just to stay close.

467
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,541
You see how that works.

468
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,458
I can't keep it together when
she talks to another man.

469
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,000
Forget about one she can
genuinely relate to.

470
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,916
I'm an idiot...

471
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,250
[GOJYO]
What's takin' him so long?

472
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,708
I need to piss so bad
my teeth are floatin'.

473
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,291
Well, given how difficult
this building is to navigate

474
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,916
he may very well
have gotten lost.

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,375
[GOJYO]
Ugh. I'll go look for him.

476
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,625
[gasping]

477
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,833
[HAKKAI]
Are you okay?

478
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,208
[GOJYO]
No, yeah. Heh.

479
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,625
Just been a while since
I've indulged. Heh...

480
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,875
Your neck!

481
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,833
[grunts] Yeah, what about it?

482
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,291
Oh. Never mind.
Thought I saw something.

483
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,500
[HAKKAI]
Where did that come from...?

484
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,583
Forgive me for what
I'm about to do.

485
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm sorry! There was
no other choice!

486
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,500
[bell tolls]

487
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,750
[SHARAK gasps]

488
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,000
[SANZO]
Hm?

489
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:56,833
What the...?

490
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,583
Somethin' wrong?

491
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,083
[SHARAK] Impossible.

492
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:04,041
The Kouten Barrier.
It's been broken!

493
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,458
So it begins.

494
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,625
[SHARAK] Episode eight:
"Barrier." Don't miss it.

495
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,041
[GROUP]
Ura Sai.

496
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,708
[ALL eating]

497
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:00,875
[GOJYO, SANZO, HAKKAI groan]

498
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,500
[GOJYO]
Why do I keep eating?!

499
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,375
[GOKU groans]

500
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,083
[SANZO, GOJYO]
Delayed reaction!

501
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,333
[HAKKAI]
Off we go!
