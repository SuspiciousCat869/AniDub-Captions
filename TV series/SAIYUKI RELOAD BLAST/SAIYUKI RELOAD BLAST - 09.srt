For heaven's sake are you

Get up and do something!

Heh. Sorry I'm not

I will shake this pariah

Oh, yeah. Totally knew that.

I know what it is to go berserk.

161
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,083
Gojyo was there to check me.

00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,208
[HAKKAI] Will I be able
to return the favor?

It's Goku!

We have to get back to the

[SANZO]
I though you wanted to end this.

173
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,750
Way to be a hypocrite.

174
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,291
If that's all you can manage,
killing me isn't in your future.

175
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,666
What's the deal?

176
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,583
Not to be facetious,
but frankly I expected better.

177
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,125
[KOUGAIJI] He's shielding
himself with the scripture!

178
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,875
[KOUGAIJI] You're mad!
Why would you go that far?

179
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,708
[SANZO]
You really have to ask?

180
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,375
I think the real question here,
is why wouldn't you?

181
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,583
Impossible!

182
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,666
He shouldn't be able to move!

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,541
[SANZO] You could've
finished me, you know.

184
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:22,125
That move was enough to
put me in the ground.

185
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,458
Trouble is, it skewed
slightly off target

186
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,625
instead of hitting me dead-on.

187
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,208
I was essentially helpless,

188
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,958
yet you hesitated
just long enough

189
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,500
to let my instincts kick in
and dodge the strike.

190

Silence!

[SANZO] That's always been
your problem, hasn't it?

193

You don't commit.

You always second-guess yourself

when what a bad guy needs
to do is go all-in.

196

It's why you'll never stand
a chance of defeating us.

I wanted just to say thank you.

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,708
You gave my life meaning.

322
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,291
Wish I had better words.
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,666
That's all I could
think of at the moment.

324
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,708
Please! Don't do this.
Just stop!

325
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,000
C'mon, don't cry.

326
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,833
[GOJYO]
I'm not crying.

327
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,333
Screw you.

Episode ten: "Imperial Order."

331
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,875
Don't miss it.
