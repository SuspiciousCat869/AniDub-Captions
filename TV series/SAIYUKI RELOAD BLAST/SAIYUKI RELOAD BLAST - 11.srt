1
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,166
Hey! Cut the BS already, huh?

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,375
What's the deal with you lately?
You tryin' to start somethin'?

3
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,958
Screw work-shopping your
joke delivery, jackass.

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,250
Learn how to lie.

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,666
[GOJYO groaning]
Let go of my hair!

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,000
Hold up, Gojyo.

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,791
You've got something
on your neck.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,250
Like, a weird-looking mark.

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,791
Initializing deployment now.

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:23,708
So, yeah. That's, um,
a demon mark, I guess.

11
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,458
Did he have to know?

12
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,875
No point trying to keep
it under wraps.

13
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,458
What he knows doesn't
change the reality.

14
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,541
[GOKU] Man. When'd you go
berserk? Was it recent?

15
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,250
Nobody's gone berserk!
Son of a bitch.

16
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,041
Why'd it have to pop up
somewhere I can't even see?

17
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,541
Oh, god. Please tell me
it doesn't look lame.

18
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:47,833
Well, actually. It's kind
of swirly. Like, ice cream.

19
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,583
Yeah. That's it.
Or maybe frozen yogurt.

20
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,416
Let's not over-generalize.

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,375
It's more like an
artesian gelato cone.

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,875
You guys are not helping at all!

23
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,875
Damn it. Of all the times
for this stupid thing

24
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,625
to make an appearance.

25
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,083
[SANZO] It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,666
You're half demon,
there's no denying that fact.

27
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,458
Hakkai called it if you ask me.

28
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,375
Simply put, the further
West we've come

29
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,708
the more susceptible you are
to the dark aura's power.

30
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,500
Wait, but how come his ears
aren't all pointy and stuff?

31
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,291
He doesn't look like
a demon to me.

32
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,375
More like one of those gym bros,
with a tribal tattoo.

33
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,083
[GOJYO] What tribe, exactly?
The Ice Cream Men?

34
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,250
Look. It's fine. Any way you
slice it, I'm not a real demon.

35
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,083
We have no idea what it'll do.

36
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,708
I'm a half-blood, so it'll
probably be half-assed.

37
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,416
[HAKKAI]
Precisely my concern.

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,375
The effect will manifest
in ways we can't foresee.

39
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,083
It behooves us to
plan for catastrophe.

40
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,416
Wow, man. 'Preciate the
vote of confidence.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,375
We get canned, now this crap?

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,833
Next you'll be tellin' me you
agree with the Sanbutsushin.

43
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,416
Not so long ago I'd have said

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,750
you were crazy for thinking
that. I wish I still could.

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,000
We've come so far, though.

46
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,625
[HAKKAI] Like it or not,
we've been summarily

47
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,041
relieved of our mission.

48
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,916
There is no earthly reason
for us to proceed further.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,833
Especially if you're at risk.

50
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,583
Why plunge forward
into the unknown

51
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,875
if we don't have to?

52
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,791
Ah, so now I'm a liability,
is that it?

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,583
What about you,
Mister Mansplain?

54
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,750
If we're talkin' about
who might go ape shit.

55
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,291
Last time I checked, you and me
were in the same boat.

56
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,416
As a demon I'm a known
quantity, more or less.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,916
Besides, this is your first
encounter with the aura.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's a factor.

59
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
I see. You're good
and I'm not, huh?

60
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,416
Bravo! Way to be
a selfish prick!

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,208
[HAKKAI]
Oh, I'm selfish now, am I?

62
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,000
Better than an irrational prick.

63
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,041
Hey! Knock it off,
you two! I mean it!

64
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,291
Fine.

65
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,541
I suppose I'll just come
right out and say it.

66
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,291
If the worst-case scenario
happened, heaven forbid,

67
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,416
I couldn't be the one
to put you down.

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,958
[gasping]

69
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,000
[HAKKAI]
Let's assume you do go berserk.

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,000
What happens when we cross
the point of no return?

71
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,791
Sanzo could kill you.

72
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,458
No doubt he'd oblige you
with a bullet

73
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,666
between your eyes
without much ado.

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,583
In which case, he and
I would be at odds.

75
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,625
I wouldn't just stand there and
watch him pull the trigger.

76
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,125
Let's assume Goku or
myself had to be put down.

77
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,083
Could you let Sanzo do
what was necessary?

78
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,833
[HAKKAI]
You're not wrong.

79
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,125
We are in the same boat
as far as being subject

80
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,833
to the aura's influence.

81
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,000
But given that,
shouldn't we play it safe?

82
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,375
Why should our friends
contend with two liabilities?

83
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,791
What a well thought-out
and compelling argued opinion.

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,666
[GOKU]
Sanzo!

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,375
Well, thank you, but to
be fair, in the end

86
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,666
I'm every bit as selfish as
Gojyo accuses me of being.

87
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,083
Weak, pathetic. Whatever you
have a mind to call me, really.

88
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,916
Sanzo and I have our
own ways of dealing

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,958
with worst-case scenarios.

90
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,833
To each his own when the
chips are down I guess.

91
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,833
[inaudible]

92
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,458
[gasps] Kanan!

93
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,500
[HAKKAI] I'd have given
anything to see her live.

94
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,833
Anything.

95
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,000
But dwelling on regret
gets us nowhere fast.

96
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,041
Believe me.

97
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,083
[GOJYO]
Eh... Whatever.

98
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,958
You really expect me to shrug
my shoulders and be all like

99
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,166
"yeah, you know what,
good point.

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,416
Best be on my
way now, losers?"

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,416
Never crossed my mind, honestly.

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,583
I know you too well. Being
reasonable isn't your forte.

103
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,833
[GOJYO]
Seriously?!

104
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,250
Then what the Hell have
you been babbling about

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,166
for the past five minutes?!

106
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,583
You act like the worst-case
scenario's already happened!

107
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,500
[HAKKAI] You're missing
the point entirely!

108
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,833
That's enough.

109
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,458
Both of you, get out
before I go berserk.

110
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,583
Excuse me?

111
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,916
[SANZO]
I'm done listening to you bitch.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you're gonna throw a fit
over what's on your neck,

113
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,833
go home to Chang'an and start
a frozen yogurt stand.

114
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,958
You're holding us back.
Piss off.

115
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,208
Awkward.

116
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,875
Your talent for verbally abusing
us never ceases to amaze me.

117
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,458
Well, too bad your attempts
at being cavalier

118
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,958
aren't as convincing.

119
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,125
We all know out of all
of us the one person

120
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
in the group that needs
a healer is you.

121
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,041
I'll take my chances, dumbass.

122
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,083
[GOJYO] Where do you get off
talking to him like that,

123
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,000
you glorified eunuch?!

124
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,750
[SANZO]
I wonder...

125
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,666
[GOJYO groans, coughs]

126
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,333
[SANZO] If you were worth
wasting the ammo,

127
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,166
I'd blow a hole in your head.

128
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,666
[GOJYO]
That's it.

129
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,750
Insult the guy who's got a way
better hairline than you.

130
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,541
[GOKU]
Ah!

131
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,833
You're dead.

132
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,041
[GOJYO groans]

133
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,500
Oh, is that a fact
now, cue ball?

134
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,875
[SANZO groans]

135
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,583
[GOJYO]
Piece of...

136
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,666
Easy! C'mon, are you
just gonna sit there?

137
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,250
If they want to act like idiots,

138
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,958
let them get it out
of their system.

139
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,250
What?! They can't keep
going at it like this!

140
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,041
They'll destroy each other!
Cut it out!

141
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,750
[SANZO]
Shut up!

142
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,791
Stay out of this, monkey boy!

143
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,333
You jerks! Why'd you
go and do that?!

144
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,125
[GOKU groans]

145
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,750
Now I'm ticked!

146
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,375
[GOKU, GOJYO, SANZO grunting]

147
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,416
[GOJYO, GOKU, SANZO]
What the...?

148
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,500
[ALL groan]

00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,916
So, in his language that
means "get the Hell out."

151

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,875
Seriously, you guys.

154
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,375
When did Hakuryu get to
be the levelheaded one?

155
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,666
[laughs]

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,916
Talk about perspective.

At this rate the four of
us are cruisin' to fulfill

158
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,750
that prophecy what's-her-name
spewed out.

159
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,625
Much as I respect divination,

160
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,250
that's not my idea
of a good time.

Forgive me, but...

[SHARAK]
These demons...

164
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,750
They're not like the others we
tend to run across nowadays.

165
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,750
They'd never harm a soul.

166
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,500
I, uh, can't help but notice.

167
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,000
There aren't quite as
many of you now.

168

[MAN 11A]
Yes.

169
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,291
Our population has
decreased by half.

170
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,208
Faithful as we try to be.

171
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,041
Our kind can only resist
the dark aura for so long,

172
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
and even then it's a fight.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,041
Strong though our
brothers were in belief.

174
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,333
They fought, and they lost.

175
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,416
Far be it from me to ply
you with false hope.

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,458
But certain steps are
currently being taken

177
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,916
to extinguish the dark
aura at its source.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,041
With luck, your struggle
to keep the madness

179
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,083
at bay won't have
been for nothing.

Endure as best you can,

That's encouraging news!

We can all hold out a
little longer, right?

185
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,916
[SHARAK]
And him?

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,250
The child, Prince Nataku,
Heaven's war god?

187
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,250
What if he comes back?

188
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,625
According to Genjo, he singles
out demons mercilessly.

189
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,000
And suppose their kin who've
succumbed stage a raid?

190
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
This village would be helpless.

191
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,958
Strengthening the barrier
would be wise.

192

If you'd prefer, I'd be more
than happy to give it a boost.

00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
Thank you! That'd be wonderful!

194

Your kindness and
generosity allows us

195
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,500
to thrive in our own humble way,

196
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,625
despite the misfortune that
has befallen our comrades.

197
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,250
Because of you, Sharak,
we live in peace.

198
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,041
Thank your own
considerable strength

199

[SHARAK]
I can't have children of my own.

203
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,916
Motherhood wasn't in the cards.

204

This is the next best thing.

For their children.

What I don't understand is why
you wouldn't just say something.

I don't know. I suppose I was
waiting for the right moment.

Knowing about the mark

243
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,875
might've pushed you
over the edge.

244
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,041
I didn't wanna chance it.
Emotional unrest is a trigger.

underway can twist you.

In the midst of battle,
for example.

You begin to wonder
what your capacity

for bloodshed really means.

00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,750
You start thinking,
"maybe I'm already a demon.

Maybe it happened
right under my nose."

[SHARAK]
Whatever he is,

clearly we've made an enemy
of something horrible.

318
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,291
Hassan. Eijin. Roshu.

319
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,958
Sharak's got your back.
Understood?

Humans are hereby advised
to choose their fate.

324
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,375
Leave at once or die.

325
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,791
Not much of a choice,
is it? Heh, sorry, kid!

326

What we lack in numbers,
we make up for in skill.

329
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,750
To underestimate
the Kouten Corps,

330
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,541
is to gamble with your
own fate. Aum!

What have you done?!

338
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,333
I repeat myself.

339
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,708
The humans among you
who fail to withdraw

340
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,041
will be treated as targets.

341

[SHARAK] He's a soldier,
just as Genjo said.

342
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,750
This attack isn't an
expression of his will.

343
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,833
He isn't driven by
his own momentum.

344
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,541
No. He's only a puppet.

345
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,583
A machine programmed to kill.

346
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,708
Target locked.

[GOJYO] Ah. Thought we heard
somebody starin' some shit.

349
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,583
Who went and threw a party
without invitin' us?

350
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,291
Didn't figure we were
the type to crash?

351
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,625
The weirdos are here.

352
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,083
Good on them for timing.

353
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,125
Come on down.

354
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,208
I'd explain,
but it'd take too long.

355
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,250
Oh, that's quite all right.

356
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,666
I'm fairly certain we
have the gist of it.

357
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,666
This must be our replacement.

358
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,250
Greetings, Prince Nataku.

359
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,041
Best of luck thwarting the
Resurrection Experiment.

360
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,583
We've heard great
things about you.

361
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,083
[SANZO]
Sorry for the late introduction.

362
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
Names Sanzo Genjo,

363
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,416
31st in China, at your service.

364
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,541
These are my boys.

365
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,458
[GOJYO]
What's with you?

366
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,625
[sighs]

367
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,458
It's nothin'. I'm good. I
thought maybe I knew this guy,

368
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,583
but there's no way
we could've ever met.

369
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,708
Huh?!

370
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,916
Humans are advised
to take their leave.

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,208
Withdraw or die.

372
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,500
No.

373
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,708
Two new enemy
combatants confirmed.

374
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,708
Wait, what the hell?

375
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,916
If I heard correctly,

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,750
we've been identified
as the enemy.

377
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,000
If that ain't luck,
I don't know what is.

378
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,125
We're under no
obligation here, guys.

379
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,208
Friendly or not, keeping
these demons safe

380
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,625
isn't our responsibility.
That said...

381
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,750
No, we get you.

382
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,166
This little bastard's
the whole reason

383
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,625
the four of us got the axe.

384
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,125
Yeah, gotta admit,

385
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,250
I'm curious to see if he's
the better man for the job.

386
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,250
I do hope that Your
Highness will indulge us

387
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,125
with an unflagging
show of strength.

388
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,791
Please tell me this isn't
turning into a grudge match.

389
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,958
[SHARAK]
Careful.

390
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,125
This might come off
like you're picking

391
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,750
on someone a fraction
of your age.

393
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,875
These four will be neutralized.

not all that bad.

If the beam had hit us dead on,

we'd be a pile of ash right now.

Ah, as I suspected,
they're shikigami.

can't find their medium?

don't you agree?

Whatever. If he put
something weird in here,

I'll shoot him in the face.

this is, but yum!

It's way too heavy.

What are you talking about?
It's delicious!
