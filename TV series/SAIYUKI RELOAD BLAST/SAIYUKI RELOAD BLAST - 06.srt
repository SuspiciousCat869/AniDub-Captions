General Kenren
of the Western Army

322
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,000
and Field Marshal Tenpou
are confirmed neutralized.

323
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,125
Mission accomplished, my lord!

324
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,250
Wait, but what does that mean?

325
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,541
What did you do to them?
Where are they?

326
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,666
[GOKU whimpers]

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,708
Feel me? It's a pinky promise.

328
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,791
This way,
you know it's for real.

329
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,875
Okay. I suppose it's official.

330
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,416
Looks as though we're
going to be together

331
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,833
for a long time.

332
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,458
You lied to me.

333
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,750
[KONZEN]
We'll meet again.

334
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,041
Just look for us beneath
the cherry blossoms.

335
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,291
It was all... a lie!

336
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,000
[LI TOUTEN]
What the...?!

[KONZEN grunting]

340
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,458
[KONZEN] Earth is just on
the other side of that light.

[groaning]

342
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,708
No! Konzen!

343
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,500
Don't worry about me. I'm okay.

344
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,583
Focus on the dimension gate.

345
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,625
[GOKU gasps]
It's open! We made it!

346
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,208
[KONZEN] Earth is waiting
for you, my friend.

347
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,250
Can you run?

348
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,541
[GOKU]
Yeah!

349
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,333
[KONZEN]
I'm not a fool.

350
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,083
There's no guarantee of
hope beyond the light.

351
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,666
I've known that
from the beginning.

352
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,958
It's possible only
pain awaits you.

353
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,458
But if there's even
a chance at happiness,

354
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,583
I will do everything in
my power to get you there.

355
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:33,916
[LI TOUTEN] Miserable vermin.
I will not be mocked!

Damn it! We've got to move!

[laughs]

359
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,458
Hope is a lost cause!
Run as fast as you can!

360
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,166
The light will always
be beyond your grasp!

[gags]

362
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,666
[GOKU]
Almost there!

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,666
No!

364
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,958
We can make it! Don't give up!

00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,875
[KONZEN] Aren't cherry blossoms
the same everywhere?

367
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,458
[KENREN] Nah, depends on
where they live.

368
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:08,250
[KONZEN] Is that a fact? I'll
have to see them for myself.

Don't stop! You have to
keep moving! [groans]

No! [grunting]

Goku!

379
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,208
[KONZEN]
Think back.

380
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,083
When me met,
you were the first one

381
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,291
to reach out your hand.

382
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,166
Konzen.

383
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,208
[KONZEN]
The next time we meet,

384
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,250
I'll be the one reaching
out to you.

385
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,875
Listen to me.
We will meet again.

386
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,875
[KONZEN]
Just remember,

387
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,541
I'm not the sun. You are.

388
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,875
[GOKU grunting, cries]

389
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,083
[NATAKU] In the end,
we all dream of someday

390
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,666
reaching the light.

391
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,458
The question is,

392
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,000
will it have been worth it?

393
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,666
Go... ku...

394
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,625
[KANZEON] A few days later,
the royal garden's

395
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,500
cherry blossoms,
meant to bloom eternal,

396
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,791
fell softly to the ground.

397
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,083
Some say the petals
were trying to follow

398
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,916
Goku and his friends.

399
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,041
[KANZEON]
My goodness.

400
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,333
How long do you plan
on staying there?

401
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,125
[KANZEON] The child lay
were Konzen left him,

402
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,666
huddled before
the dimensional gate.

403
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,000
He'd scarcely moved a muscle
since seeing my nephew die.

404
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,541
There he waited like a stone.

405
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,083
By rights,
you ought to be dead.

406
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,250
A normal body would have
succumbed to starvation.

407
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,375
Come, that's not what
you want. Or is it?

408
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,750
You are not Seiten Taisei.

409
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,625
You are Goku. No one else.

410
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,458
The only name you'll
bear is the way

411
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,541
Konzen saw fit to give you.

412
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,041
"He who sees
what others cannot."

413
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,041
I trust you see how it is you
come by the luxury of despair?

414
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,750
You were brought here
on the back of sacrifice!

415
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,791
Waste that sacrifice and
disgrace not only yourself,

416
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,666
but the death of your friends!

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,791
[screams]

418
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,000
[KANZEON]
You've endured so much pain.

419
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,083
I speak for those who cannot.

420
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,125
Konzen, Tenpou, Kenren.

421
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,583
I knew their hearts.
Let me be their voice.

422
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,916
They loved you.

423
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,250
Never doubt it for a moment.

424
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,416
[screams]

425
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,458
[KANZEON]
Five hundred years of solitude.

426
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,875
Such was Heaven's
justice for the boy.

427
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,958
Every last vestige of paradise
was erased from his mind.

428
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,541
He would remember nothing.

429
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:04,166
Yet for all that, one memory
refused to be cast out.

430
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,041
[KANZEON] Why it persisted
I can only surmise.

431
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,916
Though something tells me
his name played a part.

432
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,208
Five centuries have
since passed.

433
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,000
Nataku is nowhere to be found.

434
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,583
Something is stirring.
I can feel it.

435
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,750
[HAKKAI]
I'd say it's time we get going.

[GOKU grunts]

comes the storm.
