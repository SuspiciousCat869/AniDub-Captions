1
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,458
[GOJYO]
It's been four days.

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,916
Excellent news. Repairs to the
compound appear to be complete.

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Huh. That's somethin'.
And Sanzo's okay?

4
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,958
Well, the herbs are
certainly numbing his pain.

5
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,458
He's fast asleep
for the time being.

6
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,458
The burns should heal
up soon enough, but...

7
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,458
...the real issue
is his right arm.

8
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,333
Whether or not he's
able to move it again,

9
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,208
the recovery process
will be difficult.

10
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,083
Who'd have ever thought
Kougaiji and his goons

11
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,583
were the ones behind this?

12
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,833
Indeed.

13
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,916
A rather uncharacteristically
devious attack.

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
No clue who this Kougaiji
fellow is supposed to be,

15
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,541
but he sounds delightful.

16
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,250
What concerns me more
at the moment

17
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,750
is our mystery
guest from Heaven.

18
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,250
Only Genjo managed to
get a good look at him.

19
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,041
Whoever it was, he was a kid.

20
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,875
Just, not like any kid
I've ever laid eyes on.

21
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,166
Apparently, the power
he wielded was amazing.

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,208
Burning through demons

23
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,541
like a cold-blooded
killing machine.

24
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,041
Genjo said it seemed like
he was carrying out orders

25
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:45,500
from on high, but from who
exactly, I don't know.

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,500
His aura was palpable
even from inside the temple.

27
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,833
Whatever he is,
he sure ain't human.

28
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,833
Or for that matter, a demon.

29
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,250
He single-handedly
wiped out a demon army

30
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,875
and we don't know who he is.

31
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,583
That, and the fact his motives
are yet shrouded in mystery,

32
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,458
has me just a trifle on edge.

33
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,916
No kiddin', right?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,791
Somethin' else that's
kinda botherin' me

35
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,166
is Goku not bein' back even
though half the day's gone by.

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,875
[HAKKAI]
That's to be expected.

37
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,666
He's really been throwing
himself into helping

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,708
with repairs and what not
for the past three days.

39
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,291
His philosophy is,
"Sanzo put his life on the line

40
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,250
for these people, why shouldn't
I do everything I can?"

41
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,250
Poor guy...

42
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,458
[HAKKAI]
Kougaiji and the stranger

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,083
aren't our only problems.

44
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,708
The mark on Gojyo's neck
gives me cause for alarm.

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,333
I'd have broached
the topic before,

46
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,916
but everything happened so
quickly there just wasn't time.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,375
If he's aware of it himself,

48
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,541
he's certainly given
no indication.

49
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,958
Once he notices,
it might be too late.

50
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,375
Worse, the confusion
bound to follow

51
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,416
may well trigger his awakening.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,291
Terrifying as that
is to contemplate.

53
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,125
Unless I want to disturb
Sanzo's recovery,

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,250
it's on me to make a decision.

55
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,250
[HAKKAI]
Gojyo.

56
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,166
[GOJYO]
Huh?

57
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,333
There's something
I need to tell you.

58
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,916
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
There's an important message

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,166
for Sharak Sanzo
from Kyokueiden.

60
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,458
Well, let's hear it.

61
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,833
[MAN 10A]
Right.

62
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,208
"Urgent--the presence of
Sanzo Sharak, 28th in Arhat,

63
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,750
is hereby requested in
Kyokueiden immediately.

64
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,375
The Sanbutsushin must
discuss new developments

65
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,833
regarding her mission.

66
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,708
Furthermore, Sanzo Genjo
and his three followers,

67
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,875
who currently enjoy
Sharak's hospitality,

68
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,625
are ordered to accompany her.

69
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,416
Failure to appear is
unacceptable." That's it.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
[GOJYO]
Huh...?

71
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,500
Word travels fast in
this neck of the woods.

72
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
Looks like they know
you boys are here.

73
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,916
Wow. This is pretty big.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,166
Sanbutsushin almost never
summon people directly.

75
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,958
You're not gonna
refuse, are you?

76
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,958
Circumstance compels us
to decline, I fear.

77
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,083
Direct order or not,
they cannot expect

78
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,791
Sanzo to travel
in his condition.

79
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,458
[SANZO]
How far to Kyokueiden?

80
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
[HAKKAI]
Sanzo!

81
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,708
Oh, I'd say about 20 miles.

82
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,583
[SANZO]
Show me the way, Sharak.

83
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,416
What the hell are you
tryin' to prove man?

84
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,583
You can barely walk.

85
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,708
Not gonna get much better
lying on my back

86
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,166
all day collecting bed sores.

87
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,625
And besides...

88
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,541
I don't have a clue what the
Sanbutsushin want with me.

89
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,791
But, as long as we're there I
can think of a few questions

90
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,916
I'd like to ask them.
Specifically about that kid.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,333
Who he is, for starters.

92
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,666
[GOKU]
What was I about to say?

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,208
What did I want to call him?

94
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,500
Seeing him made me nostalgic.

95
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,708
Like...

96
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,166
Like maybe I recognized
him from somewhere?

97
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,208
Wonder if we've met before.

98
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,541
I mean, he didn't seem
to recognize me,

99
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,791
so that doesn't make sense.

100
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,791
[GOJYO]
Hey, Goku! Come get your things.

101
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,416
We've got somewhere
we need to be.

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,833
Huh? 'Kay, where we goin'?

103
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,208
[SAITAISAI]
Good question.

104
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,250
Maybe the only one that matters.

105
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,958
Let's just say for your sake
I hope it isn't Hell.

106
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,583
That'd suck.

107
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,958
[GOKU]
Sanzo, are you all right?

108
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,208
Maybe we should let you
ride in the wagon.

109
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,375
It'd probably shake less.

110
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,291
[SANZO]
Shut up.

111
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,166
Ah, alas, the wagon wouldn't be
very comfortable for him,

112
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,833
knowing he'd
relinquished his seat.

113
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,041
Aw. I can't decide if
that's stupid or cute.

114
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,291
[SANZO]
Bastards.

115
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,791
Wow, sure is a long
way down from here.

116
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,625
Yeah. Reminds me of Shayoden.

117
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,041
Guess the big wigs
prefer to take

118
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
"high and mighty" literally.

119
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,708
[SHARAK] Kyokueiden temple
is where the Kumari

120
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,500
and her attendants dwell.
Been that way for ages.

121
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,208
There's a special room
in the basement

122
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,291
where you can speak
with the Sanbutsushin.

123
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,791
Kumari?

124
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,750
"The living goddess," I assume?

125
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,625
Tradition demands
she be represented

126
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,875
by an exceptionally
beautiful girl.

127
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,500
A peasant chosen to be worshiped

128
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,750
as the goddess herself
in the flesh.

129
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,916
Who in turn bears the
burden of guiding

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,583
a country's fate through
astral divination.

131
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,833
Basically, she's a prophet.

132
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,666
The current Kumari is
a girl named Talchie.

133
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,041
Said to appear every millennia.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,125
[SHARAK] Her gift for seeing
the future is unparalleled.

135
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,166
Not once has she been wrong.

136
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,541
Exceptionally beautiful. Gifted.

137
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,250
I'm lookin' forward
to meetin' this gal.

138
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,875
[HAKKAI] If memory serves,
the Kumari must be pure,

139
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,500
meaning prepubescent.

140
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,625
[GOJYO] Eh... Oh.
In that case, never mind.

141
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,125
Forget I said anything.

142
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,208
The girl doesn't have
to be young.

143
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083
Just, well, unsullied

144
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,416
and willing to fulfill
her sacred duty.

145
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,458
They can serve for
quite some time.

146
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,000
The current Kumari has held
the position for over 80 years.

147
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,166
[GOJYO] That's an even
bigger never mind.

148
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,958
[GOKU]
Whoa. Nice. Check it out!

149
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,625
Whoever designed this place
knows about atmosphere.

150
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,125
[HAKKAI]
You never get a second chance

151
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,708
to make a first impression.

152
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,791
[GOJYO]
Eh. Okay. Heh, heh.

153
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,041
[GOKU]
Trippy!

154
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
[HAKKAI] You might want
to watch what you say.

155
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,750
Right, so, uh, we'll wait
outside till you're done here.

156
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,041
[SHARAK]
Thank you.

157
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,583
[SANZO]
Hm?

158
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,333
[TALCHIE]
Primordial chaos.

159
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:51,250
The scroll speaks of time when
Heaven and Earth were one.

160
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,500
Mankind had yet to emerge
from the whirling void.

161
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,625
But, like a ray of light, Banko
pierced through the fog and,

162
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,583
tearing Heaven and Earth apart,
from one made two.

163
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,208
Thus did the creator of
all things fashion reality.

164
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,250
Thus did his children come to
worship him as their maker.

165
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,416
I forget how long it's been
since I've seen you, Talchie.

166
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,833
Quite.

167
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,750
I am very pleased to see that
you are well, Sharak.

168
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,291
Wait, how can that girl
be a living goddess?

169
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,875
She totally has a demon mark!

170
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,083
Yes. And yet...

171
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,125
Her ears are perfectly normal.

172
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,875
[TALCHIE] I address the Sanzo
Genjo Party, do I not?

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,333
I laud you for having made
it so far without dying.

174
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,833
Well done.

175
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,375
[TALCHIE]
However, your luck will run out.

176
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,875
Whether the rut ceases or no.

177
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,541
The path you follow
is not your own.

178
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,625
It is written in the stars.

179
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,958
[GOJYO]
Eh?

180
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,416
Is that one of your prophecies,
Talchie? Do tell.

181
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,291
Fate does not lie.

182
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,625
Try though we might, not
even the Buddha's will

183
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,625
is strong enough to break
the circle our lives describe.

184
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,791
Ha! Bet you're fun at parties.

185
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,708
Anyone know what this
<i>loli</i> 's talkin' about?

186
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,750
Don't call me a <i>loli</i> .
I'm older than you.

187
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,791
If your powers are real,
you know damn good

188
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,375
and well what we intend to do.

189
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,833
Look, I'm not about to tuck
my tail between my legs

190
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,333
and toddle on back
home just 'cause

191
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,708
some stranger gives
me a warning.

192
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,750
[TALCHIE]
I am no stranger.

193
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,000
Come, the Maten Scripture
fell to you, is it not so?

194
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,500
The one who bore its
dread weight before you

195
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,625
shares the blood which
courses through my veins.

196
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,791
[SANZO]
Hm?

197
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,500
[gasps] I was never
made aware of this!

198
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,375
Hold on.

199
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,791
What's that supposed to mean?

200
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,666
The Sanbutsushin are waiting,

201
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,375
if you'd be so kind.
Step this way, please.

202
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
[GOJYO]
Snap out of it, Sanzo.

203
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,666
Who cares what she means?

204
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,166
We didn't come here to
have our fortunes told.

205
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,666
[TALCHIE]
The endless cycle. Dawn to dusk.

206
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,000
Cradle to grave.

207
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,666
The wheel turns.
Misfortune repeats.

208
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,125
The centuries fold back
upon themselves...

209
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,625
...forever.

210
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,250
Sanzo Sharak, 28th in Arhat.

211
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,125
How may I serve you.

212
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,958
Sanzo Genjo, 31st in China,
at your beck and call.

213
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,375
[GOJYO] Uhh, and his
merry band of misfits!

214
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,333
[GOKU]
I'm not a misfit!

215
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,791
[HAKKAI]
Read the room, you two.

216
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,458
[SHARAK]
We've come with all haste.

217
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,416
Good. It gladdens my heart
to see that you're well.

218
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,125
We congratulate Genjo's
journey to the West.

219
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
You and your party
have surmounted

220
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,916
many obstacles to come so far.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,125
Though, it did take you

222
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,083
quite a bit longer
than we thought.

223
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,666
Hey!

224
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,708
You make it sound like it was
s'posed to be a piece 'a cake.

225
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,541
Yeah, you have no idea the crap
we've had to deal with.

226
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,541
Well, considering how
quickly the balance

227
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,000
on your card was exhausted,
I'd say we do.

228
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,083
[HAKKAI] Apologies, we'll
address that presently,

229
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,208
but if you wouldn't mind
answering a question.

230
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,416
Insolence. You dare
change the subject?

231
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,125
Your evasion is noted,
but pray continue.

232
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,333
Three days ago, while
the Kouten compound

233
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,125
was under attack by demons,

234
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,541
a child appeared in black
robes and proceeded

235
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,875
to route the enemy
single-handedly.

236
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,291
For reasons that should
be perfectly obvious,

237
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,875
we'd like to know who he was.

238
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,125
Heaven, as I'm sure
you're well aware,

239
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,708
has its own military.

240
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:12,166
The eastern army concerns itself
chiefly with internal conflicts.

241
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,375
Threats from without fall under
the western army's jurisdiction.

242
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,333
Should the denizens of
Heaven break off

243
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,250
into opposed factions and
war with each other,

244
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,041
bloodshed is taboo.

245
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,333
I can see where this would

246
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,291
cause its fair share
of problems.

247
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,625
Silly me. I thought
Heaven was peaceful.

248
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,625
[ASPECT]
War is an aberration.

249
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,083
Therefore, an aberration
must address it.

250
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:37,958
One whose impurity permits
him to kill. A war god.

251
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,291
"War god"?

252
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,666
[ASPECT] Five hundred
years ago, the boy you saw

253
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,250
was embroiled in
circumstances so dire,

254
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,000
it became necessary for
him to lay in torpor.

255
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,333
His name was Prince Nataku.

256
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,333
Nataku?

257
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,291
But, what brought
the boy to Earth?

258
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,208
For that matter,
why is he awake?

259
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,208
Whose purpose does he serve?
Why come to my home?

260
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,416
Well, to be frank, upon
hearing this news

261
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,458
we were every bit
as bewildered as you.

262
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,750
You see, Prince Nataku
traveled to Earth

263
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,458
500 years ago to fulfill
a sacred mission.

264
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,458
He was tasked with subduing
Gyumaou and his kin.

265
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,166
We believe the incident
at Kouten is in some way

266
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,125
related to the enemy's
resurrection experiment.

267
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,750
Hold on a second!
You just said he--

268
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,250
Gyumaou was taken out
by some random brat?

269
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,791
[NEUTRAL ASPECT]
Indeed.

270
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,500
That's the reason the boy came
to Earth in the first place.

271
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,541
And, not to put too
fine a point on it,

272
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,583
the very reason we gathered
you all here today.

273
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,625
Huh. Should've seen it coming.

274
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,875
[ASPECT] We now relay the
message entrusted to us

As of this moment, you are
relieved of your duties

Don't mince words.

If I understand you correctly,
we're being given the axe.

[GOKU]
Yep. Knew it.

299
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,916
Sorry. Not to be difficult,

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,750
but I don't think I've
quite got my head around

301
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
what you're asking me to do.

302
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,500
Your frustration is
perfectly understandable.

303
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,333
No shit it's understandable!

304
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,416
We come all this way and
you tell us to scuttle

305

our happy asses back to China?

306
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,416
Allow me to explain what
you have failed to grasp.

307
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,416
How many times did you find
yourselves in jeopardy?

308
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,583
How often did you stray
from the path?

309
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,625
The sheer waste of
time and resources

310
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,708
is enough to make
one's head spin.

311
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,583
All told, it's a miracle you
weren't "given the axe" earlier.

Count yourselves lucky.

313
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,125
[ALL]
Well, damn.

314
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,541
There's no arguing with that.

315
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,125
While it does makes
sense that you'd

316
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,875
hand over our duty to the one
who originally defeated Gyumaou.

317
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,666
What I don't understand is why
you'd ask us to withdraw

318
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,166
rather than fight alongside him.

319
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,250
You know of Kumar
Talchie's gift.

320
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,083
Her prophecy is quite clear.

321
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,791
We have absolutely no interest
in allowing you four

322
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,958
to squander your lives when
defeat is inevitable.

323
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,083
Gah. Stupid <i>loli</i> just had to
open her trap and sell us out.

324
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,125
Look, I don't care if she's
peddling fortunes or fairy dust!

325
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,708
Why are you guys so damn
sure we're destined

326
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,083
to get our asses kicked?!

327
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,750
Go. By Imperial order
from the upper echelons

328
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,083
of Heaven, get thee gone.

329
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,833
[GOJYO] You can't just
shrug us off like that!

330
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,541
Permit us once again to commend
your brave journey.

331
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,125
[GOKU]
We've been over that!

332
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,541
[HAKKAI]
Another moment, please!

333
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,166
About our credit limit, perhaps
some agreement can--?

334
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,958
Do exercise discretion
on the way home.

335
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,458
What are you doing?!

336
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,625
Heh. Things took a turn, huh?

337
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,833
[GOKU]
Yeah! What was that all about?

338
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,791
[GOJYO]
They can't fire me, I quit!

339
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,291
Middle management tryin'
to push us around.

340
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,041
Take this job and shove it,
am I right?

341
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,500
[GOJYO]
Eh... It's not that simple.

342
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,250
Genjo didn't take this on
for the bragging rights.

343
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,541
He couldn't care
less about Gyumaou.

344
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,333
No, it's about getting the
Seiten Scripture back.

345
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,875
Of course. Though there's
a more pressing concern

346
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
at the moment.
Our credit score is abysmal.

347
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,458
Is it seriously always a
question of money for you?

348
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,708
It's like you said before,
we can't use the card

349
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,000
around here anyway, so what's
the point of worrying?

350
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,875
Um, irrespective of
whether we decide

351
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,083
to forge ahead or go home,
a journey requires means.

352
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,583
I was hoping at least to secure
their word our account

353
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,708
wouldn't be frozen outright

354
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,375
until we'd made it
back to Chang'an.

355
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,708
So much for that, I suppose.

356
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,458
Shit in one hand,
wish in the other.

357
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,375
Let's return to the compound
and discuss next steps. Agreed?

358
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,625
[GOKU gasps]
Sanzo!

359
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,750
"No, no. I'm good.
Bed rest is for losers."

360
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,125
That's what you get
for toolin' around

361
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,875
when half your bod's
still medium rare.

362
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,375
[SANZO]
Keep talking, water sprite

363
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,708
Tartar's on the
menu for tonight.

364
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,708
Goku, please.
Carry him to Hakuryu.

365
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,666
Sure. No problem.

366
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,416
Ugh. Let go. I'm fine.

367
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,125
Don't be like that.

368
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,541
[SHARAK] They're using Talchie's
prophecy as an excuse

369
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,833
to get rid of them.

370
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,250
How exactly is that supposed
to make sense?

371
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,416
The goal is to subdue Gyumaou.

372
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,041
If that's this
war god's mission,

373
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,125
why risk letting him
go it alone?

374
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,166
And why send him to Kouten?

375
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,666
The enemy is in Houtou Castle.

376
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,833
[ASPECT B]
They deserved better of us.

377
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,583
Those repeatedly willing to put
themselves in jeopardy

378
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,583
are owed more than
a casual dismissal.

379
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,041
[NEUTRAL ASPECT] You speak
as though we ought to've

380
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,333
shown them pity. Would that
have eased their troubles?

381
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,875
Lest you forget,
we are but divine mouthpieces.

382
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,750
Our personal opinions are
neither here nor there.

383
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,041
Thank you, I'm well aware.
And yet...

384
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,333
Come now. Far be it from us to
question the wisdom of an order

385
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,583
given from on high,
wouldn't you say?

386
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,791
For what it may be worth,

387
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,750
Kanzeon Bosatsu
will appeal directly

388
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,875
to Shaka Nyorai in this matter.

389
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,041
Take comfort in the
knowledge that Buddha

390
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,541
shall weigh the verdict
most carefully.

391
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,708
[GOKU] Huh. I wonder how far
Sharak and the others went.

392
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:30,166
Rest. There's a nearby village
we'd like to check in on.

393
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,208
Yeah. They go on patrol,
we kick back.

394
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,583
It's kinda nice not to be
firing on all cylinders.

395
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,083
I'd have to agree.

396
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,125
Cleary there's more to
be said for unemployment

397
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,208
than I thought.

398
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,583
What the...?

399
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,416
Anyone else weirded out that
Sanzo's not telling us

400
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,875
all to shut up right now?

401
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,375
[GOJYO] Painkillers must've
finally kicked in.

402
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,166
Let the widdle man sleep.

403
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,500
Downtime has been in short
supply since we hit

404
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,458
the open road. Our nerves
could use a little break.

405
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,291
Besides, carving out some
quality R n' R time

406
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,750
never hurt anyone.

407
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,041
[GOKU]
Sounds good to me.

408
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,625
[GOJYO]
Music to my ears.

409
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,791
[GOKU]
Uh! Question!

410
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,000
Ugh. What is it?

411
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,791
[GOKU] How do you know
when you're relaxed.

412
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,083
[GOJYO]
Just had to ask, didn't ya?

413
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,750
Well first off, this
location sucks ass.

414
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,208
Jeez. I mean, how's a guy
supposed to unwind out here

415
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,333
in the middle of freakin'
nowhere, huh?

416
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,750
Ah. Do you remember
those hot springs

417
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,250
we visited before heading West?

418
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,625
Yeah! You mean the one where
I played Ping-Pong all day?

419
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,291
And the food! Gah!
Talk about outta this world!

420
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,500
Toss Sanzo into a Jacuzzi and
give him one of those

421
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,416
fruity umbrella drinks, he'll be
back on his feet in no time.

422
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,125
What about that big city
we stopped in with

423
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,583
all the cool spots for us to
stuff our faces, right?

424
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,500
Right! And four-star
gentlemen clubs

425
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,833
as far as the eye could see!

426
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,291
Ah, yes. It was on the
way here as I recall,

427
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,708
so if we take the same route
we'll just pass back through.

428
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,208
Hell yeah, bro! Only difference
now is we'll finally

429
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,125
get to take our sweet-ass time!

430
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,166
Seriously? Oh man,
this is totally the life!

431
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,416
Yes, but bear in mind we'll
still have to rely on our card.

432
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,916
I don't wanna rain
on your parade,

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,750
but if the higher ups have
cancelled our line of credit,

434
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,041
we may have to get jobs.

435
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,416
Hey, no problem.

436
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,250
We'll just throw Sanzo's
weight around and watch

437
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,208
the plebeians shower
us with cash!

438
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,583
Guys! What about this?

439
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,458
Yeah! We hire some
body guards so people

440
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,791
think we're super important!

441
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
[laughs] Well, as long as
we're not in any hurry

442
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,083
to reach Chang'an. At this rate
it'll take us decades.

443
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,500
[GOJYO] Yeah. What else
we got on our plate?

444
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,458
Let's, switch gears and
discuss something

445
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,083
a bit more down-to-earth,
shall we?

446
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,875
Think about Sanzo and
the Seiten Scripture.

447
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,041
Odds are he'll head to Houtou
Castle with or without us.

448
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,875
[GOJYO]
Without a doubt.

449
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,916
[HAKKAI] Goku, am I right to
assume you'll go with him?

450
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yup.

451
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,416
[HAKKAI]
Since I can't in good conscience

452
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,083
let you do without
Hakuryu or a healer,

453
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,291
I suppose it's safe to say
I'm along for the ride.

454
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,458
Gojyo, I... I'm very sorry.

455
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,708
Forgive me if I recommend
that you not go any further.

456
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,041
[GOKU gasps]

457
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,250
If that's your idea of
a joke, I recommend

458
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,833
you workshop your
delivery, chief.

459
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,958
What are you saying?

460
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,666
It wasn't a joke.

461
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,333
Please, I say this
in all seriousness.

462
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,708
Yes, I'm beating a dead
horse, but listen,

463
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,541
the dark aura's hold on
you will be too strong.

464
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,375
Even if there aren't
issues right away.

465
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,291
It's only a matter
of time before--

466
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,625
Hey! Cut the BS already, huh?

467
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,416
What's the deal
with you lately?!

468
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,875
You tryin' to start somethin'?!

469
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,416
Screw work-shopping your
joke delivery, jackass.

470
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,708
Learn how to lie.

[GOJYO groaning]
Let go of my hair!

472
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,625
Hold up, Gojyo.

473
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,416
You've got something
on your neck.

474
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,916
Like, a weird-looking mark.

475
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,625
[HASSAN]
Quiet, isn't it?

476
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,958
[HASSAN]
Anybody here?!

477
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,208
[WOMAN 10A gasps]
Sanzo Sharak?

478
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,625
She's actually here!

479
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,708
She's come all this way
just to see us!

480
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,333
Sorry it's been so long
since I've stopped by.

481
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,625
How do you all feel? Any change?

482
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,708
Nothin' yet. Least, not as
far as any of us can tell.

483
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,000
Initializing deployment now.

[HAKKAI]
Episode Eleven. "Raid."

485
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,750
Don't miss it.

489
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,458
Well, that was certainly
its own kind of awful.

490
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,875
Hey. Where'd Sanzo go?

491
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:04,166
[KANZEON] Which of these is
your friend? Choose wisely.

492
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,458
Neither one, to be honest.

493
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,291
The one on the left's
a tad shorter

494
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,250
than I remember him being.

495
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,833
And, his eyes look sorta droopy.

496
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,791
No kidding. And, can we
talk about his hairline?

497
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,916
You're dead.
