It's better for everyone
if you go back to Earth.

160
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,333
She'll understand--

161
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,541
What're you doing, Goku?!

162
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,208
[GOKU]
Stop it! Let go!

163
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,458
Calm down and listen to me
for once in your life!

164
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,291
[GOKU] I have been listening!
You're wrong!

165
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,250
Tenpou would never
use me as a pawn,

166
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,833
and neither would Kenren!

167
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,041
I don't understand,

168
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,750
why would you tell me
I don't belong here?

169
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,333
I know you're mad
at me all the time,

170
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,625
but you just gave me a name!

171
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,000
[groans]

172
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,583
Konzen. I'm sorry!

173
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,750
I swear I didn't mean to
hurt you! Are you okay?

174
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,125
Konzen?

175
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,625
Listen to me. Quit likening
me to the sun, okay?

176
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,375
What's that mean?

177
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,208
I don't shine.
I seldom radiate warmth.

178
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,250
I just take advantage
of being different

179
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,500
to give my life some meaning.

180
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,583
I can't talk like Tenpou,

181
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,666
or fight my way to hell
and back like Kenren.

182
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,833
But you know what?

183
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
Here lately I find myself
thinking an awful lot

184
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:39,291
about I can do.
Your fault, actually.

185
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,750
You're talkin' funny.
Did you hit your head?

186
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,041
Look, the bottom line is:
forget what I said.

187
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,958
You're not going anywhere.

188
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,041
Okay!

189
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,500
[GOKU]
So, uh...

190
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,708
True story.
The first time we met,

191
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,083
I thought you looked pretty.
I'd never seen anyone like you.

192
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,583
Thought to myself, "look at him.

193
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,791
If he'd just smile
he'd be even prettier."

194
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
Doesn't really suit you, though.

195
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,083
Wow. You have a death wish,
don't you?

196
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,583
[GOKU]
That night,

197
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,958
Tenpou and Kenren
dropped by out of nowhere.

198
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,750
They wanted us to
look at a tree?

199
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,458
[TENPOU]
...look absolutely gorgeous.

200
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,000
Flowers in the moonlight.

201
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,125
You guys have nothing
better to do?

202
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,208
[TENPOU] Well, there's
no call to be rude.

203
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,875
Earth has many foods,
but without a doubt,

204
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,666
among the finest and
most indispensable

205
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,166
of its fare is ramen.

206
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,125
Konzen makes me ramen sometimes,

207
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,625
but it turns out really gross.
Tastes like feet.

208
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,500
[TENPOU]
I should make you some.

209
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
[GOKU]
Please!

210
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,666
[KENREN] All right, little man.
How's your tree-climbing?

211
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,208
Excellent! Ha! Last one
to the top's a rotten egg!

212
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,583
Hey, don't break your neck.

213
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,708
I'm gonna laugh when you
fall on your ass, you drunk.

214
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,208
Talk to me.

215
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,583
Uh?

216
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,958
[KONZEN]
Is it possible for two war gods

217
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,250
to reside in Heaven at once?

218
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,875
[TENPOU] So it's crossed
your mind, too, I see.

219
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,541
Multiple war gods existed
alongside each other

220
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,333
at one time. However...

221
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,041
...if perchance our
friend is elevated

222
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,083
to share the title with Nataku,

223
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,416
Li Touten would most certainly
see him as an interloper,

224
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,791
and act accordingly.

225
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,083
Moreover, you would be
the guardian of a war god.

226
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,916
Pitting you and the secretary
in direct competition.

227
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,375
[GOKU] Seriously. The cherry
blossoms were amazing.

228
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,500
I wish Nataku could've been
there, he'd have loved it.

229
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,458
Sorta made me sad.

230
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,208
Here's a golden idea:
why don't you worrywarts

231
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,333
stop talkin' shop
and enjoy the saké?

232
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,541
Yes, yes. We know.
Duly noted, thanks.

233
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
I hate to be the one
to point this out,

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,333
but the flowers here
aren't half as beautiful

235
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,833
as what they got down on Earth.

236
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,875
Aren't cherry blossoms
the same everywhere?

237
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,416
[KENREN]
Nah. Depends on where they live.

238
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,041
[KONZEN] Is that a fact? I'll
have to see them for myself.

239
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:56,916
[gasps]

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
[KONZEN groaning]

241
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,041
Oh! My bad! Sorry!

242
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,083
[KENREN laughs]
Nice catch, Konzen!

243
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,291
I think we found
what you're good at!

244
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,916
[KONZEN] Of all the places
you could've landed,

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,416
did it have to be my head?!

246
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,750
[GOKU]
I said I was sorry!

247
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,125
[KENREN]
You chose to sit there.

248
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,416
[KONZEN]
Excuse me?!

249
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,333
[TENPOU]
Goku must weigh over 200 pounds

250
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,125
with those shackles on.
The branch was bound to snap.

251
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,208
[laughs]

252
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,333
[GOKU]
I was with the people I loved.

253
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,333
We were all laughing.

254
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:26,708
Not much, I s'pose,
but all I ever wanted.

255
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:31,625
It was wonderful. I could've
lived like that forever.

256
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,666
[LI TOUTEN sighs] Dear child,
again you've been injured.

257
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,750
It must hurt. You poor thing.

258
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:44,125
Nataku. My treasure,
my sole reason for existence.

259
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,750
My pride and joy above all else.

260
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,416
[NATAKU]
The moment we're alone,

261
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,625
Father's words are tender,
encouraging.

262
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,250
[LI TOUTEN] I am you.
We are one and the same.

263
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,250
[NATAKU] This is the side of him
that frightens me most.

264
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,291
Though, I don't tremble.

265
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,791
[LI TOUTEN] Nataku.
I am nothing without you.

266
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,375
Nothing.

267
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,583
[NATAKU]
I freeze, unable to move.

268
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,166
This is all I know of love.

269
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,875
[TENPOU] Not long after
accepting my post

270
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,125
as field marshal,
colossal demons

271
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,458
began appearing on
Earth in droves.

272
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,333
An onslaught of epidemic
proportions.

273
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,583
Try though we might,
their numbers proved

274
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,000
more than Heaven's
forces could handle.

275
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,000
[TENPOU] We mustn't
underestimate Li Touten.

276
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,083
He's a most ambitious man
who soared through

277
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,500
the ranks on the strength
of his singular mind.

278
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,541
His great weakness is
a failure to endure

279
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,916
the acrimony foisted
upon him by the peerage

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,875
for having dared come
from a ruined family.

281
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,875
He hates his betters.
Crushing them is his obsession.

282
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,250
[TENTEI]
Who is this?

283
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,458
[LI TOUTEN]
One permitted to kill, my liege.

284
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,833
I give you the war god,
His Highness Prince Nataku.

285
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,375
[TENPOU]
So it went.

286
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,583
You're familiar with the
boy's work in that vein

287
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,333
since he was admitted
into court, I presume.

288
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,416
This is purely
speculation, but...

289
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,791
...it is my belief that
Nataku's true identity

290
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,791
is a secret between our Tentei
and the upper echelons.

291
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,541
Only they know.

292
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,416
I think Li Touten created
him, artificially.

293
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,541
The boy functions as a weapon.

294
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,541
Gossip is currency in
the trenches, of course,

295
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,916
but one persistent
rumor intrigues me.

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,708
Our soldiers say he's
half god, half demon.

297
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,916
We would never sanction
such a thing.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,041
Indeed. And yet it has been.

299
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,500
Evidently Heaven required
a warrior so fierce

300
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,083
they deigned to do
the unthinkable.

301
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,458
A need Li Touten was only
too happy to fill,

302
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,666
perhaps even one
he manufactured.

303
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,291
What are you saying?

304
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,291
[TENPOU] Battle upon battle.
An overtaxed military.

305
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,791
Convenient, wouldn't you say?

306
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,333
[TENPOU] I can't speak to
the man's ultimate goal,

307
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,208
but I know beyond
a shadow of a doubt

308
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,291
he'll do whatever he can
to rid himself of Goku.

309
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,083
Our friend jeopardizes
his leverage.

310
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,000
Nataku himself
might do the deed.

311
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:00,708
[GOKU]
What deed?

312
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,791
[TENPOU, KONZEN gasp]

313
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,000
[KONZEN]
