1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,750
[TENJIN] Over and over, the
sacred rites are repeated.

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,250
Where is the wellspring of life?

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,791
From whence does it flow?

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,541
And, more importantly,
where does it end?

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,083
[GOJYO]
Ah, damn it! Son of a...!

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,458
Was this seriously the only way?

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,625
[HAKKAI]
How many times must I tell you?

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,708
I'm sorry! It's not my
fault a mountain range

9
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,125
blocks our path to the West.

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,041
Come on, nothin' wrong
with a little hike

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,500
every now and then, right?

12
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,041
[SANZO] This isn't exactly
my idea of a hike.

13
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,083
Strikes me more as a
rock-climbing expedition.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,291
Do what?

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,458
You'll have to talk louder.
I can't hear ya.

16
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,166
[GOJYO] Just tell me
the path isn't like this

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,833
the rest of the way.
My palms are chaffing!

18
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,750
[HAKKAI] The West was quite
unpredictable enough

19
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,916
before bizarre phenomenon began
reshaping the landscape.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,375
Maps just can't keep up.

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,875
[GOKU] In other words,
how 'bout you quit bitchin'?

22
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,750
Take a page from Sanzo's book--
he's barely said anything.

23
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,625
'Cause the poor bastard
can hardly breathe,

24
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,791
in case you hadn't noticed!

25
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,833
It's all he can do
just to hold on--!

26
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,125
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

27
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,041
That could've hit me!

28
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,583
I didn't do anything.

29
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,958
What makes you think
you're worth the effort

30
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:13,958
to draw a gun?

31
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,666
Then, where'd the
shot come from?

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,500
[DEMON 3A laughs] Well,
if it isn't the Sanzo Gang!

33
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,041
We'll be takin'
that scripture now,

34
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,041
and of course, your lives.

35
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,125
Huh?!

36
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,291
You really have
to do this right now?

37
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,583
Get a clue, jackass.

38
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,291
We're kinda preoccupied
at the moment!

39
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,250
I'd say they have
a fairly decent grasp

40
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,958
of the situation
we're in, actually.

41
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,416
[GOKU]
Well? What are you waiting for?

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,125
[DEMONS yell]

43
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,000
Idiots! Don't just
stand there! Attack!

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,416
[GOJYO]
Whoa there, tiger.

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,833
Givin' a little too much
attention to my buddy there.

46
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,833
If I didn't know better,

47
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,208
I'd think you were
getting jealous.

48
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,125
That'd be a rather
fascinating dimension

49
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,666
to explore in a crime drama.

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,666
Popularity's not all it's
cracked up to be, guys!

51
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,791
Is it just me or are
we gettin' hounded

52
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,000
at every turn lately?

53
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,458
It's a shame they
insist on attacking

54
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,500
regardless of how
polite we try to be.

55
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,041
[DEMON 3M groans]

56
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,750
[SANZO] Maybe I'm paranoid,
but I call that being stalked.

57
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,333
[HAKKAI] Isn't there some
old sutra about everyone

58
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,250
having their 15 minutes of fame?

59
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,250
[GOKU] Wait, I'm wasting my
moment in the sun on this?

60
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,125
[GOJYO] Some of us get
a lot more than 15 minutes.

61
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,125
[GOJYO]
Okay...

62
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,458
[growls]

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,875
[DEMONS yelping]

64
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,166
[GOJYO]
Man, that's gross.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,166
They're feeding
on demon carcasses?

66
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,000
[GOKU gags]

67
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,333
[TENJIN]
Don't worry.

68
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,333
As you observed, they're
only nourishing themselves

69
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,750
on the dearly departed.

70
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,375
[HAKKAI]
A demon?

71
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,708
Forgive my asking,
but, are you the one

72
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,166
controlling these birds?

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,958
[TENJIN chuckles] Goodness,
no. I'm just a caretaker.

74
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,125
They have minds of their own.

75
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,291
You see that little
village down there?

76
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,666
Not so long ago, this area was
reserved for sky burial rites.

77
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,375
[GOKU]
What is that s'posed to mean?

78
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,916
[SANZO]
You know how people are interred

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,375
or cremated after they die?
It's kind of along those lines.

80
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,166
Some customs dictate the
recently deceased to be left

81
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,958
out in the open so birds
can pick at their remains.

82
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,458
Talk about leavin' a
bad taste in your mouth.

83
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,583
You know, funeral rites
offer a great insight

84
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,083
into a given culture's
relationship with death.

85
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,375
Sky burials may seem
barbaric at first,

86
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,208
but in reality, its symbolic
of life returning to nature.

87
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,000
Indeed! What an
unadulterated pleasure it is

88
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,625
to meet someone who understands!

89
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,291
Would you gentlemen
care for some tea?

90
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,333
My abode isn't much to look at,
I know, but I live alone.

91
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,583
[gasps] Thank you,
but we really must be--

92
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,666
[TENJIN]
This way! [yelps]

93
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,791
Perhaps some other time?

94
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,416
I'm afraid we're
in a bit of a hurry.

95
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,541
[TENJIN]
Okay.

96
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,666
[GOJYO] All right. So we're
in demand. I get it.

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,041
But d'you ever think
we'd be invited

98
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,666
to tea by a demon?

99
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,583
[GOKU] Wouldn't'a hurt
to take him up on it.

100
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,291
You might not have had problem,

101
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,208
but a priest sitting
down with a demon

102
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,375
wouldn't go over well.

103
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,125
You have a point.

104
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,666
One wonders how
the fellow manages,

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,500
particularly living
within a stone's throw

106
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,916
of human habitation.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,041
[SANZO]
Who knows?

108
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,500
[GOJYO]
More importantly,

109
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
one also wonders where
we're gonna sleep.

110
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,125
Just sayin'.

111
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,000
Another good point.

112
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,958
I had a look around on
the way in but didn't see

113
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,375
a place we could stay the night.

Um.

Pardon me, I couldn't help
but notice your robes.

You wouldn't be

00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,916
Yes indeed!

118

As a matter of fact,
the man sitting before you

119

That would be most kind of you.

we're dealt, do we not?

What a coincidence.

153
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,416
I understand sky
burials used to be

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,125
a common practice in this
region. Is that true?

155

158
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
Burrying our dead
atop the mountain

159
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,208
became too dangerous.

160
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,958
We had to start putting
them in the ground.

161
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,416
[MAN 3C] The carrion birds
are now tended to by a demon

162
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,708
that used to live
among us as a friend.

163
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,833
He's obsessed with them. There's
no rhyme or reason to it.

164
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,750
Of course, it's only
reasonable to assume

165
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,916
he's connected to the
string of disappearances.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,750
[GOKU] Hm. I'll admit he
might've been a little off,

167
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,125
but I didn't get a crazed
killer vibe from the guy.

168
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,291
[MAN 3B]
Wait!

169
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,958
You've actually crossed
paths with Tenjin?

170
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,666
That's one way of
putting it, I guess. Sure.

171
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,000
There you are!

172
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,500
I'd expect nothing less
from the noble Sanzo Gang!

173
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,625
Imagine being so bold
when encountering a demon

174
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,583
in this day and age!

175
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,958
Yes, well, you know.

176
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,833
[MAN 3B] Surely his grace
would agree to confront

177
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,625
the demon and get to
the bottom of things?

178
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,375
[MAN 3C] Better yet, he can
kick him off the mountain

179
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,375
and give our village some peace!

180
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,958
Bless you, sir! Bless you!

181
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,666
Of course.

182
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,916
[TENJIN]
I beg your pardon?

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,541
I'd never do the villagers harm!

184
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,750
Delicious!

185
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,333
I owe the villagers
a vote of thanks

186
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,333
for letting me live there
as long as they did.

187
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh, and, uh, I happened
to be a vegetarian.

188
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,958
[HAKKAI] Ah. Even so,
you're also a lightening rod.

189
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,041
Your neighbors are
an apprehensive lot.

190
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,625
They'll lay all kinds of
misfortune at this door.

191
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,250
Toiling under a
cloud of suspicion

192
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,250
can't make for a happy life.

193
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,250
Why don't you just pick up

194
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,291
and move the hell
away from here?

195
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,125
'S not like the birds need you
to take care of 'em, right?

196
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,791
[TENJIN]
Maybe not, but I don't choose

197
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,375
to remain here for them.

198
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,958
The ritual of sky burial is an
important part of our culture.

199
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,500
Life returning to
nature is beautiful.

200
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,416
Doomed to live and
are in turn consumed.

201
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,875
An unending cycle through
whose weft and warp

202
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,791
the whole of creation
is threaded.

203
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,958
See, I remain on this
lonely mountaintop

204
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,875
to preserve a vital sacrament.

205
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,208
Awaiting the day when Shangri-la
is once again in harmony.

206
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,666
I need no other purpose
in life than that.

207
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,916
So, that's all
you're interested in?

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,833
Uh--

209
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,333
[screams]

210
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,958
C'mon, what're you doing?
Knock it off! This is my food!

211
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,416
You know better
than that, Tenba.

212
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,750
Leave him alone.

213
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,375
You are aware you're
pickin' a fight with a bird.

214
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,708
[TENJIN]
This isn't like him. Huh.

215
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,583
It's unusual for him to even
approach anyone but me.

216
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,625
[GOJYO]
Eh. Wild animals are attracted

217
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,583
to other wild animals,
am I right?

218
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,666
Who you callin' a wild animal,
ya stray water sprite?

219
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Water sprites were
never domesticated

220
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,416
in the first place, you moron!

221
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,583
May I ask why the bird
seems to live here?

222
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,125
[TENJIN] He can't fly
very well on account

223
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,791
of a broken wing.

224
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,750
Poor thing's a lot
younger than he looks.

225
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,708
[HAKKAI] I can understand
taking care of one,

226
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,333
but tending so many
must be exhausting.

227
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,708
How on earth do
you feed them all?

228
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,541
[TENJIN] It isn't as easy
as it used to be.

229
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,208
Since things started
changing for the worse,

230
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,833
there's hardly enough food for
me, let alone a whole flock.

231
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,125
I feed them scraps of
livestock when I can, though.

232
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,458
[SANZO]
Tenjin and Tenba.

233
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Both words mean
"the teachings of Buddha,"

234
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,625
if I'm not mistaken.

235
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,666
Oh, my. You're
knowledgeable of other

236
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,375
religious practices, are you?

237
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,833
I envy the sense of perspective
you must have, my friend.

238
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,500
[GOJYO] You wouldn't know
it by lookin' at him,

239
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,125
but he's kinda smart.

240
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,666
[SANZO] Somebody must really
wanna return to nature.

241

forbidden from seeing!

fine spirits today, aren't they?

these birds here,

they're going back
to their home, huh?

birds as big as these guys?

Excellent question.

Our souls, I mean.

When someone you love passes on,

256
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,333
what happens to their spirit?

257
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,708
Where does the soul travel
when parted from the body?

258
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,791
[GOKU] Yeah, I, uh, don't know
much about souls 'n stuff.

259

I've never really thought
about it. Could be anywhere.

260
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,958
To be honest, I think it's
more important to focus

261
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,583
on the life right in front
of you than to worry

262

about what happens after
it's all over, y'know?

263

Huh.

Have at 'em.

311
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,708
We figure it's best to let you
people dole out justice.

312
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,000
Bear in mind, they're on
the verge of starvation.

313
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,500
We ask that you refrain
from judging them harshly.

314
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,666
Such wise and
compassionate souls!

315
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,625
May each and every
one of us aspire

316
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,958
to follow your example!

317
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,166
[WOMAN 3B]
Thank you so much!

318
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,250
If there's anything we can do...

319
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,416
[SANZO]
Hakkai.

320
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,583
...only say the word
and it's done!

321
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,333
Well, actually.

322
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,750
Virtue is its own reward.

323
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,708
Heh. What he wants is sleep.

324
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,500
Uh. But, if maybe
you think about

325
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,250
apologizing to the birdman,

326
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,416
that'd be something kinda
nice you could do for us.

327
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,708
That's true.

328
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,291
We're not trying to
gloss over the fact

329
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,833
that we treated him
unfairly or anything.

330
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,375
But a demon's a demon.

331
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,083
We're not comfortable with
one of them living so close.

332
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,291
[MAN G]
Hear hear.

[ROOSER crows]

334
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,875
[yawning] I could definitely
use another hour.

335
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,708
Gojyo, any idea where Goku is?

336
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,666
Tellin' me he's not here?

337
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,416
[HAKKAI] I thought he stepped
out to relive himself,

338
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
but that was a while ago.

339
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,208
[SANZO]
Nothing to worry about.

340
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,375
He's probably just
wandering around.

341
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,625
Dear me, no.

342
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,541
The young lad definitely
had a purpose in mind.

343
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,125
Said he had to head out early.

344
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,541
Huh?

345
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,125
[WOMAN 3C] Something about
telling someone something.

346
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,166
Idiot kid.

347
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,083
He must've gone up the hill.

348
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,833
I thought he had
a troubled look.

349
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,916
Tenjin's riddle must've
really gotten to him.

350
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,875
[GOJYO] Stupid monkey, trying
to use brains he ain't got.

351
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,833
[GOKU] Tenjin! You
still asleep? It's me.

352
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,958
Is he here?

353
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,875
[GOKU]
I smell incense.

354
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,166
Hello? Tenjin?

355
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,333
Whoa. What's this place?

356
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,458
All kinds of stuff in here.

357
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,333
Toys, stuffed animals,
a hand mirror.

358
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,208
That looks like a
little girl's barrette.

359
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,125
Did these things belong to
his family or something?

360
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,666
Why's it like
they're on display?

361

[TENJIN]
Goku?

00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,875
Ah! Sorry.

363
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,291
I didn't mean to barge
in without permission!

364
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,333
It's all right. No harm done.

365
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,666
Good to see you,
it's just so early.

366
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,541
I wanted to tell you somethin'
'fore me an' the guys left town.

367
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,958
I know it's kind of early,
but I just couldn't wait.

368
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,208
[TENJIN]
Well, then.

369
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,250
Why not come inside
for a bit of tea?

370
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,958
I'm sure Tenba would
enjoy the visit.

371
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,083
[GOJYO]
Ugh.

372
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,541
How long does the
monkey boy need?

[HAKKAI]
I must confess,

374
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,750
I'm not a fan of him
going off on his own.

375
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,583
[GOJYO]
Eh, he'll be fine.

376
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,375
Tenjin's gotta be the
least threatening demon

377
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,666
we've ever run across.

378
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,041
Plus we've already bagged

[GOJYO]
Oh, thanks. Didn't realize.

382
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,041
Seems an odd thing
for you to own.

383
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,500
How on earth did you come by it?

384
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,125
I don't own it, just found
it on the hill yesterday.

385
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,583
Figured some kid
from the village

386
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,000
must've lost his mitten and
be in bad with his folks.

00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,250
[MOTHER 3A]
Um, might I see?

388
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,875
[MOTHER 3A]
I thought it looked familiar.

389
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,208
This belonged to my son!

390
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,083
Forgive me for prying.
May I ask where he is?

391
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,750
[MOTHER 3A] There was an
epidemic several months ago,

392
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,958
it claimed my
darling boy's life.

393
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,000
He was a little-bitty thing,
only six years old.

394
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,041
We buried him with his mittens.

395
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,416
How could this end up on--?

396
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,916
What's up?

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,416
[SANZO] You people have
been interring your dead

398
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,750
since the sky
burials stopped, yeah?

399
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,916
That's right.

400
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,916
We made a cemetery
just outside of town.

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,583
[SANZO]
Take me there. Now.

402
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,708
[HAKKAI] Gojyo, I think you
need to go up the hill.

403
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,833
Somebody gonna tell me
what the hell's goin' on?

404
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,833
[SANZO]
Round up some men.

405
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,208
Have them bring shovels.

406
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,708
[HAKKAI]
You're sure about this?

407
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,708
[SANZO] If I'm wrong, I'll
recite the appropriate sutra.

408
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,583
[TENJIN] You caught the guys
behind all the disappearances?

409
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,541
That's a relief to hear, though
it's difficult to be happy,

410
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,375
given how many people
lost their lives.

411
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,875
I know. But, hey,
look on the bright side!

412
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,083
At least your name's
been cleared.

413
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,666
That's something, right?

414
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,666
Is that what you came here at
the crack of dawn to tell me?

415
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,916
[GOKU]
Not just that.

416
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,125
Ah! Hey, hey! Easy there, Tenba.

417
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,250
You're crowding
my personal space.

418
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,833
[laughs] Well, look at that.

419
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,583
Who'd have thought my son
would make himself

420
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,958
a new friend so quickly?

421
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,416
[GOKU] Tenjin. D'you
used to have family?

422
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,041
The stuff in your shed
looked like it might'a

423
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,916
belonged to people close to you.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,583
[TENJIN] Ah. Yes, you mean
the random bric-a-brac

425
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,333
my feathered friends make
a habit of bringing here.

426
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,500
Birds can't resist
anything shiny.

427
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,750
[GOKU]
Got'cha.

428
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,041
I can return 'em to the
villagers if you want.

429
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,000

U-Uh...

'D be hard to do it yourself,

of you and everything.

00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,708
Lots of valuables
in there I'm sure

433
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,166
they'd like to have back.

434
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,708
How kind. Such a
good boy, you are.

435
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,166
[MAN 3E] They're gone!
The bodies have been taken!

436
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,875
[MAN 3F] We just buried
this one last week!

437
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,833
What it heaven's name
is going on here?

438
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,208
[HAKKAI]
Birds that eat only dead flesh.

439
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,791
There's not much room for doubt.

440
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,666
[HAKKAI] This is how Tenjin
kept his charges fed.

441
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,625
I can't believe he'd
defile the sanctity

442
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,416
of the grave just to
carry on a lost tradition.

443
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,791
The dead aren't just
props for a pet cause.

444
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,875
Wha...

445
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,041
[TENJIN]
Let me tell you about my son.

446
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,625
My beloved wife died in agony
bringing him into this world.

447
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,583
[GOKU]
What's going on?

448
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,125
[TENJIN]
All for nothing.

449
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,500
He was born with a heart
condition that would play a role

450
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,791
in his own death.

451
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:24,291
I was there. I saw it
with my own eyes.

452
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:29,333
The insatiable birds
picking at his corpse.

453
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,833
The villagers
butchered his remains,

454
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,041
ripped him open like
a sacrificial lamb.

455
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,125
There he lay,
face down in the dirt,

456
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,916
the birds pecking and clawing
until the only trace

457
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,666
of what had once been my son
was clean, white bone.

458
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,125
You cannot imagine
so magnificent a sight!

459
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,291
Tenba's soul reclaimed
by the earth.

460
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,500
Nature's glorious plan
come full circle!

461
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,833
Until that moment,

462
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,500
I'd never truly appreciated
the beauty of death.

463
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,541
[GOKU]
My whole body's gone numb.

464
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,791
[TENJIN] It was then
that I realized my purpose--

465
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,208
to carry on that grand,
empyrean ideal

466
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,791
and sanctify the soul's
journey back to its source!

467
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,083
I have been burdened
with a mission divine!

468
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,666
[TENJIN yells]

469
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,541
[GOJYO]
Real poetry there. Bravo.

470
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,166
Hell, I'd have believed
you if you hadn't

471
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,125
gone and named a bird after
your dearly departed son.

472
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
You're insane.

473
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
There's no "mission divine,"
you're just blinded by grief.

474
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,291
Shut up! His death
meant something.

475
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,333
[GOKU]
Tenjin.

476
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,666
[gasps]

477
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,958
[GOKU] I thought about
what you asked yesterday.

478
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,083
What happens after we die?

479
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,333
Honestly, I have no clue.

480
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,166
But whatever's waiting
on the other side,

481
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,083
wherever our loved ones
go once we've said

482
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:49,166
our last goodbyes, they're
still with us in a way.

483
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
In our hearts.

484
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,500
So as long as they're
memory's alive,

485
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,375
they're not lost.

486
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,458
Tenba. Please don't fly away.

487
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,750
No! Don't leave me! Wait!

488
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,541
[GOJYO]
You're an idiot, you know that?

489
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,541
[GOKU]
Sorry. I shouldn't 'a gone.

490
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,041
[GOJYO] You said it yourself,
it's more important

491
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,166
to focus on the life
right in front of you.

492
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,750
[GOKU]
Yeah. I know.

493
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,250
I just...

494
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,791
I just couldn't stop thinkin'
about it for some reason.

495
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,000
I had to talk to somebody.

496
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,375
[GOJYO] Well, from now on,
leave that sorta BS

497
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,833
to people with half a brain.

498
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,333
'Sides, it's not like the big
questions are goin' anywhere.

499
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,125
[GOKU] I love you guys.
You know that, right?

500
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,666
[GOJYO]
Are you gonna start crying?

501
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,250
[GOKU]
Tch! Cut me some slack,

502
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,791
I'm tryin' to have
a moment here!

503
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,041
[GOJYO] I just saved your
ass! Cut <i>me</i> some slack!

504
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,083
[TENJIN grunting]

505
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,083
[TENJIN]
Ah.

506
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:03,333
I see, you've brought
the whole gang back, huh?

507
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,458
Bear with me, son.

508
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,041
Soon. I promise.

509
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,875
That's a good boy.

510
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,041
[GOJYO] Episode 4:
"Nataku." Don't miss it.

511
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,250
[GOJYO]
Ready, and...

512
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,000
[GOKU, HAKKAI, SANZO, GOJYO]
Ura Sai!

513
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,583
[SANZO]
Hm.

514
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,500
[toilet flushes]
