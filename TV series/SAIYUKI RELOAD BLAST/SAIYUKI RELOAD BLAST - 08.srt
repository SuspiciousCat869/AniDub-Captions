Meh, seven villages
in total, right?

34
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,666
Goku and Gojyo will be the most
help in larger settlements,

35
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,791
so whoever's going there,
take 'em with you.

Hakkai, use Hakuryu and

[HAKKAI] I'll explain
everything later. Please.

Take Squad Four and the boy.

51
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,500
So, are you hanging back
here at the temple?

52
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,250
[SANZO]
Yeah. These men have families.

53
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,458
Someone's gotta protect
them and the refugees.

Uh, that would by my line.

57
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,708
[footsteps]

58
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,333
[SHARAK] Okay.

59
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,708
I'm guessing you'll be
focused on the barrier?

60
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,166
The spell's got a lot
of area to cover.

61
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,125
Even if I blaze through
the incantation,

62
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,000
it's gonna take me
at least an hour.

63
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,458
Wait, you're gonna
try to blanket

64
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,083
the entire region without
using the bell? That's nuts!

65
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,750
Is it possible to restore
the temple's barrier first

66
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,916
and then work your way
out from there?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,958
The spell can't be done in
stages. It's all connected.

68
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,458
So, until the barrier is back
up and running everywhere,

69
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,291
even the hub is vulnerable.

70
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,375
That's their game.

71
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,083
All this was to weaken
your defenses

72
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,041
so they can bust in here and
grab the Kouten Scripture.

73
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,750
Divide and conquer:
oldest trick in the book.

74
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,250
Once your squad moves out,
the demons'll make their move.

75
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,208
Lucky for me I've got
two fine gentlemen

76
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,083
right here who
can give 'em hell.

77
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,250
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about, Sharak;

78
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,791
do what you've got to do!

79
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,750
Those bastards won't touch
a hair on your head!

80
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,333
[GOJYO]
What's the story?

81
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,041
Why'd you wanna stick with me?

82
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,041
Nothing so dramatic
as I made it sound.

83
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,541
You weren't feeling well
earlier and I was concerned.

84
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,750
That's all.

85
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,000
If you expect me to
swallow than line of BS,

86
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm gonna be seriously pissed.

87
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,166
[sighs] I was hoping
not to say anything

88
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,708
if I could get away with it.

89
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,291
But since crossing
over into the West

90
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,333
a few weeks ago, I've noticed--

91
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
Or rather,

92
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,958
I've felt something far stronger
than any of us anticipated.

93
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,958
I'm certain your bout
of ill health earlier

94
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,000
is directly attributable
to the dark aura

95
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,541
we've been exposed to.

96
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,125
[GOJYO]
You mean...?

97
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on!

98
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,750
So, in other words, you
thought I'd go all berserk?!

99
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,541
Ugh, this is exactly why I
didn't want to talk about it.

100
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:24,125
As I said, I was concerned.

101
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,541
Well, now that you mention it,

102
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,958
I suppose it's not entirely out
of the question, huh?

103
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,041
I mean, after all I'm
just some half-ass

Even when I can feel
demons are close.

106
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,541
I can't lock onto the whole
"dark aura" thing like you guys.

107
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,750
For the record, though,

108
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,916
that doesn't mean you
get be a mother hen!

109

Uh. Right. I'm sorry.
Just my nature.

110
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,791
[HAKKAI] Nothing to worry about
for now.

111

it, we should be okay.

Those robes!

165
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,291
[DEMON 8S]
Is that who we're looking for?

166
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,458
[DEMON 8R] No. Sanzo Sharak
is supposed to be a woman!

170
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,916
[SANZO] Okay. You can use
spells, too, huh? Nice.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, believe it or not
I had aspirations

172
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,666
to be a priest once upon a time.

173
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,958
[DEMON 8U]
Don't be a hero!

174
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,375
[DEMON 8V]
Get out of our way!

175
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,333
You'd make a better one
than me, that's for damn sure.

176
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,500
Do what?

177
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,416
Training wasn't what
you'd call my forte.

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,916
I was never able to
master the spells, so...

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,375
[gunshot]

180
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,708
[HASSAN] Wait, then how'd
you manage to get this far?

181
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,000
[SANZO]
That's a very good question.

182
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,250
Yo! I'm right here!

Done!

00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,416
Hey, how you doin'? We good?

187
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,208
[HAKKAI] The severely injured
are stabilized

188
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,833
for the time being.

189
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,083
I rather expected there
to be more causalities.

190
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,541
We should be able to
leave the villagers

191
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,416
to fend for themselves.

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,125
[GOJYO]
Man, it's hot.

193
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,541
Wonder how Sharak and
the others are holdin' up.

194
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,875
Isn't somethin' bad
s'posed to happen

195
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,750
if we leave those two together?

196
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,916
Easy! What're you tryin'
to do to me?

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,208
I suggest you leave
your jacket on for now.

198
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,583
Seriously?

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,458
I'm sorry, it's just too sexy.

200
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,541
[GOJYO]
Ah, yeah. Good point. Wait...

201
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,708
Nice work with the
demons! Thank you!

202
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,583
Would you mind givin' me
an' the guys a lift

203
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,958
to the next settlement?

204
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,375
Never ends.

205
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
Doesn't using your
qigong wear you out?

206
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,750
Yes. Don't worry
about me, though.

207
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,458
I'll be fine. What about you?
Any dizziness?

208
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,041
Heh. Actually, now that
you bring it up--

209
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,583
No, matter of fact
I haven't felt

210
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,083
this light on my feet
in forever. Heh, heh.

211
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,666
Well, there you are.

[GOKU yells]

214
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,208
I think that's all of 'em.

215
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,500
But, why were there so
many to begin with?

216
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,625
[ROSHU] Uh, Squad Four's
asking for backup.

217
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,375
Can you get over there
and give them a hand?

218
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,583
Sure!

219
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,375
[GOKU]
I hope Sanzo's okay.

220
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,833
I don't know why,

221
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,708
but for some reason I've got
a bad feeling about this.

222
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,333
[gunshot]

That's it, right? We're done?

227
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,541
Y'all right, hot shot?

228
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,541
You seem a little out
of breath there.

229
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,916
Heh. I'd tell you to
take off that hat, but,

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,083
we wouldn't want you
to catch the sniffles.

231
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,750
Oh, don't worry. It's
got great ventilation.

[BOTH gasp]

233
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,458
Wh... Who're you supposed to be?

234
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,166
You dare address me
in this manner?

235
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,333
Fools, I am Kougaiji.

236
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,458
By order of Lady Gyokumen
I have come

237
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,208
for Sharak Sanzo's
Kouten Scripture.

238
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,708
[MAN 8E]
Kougaiji!

239
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,625
[MAN 8F]
The son of Gyumaou!

240
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,541
[SANZO]
Now it makes sense.

241
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,750
Seemed like more
demons than usual.

242
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,458
So, you're the brain trust
behind this, eh?

243
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,541
Hello there, Kougaiji.
It's been a while.

244
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,083
Wait! It's Sanzo Genjo!

245
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,375
Wh-What the hell
are you doing here?

246
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,708
[SANZO]
Took you long enough.

247
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,250
Okay, so judging by how
surprised you are to see me,

248
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,791
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

249
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,458
and say this was all just a ploy
to nab the Kouten Scripture.

250
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,250
Wow, 's quite an operation.
'Specially for you guys.

251
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,208
No offense, but it seems
kinda out of your league.

252
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,458
Time hasn't done much to
temper that mouth, has it?

253
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,833
Where are the three
mouth breathers

254
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,541
you normally have in tow?

255
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,125
[KOUGAIJI] No doubt fighting
alongside Sharak's dogs

256
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,250
in the other villages.

257
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,750
Really sorry about that.

258
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,625
The three of 'em out there'll
probably hit you

259
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,541
with more causalities
than you'd bargained for.

260
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,083
Not to mention the squads'll
be back any minute.

261
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,916
Damn, looks like it
sucks to be you guys.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,041
Not that I'd expect
any different.

263
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,250
[KOUGAIJI] What is he doing,
trying to provoke me?

264
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Actually, you can
dispense with the ruse.

265
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,750
I know desperation
when I hear it.

266
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,250
You're playing for time,

267
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,791
hoping to distract us until
Sharak restores the barrier.

268
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,875
That's right. We know the score.

269
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,833
And we know where she is.

270
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,666
Your followers are gone.

271
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,333
Surely you don't think this
ragtag group of humans

272
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,916
will be enough to stop us?

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,750
[SANZO]
You got me. I take it back.

274
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,916
What?

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,625
[SANZO]
Today's your lucky day.

276
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,625
With Goku and the others
out of the picture,

277
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,458
this is your chance
to grab two scriptures

278
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,958
for the price of one.

279
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,583
I'm no expert, but that seems
like a pretty sweet deal.

280
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,875
Maybe it doesn't suck
to be you after all.

281
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,166
Huh. Whaddya know?

282
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,083
You little...!

283
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,708
Bring it on, just be warned,

284
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,541
if you can't kill a solitary
a human by yourself,

285
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,166
people might wonder
if you really are

286
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
the great demon's son.

287
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,708
Go, Dokugaku.

288
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,791
I leave obtaining the Kouten
Scripture up to you.

289
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,583
I won't have my title
questioned!

290
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,916
Our quarrel with the Sanzo Party
is hardly anything new.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,958
If this piece of garbage
is challenging me,

292
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,208
I am honor-bound to
answer him in kind!

293
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,083
[DOKUGAKUJI]
Yes, but--

294
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,958
Damn it, there's no time! Go!

295
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250

All forces press on!
Exercise discretion!

297
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,291
Only kill or maim
civilians if necessary!

298
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,916
Our one and only
purpose here tonight

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,958
is to claim the Kouten
Scripture!

300
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,625
[HASSAN]
Over my dead body!

Don't let your guard
down with him.

303
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,166
He's not like the rest!

304
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,041
[HASSAN]
Stay alive, Sanzo? Ya hear?

305
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,875
[KOUGAIJI] I've pictured
this moment more times

306
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,666
than I care to admit, though
never quite like this.

307
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,791
I assume you're prepared
for me to go all out?

308
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,166
[SANZO]
Smartass.

309
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,958
[KOUGAIJI] Steady. Whatever
happens, I can't falter.

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,666
[SANZO]
If I want out of this alive,

311
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,333
I need to keep my eyes
open for a good shot.

could attest to that.
