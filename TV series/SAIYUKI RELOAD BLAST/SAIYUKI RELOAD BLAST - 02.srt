[PLAYERS]
Ooh!

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,875
[FINE LADIES giggle]

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,750
[LADY 2A] We've got a card
sharp on our hands, ladies.

[GOJYO gasps]

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,875
[GOJYO]
What is that smell?!

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,458
Ugh! And what the hell
are these things?

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,416
Commonly referred to as yaks.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,958
Or, even-toed ungulates,
to be precise.

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,458
Classed as order Artiodactyla,
family Bovidae, I believe.

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,958
I wasn't asking for
an encyclopedia entry.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,333
[yawns] Oh, man.

14
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,458
You gotta love how
warm these babies are.

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,458
Especially with
how cold it gets.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,291
If I wanted warmth,
I'd cuddle with a hot lady.

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,583
Preferably in a four-poster bed.

18
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey. Stop whining.

19
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,250
You sound like a little bitch.

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,416
Matter of fact,

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,916
go back to sleep and
never wake up, okay?

22
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,416
Sanzo, my man.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,625
[SANZO]
I'm not bumming you a smoke,

24
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,708
so don't bother
asking me for one.

25
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,833
[GOJYO] A-Ah! C'mon,
what if I say please?

26
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,166
[SANZO]
Um, no.

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,750
[GOKU, HAKKAI]
Harsh.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,041
[GOJYO]
I love how we're treating

29
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,333
this whole crazy journey

30
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,833
like we just stepped
out for cigarettes.

31
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,416
Kinda sucks there's
nothin' but mountains

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,833
as far as the eye can see.

33
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,333
It's the only available
scenery for quite some time,

34
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,000
so get used to it.

35
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,000
[GOJYO] What about India?
How much longer?

36
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,875
I'm not really sure.

37
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,166
That said, I'm fairly confident
it can't be much further.

38
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,500
You'll notice we've been
encountering a lot of demons.

39
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,125
Lady Gyokumen's Gyumaou
Resurrection experiment

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,375
is to blame.

41
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,000
It's created a dark aura
spreading from the West

42
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,958
like a plague, decimating
everything in its path.

43
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,750
Inciting demons to violence.

44
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,041
[HAKKAI] Of course people
fear for their lives.

45
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,666
We ought not be
surprised if villages

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,500
in the region are
less than hospitable.

47
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,333
They gotta do what
they gotta do to get by.

48
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,625
'S not like they have
much of a choice.

49
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,791
Okay, so look,
not to be that guy,

50
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,375
but I have a hard
time believing this

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,041
is gonna have a happy ending.

52
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,166
It's not like things'll
just snap back to normal

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
after we slay the final boss.

54
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,875
If you want out, leave.

55
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,500
Gimme a break.

56
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,000
Heh.

57
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,708
Like it or not, gentlemen,
we're basically stuck together.

58
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,833
[GOJYO]
Believe me, I know.

59
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,208
You think I'd be hanging
with a bunch of guys

60
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,250
if I had a say in this?

61
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,666
[SANZO]
Keep talking, I'll kill you.

62

[GOKU yells]
I'm dyin' of starvation!

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,291
And I'm dying of thirst!

64
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,375
"What a shock,"
said absolutely no one.

65
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,333
Way to ruin the mood,
monkey boy. Bravo.

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,875
Ugh. He's got a point, though.

67
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,375
We're out of cigs,
we're out of water.

68
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,416
if we don't stop off
somewhere soon and restock,

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,583
we'll shrivel up and blow away.

70
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,750
[HAKKAI] There should be
a village not far from here.

71

[GOKU screams]

72
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,875
Could you not scream
in my ear, please?

73

--It's kind of annoying.
--[GOKU] Look! Just up ahead!

74
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,583
[HAKKAI]
A rather substantial lake,

75
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,041
at least, according to our map.

76
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,208
I suggest we replenish
our water supply

77
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,125
before heading to the village.

78
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,250
Ah!

79
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,791
Not to your liking, I take it?

80
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,166
Ugh! What the hell?
It tastes like salt!

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,416
That would be
because of the salt.

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,666
A rather high concentration
of it, evidently.

83
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,291
Huh. Great.

84
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,416
So much for
quenching our thirst.

85
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,708
[HAKKAI] We'd be fools
to drink it, that's true,

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,583
but on the bright side,
we'd be hard-pressed to drown.

87
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,541
What's that supposed to mean?
If we swam, we could drown.

88
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,750
Ah, but you see,
a high concentration of salt

89
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,125
in the water lowers
our specific gravity.

90
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,541
Essentially meaning, we'd
float on the lake's surface

91
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,375
like driftwood.

92
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,500
[GOJYO] Great, so we can relax
while we die of thirst.

It's so pretty, though!

Well, uh, last
I checked, I'm human.

99
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,916
These three, though?
I'm not so sure, to be honest.

100

Ugh. Here we go.

106
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,875
Why can't demons ever open
with something original?

107
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,083
Excellent question.

108
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,041
It is somewhat alarming
how taken their kind

109
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,333
seem to be with cliché.

Right. Damn it.

114

What a time to be
outta cigarettes.

115
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,208
All that movin' around's
made me even hungrier.

116
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,791
What are you?

117
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,791
You can't be human.

118
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,000
[MAN 2A] That lake is the
source of our prosperity.

119
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,291
This village refines
and distributes salt.

120
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,625
It's our chief export, you see.

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,833
[MAN 2A]
We're a thriving community

122

by any reasonable standard.

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,166
Demons don't dare attack such
a robust population directly.

124
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,958
However, they do ambush
our transport wagons

125
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,583
from time to time.
Lately more than ever.

126
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,708
Who are these clowns
and why are they here?

127
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,208
[MAN 2A] Travelers, sir.
They staved off a demon attack.

128
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't say.

129
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,625
A priest and his
entourage headed West.

130
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,166
All right, let's lay it out.
Demons have attacked

131
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,875
enough drivers the
last few months

132
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,250
that it's cutting into
our bottom line.

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,875
You fix our problem,
we fix yours.

134
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,250
You need lodging and supplies,
we need a safe trade route.

135
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,500
Whoa, wait a sec.

136
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,958
We're not here to cut
a deal with you people.

137
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,958
We're here because
this slippery bastard

138
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,541
said he'd take care of us
as a thank you for saving him!

139
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,666
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

140
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,708
What? You don't
think that's fair?

141
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,500
Look, pal, nobody
asked you to help.

142
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,875
You stepped in and played
hero on your own terms.

143
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,958
Fact is, 'less you're willing
to scratch our backs,

we got no incentive
to scratch yours.

right men for the job

in the first place, huh?

00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,125
Let's go.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,291
[HAKKAI] Very well, Lord Mayor.
We graciously accept.

149
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,625
[GOKU, GOJYO]
Huh?!

Look, if we need
stuff that badly,

152
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,375
just charge it to the card!

153
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,500
Regrettably, our line
of credit doesn't extend

154
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,208
to regions this remote.

155
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,708
Please be joking.

156
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,250
[HAKKAI] It's not so much that
our credit is bad, per se.

157
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,208
More that none of the shops
here have card readers.
