162
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,666
True, the loss of life could've
been a lot worse.

163
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,416
What I don't get, though.
What was that boy doing here?

164
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,625
You mean Prince Nataku, yes?

165
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,416
[SHARAK] I understand
he'd been ordered to stop

166
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,166
the Gyumaou Resurrection
Experiment in your place, but...

167
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,666
Why then would he
show up here to fight?

168
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,625
And, why suddenly
fly back to Heaven

169
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,541
after a brief skirmish
with the four of you?

170
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,166
Who can say, really?

171
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,791
Maybe his batteries
needed to recharge.

172
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,541
His retreat did
seem rather hasty.

173
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh! Know what?

174
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,166
I think he was hungry!
He needed food.

175
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,750
[stomach growls]

176
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,375
[GOJYO] Yeah, thanks for
playin', but ya know,

177
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,250
not everyone's slave
to their stomach.

You got something better?!

[HAKKAI]
Calm down, gentlemen.

180
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,083
[SHARAK]
So, what's next?

181
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,250
If you'd like to rest,
you're more than welcome

182
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,958
to stay here as
long as you need.

183
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,625
Nah, we'll go.

184
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,708
[SHARAK]
Westward?

185
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,916
Yeah.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,333
Very well.

187
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,458
If nothing else,

188
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,875
this incident has certainly
taught me my limits.

189
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,583
The Kouten Scripture
enables me

190
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,083
to protect people,
but not everyone,

191
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,041
and not without a price.

192
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,458
I envy you.

193
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,291
I'd quash the dark aura's
source with my bare hands

194
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:29,125
if Fate so permitted. Alas,
my duties lay elsewhere.

195
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,458
Though I wish I could go.

196
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,750
I have the utmost faith in you.

We've piled your ride high with
plenty of supplies for the trip.

200
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,416
Thanks. We appreciate it.
You're too kind.

201
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,375
I prob'ly shouldn't ask...

202
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,208
[SANZO, GOKU]
Hm?

203
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,166
But do you have to leave?

204
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,333
You could stay here with us
for a little while longer

205
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,083
and help out till things
calm down, right?

206
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,708
What's it gonna be next time?

207
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,375
Bloodthirsty demons, Prince
Nataku come back for more?

208
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,791
I can't guess.

209
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,333
Sure'd be nice to have you
all here with us, though.

210
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,500
Sharak'd be pleased.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,083
I don't know about that.

212
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,083
I think she'd prefer us
to fight where she can't.

213
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,875
No, you're right.
I'm just being a fool.

214
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,458
Be careful out there.

215

Right back at'cha.

Thank you for all you've done.

delicious grub! [laughs]

Ugh. More mountains? Seriously?

219
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,000

Nausea ought not to
plague us too terribly.

Unless you try to drink it.

Aw, don't sweat it, man.

224

If you get sick and
can't take the medicine,

I'll just shove it down
your throat. No worries.

That'd be great.
You're a real friend.

Thanks a lot.

Hey, you all right, Sanzo?

requesting an audience with us.

Impudence. It's unthinkable
that such a high-ranking priest

would stoop to threaten
others of his own order.

Pardon me. But, it
sounds as though

the monkey boy.

319
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,958
Can you give us a rest from
your whining for ten seconds?

320
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,083
Yo! Kiss my ass!

321
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,291
I'm gonna die.

322
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,708
[GOJYO] Okay! We get it.
Thank you. Shut up.

323
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,000
[DEMON 12A]
Ah-ha!

324
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,250
[tires screech]

325
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,666
[DEMON 12A] Well, if it
isn't the Sanzo Party!

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,458
Ha, ha, ha!
Heads are about to roll!

327
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,666
Aw...

328
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,166
'Kay, this is startin'
to get on my nerves.

329
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,208
Ah...

330
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,916
[GOJYO]
Son of a...

331
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,583
Uh, seems like a lot.

332
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,666
Yeah. They've painted
themselves into a corner.

333
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
Quantity over quality.

334
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,416
[HAKKAI]
An obvious strategy,

335
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,625
I'll grant you, but
undoubtedly effective.

336
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,333
[GOKU] So, um, how're we
handling this?

337
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,791
You don't have a snowball's
chance in hell

338
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,333
against an army this size!
Surrender now and--!

339
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,583
[GOJYO]
Let's do this!

340
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,250
[DEMONS yelling]

341
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,916
Ugh. This is such a
royal pain in the ass.

342
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,583
Maybe we should've
head home after all.

343
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,125
[GOKU]
Seriously? Come on!

344
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
Rather anti-climatic
after the spiel

345
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
we gave the Sanbutshusin,
don't you think?

346
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,958
Lame'd be a better word.

347
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,958
[GOKU]
"Lame."

348
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,500
[HAKKAI]
Moot point, either way.

349
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,958
We wouldn't be likely to
make it back in one piece.

350
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,250
And for that matter,
how do we get there?

351
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,875
What d'you mean?
We don't have a map?

352
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,000
[SANZO] Sure, but the
landscape keeps shifting.

353
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,166
Why do you think
we're always lost?

354
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,666
Damn thing'd be better
off as toilet paper.

355
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,041
And here I thought you
were just a shit navigator.

356
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:30,750
Go figure.

357
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,666
Yeah, me, too.

358
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,541
Both of you are gonna get shot.

359
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,083
At this juncture, comrades,

360
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,750
going back would be just as
troublesome as forging ahead.

361
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,125
Best stay the course.

362
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,250
Right. And there's probably
demons waiting in ambush

363
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,458
whatever direction we go with.

364
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,208
Seems to me like a
damned-if-we-do,

365
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,083
damned-if-we-don't scenario.

366
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,083
Hey. Sanzo's the boss. What now?

367
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,666
I'll give you one guess.

368
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,416
[SANZO]
The only way out, is through.

369
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,833
[GOJYO, GOKU, HAKKAI, SANZO]
Ura Sai.

370
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,625
Kinda havin' a hard time
believin' it's over.

371
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,916
Yeah. I'm there with ya.

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,541
Huh. Who'd have thought
it'd go so fast?

373
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,958
[HAKKAI] How humbling to ponder
the blur this has been.

374
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,708
[HAKKAI] Anyone else
feeling a touch nippy?
