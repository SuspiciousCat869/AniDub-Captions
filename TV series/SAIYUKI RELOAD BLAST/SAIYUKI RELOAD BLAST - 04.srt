00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,833
[JIROSHIN]
Kanzeon Bosatsu! Please!

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,625
Your presence is requested
in the main hall right away!

3
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,333
[JIROSHIN]
It's Prince Nataku!

4
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,541
[HAKKAI]
Ages ago, Shaka Nyorai unfurled

5
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,875
a heavenly scroll bequeathed
to him from on high.

6
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,541
Thus sprang forth being and
void, light and darkness.

7
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,666
So formed a chaotic land
where life and death

8
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,875
danced in eternal struggle.

9
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,166
Wishing only for
the prosperity of all,

10
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,583
Shaka tore the scroll into
five pieces, entrusting them,

11
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,125
and the fate of the entire
world to humankind.

12
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,041
Thus were born the
founding scriptures

13
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,458
of Heaven and Earth.

14
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,041
So the story goes.

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,583
'Least as far as I can tell from
perusing the source material.

16
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,958
I didn't know that.

17
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,125
Then the five of them
actually started out as one?

18
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,375
Take it with a grain of salt:

19
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,916
I'm a successor
and can't tell you

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,416
if that's how it
really went down.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,583
Huh.

22
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,291
You know what the bigger
mystery to me is?

23
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,541
The Sanzo Party has
breathed its last!

24
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,083
[GOJYO] Why the hell you're
droning on about

25
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,833
some stupid origin myth while
we're in the middle of this.

26
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,958
[HAKKAI] To be fair, we wouldn't
be having this discussion

27
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,375
if you hadn't suggested the
scriptures were worthless.

28
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,541
If it were up to you, we'd just
throw them to the enemy.

29
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,375
[SANZO] If we're throwin' these
sons of bitches anything,

30
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,458
it's gonna be the
shithead water sprite.

31
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,291
Except he's so
heavy we'd probably

32
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,666
blow our backs out
in the process.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,708
Could we not seriously consider
tossing me, please?

34
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,375
Besides, Goku, trash collection
is only on even numbered days.

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,458
Oh, you're right.

36
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,833
He's too big for normal pickup.

37
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,208
Say your prayers, asshol--

38
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,250
[GOJYO]
Ha, ha. Very funny.

39
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,666
We'd have to double-bag you
so the trash men don't puke.

40
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,291
Garbage sorting is such a hassle

41
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,416
when you have to
account for things

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,125
like pistols and diadems.

43
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,250
Huh... Just don't
forget the recyclables.

44
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,333
[GOKU]
Anyway...

45
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,208
So if I understand you right,
this Shaka basically made

46
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,000
whatever he felt like
and forgot about it

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,458
like a kid playing in the dirt?

48
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,875
That'd be the long
and short of it.

49
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,250
Well said.

50
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,166
[GOJYO] Sounds like
my kind of holy figure.

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,041
Ya gotta admit, it's
kind of a relief to know

52
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,083
the Buddha's even more
reckless than we are!

53
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,875
Meh. Everybody's got an opinion.

54
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,541
Far as I'm concerned,
if you weren't there,

55
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,625
you got nothin' to say.

56
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,208
[KANZEON sneezes]

57
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,500
Someone must be
speaking ill of you.

58
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,250
Uh, I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,916
[KANZEON]
An old wives' tale.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,041
I have the sniffles.

61
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,041
What's going on with Nataku?

62
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,583
[JIROSHIN]
That's a very good question.

63
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,041
He's been missing for hours,

64
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,708
with no reports of anyone
seeing hide or hair of him.

65
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,708
[KANZEON]
So either some nefarious villain

66
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,125
has kidnapped him,
or he simply woke up

67
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,875
and wandered off.

68
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,208
[KANZEON sighs]

69
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,666
[KANZEON]
Has it been 500 years already?

70
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,625
[KANZEON]
"What a bloody bore." 

71
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,291
That's how the sour
look on your face

72
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,625
tends to translate.

73
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,291
Worry about your own face.

74
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,041
[KANZEON] Someone needs
a break. Come with me.

75
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,791
Gyoja Egan brought
back an animal

76
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,041
from his trip to Earth
that might intrigue you.

77
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,666
What sort of animal?

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,916
Ah.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,291
Rather ferocious little
thing with golden eyes.

80
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,583
I thought you'd like
to come see for yourself.

81
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,500
[GOKU]
I'm walking, okay!

82
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,958
You don't have to be so rough!

83
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,541
[EGAN] Stop screeching
and show some respect!

84
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,291
You say he came from a rock?

85
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,666
I do.

86
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,500
Which means he's neither
human nor demon.

87
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,333
This creature was born
of the earth itself.

88
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,125
Just so you know, I was
told there'd be food!

89
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,583
Dirty liar!

90
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, yes. He's an animal.

91
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,083
[EGAN]
You'll note the child's eyes.

92
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,041
The unmistakable tint of gold.

93
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,958
Ancient wisdom holds that
children born with such eyes

94
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,583
bring misfortune.

95
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,000
Thus, I humbly submit to
your judgment on the matter

96
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,000
of what's to be done with him.

97
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
Do you indeed?

98
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,625
Because we of Heaven
are pacifists.

99
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,416
You know we couldn't bring
ourselves to dispose of him.

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,333
Shaka must think
we're a nursery.

101
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,750
[KANZEON] Kindly tell him
we do not take in strays.

102
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,666
[JIROSHIN]
There's no need to be rude!

103
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,125
What do you want?

104
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,083
[GOKU]
Wow! Your hair is so shiny.

105
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,291
It looks like the sun!

106
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,583
I'm sorry, sir!

107
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,416
He knows not what he does!

108
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,500
My bad.

109
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,333
Vile thing!

110
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,750
What in the name of all that
is holy makes you think

111
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,916
you can pull a man's hair,
you monkey boy?

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
[EGAN]
Forgive him, Douji Konzen!

113
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,125
Huh. Never mind.

114
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,458
I take back what
I said. He stays.

115
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,083
You cannot be serious!

116
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,958
Might I point out that
you've yet to take care

117
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,416
of so much as a flower?

118
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,041
[KANZEON]
Did I ask for you assessment?

119
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,291
Who said I would be the
one taking care of him?

120
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,708
[JIROSHIN]
Huh?

121
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,333
[KANZEON] That honor I put
squarely on the shoulders

122
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,166
of my nephew.

123
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,125
[gasps]

124
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,083
What? What are you playing at?

125
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,166
You-- You hag!

126
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,500
You should be pleased.

127
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,208
This comes from a bodhisattva.

128
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,375
"It looks like the sun," eh?

129
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,583
You should save that and use
it as a pickup line someday.

130
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,750
[KONZEN]
Uh...

131
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,833
[KONZEN] Where'd he run off
to now? Stupid monkey!

132
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,958
[MAN 4A]
Konzen, sir. What's going on?

133
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,916
[KONZEN] The little bastard
used important documents

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,708
for origami! He's through!

135
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,041
He's not getting away
with it anymore! Mark me!

136
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,625
[GOKU]
Uh-oh.

137
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,708
For someone so pretty he's sure
got a heck of an ugly temper.

138
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,666
Not to mention he's violent.

139
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,583
Yeah, I should find
a good hiding spot.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,875
[GOKU] I don't so much mind
how heavy these things are,

141
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,458
or how painful, or even that
they're so friggin' cold.

142
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,041
But why do I have to
wear them all the time?

143
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,583
I don't understand.

144
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,875
Do they not want me
here or something?

145
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,416
Earth had blue skies
and green, rolling hills.

146
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,333
The water was cool.
The wind was warm.

147
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,625
The people I met
were always nice.

148
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,500
Around here, though...
They're all so stuffy.

149
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,708
'Cept the blond guy makes
me think of the sun,

150
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,458
so there's that.
Kinda comforting in a way.

151
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,458
[GOKU]
Seems like a good spot.

152
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,250
I wonder what room
this is? Whatever.

153
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,416
[NATAKU]
Hey.

154
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,541
Who are you? What's your name?

155
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,500
[GOKU] Huh? He looks
the same age as me!

156
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,500
Are you deaf?
I asked you for a name.

157
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, uh...

158
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,291
[GOKU]
I... I don't know. Who am I?

159
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,250
--[footsteps]
--Damn it, they've found me!

160
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,125
[gasps]

161
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,958
[NATAKU]
Shh. Just come on!

162
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,375
I know you're here, Nataku!

163
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,333
What? [growls]

164
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,208
Your Highness,
this is getting old.

165
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,083
[chuckles] Imbecile.

166
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,208
Are you hiding for fun,

167
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,250
or 'cause you did
something bad, too?

168
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,875
It wasn't that big of a deal.

169
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,083
The high 'n mighty Tentei
was taking a nap.

170
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,000
I just drew some
nose hair on him.

171
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,416
I thought it looked tasteful.

172
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
[laughs] Classic! I wish
I could've seen it! Wow!

173
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,708
[NATAKU] Right? I should've
commissioned a portrait!

174
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,625
You have a sense
of humor. That's good.

175
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,166
My name's Nataku. What's yours?

176
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,625
Oh, uh. I don't
really have one yet.

177
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,666
There was no one around
to give me a name, so...

178
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Apparently that
makes me a weirdo.

179
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,958
Well, that and 'cause I was
born from a rock, I guess.

180
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,833
And my eyes are gold-colored,

181
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,583
which is s'posed to be bad luck,
so they keep me here.

182
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,958
Ah. I'm not sure I understand,

183
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,583
but it sounds awesome to me.

184
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
Huh?

185
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,291
[NATAKU] There's only one
of you in the entire world.

186
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,833
Which means nobody could
ever take your place.

187
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,458
It makes you special.

188
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,333
I thought I heard the
sound of your voice!

189
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
[gasps]

190
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,458
[MAN 4B] Please return to
the main hall, Your Highness.

191
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,875
[NATAKU]
Ugh. Fine.

192
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,625
[GOKU]
Nataku! Can we play again soon?

193
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,458
Yeah! Absolutely!

194
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,000
[laughs]

195
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,291
[KONZEN]
You made a friend?

196
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,916
[GOKU] Yep! Sorta full of
himself maybe, but fun!

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,750
I'm told it's good to have fun.

198
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,125
[GOKU]
It is!

199
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,083
[KONZEN] But there's no one
here remotely his age

200
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,416
apart from...

201
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,250
Nah. Couldn't be.

202
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,500
What do you want?

203
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,333
Well I was just wondering...

204
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,958
Can you please give me a name?

205
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,541
That certainly came
out of nowhere.

206
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,083
My new friend asked me!

207
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,708
I wanna be able to tell him.

208
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,916
C'mon, please?
I need one! Right?

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,041
Fine. I'll give it some thought.

210
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,791
Konzen! Don't think!
Just give me one!

211
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,833
Sure. Whatever.
How about "Monkey?"

212
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,916
[GOKU] I'm not kidding around!
Take this seriously!

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,375
Why you...!

214
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,333
[GOKU whimpers]

215
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,916
[KONZEN sighs]

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,875
[KONZEN]
Goku.

217
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,500
There. Happy?

218
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,375
Best to keep it short and sweet.

219
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,083
That monkey brain can
only hold so much.

220
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,833
"Goku." I like it.

221
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,708
It feels like a pretty good fit.

222
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291
Wait, what's it mean?

223
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,000
[KONZEN]
Stop talking and go to sleep.

224
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,750
[GOKU]
Don't be a jerk!

225
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,083
[TENPOU] I know I haven't
been around lately,

226
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,500
but damn if things haven't
gotten interesting.

227
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,041
No kidding.

228
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,916
Hi! My name's Goku!

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,791
What're you called, mister?

230
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,541
I'm not quite old enough
to be a "mister" just yet.

231
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,708
Let's say I'm an old
acquaintance of Konzen here.

232
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,666
Nobody special.
Tenpou to be specific.

233
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,166
Cool! That's a great name, too!

234
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,375
Why are you suddenly better

235
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,250
at talking to little
kids that I remember?

236
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,375
You're the field marshal
for Heaven's western army

237
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,208
for crying out loud.

238
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,666
Beats me. Why are you suddenly
so much more full of life

239
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,000
than I remember?
Are things that good?

240
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,416
"Goku."

241
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Doesn't that mean "one who
sees what others cannot?"

242
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,083
Now that's a great name.

243
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,125
[sighs] I don't need this.

244
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,333
So, does what they're saying
about the troublemaker

245
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,958
in your midst hold any water?

246
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,416
Afraid so.

247
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,166
Though he's somewhat larger
in stature than your Goku.

248
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,000
I hear his name in Kenren.

249
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,250
Rumor has it, since he's
enlisted, the top brass

250
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,708
have been watching
him like a hawk

251
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,333
on account of his prowess,
which drives them mad.

252
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,333
[TENPOU]
Seems about right.

253
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,208
You'd think the brass
would've figured out by now

254
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,833
it only makes them look like
they've got something to hide.

255
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,625
[KONZEN]
So he does know.

256
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,875
He's letting this Kenren fellow
run loose just to rile them up.

257
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,916
Exactly what I'd expect.

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,791
Once a strategist,
always a strategist.

259
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,166
[MAN 4C] War God
Prince Nataku, come forth!

260
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,875
You think he's actually
here this time?

261
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,958
Where do they get off making

262
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,875
that cocky little
brat a war god?

263
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,291
He killed a monster
several times his own size.

264
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,083
Took him down in a
single blow, I hear.

265
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,416
Word is he's been possessed

266
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,333
by a demon from birth.
I don't know how long--

267
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,833
'Less you plan on speakin' up,

268
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,041
I suggest you shut
your pie hole.

269
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,750
Prince Nataku.

270
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,041
No doubt you know why
I've summoned you today.

271
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,583
I can still see some of
the nose hairs I drew, sir.

272
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,083
[TENTEI]
Silence.

273
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,458
My sense of mercy dictates
I let your childish whims be.

274
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm burdening you
with a great task.

275
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,000
Prince Nataku.

276
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,208
You are hereby ordered
to journey to Earth

277
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,750
and subdue the infamous
demon, Gyumaou,

278
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,500
the beast that
devours human beings

279
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,916
and sows strife
across the lands.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,083
[TENTEI chuckles]
This should prove simple

281
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:37,958
for one of your invaluable
gifts. Do you accept this honor?

282
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,875
[NATAKU]
You're all a bunch of losers.

283
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,166
I'm your killing
machine, is that it?

284
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,875
Only good for cleaning
up your messes?

285
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,666
At least I'll never grow up
to be a worthless adult.

286
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,041
Not ever.

287
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,500
Your Grace.

288
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,708
[KENREN grunts]

289
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,958
Uh-- Oh, sorry!

290
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,958
[KENREN]
Golden eyes?

291
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,458
[GOKU]
Late--!

292
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,625
Whoa. Where ya goin'?

293
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,583
[GOKU]
Ow! Why'd you pull my hair?

294
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,458
Are you the kid Tenpou
was tellin' me about?

295
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,333
Yeah! Who're you, mister?
One of his friends?

296
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,708
[KENREN]
Did you just call me "mister"?

297
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,041
[MAN 4D]
General Kenren!

298
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,250
Forgive me.

299
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,958
The child was wandering
about palace grounds

300
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,250
without permission. We have
no idea how he got in.

301
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,125
[KENREN]
Ah, no worries. He's cool.

302
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,208
[MAN 4E] Uh. You're familiar
with the boy, sir?

303
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,708
Yeah. Sure. He's my bastard son.

304
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,833
[MEN gasp]

305
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,541
[KENREN laughs]

306
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,750
[KANZEON]
What's this?

307
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,125
From the kid. He thought
they looked pretty.

308
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,166
Probably yanked them
out of the garden.

309
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,500
[KANZEON]
Well, they are rather pretty.

310
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,833
I suppose so.

311
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,583
[KANZEON chuckles]
You're different, Konzen.

312
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,958
[KONZEN]
How so?

313
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,375
Not in a bad way.

314
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,375
Change keeps things from
getting too comfortable.

315
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,291
Better than being bored, eh?

316
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,541
[KONZEN]
Yeah.

317
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,875
[KENREN]
All right.

318
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,750
But what was the point of
sneaking into this one?

319
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,708
Konzen's in a whole
other building.

320
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:07,125
Well, see. It's just that
I ran into Nataku here

321
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,625
the other day and I thought...

322
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,750
Nataku?

323
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,791
Yeah! He's a really neat guy!

324
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,708
I didn't have a name the
last time we saw each other

325
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,791
and now that I do,
I want him to know what it is!

326
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,833
[KENREN] Killing machine's
made himself a friend, did he?

327
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,833
Huh?

328
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,750
[KENREN]
Uh, nothing. Sorry, buddy.

329
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,541
Nataku's gone to Earth.

330
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,958
Huh? What he go n' do that for?

331
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,041
Don't sweat it.

332
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,875
He'll be back tomorrow
or the next da--

333
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,750
Damn, somebody fill
you with rocks?

334
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,458
Oh. Nah. It's these things.

335
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,041
[KENREN]
Is he joking?

336
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,916
Those shackles have
to weigh 50 pounds each.

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,541
How's he moving around in 'em
like they're made of paper?

338
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,000
And, for that matter,
how much of a threat

339
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,375
does he pose that measures
like this are even necessary?

340
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,875
[MAN 4F]
General Kenren, sir!

341
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,875
Prince Nataku has returned
from conquering Gyumaou!

342
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,375
He's already back?

343
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,750
Something must've gone wrong.

344
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,625
Thankfully, sir, he was
successful in his mission.

345
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,333
However...

346
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,416
[MAN 4G]
Nataku!

347
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,583
[MAN 4H]
Are you injured, Your Highness?

348
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,958
Don't touch me!

349
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,166
[gasps]

350
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,375
[GOKU]
Nataku! What's going on?

351
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,833
Why are you covered in red?

352
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,500
It's the kid from the other day.

353
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,875
[SERVANTS gasp]

354
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,083
[gasps] Nataku!

355
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,166
[KENREN] Huh. Didn't take
the li'l war god very long.

356
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,458
He dispatched Gyumaou
rather quickly, eh?

357
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,083
[KENREN]
Took more 'n his share of hits,

358
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,291
from the looks of it.

359
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,333
Is something on your mind?

360
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,500
Not much. Just the fact
that the other soldiers

361
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,000
all came back unscathed...

362
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,916
Seems sorta odd.

363
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,375
It's a safe assumption they left

364
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,208
the killing machine to do
the dirty work own his own.

365
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,333
Where's his highness being kept?

366
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,583
[KENREN]
In his room, for treatment.

367
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,041
The monkey boy Konzen took in
refuses to leave his side.

368
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,375
[TENPOU]
Goku?

369
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,208
I caught the
golden-eyed monstrosity

370
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,125
giving palace staff
the slip earlier.

371
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,375
Kid didn't really strike me
as an obvious heretic.

372
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,041
But, hey, he is in shackles,

373
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,916
so they must know
something I don't.

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,875
Seems excessive, not that
it's any of my business.

375
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,833
The people of Heaven
have a strict policy

376
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,750
with regard to heretics.

377
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,583
Goku's not their only concern.
Nataku's in the same boat.

378
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,833
[VOICE 4A] Monster! Your
existence is an abomination!

379
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,416
[LI TOUTEN'S WIFE] Such a beast
came not from my loins!

380
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,833
I renounce him!

381
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,458
[VOICE 4B]
The lady has lost her wits!

382
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,625
You should be ashamed!

383
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,000
[NATAKU]
Stop it.

384
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,416
You were sired for the
purpose of dying in battle.

385
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,291
You will perish in blood
and no soul shall mourn.

386
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,208
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

387
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
[GOKU]
Nataku!

388
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,500
[gasps] You.

389
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,666
Oh, thank goodness!

390
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,166
You haven't opened
your eyes in so long,

391
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,333
I was starting to worry
maybe you never would!

392
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,208
Are you okay?

393
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
Sure.

394
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,875
[NATAKU]
That's right.

395
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,250
I'm back in Heaven
after defeating Gyumaou.

396
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,458
Hey, is this really your room?

397
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,625
Looks more like a dungeon
or an underground hideout.

398
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,875
What kind of jerk keeps you
holed away in a place like this?

399
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,833
You get used to it.
It's not all that bad.

400
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,541
What else are they
gonna do with me?

401
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
Not like anybody cares.

402
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,375
What's that supposed to mean?

403
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,333
Come on! Don't say that! I care!

404
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,333
[GOKU]
You told me I was awesome!

405
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,416
No one's ever said that
before! It felt good! Ha!

406
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,333
When you said we'd play again,
it felt even better!

407
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Oh, yeah. Know what?

408
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,916
When I'm healed up, I'm gonna
give you the grand tour!

409
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,041
You won't believe all
the great hiding spots!

410
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,791
Raspberries grow in one of 'em!

411
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,500
[GOKU]
Raspberries? Count me in!

[grunts]

413
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,750
[GOKU] Careful.
You shouldn't be moving.

414
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,416
I'll get somebody.

415
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,416
I'm fine. Please don't go.

416
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,541
[KONZEN] At this rate,
we'll have a menagerie.

417
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,333
[MAN 4I]
Hear ye! Hear ye!

418

The Tentei shall now honor us
with his birthday address!

[TENTEI]
I thank you for gathering...

420
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,625
[LI TOUTEN]
You seem restless.

421
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,125
Quite the contrary, sir. Father.

422
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,666
Take in every last detail, son.

423
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,333
One day, I'll take the Tentei's
place atop those steps.

424
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,458
Yes. And whom do you
think will succeed me?

425
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,541
Ponder it.

426
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,250
[NATAKU]
That glint in his eye.

427
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,666
I hate when he gets like this.

428
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,333
[NATAKU]
Yes, sir.

filthy brat think he is?

Yeah! He ought'a watch
where he's goin'!

Seriously? I don't think so!

00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,583
You're the ones
who bumped into me!

433
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,166
[gasps] Hold on--
he's got golden eyes.

434
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,208
[MAN 4K] He does.
You know what that means?

00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,000
[MAN 4J] Punk's not just
some street urchin.

436
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
He's a heretic from Earth!

437
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,166
Isn't he Douji Konzen's
ward? What's that about?

438
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,875
Heaven's malcontent caring
for an abomination?

439
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,875
Either he can't tell
what color his eyes are

440
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,875
or he gets so lonely
at night anyone'll do.

441
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,958
Um. Whatever you said,
I'm pretty sure it wasn't nice!

442

Anybody who says anything nasty
about Konzen will answer to me!

Good sir, isn't raising
your hand to a young child

00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:07,958
beneath you?

Ha, ha! You tell 'em, Ten!

447
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,666
In the future,
I urge you to consider

448
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,708
such behavior incentive to
display your own maturity.

449
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,666
No soldier's gonna
speak to me like that!

[KENREN]
Easy.

00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,375
Who called a free-for all
without tellin' me?

460
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,000
All right if I throw in?

00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,375
Oh, hey, Kenren!

462
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,750
Just when I thought
this couldn't get

463
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,875
any more complicated.

464
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,291
Nice try, Ten.

465
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,541
Don't try to act like you
aren't as sick of hearing

the old fart ramble as I am.

No time like the present
for shaking shit up!

Get some no-holds-barred
action right here!

00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,708
Aw, yeah! I'm lovin' this!

472
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,041
Wow.

473
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,750
Quite a few more people
hate you than I realized.

474
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,416
Sorry. Hatin' me is
essentially the same thing

475
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,833
as hating you, sweetheart.

476
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,375
Um.

477
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,708
I'll thank you not to talk to me
like we're a married couple.

478
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,916
[GOKU]
Yeah-ha! They're both so strong!

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,083
This looks fun!

480
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,500
[GOKU]
Ten! Look out!

481
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,208
Not bad, monkey.

482
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,833
Ugh! Don't call me that!

483
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,875
[gasps] It's him!

484
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,666
[KONZEN]
Goku! Goku!

485
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,833
Huh?

486
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,583
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

487
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,125
Hi, Konzen!

488
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,583
How many times have I told you
not to run off by yourself?

489
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,166
Sorry! Sorry! Aargh!

490
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,083
[KENREN]
C'mon. He was holding his own.

491
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,333
You ought'a be proud--

492
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,416
[KONZEN] Take your hand
off of me. Who are you?

493
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,708
You know me, pretty boy.

494
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,333
I'm the rowdy general.

495
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,333
You're General Kenren,
aren't you? Huh.

496
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,833
Are these hooligans
bothering you?

497
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,375
[KONZEN]
It's okay. They're with me.

498
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,583
We take full responsibility
for this disturbance

499
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,375
and we will be on our way.

500
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,291
[TENPOU]
Are you sure?

501
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,083
You do realize we're
stirring up trouble

502
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,958
for no good reason?

503
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:04,041
That's fine--whatever gives me
an excuse to get out of here.

504
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,708
[HAKKAI]
Next episode: "Flower Banquet."

505
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,083
Don't miss it.

506
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,416
Ready, and...

507
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
[GOJYO, GOKU, HAKKAI, SANZO]
Ura Sai!

508
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,583
[HAKKAI] This fan letter
comes to us from Tokyo.

509
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,458
Kiritanpo asks, "What does
Goku do with his diadem

510
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:01,250
when he's washing his
hair." Good question.

511
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,708
Ready when you are.

512
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,208
[GOKU]
'Kay.

513
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,000
[BOTH sigh]
