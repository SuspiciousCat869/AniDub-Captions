00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,875
[laughing]

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Dr. McFife was a
brilliant scientist,

161
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,500
and I believe he built and
activated that Monster Car

162
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
just before he went
completely whacky.

163
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,458
[POPS]
Judging by what Dr. McFife said

164
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,708
about no one being in the car,

165
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,208
I figure that the
car's being operated

166
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,000
by its own built-in
electronic brain.

167
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,375
Electronic brain?

168
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,750
That would explain
why the doctor said

169
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,416
that no one will be
able to stop the car!

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,916
[CHIEF]
It makes sense!

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,541
[POPS] Hmm, and that electronic
brain has been programmed

172
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,833
to keep the car attacking and
destroying everything in sight!

173
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,583
It'll be impossible to stop!

174
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,416
[CHIEF] Let me show ya
something on this map.

175
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,250
The reports coming in here
to police headquarters

176
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,583
indicate that the Monster Car
is following this path

177
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,125
across both land and water.

178
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,166
What? The Monster Car's
able to cross water?

179
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
Yes, it obviously can.

180
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,166
It must cross Crooked Straits
to follow the course on the map.

181
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,666
Poor Mr. McFife must've had some
grudge against Burrup County

182
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,375
to build a monster car
and program it

183
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,833
to create mayhem
throughout Burrup.

184
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,166
[POPS]
Hmm...

185
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,541
Part of the trouble is
that the electronic brain

186
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,375
probably has been
programmed to attack anybody

187
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,333
who tries to attack
the Monster Car.

188
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,458
Western Burrup County
is making elaborate plans

189
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,875
to fight the Monster Car if and
when it crosses Crooked Straits

190
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,708
and resumes
its terrible attacks.

191
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,041
Pops, that might be the best
time to try to attack the car.

192
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,541
While it's submerged
in the water,

193
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,583
it will be weaker and slower
and more vulnerable, I hope.

194
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,041
[POPS]
You're right, Speed!

195
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
That may be the only chance
to successfully attack it.

196
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,375
[TRIXIE]
But won't it be too dangerous?

197
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,958
[POPS]
Possibly.

198
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,416
I will send our Navy after it.
We'll attack it with submarines.

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,708
[SPEED]
Oh...

200
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,458
[POPS] Speed, before
the car enters the water,

201
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,583
let's see if we can
spot its weakest point.

202
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,083
--[SPEED] That's a good idea...!
--Come on!

203
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:18,791
[SPEED]
Right.

204
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,208
[TRIXIE]
Be careful!

205
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,583
They're not taking us with 'em.

206
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,958
Come on, Spritle,

207
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,333
we'll cross Crooked
Straits in my helicopter!

208
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh boy! Let's go!

209
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,166
You know, Pops, I found
out that the Monster Car

210
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,708
has rocket engines.

211
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,916
Then it's fueled by
metal alcohol, I bet.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,250
[SPEED] And that stuff
burns pretty fast,

213
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,833
so its fuel supply
can't last long.

214
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,333
It'll run out of gas before it
can get across Crooked Straits.

215
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,291
You may be right, Speed.
I sure hope you are.

216
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,583
It won't be long
before we find out.

217
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,416
Here comes the Monster Car now!

218
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,125
It's going to try to
cross the straits! Huh?!

219
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,166
[gasps]

220
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,583
[POPS]
They're going to bomb the car!

221
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,041
The car's equipped
with a deflector ray!

222
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,958
Ah! Duck, Speed! Get down!

223
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,750
[BOTH gasp]

224
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,250
It's headed for the lighthouse,

225
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,541
and that's needed to guide
the ships through the straits

226
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,375
so they won't crash
on the rocks!

227
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,208
Pops, what's the car
doing with that pipe?

228
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,291
I dunno!

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,958
It started up again!

230
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,958
[POPS]
Hmm...

231
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,208
[SPEED]
Let's go!

232
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,416
[POPS]
Hmm...

233
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
Now I remember.

234
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,250
Speed, this used to be a fueling
station for passing freighters.

235
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,416
Years ago, they'd
anchor offshore

236
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
and the oil would be
pumped out of them.

237
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,083
The only way we can
stop that car now

238
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,708
is sneak on and put it
out of commission.

239
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,583
Okay, then.

240
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,916
Speed, where're you going?!

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,666
I'm gonna try to sneak
on board the Monster Car!

242
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,416
Wait, Speed! Stop!

243
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,791
Speed!

244
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,458
[whirring]

245
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,208
Speed just drove the
Mach 5 into the water!

246
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,333
[SPEED]
Oh...

247
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,958
We've spotted the Monster Car!

248
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,500
Fire torpedoes!

249
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,625
Idiot! We must destroy that car!

250
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,333
How I'm gonna get in it?

251
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,500
So that's it!
There's a door on the bottom!

252

[COMMANDER B]
Uh-oh!

Get ready, take aim!

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,708
[COMMANDER B]
Fire!

255
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,208
He'll never be able to
get across those straits

256
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,041
in the Mach 5.

257
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,125
He shouldn't have tried to.

258
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,458
I'm worried.

259
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,833
Look! What's that down there?

260
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,833
It's our car.

so glad you're all right!

Learn anything?

264
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,208
Yes, Pops, I sure did.

265
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,666
I found out how we
can get on board

266
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,958
the Monster Car to stop it.

267
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,833
There's a door that opens
in the bottom of it.

268
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,500
Then come on, let's report
what you've found out

[BOARD LEADER] This is an
Electronic Brain Rattler.

279
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
It will scramble the thoughts

280
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,041
of an electronic brain
for a few minutes.

281
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,541
It might scramble the electronic
brain of the Monster Car,

282

at least for a short time.

283

Let's hope so.
We'd better try it right now.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,625
But how will we make it work?

285
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,791
[BOARD LEADER] Someone must get
very close to the Monster Car.

286

The closer, the better.

287
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,708
Then they must try
to work this rattler.

288
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,375
Of course, it will be a very
dangerous mission,

289

but it's our only chance!

00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,875
Sir, I have
important information

291
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,041
about the Monster Car!

292
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,750
Dr. McFife has just revealed

293
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,166
that when the car
reaches the center

294
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,291
of our military fortifications,
it will blow itself up!

295
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,375
The explosives inside
the car are so powerful,

296
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,416
that if they go off,
they'll destroy almost all

297
