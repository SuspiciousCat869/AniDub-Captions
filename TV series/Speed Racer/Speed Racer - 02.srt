of the most powerful

18
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,500
and amazing racing car
in the world, the Mach 5.

19
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,791
Control A releases powerful
jacks to boost the car,

20
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,583
so that Sparky, our
mechanic, can quickly

21
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,500
make any necessary
repairs or adjustments.

22
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,291
Control B: Press this button
and the Mach 5 sprouts

23
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,333
special grip tires for traction
over any kind of terrain.

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,625
At the same time,
5,000 horsepower is

25
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,083
distributed equally to each
wheel by auxiliary engines.

26
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,041
Control C: For use
when I have to

27
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,041
race over heavily
wooded terrain.

28
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,958

to slash and cut any

31
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,000
This is Control Button D.

32
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,250
Which, when pressed,
releases a powerful deflector,

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,500
which seals the cockpit
into an air-conditioned,

34
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,041
bullet and crash-proof,
and water-tight chamber.

35
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,083
Inside it, I am completely
isolated and shielded.

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,958
E: The control for
special illumination.

37
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,875
Which can be traversed
singly or in tandem.

38
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,750
And which enables me
to see much further

and more clearly than
with ordinary headlights.

[SPEED]
This is Control F, which I use

43
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,541
when the Mach 5 is underwater.

44
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,875
First, the cockpit
is supplied with oxygen.

45
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,500
Then, a periscope is raised to
scan the surface of the water.

46
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,625
Everything that is seen

47
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,375
is relayed down
to me by television.

48

[SPEED] Control G
releases a homing robot

49
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,708
from the front of the car.

50
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,416
The homing robot
can carry pictures

51
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,583
or tape recorded messages

52

to whomever and wherever
I wanna send them.

53

The Mach 5 is the most complex
and ingenious car ever built--

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,583
A tribute to my
father's imagination,

55

genius, and technical skill.

56
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,333
The Mach 5 always was a great
car, but a couple of years ago,

57
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,666
Pops drew up the designs for
making it the car it now is.

58
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,708
Because certain men were
after those plans, he hid them

59
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,208
by drawing them in invisible
ink on the windshield

60
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,333
Sparky and I installed
on the Mach 5.

61
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,541
Pops needed money
to rebuild the car.

62
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,041
So, against his wishes, I
entered the Sword Mountain Race

63
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,791
to try to win the
$5,000 prize money.

64
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,125
However, Ace Ducey and
his men came after me

65
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,833

windshield with the plans.

the results of the race
have been cancelled!

323
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,708
There is no winner and
no losers! I'm sorry, folks,

324
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,291
but you'll just have to
forget the whole thing!

325
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,291
And I was counting
on that money!

326
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,541
[DUGGERY chuckles]

327
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,208
Too bad! That was
tough luck, Speed.

328
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,916
Gee, I'm sorry, Pops. But if I
hadn't smashed the windshield,

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,791
those men would've gotten your
designs for the new Mach 5!

330
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,458
I'm not saying
a word about that.

331
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,333
Huh?!

332
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,000
[POPS chuckles]

333
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,333
I'm glad you broke it to
protect the designs, Speed,

334
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,291
because I've got them
right up here in my head.

335
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,083
Gee, that's great, Pops!

336
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,375
[laughs]

337
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,666
You're a very clever
man, Mr. Racer!

338
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,333
And some of it's
rubbed off on me! Right?

339
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,875
[POPS]
Hm... Well, Spritle, I hope so.

340
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,166
I intend to be the winner
of the next race I'm in.

341
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,000
You can count on it!

342
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,750
[POPS] That's the way I like
to hear you talk, Speed.

343
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,125
The next race you're in--
Hey! Wait just a minute!

344
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,500
[BOTH gasp]

345
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,958
Who gave you permission
to be a racer, huh?!

346
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,166
It's very difficult
to be a racer.

347
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,291
It takes training
and experience!

348
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,500
Don't think that
because you won today,

349
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,750
you've already become
a professional racer!

350
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,750
[SPEED] That's enough
lecture for now, Pops.

351
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,208
--[POPS] Huh?!
--[SPEED] See ya later!

352
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,708
[POPS]
Speed!

353
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:12,875
[GROUP laughing]

354
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,583
Speed, you come back here!

355
