160
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,708
I would marry the winner!

161
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,375
Eh... The driver I would
like you to marry

162
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,000
is that one!

163
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,458
[TRIXIE]
Oh...

164
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,416
He looks as if he might be
the bravest man in the race,

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,250
and, if he is, then he's the
right one for my granddaughter.

166
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,875
But suppose he doesn't
wanna marry her!

167
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,833
I'd be glad to
be her bridegroom.

168
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,125
Will you be able to
beat Kabala tomorrow?

169
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,791
[KADAR]
Kabala? He's going to race?

170
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,208
Kabala will race and win.

171
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,791
Nobody is going to
be able to beat him.

172
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,666
[CHANCELLOR] Hmm... You're
positive Kabala will be in it?

173
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,291
Huh? Of course I am.

174
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,458
But it doesn't make sense to me.
Kabala disappeared years ago

175
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,500
and nobody has seen him or
knows what happened to him.

176
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,125
He might not be alive.

177
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,208
Racers, let me inform you
about Kabala of Kapedapek,

178
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,000
the bravest, fastest, and most
skilled driver in the world.

179
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,916
[ZUMA] This is Kabala's home,
and over on that wall

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,958
are pictures of the
racers he has beaten.

181
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,000
Those skulls in the upper-right
corners denote that those racers

182
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,958
never were able to race again.

183
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,708
A rogue's gallery of defeat.

184
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,708
Soon, these pictures will
have skulls in the corners.

00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,833
Where's the treasure
of Kapedapek hidden?

189
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,208
All of my country's wealth!

190
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,541
That's right. I want to know

191
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,458
where that treasure
is kept hidden.

192
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
It's kept secret even from me!

193
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,333
[KADAR]
Is that so?

194
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,375
Stop lying, Sibana.
I want that treasure,

195
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,208
and I'll stop at
nothing till I get it.

196
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,333
I'm not lying about it!
Grandfather wants to keep

197
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,916
our borders closed
against men like you!

198

Tell me where the treasure
is or you'll be sorry!

I'll get even
with Speed Racer...

208
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,500
[ZUMA] Racers of the world,
I have just received a challenge

209
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,541
from the great Kabala.

210
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,791
Impossible! Kabala's dead.

211
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,166
[ZUMA] I have been told
by Kabala to warn you

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,541
that whoever races against him
tomorrow will never race again.

213
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,416
Your cars will be
smashed off the road

214
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,166
and it will be the end of you.

215
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,208
The end! Remember, whoever
races against Kabala

216
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,416
will meet with
terrible disaster.

217
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,333
[SPEED] I've got to take my
chances... and I've got to win.

Wow, I was really
scared for a minute.

225
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,000
I thought there were
ghosts out on the water.

226
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,041
Gentleman, the rafts will
bring your cars downstream.

227
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,166
Why are there so many bones
lying over there on the bank?

228
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,666
They're the bones
of men who tried to

229
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,208
get into our country and failed.

230
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,666
My grandfather leaves them
there as a warning to others.

231
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,250
This place is a dead-end.
It's impossible to race here.

232
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,916
Was everyone brought
here to race or explode?

233
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,125
[SIBANA] This is the secret
entrance to the most beautiful

and interesting part
of our country.

Very few people
have ever seen it.

Why do you keep it locked up?

237
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,541
My grandfather doesn't
want strangers ruining it.

238
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,250
They could spoil it forever.

239
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,208
Well, we're strangers.
Aren't you afraid of us?

Oh, but we're strangers, right?

Well, I don't think we're
going to destroy anything.

Oh, you wouldn't understand!

[ZUMA] The ancient city
of my ancestors.

247

The tribes of
Kapedapek lived here.

Looks like a fairy tale city.

If only those ruins could talk;
what a story they might tell.

The rest of the
treasure must be nearby.

When I find it,
I'll be a very rich man.

[SIBANA] Oh, Speed, I hope
you'll win the race tomorrow.

259
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
That way, you'll prove to my
grandfather there's somebody

260
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,041
in the outside world
who's braver than Kabala.

I'll do my best to win,
Sibana, but I don't even know

00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,750
when the race is
scheduled to begin.

263
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,250
[SIBANA] Look over at
the volcano. When it erupts,

264
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,958
the Fire Festival starts
and the race will begin.

265
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:39,916
When it erupts, huh?

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,166
[SIBANA]
Yes!

267
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,208
Oh! Hmph!

00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,041
Uh-oh...

[screaming]

270
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,500
Now it's almost time
for the race to begin.

271
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,750
The race to decide whether
or not my country's borders

272
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,208
will be open to the world.

273
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,875
Once every hundred years,
a volcanic tunnel is opened

274
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,791
underground, and today,
it should open!

275
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,791
[rumbling]

276
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,708
The race will be through
this volcanic tunnel

277
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,666
and will end at Mt. Rumble.

278
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,125
Whatever man makes it
through this terrible tunnel

279
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,833
will be acclaimed the
bravest man in the world,

280
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,791
and he will marry
my granddaughter.

281
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,875
The volcanic tunnel
is 800 miles long.

282
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,708
If you do not reach the
exit within five hours,

283
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,875
it will close, and you
will be trapped forever.

284
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,083
That really means it's
going to be a race for life.

285
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,000
It also means that, to win,
the average speed of the Mach 5

286
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,125
will have to be over
160 miles an hour!

287
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,250
[gasps]

288

[gasping]

289
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,208
You must heed my warning!
During the race,

290
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,458
you must not touch the
treasure of Kapedapek!

291
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,833
If you do, you will
pay with your life!

292
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,916
[KADAR] You wouldn't say that
unless the treasure is hidden

293
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,708
somewhere along the course.
That's all I need to know.

294
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,000
[gasping]

295
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,500
You're cowards! All of you!

296
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,833
Kabala of Kapedapek would not
be frightened as you are!

297
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,083
By the way, I noticed Kabala
hasn't shown up yet.

298
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,875
I wonder where he could be.

299
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,000
He will get here.
He will join the race.

300
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,625
[chuckles] We will
see about that...

301
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,750
[ZUMA]
Now!

302
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
Remember, Speed,
you've got to average

303
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,750
160 miles an hour
in order ot get out of

304
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,708
the tunnel before it closes
for another hundred years.

305
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,041
[SPARKY]
Get ready!

306
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,291
Go, Speed! Go!

307
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,583
[SPARKY]
Go!

308
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,916
Good luck!

309
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,208
Why don't you give up, Chief?
Kabala isn't going to make it.

310
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,750
The volcano will erupt once
again, and before it does,

311
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,416
Kabala will come.

312
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,750
Look at those cowards!

313
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,250
They're quitting the race
even before it starts!

314
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,750
Could it be that Kabala is
even too afraid to show up?

315
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,416
[gasps] Ohh...

316
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,083
[ZUMA] There he is!
There's Kabala of Kapedapek!

317
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,375
Now we're going to win!
Nobody can beat Kabala!

318
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,625
Nobody in the world!

319
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,500
I can't believe it!
That's him all right!

320
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,000
When the mountain
erupts this time,

321
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,708
our triumphant race will begin!

322
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,416
[laughs]

323
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,625
Start!

324
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,166
[ALL gasp]

325
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,125
Ahh!

326
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:09,625
[tires screeching]

327
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,166
Ohh...

328
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,791
[NARRATOR] Will Speed reach
the end of the race in time?

329
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:18,000
Or will he be sealed in
the volcanic tunnel forever?

330
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,833
See the next exciting episode!
