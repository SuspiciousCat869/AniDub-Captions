00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
Trixie, can you hear me?

[TRIXIE groans]

162
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,708
Speed! Where are we?

163
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,875
[SPEED]
I don't know.

164
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,541
We were driving in
an underwater cave,

165
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,416
and that's the last
thing I remember.

166
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,041
I remember we hit something
and the oxygen ran out.

167
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,333
But after that, I can't
remember anything, either.

168
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,958
[SPEED] We're still under
the ocean somewhere.

169
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,875
And Dr. Nightcall and
his daughter, Lorena,

170
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,458
must have something
to do with this place.

171
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,833
I didn't trust her
from the start!

172
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,916
[SPEED]
You were right.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,291
[LORENA]
My father said you were in here.

174
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,791
[SPEED]
Lorena!

175
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,166
[TRIXIE] It's obvious that
you're in on the whole scheme!

176
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,291
And this must be the hideout of

177
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,250
the men who invented
the fake Mach 5,

178
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
am I right?

179
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,416
I don't know what
you're talking about.

180
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,125
They got their hands
on the real Mach 5

181
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,750
long enough to find
out how it was built

182
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,833
so they could copy it.

183
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,125
Then they robbed
the Science Institute

184
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,458
and stole the plans for
building a Mizmo Ray!

185
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,208
It's true and I'm very
sorry about all that.

186
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,625
[TRIXIE] Sorry?! Do you think
being sorry is enough?

187
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
Well, those things aren't
really important compared to

188
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,125
the tremendous project
we're involved in.

189
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,541
What tremendous project?

190
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,708
[LORENA]
I'm not supposed to tell you.

191
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,541
It's a secret that's
been kept for years,

192
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,291
but come with me
and I'll show you.

193
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,458
[CHIM CHIM gibbers]

194
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,458
[SPRITLE]
We'll change places, Chim Chim,

195
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,250
so I can see what's going on.

196
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,625
Get your toe out of my eye.

197
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
Aah...

198
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,166
[SPRITLE] I'll bet Speed and
Trixie are somewhere in there!

199
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,250
But how do we get in?

200
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,666
[SPRITLE]
Keep kicking, Chim Chim.

201
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,250
We're getting there.

202
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,041
[SPRITLE]
There they are!

203
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,583
[SPRITLE]
Hey, Speed! Trixie! Speed!

204
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,208
[SPRITLE] Speed, I'm out here.
I'm going to rescue you.

You're very tough as well
as brave, both of you.

00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,500
But it won't do you any good

211
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,333
because now you know
much too much,

212
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,083
and I've got to make
sure you tell no one.

In a few minutes, I'll get

[CUMULOUS]
You were brave up till now.

00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,333
But now, I want to see
how bravely you die.

[laughs]

218
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,541
[SPEED] You fiend! What're
you gonna do to us?!

219
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,875
Don't be in such a hurry
to find out, Speed.

220
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,333
First of all, let me tell
you about our big plan.

221
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,791
[SPEED gasps]

222
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
That's an ICBM!

223
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,458
[TRIXIE] An intercontinental
ballistic missile!

224
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,625
And you have a lot
more missiles!

225
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,541
How'd you get your
filthy hands on them?

226
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,458
Dr. Nightcall's
an expert copier.

227
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,166
He copied the plans for them.

228
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,583
After that, we built them.

229
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,625
They make us more powerful
than anyone else on Earth.

230
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,375
The world is going
to be ours now.

231
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,625
Wow!

232

00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,875
It's much too late!

235
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,166
In 30 minutes, the
ICBMs will blast off

236
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,916
and destroy all
the military bases

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,333
throughout the entire world.

238
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,583
Look! Look where we've got
them placed, ready to go.

239
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:13,250
Nobody will be able
to stop such an attack.

240
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,416

Minus 30 minutes and counting.

All trajectories
are being traced.

[CUMULOUS chuckles]

244
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,416
Everything is going
according to schedule.

245
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,083
As soon as the military
bases are wiped out,

246
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,500
every country in the world
will instantly surrender

247
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,458
because they'll have no means
of defense or counter-attack.

00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,375
You lied to me, Father!

251
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,958
You asked me to
cooperate in a project

252
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,041
to develop the natural
resources of the ocean,

253
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,500
but you didn't tell me
that you were really

254
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,083
planning such a terrible thing

255
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,166
because you knew I wouldn't
want any part of it.

256
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,125
But the world will
be ours, Lorena!

257
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,625
And you and I will
be able to have

258
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,583
everything we've ever wanted.

259
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,416
[LORENA] But what you're
doing is wrong, Father!

260
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,541
And I don't want any part of it!

261

Don't be a fool.

262

The world's riches
are within our grasp!

00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,625
To throw away this
opportunity now

264
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,416
would be to throw away
my work of a lifetime.
