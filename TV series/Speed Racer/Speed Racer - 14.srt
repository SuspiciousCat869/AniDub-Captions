00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,125
Take it back!

163
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,000
[KIM]
That bomb I think he planted

164
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,375
smashed my special brake system!

165
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,958
You put your brother
up to the job, Speed,

166
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,750
because I smashed
into the Mach 5!

167
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,583
That's a stupid idea!

168
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,916
Listen! Why don't you admit

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,666
that you're the one who
planted the bomb, right?!

170
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,916
[SPRITLE]
No, not right! I didn't do it!

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,916
Leave my brother alone, Kim!

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,458
I want him to tell
me the truth! Huh?!

173
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,000
[growling]

174
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,041
[yells]

175
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,875
Hey!

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,208
You want to fight?!

177
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,958
[SPEED] Well, it might do
you some good. Come on!

178
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,208
Easy, Speed! Don't fight him!

179
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,208
I've got to. He's been
asking for it all along.

180
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,583
[TRIXIE]
Speed, be careful. Be careful!

181
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,791
[yells]

182
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,958
[yells]

183
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,750
[yells]

184
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,958
C'mon, Speed! Give it
to him! A left and a right!

185
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,750
Do you give up?

186
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,833
[groans]

187
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,125
[KIM]
You haven't seen anything yet.

188
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,291
[grumbling]

189
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,666
[SPEED]
Huh? Oh!

190
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,958
[SPEED]
Oh... Oh...

191
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,000
[KIM] Our fight isn't over.
But here, Kid, keep it.

192
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,041
[SPRITLE]
Oh!

193
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,458
[SPEED]
Kim, who are these men?

194
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,166
What are they doing here?

195
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,750
They came here to
see me, that's all.

196
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,958
[SPEED]
You?

197
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,750
[KIM] That's all I can
tell you right now.

198
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,833
And as for damaging my car,
I still think you did it.

199
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,416
And one way or another, I'm
going to make you pay for it.

200
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,708
[SPEED]
We had nothing to do with it

201
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,458
and you're a liar to say we did!

202
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,625
[KIM]
You're the liar!

203
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,916
No, Speed! Let him go!

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,375
Take it easy!

205
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,625
When I see you again, I'll
beat you in the race, Speed.

206
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,541
[SPEED]
Before the race,

207
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,125
I've got to prove to him that
we didn't sabotage his car.

208
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,458
I've got to...

209
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,583
[NARRATOR] This is Puba, the
fabulous capital of Sandoland.

210
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:37,208
The Imperial Hotel, where
the Mach 5 Go Team is staying.

211
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,083
[SPEED] Why didn't you tell
me this whole story before,

212
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,125
Spritle?

213
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,708
I'm sorry. I forgot
about it, Speed.

214
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, you just forgot.

215
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
So when you were in the freight
compartment of the plane,

216
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,000
you saw a mysterious
one-eyed man come in

217
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,208
and put something into Kim's
racing car the Black Tiger.

218
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,208
[SPRITLE]
Mm-hmm!

219
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,333
[SPEED]
That's all I have to know.

220
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,416
[TRIXIE]
Where're you going?

221
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,916
To see Kim.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,250
He should be somewhere in this
mysterious, fabulous city,

223
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,500
and I've got to find him.

224
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,125
I've gotta tell him
what Spritle told us.

225
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,583
It proves that I'm innocent.
I'll see you all later.

226
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,541
[SPEED] I'm sorry. I was in
a hurry and I didn't see you!

227
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,708
I didn't see you either.

228
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,916
[SPEED] I'm looking for
a racer named Kim.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,166
Is he staying at this hotel?

230
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,541
The one that owns
the Black Tiger car?

231
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,625
[SPEED]
Yes.

232
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,875
[BELLHOP]
Yes, I know him very well.

233
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,666
He's a fast and clever racer.

234
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,083
But he's gone to his homeland,
the Flathill Country.

235
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,500
I am most sorry,

236
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,208
but now you will not find
him anywhere in Sandoland.

237
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,250
He left quickly.

238
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,583
--[BELLHOP] I know.
--[SPEED] Why?

239
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,375
Well, the way I heard it,
somebody blew his car up

240
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,375
and there's no way to
get it repaired in time

241
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
for the big Desert Race.

242
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
I wish there was some way
to find out who did it.

243
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,833
[SPEED] So do I. Thanks
for the information.

244
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,416
[BELLHOP]
Hmm... Hmm?

245
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,166
[TRIXIE]
Cheer up, Speed.

246
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,708
I can't, Trixie.

247
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,458
We know you're innocent.

248
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,875
The only way to prove that
is to find the man who did it.

249
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,208
[SPEED]
I'll prove it.

250
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
I don't have to do things
like that to win races.

251
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,958
I can win them fair and square.

252
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,833
I've gotta convince Kim
I didn't blow up his car.

253
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,541
[TRIXIE]
Good evening!

254
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,583
[gasps]

255
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,833
I'm going with you.
Hop in, Speed.

256
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
You're going to Flathill
Country to see Kim.

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,708
I can read your mind.

258
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,666
So can we, can't we, Chim Chim?

259
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,541
[TRIXIE]
Oh!

260
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,000
[SPEED] I can hardly see
in this sandstorm.

261
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,541
Speed, I think this
storm's getting worse.

262
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,583
[SPEED]
Mm-hm.

263
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,250
[SPEED] We'll wait
here till it blows over.

264
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,833
It's over. I was afraid we'd
be buried under the sand.

265
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,708
Whee! It's the biggest
sand pile I've ever seen!

266
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,125
Oh, look over there!

267
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,166

Here comes some more!

Wow! A whole army of them!

277
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,291
My sand pile was
never like this!

Stop that car!

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,916
Okay, it's time we
counterattack, Chim Chim.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,458
Pass the ammo to me!

We've got help of some kind,
and it's coming from our trunk.

285
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,416
Okay, I need more ammunition.

286
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
Aw, you mean we're
out of it, Chim Chim?

287
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,708
But I know we've got
a couple of things left,

288
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,875
so we may as well use 'em.

00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,208
[RIDER A] Tell me...
Where are you going? Well?

296
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,416
To Flathill Country to
visit a racer named Kim.

297
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,333
Kim.

298
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,416
[RIDER B, RIDER C]
Kim?

299
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,375
We have to talk to him.
Do you know him?

300
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,875
We are members of the
Army of Flathill Country,

301
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,541
and, if you permit us, we
will take you to visit him.

302
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,666
Oh, why didn't you say so?

303
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,875
We didn't know you were
Flathill Army Soldiers.

304
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,500
If you had told us
that in the first place,

305
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,750
I wouldn't have been scared.

306
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,208
All right, follow us.

307
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,333
Wait! We were told that Flathill
Country is to the south,

308
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,583
that it's that way.

309
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,875
We know very well
where Flathill Country is.

310
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,708
Just be quiet and follow us.

311
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,250
I've got to see Kim, I must.

312
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,375
And who says you're
really from Flathill, huh?

313
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,083
[RIDER A] We're not from
Flathill Country now,

314
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,458
but we used to be.

315

If you want to know the
real truth, I will tell you.

Right now, my men
