going to repair my car or not?

Hm...

You're a professional

Well, tell me, are you going
to repair my car or not?

couldn't, didn't I?!

What's going on?!

185
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,583
What's the big idea of
interrupting my dream?

186
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,666
I was dreaming about eating

187
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,125
a whole room full
of coconut cookies

188

Oh, you're--!

Yes, Speed Racer's my name.

We met when you were in trouble.

Pops, this man has a great
technique for sharp curves.

199
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,041
He drives on two wheels.

Two wheels, huh?!

That's right.

00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,541
Rock Force is my name.

203
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,666
Now will you take care
of my car, Mr. Racer?

204
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,666
Well, I didn't realize that
you're my son's friend.

205
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,208
If you agree to fix his car,
Pops, I'll be glad to help.

206
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,708
Thanks, Speed.
I'd be glad if you did.

207
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,583
I'll do it on the condition
you demonstrate to me

208
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,000
how you drive on two wheels.

What's the matter, Speed?
Why are you staring at me?

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,291
Well, what is it? What're
you thinking about, Speed?

216
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,833
What's wrong with your arm?

217
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
Mr. Force, aren't you able to
use your right hand at all?

218
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,416
What?

219
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,583
So... you've noticed, huh?

220
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,083
You've discovered
my secret, Speed.

221
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,333
I didn't suspect it.

222
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,833
When you were fighting Speed,
I-I never would've guessed.

223
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
And you should see how well
he drives with that arm.

224
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,875
The man who attacked
me the other day

225
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,666
is the same one who
did this to my arm.

226
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,458
He must be a terrible man.

227
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,208
In a way. But I was sort of
to blame for what happened.

228
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,916
I joined the Bell
Ring Race last year.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,291
Jack Rival of the Rival
Motor Company offered me

230
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,125
a lot of money if I
would lose the race.

231
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,250
[POPS] He tried to bribe
you to lose the race, huh?

232
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,875
[SPRITLE] Then the
Bell Ring Race was fixed?!

233
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,541
[ROCK] Well, I took the
money, but I wanted to win.

234
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,541
So, I pulled into the lead.

235
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,083
And... I did win.

236
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,291
Fair and square, I won.

237
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,333
But I betrayed the
Rival Motor Company

238
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,416
and the man who'd
bribed me to lose.

239
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,208
They were waiting for me--
the whole gang of 'em.

240
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,500
They made sure I'd never be
able to use my right arm again.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
[ROCK] I thought my
racing days were over.

242
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,250
How could I drive a
fast car over a track

243
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,833
with twists and turns in it?

244
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,625
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,958
What happened then?

246
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,083
I went to a hospital and
spent a long time there,

247
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,375
but the doctors couldn't help.

248
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,666
I can't use my arm.

249

Ow! Ow!

250
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,125
Where were the police?!

251
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,250
I decided if I went
to the police,

252
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,541
everybody would find
out about my arm

253
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,041
and they wouldn't
let me race again.

254
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,250
Mr. Force, maybe if you
exercise that right arm,

255
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,541
you'd get it working again.

256
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,875
No, I've tried exercise!

257
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,000
But nothing's worked.

258
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,583
I tried driving with
only my left arm,

259
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,750
but I couldn't turn the car
fast enough on the curves.

260
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,500
I knew that unless I had full
control over my car in a race,

261
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,833
I'll endanger the other
drivers as well as myself.

262
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,000
I have to give up my dream
of being a racing driver.

Don't be ridiculous.

it was no accident

and we're the one's doing it.
It would be bad for business!

and it's got to be

That means we've
got to make sure

Rock Force is out of
the way permanently.

Any ideas how to do it?

Oh, I always have ideas.

Car racing is my life.

00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,166
I want more than anything to
continue being a racing driver.

Cheer up, Mr. Force.

I'm sure that your
arm will get better.

296
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,041
All you need is some
treatment of the proper kind,

297
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,875
and your arm will
be as good as new.

298
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,916
I don't think I'll
ever be able to use it.

Can't you invent
something for him, Pops,

300
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,208
so that he'll have full
control over his racing car?

301
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,583
It's hard. I doubt if I
can come up with anything.

302
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,708
You can, Pops. After all,
you built the Mach 5

303
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,166
and you can build any kinda
special car anyone wants.

304
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,458
Just give it some thought.

305
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,041
But even so, it would
be dangerous because

306
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,666
Mr. Force doesn't have
the use of his arm yet,

307
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,041
so he's liable to crash.

308
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,083
Speed's right, Spritle.

309
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,708
If Mr. Foce lost
control of his car,

310
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,208
other racers would
be in danger, too.

to happen to them.

to help Mr. Force; I like him.
