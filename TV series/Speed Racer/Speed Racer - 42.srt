me to finish the race!

and keep your mouth shut!

pineapple away from me!

I'm trying to do that, Speed.

But how can I when your
men took my pineapple?!

198

That must be how you
win so many races.

I'm out to win myself! Now
sign off, and don't bother me!

But Hap must win so that
he can pay for the doctors

to make his sister well.

And besides, Hap
would then be hired

to manage a big car factory.

That would solve all

Please let him win, Speed!

It doesn't matter to me what his
reasons are for wanting to win!

If you don't have the pineapple,

313
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,875
you're disqualified.

314
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,500
Mr. Hazard, do you have
a pineapple in your car?

315
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,208
[gasps]

316
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,416
I've got the pineapple right
here! I'm the winner of

317
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,458
the Southern Hemisphere
Pineapple Grand Prix!

318

I'm the winner!

Look, I won!

[PORSON]
Huh?!

322
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,000
Where's the jewel?! Where?!
What happened to it?!

323
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,541
It was supposed to be
in one of the pineapples!

324
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,916
He lied to me about it!

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,625
Speed Racer was disqualified

326
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,458
because he didn't have
a pineapple in his car,

327
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,833
so the winner of the
Grand Prix is Hap Hazard!

[CROWD cheering]

329
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,541
As winner, Mr. Hazard will
be awarded the top prize

330
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,791
of $10,000, and a ten-year
supply of pineapples!

331
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,625
However, Mr. Hazard has
generously said that he wants

332
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:24,916
to give the ten-year supply
of pineapples to you, his fans!

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,250
The King's Jewel must be
in one of those pineapples!

00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's get it!

Outta the way, brats!

Not in this one so far!

Err... Let me see now...

00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,166
I never saw a man
like pineapples

This is a mammoth diamond!

[PORSON]
I know! Isn't it beautiful?!

346
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,541
This is the King's Jewel!

347

It's the King's Jewel, all
right! I'll return it to him!

[THUG A, THUG D]
You and your smart ideas!

Now you'll get that job!

350
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,875
And, from now on,

351
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,333
there'll be enough money for the
doctors to make you well again!

[HAP] I told you I had
to win, Eloisa, and I did!

And now everybody knows
I am a better racer than Speed!

Oh, Trixie.

of the Grand Prix, Speed.

I told Chim Chim to
give him the pineapple.

I know why you did, Trixie,
