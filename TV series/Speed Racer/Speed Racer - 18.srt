for the Nitona race.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,416
Speed? Well, how're the
brakes workin'? Okay?

161
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,125
[TRIXIE] Speed's got other
things on his mind, Sparky.

162
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,625
Things like girl
daredevil drivers.

163
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,208
--[SPARKY] Ohh... Now I dig.

--[music plays on radio]

165
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,000
[REPORTER] We have a
special news bulletin

166
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,541
of special interests:

167
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,083
At three o'clock, a car will
be driven on a tightrope

168
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,416
across Niagara Falls.

169
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,958
Huh?!

170
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,000
[REPORTER] The driver of the car
will be Miss Twinkle Banks,

171
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,166
the star of the
Universal Circus.

172
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,666
On a tightrope?!

173
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,041
If that doesn't get publicity
for the Universal Circus,

174
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,291
nothing will.

175
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,500
But it's too dangerous--
driving on a tightrope!

176
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,375
[TRIXIE]
Mm-hmm!

177
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,875
We've got to try to stop her.

178
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,333
[SPARKY]
Hey!

179
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,958
Come back here!

180
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,416
[SPARKY] You'll never
make the Nitona race!

181
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,250
[ANNOUNCER] In only a
short while, the world's

182
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,791
most-daredevil, daredevil
driver will drive across

183
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,375
these most tremendous
falls on a tightrope.

184
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,250
[BROTCH] It's gonna be
fascinatin' to watch...

185
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,291
[BROTCH chuckles]

186
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,291
I hope we get there
in time to stop her

187
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,583
from driving across
that tightrope.

188
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,666
Oh, Speed, why're you
so worried about her?

189
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,708
After all, that car she'll
be driving is four-wheeled,

190
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,250
so it should be pretty safe.

191
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,583
I remember when four men
went across the falls

192
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,583
on only a one-wheeled bicycle.

193
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,875
Four wheels are
much more dangerous

194
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,000
because two ropes are used

195
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,583
to support the four wheels.

196
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,666
If the rope starts swinging
when the car's halfway across,

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,375
the wheels will slip from
under one of the ropes,

198
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,083
and there'll be no way
to hang on to the other

199
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,208
and Twinkle will
fall to the bottom.

200
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,541
[CLOWN]
Twinkle, I just hope those ropes

201
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,958
don't start to swing.

202
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,958
[TWINKLE] If they do, I'll do
my best to keep control.

203
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,791
It's about 3,000 feet from here
to the other side, and the

204
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,166
most dangerous part of the drive
will be out in the center.

205
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,541
The water is falling
at least 150 feet onto

206
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,000
the rocks down below.

207
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,250
If you fall, you
won't have a chance.

208
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,416
Thousands of people are going
to watch... This should make

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,291
the Universal Circus famous
throughout the world and

210
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,875
we'll never again have to worry
about selling enough tickets.

211
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,250
[CLOWN]
Thank you for doing this...

212
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,708
Now I'll think I'll
make sure everything's

213
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,208
ready for the drive.

214
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,250
[CLOWN] Ah! Mr. Cornpone Brotch!
I wanna thank you for everything

215
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,416
you've done for us.

216
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,833
It was you who suggested
that Twinkle drive

217
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,375
across Niagara Falls on ropes,

218
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,208
and it was you who took
care of all of the money

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,333
we needed to arrange it.

220
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,625
I'm mighty glad
I was able to help.

221
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,375
All I hope is that it
doesn't get windy out there.

222
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,958
Windy?

223
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,875
It would be even more dangerous
for Twinkle if it gets windy.

224
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,750
[REPORTER] The wind will be
stronger at the Canadian side

225
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,916
of the falls, and there's
a possibility of a storm.

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,833
I hope Twinkle's listening
to this weather forecast

227
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,666
up there at the falls.

228
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,541
Oh! The radio weather forecast
just said that the wind will be

229
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,583
stronger on the Canadian side,
and there may even be

230
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,750
a storm approaching!

231
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,541
This is no time for
tightrope driving!

232
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,541
We've got to stop
Twinkle from doing it!

233
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,041
--[BROTCH] No!
--[CLOWN] Hm?

234
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,208
It's already been scheduled;
she must go through with it.

235
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,958
But Twinkle will be in terrible
danger! We've got to cancel it!

236
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,333
Ah. Oh...

237
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,291
I paid for this performance
so I don't want anything

238
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,083
goin' wrong with it
startin' on time.

239
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,166
[THUG A]
Don't worry!

240
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,083
[MR. BANKS grunts]

241
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,875
So far, the plan's workin'.

242
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,250
I'm gonna borrow that clown
suit you're wearing, clown.

243
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,458
Nobody will suspect
that me, Cornpone Brotch,

244
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,541
is playin' a clown! [laughs]

245
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,750
[BROTCH chuckles]

246
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,208
[BROTCH] It's workin'.
Nobody recognized me yet.

247
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,291
Okay! Come on,
Twinkle! You ready?

248
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,541
[TWINKLE]
Mm-hm!

249
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,166
[SPEED] Only a few minutes
and Twinkle is going to start!

250
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,208
How can I make it in time?

251
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,416
--[MAN B] Look at her go!
--[MAN C] Wow!

252
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Too late.

253
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,208
Hey, Mister, what're you
up to around here?

254
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,166
[THUG B]
I, uh...

255
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,416
[BROTCH]
Hmm?

256
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,375
Oh, now I get it. This is
all part of the show, eh?

257
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,208
And Twinkle Banks is
going to do another trick

258
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,958
after she crosses the falls.

259
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,500
Well, thanks for telling me.

260
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,791
Now I'll be able to relax, enjoy
the rest of the performance.

261
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,958
[BROTCH]
Hmm.

262
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,333
Twinkle's act'll last about
another 30 minutes, so get

263
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,041
the rest of the job done while
everybody's still watchin' her.

264
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,750
[BROTCH] Hmm...
Accordin' to this old map,

265
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,000
there's a secret cave
in back of the falls,

266
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,750
and years ago,
the Indians hid

267
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,375
a fabulous treasure in it.

268
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,416
It's fantastic
enough to be true.

269
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,291
Hey, Mr. Brotch, there's
somethin' down there.

270
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,625
Hold onto it
while I take a look.

271
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,166
[gasping]

272
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,666
[ANNOUNCER] Folks, it's
getting windy up there!

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,958
[TWINKLE grunts]

274
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,291
It's the wind. She's
gonna have trouble!

275
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,041
[SPEED]
Uh-oh...

276
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,958
[CLOWN] Oh, no... I can't
bear to watch...

277
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,875
[SPEED grunts]

278
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,583
[TRIXIE]
What are you going to do?

279
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,416
[SPARKY] I've been
looking all over for ya!

280
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,958
Here, lemme give you a hand.

281
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,708
Now we'll get the
car on the ropes!

282
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,625
Wait! Don't go yet!

283
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,916
The car would be too heavy
with you in there!

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,291
[TWINKLE grunts]

285
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,000
[ANNOUNCER] Isn't there
anyone who can rescue her?!

286
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,208
The car fell into the water,
but Twinkle's hangin' onto

287
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,000
the ropes and nobody's
able to rescue her.

288
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,041
[BROTCH] Good, that makes
the show even more excitin'

289
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,375
and keeps folks from
noticin' what we're up to.

290
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,291
How you makin' out
down there in the cave?

291
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,000
[BROTCH] Great! I think I have
just found the secret entrance

292
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,125
to the secret treasure chamber!

293
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,166
Ah! 

294
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,708
That's amazing!
What a fabulous car!

What're you talkin' about?

out there?! Tell me!

[SPEED]
It must be very deep here--

313
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,375
the periscope can't
reach the surface.

314
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,625
The only way out is gonna be
by driving along the bottom.

315
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,666
I'll try it.

316
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,416
I don't think we're
going to make it.

317
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,166
We've got to because our oxygen
isn't going to last forever.

318
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,000
It's starting to get low.
There's only about a 15 minute

319
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,666
supply left and we've gotta
get out before it's gone.

320
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,875
Otherwise, they may never
even find the car.

Mm...

322
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,041
[SPEED]
The needle just dropped lower!

323
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,583
That means we have no more than
one minute of oxygen left.

324
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,958
That's all!

[SPEED]
Don't... Don't worry, Twinkle...

327
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,625
I... I'll get
us out... Somehow...

[NARRATOR] Trapped deep in the
water beneath Niagara Falls

329
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,750
and with the oxygen
tank down to zero,

330
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,375
will Speed be able to escape?
