That's enough.

Oh, you're the same man
I met earlier.

327
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,708
[GUNSEL]
Right.

328
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,333
No hard feelin's, I hope.

329
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,791
I just was just puttin'
you to a test

330
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,708
to see how well you can fight,
and you did well.

331
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,000
[RACER X] You're not taking
any chances on me, eh?

332
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,250
No, I'm not. But now I know
you'll be worth the money.

00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,500
[RACER X]
What am I expected to do?

334
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,750
[GUNSEL]
Don't be in such a hurry.

335
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,166
I wanna show ya
something interesting.

What, Mr. Gunsel?

337
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,708
You see that
sightseeing boat out there?

338
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,416
Very important officials from
countries all over the world

339
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,750
are on board.

340

happen to 'em.

[SPEED]
Come on!

345
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,958
What happened to the ship?

346
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,333
[GUNSEL] If we get rid
of all the officials

347
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,750
and diplomats like that,

348
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,041
there won't be anyone important
to run the countries,

349
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,250
and then the world'll be ours.

350
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,083
We can use a man like you
in our organization.

But if you turn us down,

I'm warning you,
it'll mean your end.

Don't worry.

00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,375
Put away that gun.

I don't have any choice;
I'll work with you right now.

I won't double-cross you.

Good. Let's go.

00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,916
I wonder where that
big monster disappeared to.

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,375
It was nowhere in sight.

Will Speed be trapped

in the hideout of
the assassin gang?

370

And will the gang succeed
in carrying out

their terrifying plan?
