of Baron Von Vondervon.

18
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,541
[SERVANT] Baron Von Vondervon
will now make a speech.

19
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,291
[BARON clears throat]

20
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,250
Twelve years ago, when my
daughter Yvonne Von Vondervon

21
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,125
was 12 years old,
she disappeared.

22
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,750
I will hold a Junk Car
Grand Prix in memory of her.

23
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,625
She always wanted to
be a racing car driver,

24
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,583
so the winner will get
a huge amount of money

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,083
and be treated as if
she were my own daughter.

26
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,458
I'll explain the rules of
the Junk Car Grand Prix.

27
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,166
The driver of each car
must be 17 years old.

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,625
She's allowed to, uh-- [coughs]

29
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,208
--have one assistant driver,
a boy or girl of any age.

30
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,625
Each team must build
their own car from junk.

31
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,958
Now, for the course.

32
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,958
It starts at Baron Vondervon's
palatial mountain,

33
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,750
crosses the spiny-peaked
mountains along Route 16,

34
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,041
follows Route 3 through
One Horse Town,

35
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,500
then the mystery road and
along Danger Pass Trail

36
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,958
and back here.

37
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,500
If any driver breaks a rule,
she will be disqualified.

38
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,375
The Baron realizes that
every inch of the race

39
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,958
is fraught with peril,

40
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,041
but the rewards to the winners
will make it well worthwhile.

41
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,458

313
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,541
You'll never stop us!

314
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,416
[gasps]

315
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
[SPARKY]
They've got Trixie!

316
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,958
Get your filthy hands off her!

317
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,833
I'll let her go in exchange
for the Baron's daughter!

318
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,791
It's a fair exchange and
you'd better agree to it!

319
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,166
Hurry up! You have no more time!

320
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,750
Don't do what he wants, Speed!

321
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,958
Don't pay any attention to her!

322
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,166
I'm going to count to ten.

323
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,916
One...

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,166
Two...

325
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,583
Three...

326
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,666
Four...

327
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,666
--[SPRITLE] Huh?
--[FREELOADER] Five...

328
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,208
--Fire crackers!
--Six...

329
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,041
[SPRITLE] Thanks, Chim Chim,
you gave me an idea!

330
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,875
You'd better make the exchange.
It's your last chance!

331
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,458
Seven...

332
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,000
Eight!

333
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,791
Nine!

334
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,041
[screaming]

335
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,583
[FREELOADER]
We're being attacked!

336
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,125
[screaming]

337
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,791
That takes care of him!

338
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,708
[GOON G yelps]

339
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,000
[GOON G]
I'll get you for that!

340
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:11,083
[GOON E yells, groans]

341
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,041
There!

342
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,666
[cries]

343
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,166
Ah!

344
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,791
Why'd I start this...?

345
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
[laughs]

346
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,375
[gasping]

347
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,000
[FREELOAD yells]

348
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,625
I'll give her back to you
if you just let go of my arm!

349
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:36,625
[FREELOAD yelps, cries]

350
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,958
Maybe they'll both win,
Sparky! I hope so!

351
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,916
But it's impossible!

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,833
[SPRITLE]
I can hope, can I?!

353
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,458
[ANNOUNCER] And here they
come to the finish line...

354
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,583
...with Trixie in the lead!

355
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:08,083
[CROWD cheering]

356
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:14,000
[trumpets blaring]

357
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,333
Congratulations, Trixie,
you drove a great race.

358
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,666
[TRIXIE]
Thank you!

359
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,416
[chuckles]

360
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
And you were very brave!

361
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,250
[gasps]

362
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,958
[YVONNE] You're wearing
a super-star topaz!

363
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,250
[BARON]
And so are you!

364
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,208
Where'd you get that
super-star topaz?

365
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,375
[YVONNE] My mother gave it
to me just before she died.

366
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,708
[BARON]
Hmm...

367
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,958
There are only two of
these in the whole world,

368
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
and I gave the other one
to my wife years ago.

369
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,208
[YVONNE]
Oh!

370
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,750
[BARON] This proves that you're
actually my long-lost daughter.

371
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,833
[YVONNE]
Daddy!

372
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,791
[BOTH crying]

373
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,166
[BARON]
At last!

374
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,458
They think she won't have
anything more to do with them.

375
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,166
Yeah, and I'm afraid
she may be right.

376
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,791
[BARON] We'll have a big party
to celebrate the end of the race

377
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,416
and our reunion.

378
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,500
[SERVANT]
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,791
Baron Von Vondervon would
like to present to you

380
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,958
his long-lost daughter,
Yvonne Von Vondervon,

381
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,375
and here she is!

382
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,625
What happened to your new dress?

383
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,416
[YVONNE] I've decided that I'm
going back to the orphanage.

384
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,958
Those children are
my dearest friends

385
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,250
and they have nobody to look
after them the way I can.

386
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,541
And I wanna keep taking care
of them the way I've been doing.

387
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,333
I'm so happy to have
found my father,

388
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,958
and aren't fathers supposed
to be understanding?

389
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,208
So I hope you'll understand...

390
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,041
[BARON] I do.
You're a generous daughter.

391
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,958
[SERVANT]
The Baron will make a speech.

392
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,375
After many years of being
known as the stingiest Baron

393
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,916
in the world, I'm going
to give one-third--

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,541
I'm going to give one-half
of my fortune to my daughter.

395
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,916
And I'm going to give the
other half to the orphanage!

396
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,833
[YVONNE]
Oh, Daddy!

397
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,666
And the children may move
into my palatial mansion!

398
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,916
[BARON chuckles]

399
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,208
[NARRATOR] Speed, Trixie,
Sparky, and Spritle

400
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,958
leave behind a happy
group of children.

401
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,875
