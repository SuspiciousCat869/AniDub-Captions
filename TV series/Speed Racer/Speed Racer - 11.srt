159
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,291
Racer X! Where are you?

160
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,916
[groans] Over here, Speed...

161
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,041
He sounds badly hurt.
But where is he?

162
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,333
Racer X!

163
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,750
Here! Over here!

164
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,791
[SPEED]
I'm coming.

165
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,500
[RACER X] Speed,
you're a brave, young man.

166
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,666
I'm proud to have
you for a brother.

167
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,833
[SPEED] Where are you,
Racer X? I can't find you.

168
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,583
Racer X, are you hurt badly?

169
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,083
I think my legs have
been broken, Speed.

170
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,583
Well, hang on to me. I'll try
to get you into the Mach 5.

171
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,291
Speed, don't bother about me,
you need help yourself.

172
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,958
Your eyes must hurt you.

173
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,500
Neither one of us will be
able to go on with the race.

174
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,791
Snake Oiler is the only one
of the Car Acrobatic Team

175
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,333
who's continuing in the race.

176
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,708
Snake Oiler, huh?

177
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,208
I wanna beat him more
than anything in the world.

178
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,625
Your car's the
only other one left,

179
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,250
but you can't see and
I can't even walk,

180
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,583
so Snake's liable to win.

181
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,583
But, Speed, I have an
idea that just might work.

182
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,083
Huh?

183
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,666
You be my legs, and at the
same time, I'll be your eyes.

184
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,000
[SPEED]
Oh, I get it!

185
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,666
You and I will be a team.

186
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,958
Yes. Maybe we can overtake
Snake and win. Come on.

187
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,958
[RACER X]
My legs are perfectly all right,

188
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,208
but this is the only way
I can help my brother Speed.

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,875
No Mach 5 or Speed.

190
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,083
[SPARKY]
Uh-oh.

191
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,583
Maybe the Mach 5's been
completely wrecked.

192
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,583
I feel that somewhere down
there, Speed's all right.

193
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,000
I think so, too, because he
has my good luck charm.

194
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,375
[SPARKY]
We'll follow the course.

195
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,958
Keep a sharp eye out for him.

196
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,208
There's the Mach 5!

197
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,458
[SPRITLE, SPARKY]
And there's Speed!

198
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,416
Left. Now ten degrees right.

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,458
Get ready, here comes
another turn to the right.

200
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,625
Fifteen degrees to the right.

201
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,625
[TRIXIE]
Speed. Speed!

202
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
Go ahead, Trixie.

203
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,125
[TRIXIE]
Are you all right, Speed?

204
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,958
[SPEED]
I... It's my eyes.

205
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,041
[TRIXIE] What's the
matter with your eyes?!

206
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,708
Uh, I'm perfectly all
right, don't worry.

207
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,958
Nothing's wrong with them.

208
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,791
[TRIXIE] I think you're
fibbing to me, Speed.

209
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,666
Make a left.

210
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,833
Who's that riding
with you, Speed?

211
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,750
[SPEED] Racer X. He hurt
his legs in a crash.

212
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,416
Hi, Speed, I'm up here, too!

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,041
[SPARKY]
Me, too!

214
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,208
[CHIM CHIM yells]

215
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,583
[SPEED] All of you, huh?
That's just great.

216
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,333
Now all I have to do
is beat Snake Oiler.

217
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,958
I might be able to catch up to
him in the next few minutes.

218
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,166
I'll meet you at the finish
line, Trixie, how 'bout it?

219
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,666
[TRIXIE] I'll be waiting for
you, Speed. Good luck!

220
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,791
Faster!

221
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,750
The final check point
is 250 yards up ahead.

222
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,041
Put your brakes on.

223
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,208
I'm glad to see you
reached here safely.

224
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,541
Now, why don't you
both take a break?

225
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,375
[SPEED]
I don't want one.

226
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,291
But, Speed, you need a rest.

227
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,375
Have you seen the Car
Acrobatic Team's car?

228
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,208
A car passed by this
checkpoint within the hour.

229
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,000
Thanks! Hang on!

230
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,708
Are you all right, Speed?

231
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,375
Yes. I won't rest until
Snake's been beaten.

232
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,666
Well, then, you'll have
to hurry. Give her the gun.

233
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,291
That's it. Give her even more.

234
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,541
Even faster!

235
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,541
I see him! He's just ahead!

236
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,791
At last, Speed,
we've caught up to him.

237
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
The Mach 5!

238
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,708
And I thought I was the only
driver left in the race.

239
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,041
You'll never be able to
follow me over this chasm.

240
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,541
Go ahead, Speed. It's your
turn to try to get over that

241
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,000
without crashing down to
those rocks in the bottom!

242
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,333
Speed! There's a broken bridge
up ahead! Use your brakes!

243
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,833
Snake managed to get across
it, didn't he? So will I!

244
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,125
How? That bridge
is falling apart!

245
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,041
Speed, you'd better use the
brakes before it's too late

246
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,250
and we smash up!

247
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,583
Tell me when we get
to the broken bridge.

248
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,583
I'm gonna try to get across it.

249
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,666
The Acrobatic Team's cars have
special equipment for flying.

250
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,375
The Mach 5 can't do it!
Use the brake!

251
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,291
[SPEED]
I'm giving her the gas!

252
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,791
Stop!

253
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:48,416
Speed, we can't make it!
Jam on the brakes! Quick!

254
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,541
You made it. I don't think
you would've been able to do it

255
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,708
with your eyes open.

256
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,333
There was no other way.
I had to make it.

257
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,500
Now I've gotta win.

258
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,666
[ANNOUNCER]
The Alpine Race is almost over.

259
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,833
And, because of the terrific
storm and the dangerous course,

260
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,375
out of the starting
lineup of 86 cars,

261
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,958
only two cars are
still in the race.

262

One of them is car number 12,

263
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,833
driven by Snake Oiler
of the Car Acrobatic Team.

264
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,916
And the other is the Mach 5
driven by Speed Racer.

Ladies and gentleman,
if you look to your left,

you can see the
remaining members

of the Car Acrobatic Team
waiting for the end of the race.

I just got a report that
Snake is way in the lead.

271
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,291
Snake's my brother
and he's going to bring

272
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,791
a glorious victory to

We will be famous

Hurry, Snake! Bring us
the crown of victory!

277

It's hard to catch up to him.
He's liable to win.

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,208
If only I could see,
I'd go even faster.

279
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,875
But Speed, you mustn't give up.

280
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,958
Why not? I don't think I have
a chance of beating him.

281

Speed, you still have
a chance to win.

282
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,625
I can see something you can't.
Oil is leaking from Snake's car.

283
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,958
Oil?

284
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,750
If he keeps on going
at his present speed,

285
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,041
he's gonna blow up.

286
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,125
He may notice
the trouble though,

287
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,208
and take time out
to stop the leak.

288
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,458
I don't think he'll
even notice it.

289
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,750
Snake's paying
too much attention

290
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,041
to the road in front of him.

291
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,125
Then he'll be wiped out
if his car blows up.

292
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,708
Yes, it might be the end of him.

293

But we're not gonna help him,
not if you wanna win the race.

It wouldn't be right.

It looks as if he'll
be the winner.

312
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,833
Oh! But here comes the Mach 5
with Speed Racer at the wheel!

313
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,625
Look at them go!

314
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,500
Go, Speed, go!

315
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,583
Go!

316
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
C'mon, Speed! You can do it!

317
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,875
I'm gonna win!
I'm gonna beat Speed!

318
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:51,916
[laughs]

319
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:55,875
[BOTH gasp]

320
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,208
[screams]

321
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,458
[SPEED]
Snake wouldn't listen...

322
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,666
[ALL shouting]

323
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,583
--[SPARKY] You won, Speed!
--[SPRITLE] You did it!

324
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,333
You drove a magnificent
race, Speed Racer,

325
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,083
and you fully deserve to be
the winner and champion.

326
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,416
Now go to the hospital

327
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,625
where the doctors will
make your eyes well again.

328
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,416
We will never forget this race

329
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,416
and our defeat by the
Mach 5 and Speed Racer.

330
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,208
[groans] We'll get revenge...

331
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,625
[CAPTAIN TERROR]
Snake is right.

332
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,916
There will be other races
and chances for vengeance.

333
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,708
We shall plan for the
day when once again,

334
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,500
we will compete
against Speed Racer,

335
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,166
and on that day,
we shall not fail.

336
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,583
Let's go home.

337
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,750
[RACER X] Speed, you
could be a great driver,

338
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,458
but you can also
be a great man.

339
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,708
You value a life even
higher than victory.

340
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,583
The world needs more
people like you.

341
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,333
I'm proud to have
you as a brother.

342
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,291
Have you seen Racer X? I've
gotta find him to thank him.

343
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,125
I saw him in the Mach 5
only a few minutes ago.

344
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,916
Nobody's in the car now.

345
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,958
There isn't? That means he was
able to walk away from it.

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,250
His legs weren't broken.

347
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,166
He just told me that so
I'd let him help me drive.

348
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,500
He deserves this trophy, not me.

349
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,541
Oh, Speed! All that matters to
me is that you made it safely.

350
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,416
Now let's go to the hospital
and get your eyes taken care of.

351
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,541
[NARRATOR]
Speed has just won

352
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,416
the most dangerous
race in the world,

353
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,458
but even more danger
and thrills lie just ahead.
