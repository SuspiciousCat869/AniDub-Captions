[RACER X]
You just avoided that crash.

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,458
The dynamite won't hurt you now.

167
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,958
It's Racer X!

168
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,916
Thank you for switching those
rails in the nick of time!

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,375
You saved us.

170
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,208
If I hadn't arrived, you
would've been blown up.

171
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,666
Those men'll do anything to win.

172
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,250
How did you know where you
could find us, Racer X?

173
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,083
You always seem to arrive just
when we need you the most.

174
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,125
[SPEED]
There's something about him

175
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,291
that reminds me
of Rex, my brother.

176
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,625
Can something be the matter?

177
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
You're looking at me in
a very strange way, Speed.

178
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,083
Tell me! What's on your mind?

179
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:31,916
[SPEED]
Nothing!

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,458
[SPRITLE]
Those bad men!

181
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,625
They were about to
smash the Mach 5.

182
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,125
I hope you'll never
again leave your car

183
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,625
while in the middle of a race.

184
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,833
Hurry! You may be able to
catch up to the Mammoth Car.

185
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,666
Thanks for everything, Racer X!

186
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,500
Now we should have
no more trouble.

[DRIVER B] This is the Mammoth
Car, calling Cruncher Block.

We're running right on schedule.

Good, we'll meet ya at the boat.

[NARRATOR] Speed and Trixie
race all night in the Mach 5.

Morning!

It looks as if it's
gonna be a groovy day!

At the checkpoint,

[ANNOUNCER] This is the first
car to reach the checkpoint.

197
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,416
So far, the Mammoth
Car is winning.

198
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Well, of course we are.

199
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,083
And we're gonna
win the whole race.

200
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,000
Now stamp the certificate with
the time that we reached here.

201
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,166
[OFFICIAL A]
There you are.

202
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,041
That gives the exact
time to the second.

203
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,041
Okay, you can continue the race.

--[DRIVER A] The police...
--[DRIVER B] What do they want?!

00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,791
We think you might be smuggling.
We want to inspect the car.

207
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,666
[DRIVER A]
Again...?

208
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,000
You did already!

[DRIVER B] We got nothing
to hide, so look around!

00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,583

Glad to see you!

Inspector, you'd better make
a thorough investigation

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,208
of the Mammoth Car!

220

[INSPECTOR]
We will!

221
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,291
We got the message by the
homing robot that you sent

222
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,875
tellin' us about that big car!

223

I didn't know you'd
be here, Pops!

Huh?! You do?!

226

I don't see them. Where are
the little rascals, huh?

227
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,458
They're both in
the trunk in back.

Huh? No, they're not.
There's nobody back here, Speed.

close to the finishing line.

be able to go any further,

into the homestretch,

the Mammoth Car and the Mach 5
are tied for first place.

Only a few more seconds,

Here they come to
the finishing line!

And as they cross
it in a dead heat,

00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,791
it's an absolute tie
for first place!

[CROWD cheering]

259
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,958
It may be the momentum

260
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,875
from the speed at which both
cars have been racing,

261
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,166
but they haven't slowed down!

even going faster!

You'll behave yourselves?

we shouldn't, I promise.

Yeah, okay then.

That's the way!

Now keep the Mammoth

You certainly ran a great race.

The Mammoth Car
was disqualified,

Well, what's the matter?
