I was looking at the Mammoth Car
when its driver grabbed me,

00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,041
dragged me in here,
and knocked me out!

It may be too tough

And it's ready to

The car's pulling
away! Let's go!

200

That's very peculiar.

201
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,625
The Mammoth Car was hardly
scratched in the crash,

202
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,750
so why did the mechanics
have to repair it?

203
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
Trixie, I'll bet there's some
kind of mysterious secret

204
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,958
to the whole thing.

205
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,041
A secret? I wonder
what it could be.

206
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,708
Let's use the robot camera!

207
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,625
I'll adjust it for x-rays and
put it on the reflex timer.

208
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,041
It should tell us the secret.

209
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,000
[TRIXIE]
The x-ray picture should tell us

210
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,625
what the Mammoth Car's carrying.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
The camera's all
ready for flight.

Okay! I'll pull out the robot.

with the x-ray camera which
will shoot through metal,

215
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,541
and may be able to reveal the
secret cargo of the Mammoth Car.

A spy!

00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,416
And now the robot's back.

219
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,916
[TRIXIE]
Ah.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,250
Oh! Somebody shot it!

[NARRATOR] The Mammoth Car
sends a radio signal.

00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,958
[NARRATOR] The signal travels
halfway around the world

to reach the luxurious
secret headquarters

226
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:41,791
of the owner of the Mammoth Car,
the notorious Cruncher Block.

227
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,583
Speed Racer sent a
flying robot camera

228
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,666
to spy on the Mammoth Car?

229
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,708
I see... Better get rid of him.

230
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,583
Now listen to me.

231
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,916
You've gotta stay in the race

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,500
because it's the only way
you'll be able to carry

233
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,500
that 50 million bucks in
gold bars out of the country.

234
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,250
[TRIXIE] I don't see
any other cars, Speed.

235
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,208
Now the race is between
the Mammoth Car and us.

236
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,208
And I'm beginning to suspect

237
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,000
that they may be
carrying the gold.

I see...

00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,666
So the driver of the Mammoth
Car slugged you, huh?

They'll stop at nothing to win.

So we've got to catch a
plane to where they are

and try to help
Speed and Trixie.

That was the last plane
leaving for the north?

[TICKET AGENT]
But I can't help you.

264

We don't have any more planes.

Oh, no?
