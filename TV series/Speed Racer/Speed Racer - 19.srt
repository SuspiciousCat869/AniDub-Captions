you sneaked into the secret

brag. I'd be ashamed.

try to catch the car.

First, we've got to find Speed.

Stay up this high.
We don't wanna be seen.

Brotch is a very clever man.

190
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,333
He's committed robberies
all over the country

191
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,875
and the police haven't
been able to catch him.

192
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,166
So, maybe this way, we can
find out where his hideout is

193
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,708
and report it to the police!

194
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,833
So we'll follow him, right?

195
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,875

Right.

Judging from his direction,

198
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,333
he'll be entering
the Dakotas soon.

199
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,708
And that must mean
his hideout's somewhere

00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,291
up in the Black Hills
of South Dakota!

201
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,625
They disappeared! There's
no sign of them anywhere!

202
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,875

here somewhere.
