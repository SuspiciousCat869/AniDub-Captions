[ELEGANTOR] Number 8 had an
unfortunate little accident,

was one of your best agents

railroad station.

253
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,666
[ELEGANTOR] Ahh, gentlemen,
we got rid of Rusty Muffler

254
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,875
and Tailgate Crumple,
but we failed to get Speed.

255
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,708
Uh-oh!

256
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,708
Speed's got to be a secret
agent, but that won't stop us.

257
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,666
We'll drop Operation A
and do Operation B,

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,750
which means that we failed
to take over Ambrocia,

259
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,416
so we'll concentrate on
taking over Abalonia.

260
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,625
Fine, I'll be just as happy

takin' over the
country of Abalonia.

262
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,708
It should be easy,
because in a few days,

263
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,583
they're holding
the Twist 'n' Turn Race there!

264
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,625
That'll give us the perfect
opportunity to take over.

265
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,541
Once we get rid of
a certain knight in our way,

266
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,958
it will be checkmate!

267
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,333
Abalonia's city looks so modern!

268
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,958
And it took them only
ten years to build it.

269
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,125
It's hard to believe that

270
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,291
this used to be such
a backward country,

271

but President Montebank
has done wonders!

He's a great man!

273

So in a few days, the city will
be holding its 10th anniversary!

And to celebrate,
they're holding the big race.

you ran into some trouble

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,458
I might be a secret agent.
I wonder what he meant.

299
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
And where is he?

300

Chief, Number 9 is here
to give you a report.

Chief, I've got bad news.

304
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,125
As you know,
they got rid of Number 8

305
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,500
and one of the other racers,

306
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,250
and made an attempt on still
a third racer's life.

307
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,416
We've gotta do something quickly

people are involved.

They took care of our man

where they are right now

Hello.

[HOTEL MANAGER] Mr. Racer,
you and Trixie are invited

319
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,333
to come at 6:00 tonight
to President Montebank's home.

320
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,625
Thank you very much.

321
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a great honor
and we'll be happy to come.

we'll be there at six.

00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,750
But what'll I wear?

325
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,458
I don't have a thing
to wear tonight.

You'll have to stay right here.

[THUG] They left and they
didn't check the tires.

They don't suspect that we
fixed it so the car'll crash.
