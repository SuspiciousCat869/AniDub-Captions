Something must've
happened to her.

You may be right
about that, Trixie.

Mm-hm.

That's right.

[FEMUR]
Without trouble from anyone,

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,041
I discovered this place

217
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,750
and found the
treasures of Cleopatra.

218
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,958
But you came along!

219
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,583
And so, now, I must
get rid of you in here,

220
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,166
where the police
will never find you.

You're working with Calcia!

222
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,125
That's right.
We came here together.

223
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,583
And we discovered the
tomb of Cleopatra together.

224
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,083
But then, just as you guessed,

225
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,583
a stone from the roof feel
and struck Calcia on the head.

226
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,625
And, from that moment,
she's been affected.

227
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,416
Calcia thinks she's Cleopatra,
the Empress of the Nile.

228
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
I intend to go on
letting her think that.

229
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,625
I won't tell her the truth.

You can't let her
keep on living a lie!

You've got to let her go
back to her own country

her here as Cleopatra,

there is a statue of Isis.

The pyramid is 100
miles north of here.

You must go and get the statue

before a shadow reaches

A hundred miles each way,

and you must be back here
within two hours.

That means you must travel

[CALCIA]
What?

00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,291
Will you let me use the Mach 5?

308
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,291
It's the steel chariot which
carried us here to your palace.

[FEMUR]
No. You can't use it.

That wouldn't be fair.

Therefore, you may
use it, young man.

I'll make sure
it won't help him.

[gasps]

322
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,500
[SPEED]
Uh-oh!

323
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,416
[THUG C laughs]

324
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,708
That takes care of him!

325
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,458
[SPEED]
You're wrong.

326
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,333
[THUG C yelps]

327
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,875
[THUGS groan]

328
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,250
[SPEED sighs]

329
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,333
The shadow's almost
up to the statue's eyes.

330
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,625
Speed won't make it.

331
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,208
Speed...

332
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:50,916
Calling headquarters.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,083
Speed is still on his way.

334
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,708
We failed to halt him.

335
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,791
[SPEED]
There it is!

336
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,625
That's the pyramid of
King Tut-Tut on the right.

337
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,083
I've gotta bring back the statue
of Isis if I'm to save Trixie.

338
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,291
But I have less than
an hour to do it in!

339
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,375
He won't make it back
in time, Your Majesty.

340
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
Then do what you must.

341
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,000
Bring your torches over to
the stake and light the fire!

342
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,208
[THUGS]
Yes, sir!

343
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,583
[SPEED] I've got to bring
that statue all the way back!

344
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,083
Oh, Speed, forget about me
and don't come back here!

345
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,666
Save yourself!

346
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,333
[SPEED gasps]

347
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,916
[NARRATOR] Will Speed be able
to return the statue

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,916
in time to save Trixie?

349
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,125
Or will this attack succeed?

350
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,583
Be sure to see the next
