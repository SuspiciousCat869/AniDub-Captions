that we better come here

and tell you all about
what happened.

You were right to tell me. Now,
we'd better go to the police

to Delicia's house

of an escaped convict

named Lawson Lamster.

168
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,333
Then he's the one
who pulled the gun on Speed

169
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
and made him drive away!

170
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,250
Right. He probably figured
he could away in the Mach 5.

171
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,125
They were headed in the
direction of Big Baldy Mountain.

is an escaped convict, have you?

Of course not, Pops.

If you want it so badly,
come and get it!

They'll be sorry
they didn't come out.

I'll make it so hot
for them in there,

I feel that everyone's life
is worth saving.

But you've gone through all
that trouble for nothing.

I'm not going to make it.
I've been too badly hurt...

I want you to do
one more thing for me.

If I don't make it,
give my eyes to Delicia.

You wanna give her your eyes?!

she would never have
lost the use of them.

were so pretty, Trixie.

you'll be able to leave

What happened to that nice man?

You mean, Mr. Lamster, huh?

403
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,416
Is it true that
he had something to do

404

with my eyes
becoming all better?

405

Yes, but he had to go far away
where we'll never see him again.

406
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,000
And he said to tell you
to look at the sky,

407
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,833
once each day, and think of him.

And wherever he is,

409

he'll know that
you're thinking of him.

What a nice idea.
