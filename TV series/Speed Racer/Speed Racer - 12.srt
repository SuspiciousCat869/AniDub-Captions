00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,583
I let that car get away from me.

158
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,250
[DETECTOR] It's all right,
Speed. I've ordered road blocks,

159
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,416
so pretty soon someone should
report seeing it again.

160
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,750
[TRIXIE] Speed! Calling
Speed Racer and the Mach 5!

161
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,125
That's Trixie calling.

162
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,166
[TRIXIE]
Speed!

163
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,791
This is the Mach 5.
Come in, Trixie.

164
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,041
[TRIXIE] The mysterious car
just passed the intersection

165
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,875
three blocks north of
your present location.

166
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,916
[SPEED]
Huh?

167
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,916
Thanks for spotting him.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,541
[TRIXIE] I've got to help,
because if you don't catch him,

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,958
we won't go on our
picnic next week either.

170
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,291
Right. Here goes!

171
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:40,541
[signal ringing]

172
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,708
[SPEED]
Huh?

173
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,833
[SPEED]
Huh?

174
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,125
[VOICE]
Mel... ange...

175
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,333
[DETECTOR]
It's a robot.

176
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
This means the black sports
car was being operated

177
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,000
by remote control.

178
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,333
It's too bad, Inspector,

179
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,625
that the sports car was
able to get away from me.

180
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,291
You did a good job
anyway, Speed,

181
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,125
in bringing back this robot.

182
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,541
By analyzing the mechanisms,

183
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,833
we'll be able to learn something
about whoever made it.

184
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,416
[SPEED] Oh, I almost forgot.
The robot said something.

185
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,666
What?!

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,000
The train made so much
noise as it was going by

187
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,458
that I wasn't able
to make it out.

188
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,625
[DETECTOR]
Oh...

189
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,541
[SPRITLE]
I tape recorded what it said!

190
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,541
[DETECTOR]
Ah-hah!

191
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,250
[SPRITLE]
I've got it all.

192
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,041
I recorded the whole thing.

193
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,625
[TRIXIE] You were hiding
in the Mach 5 again.

194
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
Right.

195
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,625
Oh, Spritle.

196
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,666
You shouldn't have been in
there. You might've been hurt.

197
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,500
Well, I got a tape recording.

198
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,583
Then give the tape recording to
the inspector so he can hear it.

199
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,166
Uh-uh. Not so fast.

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,500
Will you give us some cake
if we let you listen to it?

201
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,000
You'll get cake later, Spritle.

202
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,666
Let me listen to that
recording right now.

203
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,458
[SPRITLE]
When later? Uh-uh-uh!

204
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,875
[DETECTOR]
As soon as this case is solved,

205
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,416
I'll buy you a seven-layered
chocolate cake.

206
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,583
Here!

207
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,458
[SPEED, TRIXIE,
INSPECTOR laugh]

208
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,958
[RECORDING] Melange still races!
Melange still races!

209
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,375
Melange still races!

210
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,958
Melange? What's Melange,
Speed? Can you tell me?

211
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,208
[SPEED]
Hmm...

212
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,375
Melange is the name of
a horse that was famous.

213
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,250
What? A horse?

214
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,833
Yes, Inspector.

215
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,958
I read all about Melange when
I was studying French history.

216
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,583
I remember that Napoleon
had a horse by that name.

217
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,916
It was a great horse, and once,
it saved Napoleon's life.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,791
Well, that's very
interesting, Speed,

219
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,125
but what's the connection?

220
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,500
What's Napoleon's horse
got to do with this case?

221
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,666
[POPS]
Maybe I can tell you.

222
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,375
I know another story
about Melange.

223
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,166
[SPEED]
Pops!

224
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,458
Mr. Racer, I'd like to hear it.

225
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,416
Will you go ahead and
tell it to me please?

226
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,666
I remember that
about 15 years ago,

227
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
another race was
held at Danger Pass.

228
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,791
Danger Pass is one of the
most dangerous race courses

229
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,833
in the world.

230
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,750
The two men,
Mr. Black and Mr. Green,

231
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,291
who were crashed into recently
by the mysterious black car,

232
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,500
were coaching a team that
was expected to win.

233
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,333
But they were worried they
might be beaten by a young racer

234
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,583
named Flash Marker, driving
a car he called "Melange."

235
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,375
There were 50 cars in the race,
and for the first half,

236
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,625
it looked as if it
could be won by anybody.

237
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,291
But then Flash Marker started
passing all the other cars

238
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,750
at the entrance to Danger Pass.

239
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,875
Just as he got to the top,
another car cut in front of him,

240
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,333
and, to avoid smashing into it,
he fell into the valley below.

241
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,000
That's quite a story, Pops.
I never heard it before.

242
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,000
Inspector, don't you think it
must have something to do with

243
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,750
the case we're working on?

244
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,458
[TRIXIE] There seems to
be a connection all right.

245
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,708
[DETECTOR]
There does indeed.

246
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,583
Pops, in that race at
Danger Pass years ago,

247
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,625
do you remember if that car
cut in front of the Melange

248
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,708
on purpose or was it accidental?

249
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,250
[POPS] No one ever
found out for sure,

250
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,750
and this happened so long ago

251
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,416
that almost everybody's
forgotten about it.

252
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,875
Well, let me try to remember.

253
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,291
The Melange was wrecked by a car
owned by the Three Roses Club.

254
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,583
The Three Roses Club?

255
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,208
[POPS] That's right.
That's who owned the car.

256
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,250
Pops, did Mr. Flash Marker
leave any family behind?

257
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,833
Well, I seem to remember
that he had two children.

258
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,000
Children? Hmm...

259
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,833
[DETECTOR]
Here we are.

260
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,416
This is where Flash
Marker's children live.

261
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,625
Oh, hello, Miss Marker,
we've met before.

262
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,500
[WOMAN]
Mm-hm.

263
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,541
Well, Speed, I didn't know
that you two knew each other.

264
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,375
Would you like to
buy some flowers?

265
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,625
No, thank you, Miss Marker.
My name is Speed Racer,

266
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,041
and this is Inspector
Detector of the police.

267
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:57,916
[gasps]

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,500
And, uh, my name is Trixie.

269
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm very glad to
know you, Miss Marker.

270
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,333
You're called Lilly and your
brother is Flash Marker Jr.

271
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,916
Is he at home?

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,333
Yes, he is, Inspector. But my
brother Flash is sick in bed.

273
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,

274
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,333
but I'd like to speak to him
for just a moment if I may.

275
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,083
[LILLY]
All right. Come.

276
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,375
Flash Jr. hasn't been well
and he's been in bed like this

277
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,208
for more than three
weeks, Inspector.

278
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,916
Ah, then he stayed home
here all day today, right?

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,291
Yes, sir.

280
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,625
Well, Flash,

281
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,583
we're here to investigate
about a black sports car

282
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,333
that has caused some bad
accidents here in the city.

283
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,916
Do you know anything about it?

284
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,166
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

285
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,250
[FLASH JR. chuckles]

286
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,291
The cops weren't able
to find out anything

287
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,708
thanks to you, Lilly.

288
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,166
Oh, Flash! You told me to
lie and I did to save you,

289
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,458
but I can't lie
ever again! I won't!

290
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,333
So please, you've got
to stop driving that car!

291
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,500
They've caught the robot,

292
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,000
so I can't drive that
sports car again,

293
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,708
but I've been planning
something for years.

294
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,625
Let me show you. Come inside.

295
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,916
[FLASH JR.] You didn't know
I had built this secret factory

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,458
under our house, did you, Lilly?

297
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,416
[LILLY] No, Flash, I had no idea
you had all this down here.

298
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,708
[FLASH JR.]
The police know that car now,

299
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,041
and they'd spot it in a minute,

300
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,166
so I can't drive it in the
big race at Danger Pass.

301
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,541
Watch this, Lilly.

302
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,958
I've changed the face on our
father's car, the Melange,

303
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,500
so nobody'll be able
to recognize it,

304
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,166
and I want you to
drive it in the race.

305
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,916
That car's caused
so many accidents!

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,458
Don't ask me to drive it!

307
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,625
Get behind the wheel.

308
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,625
I'll operate it with
the remote control.

309
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,083
I don't want anything
to do with the car.

310
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875

the Melange was
wrecked by a car

than they did for a man's life!

I'll get even with them all for
what they did to our father.

none other than Speed Racer.

us ever since Black and Green

mysterious X3 sports car.

That's the Melange,
