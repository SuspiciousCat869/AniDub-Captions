00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,041
someone who knew that
I had been a witness.

158
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,791
And whoever it is is afraid
of me because of what I know,

159
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,041
and they feel they've gotta
get me outta the way.

160
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,041
[SPEED] That has to be the
only reason someone's after me.

161
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,833
I've gotta find
out who they are.

162
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
Trixie, why don't we go out?

163
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,291
Oh, that's what we've
been waiting for!

164
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,041
Let's all go out!

165
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,333
You'd better stay right here
in the room. It'll be safer!

166
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,416
[SPRITLE, CHIM CHIM groan]

167
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,333
[TRIXIE] Since we're here,
let's not travel in the Mach 5,

168
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,291
let's use the Hong Kong
method of travel.

169
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,416
What's the Hong Kong
method of travel?

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,625
Well, isn't this
much more romantic

171
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,083
than traveling in the Mach 5?

172
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,125
[SPEED]
Hmm.

173
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,458
[TRIXIE] By the way, Speed,
where are we going?

174
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,708
To visit the
floating restaurant.

175
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,666
[TRIXIE]
Oh! The floating restaurant?

176
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,208
[SPEED] Don't you
remember the invitation

177
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,583
that woman who was murdered
on the plane had in her purse?

178
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,458
I never imagined that
a restaurant on a boat

179
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,041
could be so elegant.

180
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,958
Elegant enough for even an
elegant princess to visit.

181
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,875
[SPEED]
Ohh... Princess Peddle.

182
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,041
She's elegant, all right.

183
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,083
[TRIXIE]
Hmph!

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,375
Those swords she's
dancing with are real

185
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,750
and look very sharp.

186
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,791
Speed!

187
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
[TRIXIE]
Speed!

188
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,458
She's much too elegant.

189
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,125
Ouch!

190
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,166

[SPEED]

[gasps]

194
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,458
I missed again!

195
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,416
[SPEED]
Wait! Wait!

196
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,875
[gasps]

197
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,083
[SPEED]
Wait!

198
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,791
[SPEED]
A strange kind of weapon.

199
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,333
One I've never seen before.

200
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,500
And the people on the plane
were hit by poison needles.

201
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,208
There must be some connection.

202
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,208
And whoever invented these
weapons is very clever.

203
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,250
[TRIXIE]
Speed! Speed!

204
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,708
Speed, I have a message for you!

205
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,291
[SPEED]
Huh?

206
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,875
Princess Peddle sent word that
she wants to see you right now!

207
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,708
I'm to see Princess Peddle, hmm?

208
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,666
[SPEED] Now maybe some of the
missing parts of the mystery

209
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,208
will fall into place...

210
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,208
Thank you for saving
my life, Speed.

211
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,291
It was really an honor, Princess
Peddle. I'm glad I could help.

212
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,291
[PEDDLE] And I'm glad to
hear you say that, Speed,

213
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,375
because I'm afraid I
need your help again.

214
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,125
Huh?

215
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,625
[PEDDLE]
That's right.

216
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,208
Because I'm a princess and
the richest girl in the world,

217
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,750
there're people trying
to get me out of the way

218
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
so they can take my
throne and money.

219
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,166
So someone's trying to
get rid of the princess?

220
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,708
And she wants you
to be her bodyguard?

221
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,416
But, Speed, you're
liable to be hurt!

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,750
[SPEED]
Hmm...

223
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,291
It could be dangerous,
but what else could I do?

224
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,750
She said it would cause
an international scandal

225
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,041
if she went to the
Hong Kong police

226
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,583
and asked them to protect her.

227
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,375
And she can't run away because
that would seem suspicious.

228
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,708
[TRIXIE]
Did you agree to take the job?

229
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,958
[SPEED]
Yes.

230
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,875
But you know you've got
a race coming up soon!

231
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,708
[SPEED] The Hong Kong Grand
Prix! And I'm gonna win it!

232
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,375
Well, we might as well
make the most of things.

233
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,166
The princess has to do
some sightseeing today,

234
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,666
but I have an idea.

235
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,500
[AGENT 9]
So far, they're safe.

236
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,041
[SPEED] And on your
right... [clears throat]

237
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,166
[rasping voice] On your
right, Princess Peddle,

238
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,916
is a statue of
Prince Whosamawhatsits,

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,750
and his, uh, pet
pig Snortaporcine,

240
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,541
and his mother, Queen Zizi.

241
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,458
These statues have been here
for at least a thousand years!

242
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,750
[SPEED]
How am I doing, Trixie?

243
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,375
[TRIXIE]
Just great! Keep it up, Speed.

244
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,583
[SPEED]
Okay.

245
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,708
[rasping voice]
Uh, these statues represent

246
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,166
the characters in
an ancient legend.

247
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,000
I wish I'd read up on
it before we came here,

248
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,541
so I could tell you more about
it, but there wasn't time.

249
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,416
[SPEED]
Look out!

[ASSASSIN]
Huh?!

252
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,208
That's Speed! It was
a trap! Come on!

253
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,500

Stop! Come back here!

Come back here!

[engine revs]

257
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,791
There she goes. I'll try to
catch her with the Mach 5.

258
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,625
[gasps]

259
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,958
[ASSASSIN]
I can't let him catch me!

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,958
[gasps]

261
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,250
That's poison gas!

[gasping]

264
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,250
I wonder what else
she'll try to pull.

265
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,458
[SPEED] You weren't hurt.
Come on, get up!

266
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,083
[ASSASSIN]
Huh?

267
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,208
You heard me. Stop faking.
Come on, get up!

268
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,958
I'm not taking orders from you!
You're taking them from me!

269
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,375
[SPEED]
Huh?

270
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,833
Even though you've got a gun,
it's not gonna help you!

271
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,916
I'm taking you back to the city

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,833
and turning you
over to the police!

00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,000
[SPEED]
Huh?

276
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,791
Mr. Racer, thank you
very much for helping us.

277
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,083
I'm from the International
Police Department.

278
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,541
This woman is a
member of the ring

279
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,750
that wants to get rid of
Princess Peddle and her family.

280
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm placing you under arrest

281
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,250
and we're going to round up
the rest of your murderous gang.

282
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,541
Are you? That's what you think!
You haven't met up with X yet!

283
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,791
Just wait till you meet X!

284
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,583
[SPEED] X? I wonder who
that mysterious X is...

285
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,958
You look worried, Speed.

286
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,458
[SPRITLE]
Better snap out of it, Speedy!

287
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,708
The race is going to begin soon,

288
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,666
and you've gotta
concentrate on driving.

289
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,000
[TRIXIE]
Look at all the spectators!

290
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,750
A lot of them are here
to see you win, Speed.

291
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,333
You don't wanna disappoint them.

292
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,083
Are you all right? You're acting
as if something's the matter.

293
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,333
Am I? I'm worried
about the princess.

294
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,541
Look, there's Princess
Peddle up there!

295
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,166
[SPEED]
She's still in danger,

296
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,833
but how am I going to protect
her and race at the same time?

297
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,416
Wow!

298
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,875
Ha...

299
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,916
[SPRITLE] Wow! I didn't know
there'd be a woman racer!

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,708
[ANNOUNCER]
Start your engines!

301
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:42,750
[engines revving]

302
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,458
[SPEED] Princess Peddle is going
back to her own country tonight,

303
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,250
so now would be the last chance
for her enemies to get her.

304
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,875
I'll bet they try something
while this race is going on.

305
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,583
I hope he'll win.

306
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,041
He will! Nobody can beat
the Mach 5 with Speed driving!

307
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,166
Hey, wait a minute! Something's
funny about that woman!

308
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,541
[SPEED] The International
Police didn't get

309
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,666
the leader of the gang,
so he must be around.

310
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,375
[SPEED] So far, the members of
that gang seem to be women,

311
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,000
and I've seen that woman
racer somewhere before...

312
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,416
...but where?

313
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,583
Ah! She's the stewardess
from that plane!

314
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,208
She must be the ringleader,
the mysterious X!

315
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,291
She's staying back there.

316
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,916
She must have a reason and
I've gotta find out what it is

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,291
and try to stop her!

318
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,875
So that's her plan!
I've gotta do something fast!

319
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:07,916
Ah!

320
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,875
What's Speed doing?!

321
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,833
I wonder why he's
pulling off the course!

322
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,500
[gasps]

323
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,416
Speed, you've beaten me!
My scheme failed!

324
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,833
You're X! Don't deny it!

325
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,833
You're the leader of the gang

326
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,208
that tried to get
Princess Peddle!

327
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,000
Right! But you stopped me!

328
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,541
If you hadn't, I would've taken
over the princess's throne

329
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,666
and her vast fortune!

330
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,041
Her country would've been mine!

331
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,041
But now, I've got
nothing! I-I...

332

[X groaning]

333
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,958
[PEDDLE] She'll be all right.
She just fainted.

334
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,125
Thank you, Speed, for
saving my life again.

335
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,708
Well, I'm glad I did, Princess.

336
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,083
Now you'll be able to
return to your home safely.

337
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,708
[SPRITLE]
So long!

338
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,208
Now she won't have to worry.
The gang was arrested.

339
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,875
But the Hong Kong Grand Prix
is over. And Speed lost.

340
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,041
He didn't even have a
chance to finish the race.

341
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,375
Well, there was something
much more important.

342
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,958
I had to save Princess Peddle.
And I'll be racing again.
