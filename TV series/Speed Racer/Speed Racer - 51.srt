men began to compete

00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,250
against each other
in games of sports,

19
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,291
there have been rewards
to the winners.

20
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,458
And for thousands of years,
perhaps that was enough.

00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,458
But as man became
more civilized,

22
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,916
other rewards were
given in various forms.

This is the reward

and go through Chile all the
way south past Cape Horn.

to the Mediterranean.

to the British Isles.

be much too dangerous

gold to make him rich,

an opportunity like that!
