drive the mini-racer.

keep him locked up.

You'll be locked up forever!

301
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,125
He needs to be punished.

302
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,791
And just for that, he can
stay locked up in there

303

until the race is over.

304

Maybe it'll teach him a lesson
he won't forget in such a hurry.
