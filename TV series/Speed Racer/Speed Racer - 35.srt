So much has been happening
to me in the last few hours.

I'm sure Trixie and Spritle
are wondering if I'm all right.

Aren't you worried,
too, Chim Chim?

167

He's not worried;
he's just excited

168
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,166
because we're entering
the jungle where he's from.

[SPEED] I still have
two days before the race--

the monster, if we're lucky.

So that's the mountain, huh?

very strange about it.

there is, Trixie? Huh?

all of my tribe escaped, but the

He defeated the spider, but
then before we could thank him,

he suddenly disappeared
into the jungle!

But I haven't told you yet
that I would cooperate.

00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
[BOSS] Our aim is to return to
our country and liberate it.

[CARNIVORY] That's what the

Do you remember?

258
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,041
It was caught between two other
countries that were fighting.

259
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,416
And as each of them battled,

260
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,083
our country was
overrun time and again.

261
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,958
We became a no man's land,
except for those awful days

when the battles
were at their worst.

And no man was safe.

264
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,958
Now, I want to liberate
and rebuild our country.

265

We have made gorillas
and spiders bigger.

266

Now our plan is to apply
the process to human beings,

267
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,750
and to build an army of giants.

268
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,750
That's why we need
your cooperation.

You told me nothing but lies!

Our country was
responsible for that war.

We began it and
we deserved to be punished.

And you're mistaken if
you think I'm going to cooperate

Huh? You know him?

Well, we don't let anyone
