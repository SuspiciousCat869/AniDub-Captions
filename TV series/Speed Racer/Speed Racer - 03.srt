He may be known to bring
bad luck to races,

158
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,375
but he's one of the best
drivers I've ever seen.

159
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,875
[ANNOUNCER]
In addition to the Masked Racer,

160
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,083
one of the top contenders
and a last-minute entry

161
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,875
is a newcomer, Speed Racer.

162
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,708
Huh?

163
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
[SPRITLE]
Speed!

164
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,333
--[CHIM CHIM laughs]
--[MOM gasps]

165
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,333
[ANNOUNCER] Speed, who has raced
in very few meets so far,

166
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,708
will enter this race
driving the Mach 5,

167
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,875
a special racing car designed
by his father, Pops Racer.

168
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,958
The race is expected to
be a close competition

169
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,250
between Speed and
the Masked Racer.

170
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,875
You're not supposed
to be in the race!

171
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,333
Here we go again,
Pops blowing another gasket.

172
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,250
Speed, I don't want
you in that race.

173
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,291
Under no circumstances
are you to enter.

174
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,333
Understand?!

175
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,958
Now, dear!

176
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,958
Here we go, Pops'll
change his mind.

177
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,708
[POPS] I'm only trying to do
what's best for you, son.

178
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,583
You don't have enough
skill and experience yet

179
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,791
to race against
the Masked Racer.

180
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,708
It requires the
utmost technical skill.

181
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,666
Sharp and well-trained
reflexes are necessary

182
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
over every inch of
that racing course.

183
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,916
Let me tell you about
your older brother, Rex,

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,208
who left home many years ago.

185
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,208
He and I had a bad argument.

186
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,625
It all started when
he was 18 years old,

187
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,541
the same age you are now.

188
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,166
He joined a race without
asking my permission.

189
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,375
And he used a car I
spent years building.

190
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,041
[tires screech]

191
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,708
I win... I win!

192
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:35,250
[tires screeching]

193
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,416
You'll smash!

194
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:50,333
[CROWD gasping, shouting]

195
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,416
You have to get outta that car!

196
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,625
Rex, are you all right?

197
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,750
[REX groans]

198
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,291
I'm okay, Pops.

199
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,041
[MAN E] The kid looks great.
He wasn't scratched!

200
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,375
I'm glad you
weren't hurt, my boy.

201
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,208
I'm very sorry, Pops.

202
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,666
A few yards further and I
would have been the winner.

203
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,083
I did such a great
job at driving,

204
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,750
I deserve to win the race.

205
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,166
Don't try to tell me that!

206
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,625
You deserve to lose the race

207
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,541
because your driving
technique was very bad!

208
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,791
What do you mean "bad"?!

209
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,916
I would've won if my car
hadn't gone into a spin!

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,458
I know that, Rex!

211
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,291
But if you had more experience,
that wouldn't have happened.

212
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,125
Listen, Pops, I'm
already an expert.

213
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,666
But my beautiful new car
is all smashed up!

214
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,000
What about that, huh?

215
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,666
I'm sorry, but it
was just an accident.

216
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,166
I didn't mean to do it.

217
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,250
I don't wanna find you behind
the wheel of a car again,

218
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,791
and that's final!

219
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,500
Then I'll have to become
a champion without you,

220
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,708
so I'm leaving home.

221
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,000
Good bye, Pops.

222
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,541
[POPS]
You'll never be a champion, Rex!

223
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,416
Mark my words, without
skill and experience,

224
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,416
you'll never get anywhere
in the world of racing!

225
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,458
[growls]

226
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,958
And I never saw your
brother Rex again.

227
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
And that's why I say
you need experience.

228
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,958
But, Pops, don't you know that

229
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,583
Speed's the best racing
car driver in the world?

230
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,208
Well, I'm the one
who trained him!

231
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,458
I didn't ask you, Spritle!

232
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,000
[SPRITLE chuckles nervously]

233

Well, it's getting pretty late
and it's time for bed, boys.

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,458
[SPEED]
Aw, Rex, where are you?

238
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,750
Why don't you come home
again where you belong?

239
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,500
Mom and Pops miss you.
And so do I.

240
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,416
I wish you could be here when I
race against the Masked Racer.

241
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,250
But, wherever you are,
wish me luck.

00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,791
I've got to beat him.
I've got to!

[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in a secret hotel room,

the secret head
of the Alpha Team,

245
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,333
Mr. Wiley, is holding
a secret conference.

246
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,583
I want my team to win
the Trans Country Race

00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,958
no matter what the price,
do you understand, Slick? Hm?

248
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,916
You can count on me, Mr. Wiley.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,458
It doesn't matter to me
who's in the race,

250
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,041
the Masked Racer or Speed
Racer, I'm gonna beat 'em!

[WILEY]
Smart boy.

252
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,666
But I've heard that the
Masked Racer's pretty tricky.

253
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,458
No matter what trick he pulls,
I'll be pulling it first.

254
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't worry, I'll beat him.

255
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,166
[WILEY chuckles]

256
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,000
[WILEY] That's the
dirty fighting spirit.

257
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,500
But when I do win, I expect
to be paid a lotta money!

258
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,333
[WILEY] I promise, Slick, you'll
get everything you deserve.

259
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,375
Hey, Mr. Wiley, I just found
out that the Masked Racer

260
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,750
is staying at
the hotel, sleepin'.

261
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,416
He didn't make any
plans to beat us.

262
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,583
[WILEY]
So?

263
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,833
So, we better make
some plans to beat him!

264
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,166
[SLICK]
Don't worry.

265
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,750
When I'm out on track
in the middle of the race,

266
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll do my stuff, and he
won't know what hit him!

267
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,875
[WILEY chuckles]
Good luck, Slick.

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,291
[gasps] Number 7, driven
by the Masked Racer,

is beating Speed,
driving the Mach 5!

Now, they're neck-and-neck,

271
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,416
and the Masked Racer is
trying to make Speed crash!

272
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
They both crash!

What'd you come here for?

[RACER X] To ask you
to do something for me.

284

I want you to give this
letter to your brother, Speed.

[SPRITLE gasps]

286
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,166
Give the letter to my brother?

[RACER X]
Mm-hm.

288
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't get it. Why don't you
give it to him yourself?

[RACER X] I don't want
anybody to know about it.

Please take it.

00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,333
[SPRITLE]
Well, why should I?

292
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,833
After all, I'm not the mail man!

I'll give you some candy.

Who was that?

Him? Just somebody who was lost.

00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,666
He was looking for
a post office,

301
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,208
and I told him
which route to take.

to me by the Masked Racer.

What does it say, Speed?

310
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,000
It doesn't have anything to do
with you, Spritle. It's private.

And you mustn't tell anybody
about it. Do you promise?

I've got to be in that race.

315
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,583
I've got to beat
the Masked Racer.

316
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,333
And I know I can do it.

317
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,166
But Pops says I
need more experience.

318

Well, I'll go to the track now
and I'll get experience!

[RACER X] You! What are
you doing here, Speed?

323
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,916
Practicing.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,291
You must not be in the race!

[SPEED] I will be! And I can
beat you; I'll prove it!

[NARRATOR] Visibility is
nearly down to zero

328
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,500
as Speed and Racer X race
blindly through the night.

One wrong turn, and it will
be the end for either of them.

[RADIO] And the forecast
for the day of the big race

335
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,375
is still uncertain.

336
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,083
Right now, we're in the center
of a low, low-pressure area,

337
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
which is bringing heavy
rains and high winds.

At sea, the waves
are 30 feet high,

00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,500
and the tide is still rising.

340
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,625
Driving conditions
are extremely hazardous.

00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,833

The storm grows worse,

and the road more dangerous.

347
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,833
Now, Speed barely manages to

348
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:43,125
keep the Mach 5 from
skidding into disaster.
