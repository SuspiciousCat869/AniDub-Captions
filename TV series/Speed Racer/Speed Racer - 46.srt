00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,166
[CHIM CHIM laughs]

158
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,250
[SPRITLE] That's not funny.
Come on, let's try again!

159
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,541
[gibbers]

160
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,833
Hands up, everybody!
I'm known as Spritle the Kid!

161
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,708
[laughing]

162
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,583
Stop laughing, Chim Chim!

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,708
[laughing]

164
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,625
[CHIM CHIM yelps]

165
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,708
[SPRITLE]
Ah!

166
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,250
Chim Chim, that's an Apache!
A Motorcycle Apache!

167
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,083
[APACHE A]
Quiet!

168
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,125
[SPRITLE whimpers]

169
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,458
[SPRITLE]
Attack!

170
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,208
[yells]

171
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,833
[yelps]

172
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,333
Bullseye! Nice going, Chim Chim!
Now we can capture him!

173
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,333
[SPRITLE]
He put up a terrific fight,

174
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,541
but he was no match
for Chim Chim and me.

175
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,166
You've both done a very
brave job. This man is a spy.

176
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,541
[APACHE A]
We will do all we can

177
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,250
to stop you from completing
your secret base.

178
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,583
And, for the sake
of world peace,

179
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,041
we'll do all we can to
stop you from stoppin' us!

180
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,333
Where's the headquarters
of the Motorcycle Apaches?

181
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,833
[APACHE A]
I will never tell you!

182
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,666
[SPEED] Sir, why don't you try
to find it before I leave?

183
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,125
I'm afraid there won't
be time, Speed.

184
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,958
That Uraniumtane must be
delivered as soon as possible.

185
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,625
But the Motorcycle Apaches will
be waiting to ambush Speed,

186
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,041
so let us go along
to fight them!

187
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,083
[SKYHIGH]
Well...

188
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,708
Okay, you've proved
you can fight.

189
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,041
Hooray! We'll be with Speed!

190
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,166
[SKYHIGH]
On one condition.

191
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
What?!

192
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:41,833
[SKYHIGH]
You'll ride in the wagon.

193
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,208
What d'ya mean?

194
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,708
[SKYHIGH] Look. You'll ride
in that wagon out there.

195
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,083
[SPRITLE]
Oh, boy! That looks groovy!

196
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
And you must take
a different trail

197
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,000
from the one Speed'll
be driving.

198
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,541
[SPRITLE]
Hmm...

199
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,916
Do you hear that, Chim Chim?
We won't be driving with Speed!

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,041
But you'll be carrying
a very important cargo.

201
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,708
The wagon will be
loaded with all the food

202
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,916
for the men who are building
the base, all right?

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,875
The wagon will be loaded
with food? And I'm hungry.

204
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,125
[SKYHIGH] You'll take
good care of the cargo.

205
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,875
[SPRITLE]
Mm-hmm!

206
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,916
[trumpet sounds]

207
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,333
Depart!

208
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,291
They'll reach the base long
before we do, Chim Chim. Right?

209
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,791
See ya later!

210
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,916
I'll be counting on
them to make it.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,125
[SPRITLE]
So long!

212
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,458
The best of luck, Spritle!

213
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,166
We'll meet you at the base!

214
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,333
Sure! We'll make it, I hope!

215
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,250
[SPRITLE sighs]

216
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,125
[CHIM CHIM snores]

217
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,791
What was that, Chim Chim?!

218
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,041
Huh? Ah!

219
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,125
Apaches!

220
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,708
[APACHE B]
They're... children.

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,958
[APACHE C] Careful, it may
be a trap. Look in the wagon.

222
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,125
[APACHE D] Fruit and
many other goodies in cans,

223
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,083
and we're starving.
Let's take everything.

224
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,333
[BOTH wailing]

225
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,333
[APACHE D]
Oh! Quiet! Quiet!

226
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,958
All right, all right!
We're sorry! Keep the food!

227
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,666
Braves, let's go!

228
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,375
[engines revving]

229
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,541
Speed, I hope those
Apaches attack

230
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,333
because I'm sure
we can beat them.

231
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,000
But if they attack,
we can't stay and fight!

232
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,458
We've gotta try to get
through with the Uraniumtane.

233
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,333
Just running away won't be
the easiest thing to do.

234
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,833
[APACHE E] Calling headquarters!
Calling headquarters!

235
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,000
[APACHE F]
This is headquarters.

236
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,291
[APACHE E]
The transportation caravan

237
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,958
is approaching Tabletop Mesa.

238
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,833
[APACHE F]
Ugh. State exact location!

239
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,250
[APACHE E] Three miles
southeast of the mesa,

240
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,833
and travelling north by
northwest at 50 miles an hour,

241
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,833
following the Old Hammer
and Chisel Trail.

242
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,166
They took a different
trail than the one

243
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,000
we expected them to take...

244
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,208
...and that means they're
carrying the Uraniumtane.

245
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,125
[APACHE E]
Anything else, sir?

246
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
How many trucks are there?

247
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,666
[APACHE E] Sixteen trucks,
and all of them heavily armed.

248
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,000
Wait! There's something else!

249
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,833
Another vehicle,
not like the others.

250
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,166
A white sports car.

251
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,708
The letter "M" is
painted across the hood

252
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,125
and on the side I
see the number 5.

253
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,750
Hmm... That must be
the famous Mach 5.

254
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,083
That's Speed's car!

255
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,375
[APACHE F]
What're your orders, Geronimo?

256
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,333
All men and weapons are to
be assembled immediately

257
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,375
for a showdown battle.
Rendezvous at Bad Valley!

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,333
So far, we're safe.

259
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,333
That's the Mach 5, all right.

260
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,958
Attack!

261
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:41,875
[APACHES whooping]

262
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,875
Here come the
Motorcycle Apaches!

[BOTH gasp]

264
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,333
Men! Form a circle around the
Mach 5! It must be protected!

265
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,791
[grunts]

[groans]

268
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,375
We'd better get out of here!

269
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,791
Ah! Speed, we can't
get away from them!

270
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,833
Hang on!

271
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,750
[GERONIMO]
I'll get Speed myself!

272
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,000
I've gotta beat him.

273
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,875
He must be the leader
of the Apache tribe.

274
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,458
Greetings, Speed Racer.

275
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,375
Get out of my way!

276
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,208
[GERONIMO]
No!

277
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,250
You'll be permitted to go on

278
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,416
if you leave the
Uraniumtane here!

279
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,750
Sorry, but I can't do that!

280
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,916
My mission is to transport
it to the secret base!

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,875
I don't wanna fight you, Speed.
Leave the Uraniumtane with me!

282
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,208
Get out of my way
and stop interfering

283
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
with the construction
of the base!

284
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,583
I'm defending the land that
belongs to me and my people.

285
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,833
We don't want strangers
coming on our private land.

286
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,500
You don't belong here!
Get out of here!

287
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,666
Stop being so selfish!

288
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,041
Just a small part of
your land is needed

289
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,166
to build a base for
ensuring world peace!

290
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,750
Making sure of world
peace also means

291
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,625
making peace with my tribe,
and that's important to me!

292
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,208
This beautiful land has
belonged to my tribe

293
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,250
for hundreds of years and it
will continue to belong to them.

294
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,500
Go back to your racing, Speed.

295
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,958
I have too much respect
for you for us to fight.

296
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,958
But the base must be
built for world peace!

297
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,250
We're wasting time.

298
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,916
There's no other way but
for you and me to fight.

[groaning]

305
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,416
Oh! You're the Indian, Geronimo!

306
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,125
I dreamed of being
a professional racer,

307
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,166
but I gave the dream up because
I'm the son of a chief.

308
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,208
Instead, I became
an admirer of yours

309
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,000
and hoped to see you
world champion someday.

310
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,875
But you had to come here
with that Uraniumtane

311
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,166
and I couldn't allow that.

312
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,083
I had to try to stop you, Speed.

313
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,000
But the only things in
that package were rocks.

[SPEED]
Shh!

315
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,291
I'll still stop you!
The land belongs to my tribe,

316
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,625
and I'll make sure
you won't get through

317
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,458
with that Uraniumtane!

Poor Geronimo.

319
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,208
He doesn't realize that he
must give up a little bit

320
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,416
of the land so that all
the land can be protected.

321
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,333
Well, maybe after he
gets out of the hospital,

322
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,666
he'll come to his senses.

323
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,541
Somehow, I'm sure he will.

324
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,750
Look, Chim Chim, there's
the space development base!

Your name, I reckon, is Spritle?

[SPRITLE]
That's me, all right!

328
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,541
Well, you did a mighty
fine job, kid!

329
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,000
[SPRITLE]
Huh?

330
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,625
[MAN A] That's right! You
brought us the Uraniumtane.

331
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,000
It was in those cans there!

Well, Speed,

thanks to you and your
brother and your friends,

335

the space development
project can be completed

00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,125
and work towards preserving
peace in the world.

Thank you, sir,

but the real thanks goes
to my brother Spritle.

completed the job.
