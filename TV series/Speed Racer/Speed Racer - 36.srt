Two days before the start

of the Trans-Africa Grand Prix,

19
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,375
I had finished
checking the course

20
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,375

to Nairobi in a small plane.

On board, I met
Professor Carnivory,

00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,083
who was on his way to
check into a story about

a mysterious mountain.

the professor prisoner,

make its way through the jungle.

a bridge came out of the water.

And before the bridge could be
lowered into the water again,

Take me down off this rope!

Let them off those ropes.

They're innocent children;

they haven't done
anything to anyone!

I'll let them go
if you change your mind

and agree to work for me.
How about it?

I'm willing to let them go...

you agree to work with me.

You're not being fair, Doctor.

I have nothing to do
with those children,

so why should their

The country of Giltar.

That's what it was
called 20 years ago.

Many people have forgotten it
or want to forget it.

Giltar was a country
that loved war.

What kind of men
are holding us prisoner?

233

And they're planning
to start another war.

who might be the one
you're looking for.

We were on a plane together.
His name was Speed.

We must proceed only for
the sake of pure science.

we can be sure

if our process can
make giants out of humans

I couldn't be the friend of a
man who makes such a machine.

It's my duty to see that you
never threaten

You're wasting your time

if you think you can
fight me and my men.

You have no choice
but to do as I command.

Help us build an army of giants

and help us take over

dreaded war country of Giltar.

stopped before they could

involve too many innocent people
in their diabolical scheme.
