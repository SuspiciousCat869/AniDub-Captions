00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,041
[SPEED] I know, but as long as
the public pays to see them,

157
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,375
they'll continue to have them.

158
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,875
[MRS. ZOOMER] Poor Gadge
has changed so much since

159
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,875
--he became a car wrestler.
--[SPEED] What do you mean?

160
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,208
His temper has
become very short.

161
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
He seems to get angry
over the slightest thing.

162
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,375
I worry about him...

163
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,375
[yells]

164
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,291
[GADGE]
I'll smash everything!

165
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,791
I never know what he'll do next,
or what he'll try to smash.

166
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,208
He's a different man
since he hasn't been able

167
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,458
to race anymore.

168
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,208
Let me warn you, Speed,
keep away from him,

169
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,541
or, without really meaning to,
he may try to hurt you.

170
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,625
Be careful.

171
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,791
[SPEED]
If I'm going to help Mr. Zoomer,

172
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,291
I've gotta stop him
from car wrestling.

173
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,416
[SPEED]
All he needs is one good break,

174
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,750
and I'm sure he'd
be normal again

175
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,166
and his family would
be proud of him.

176
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,708
I've got to help him.

177
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,416
[GADGE] Come on, come on! Fill
it up! I haven't got all day!

178
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,250
[SPEED]
That's Mr. Zoomer in that car!

179
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,375
I wonder what he's up to
and where he's headed.

180
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,500
I'll follow him.

181
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,041
[GADGE]
Huh?

182
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,083
That's Speed Racer
in the Mach 5.

183
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,208
He's following me. A wise guy,
huh? He may be sorry!

184
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,041
He's still back there.

185
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,250
Well, Speed, you're
going to learn something

186
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,833
you'll wish you didn't
know anything about!

187
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,958
[SPEED]
Where could he be headed?

188
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,875
And what am I
getting myself into?

189
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,500
Maybe Mrs. Zoomer's right and
I should keep away from him.

190
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,333
[GADGE] Well, he wanted to
follow me, so here we are.

191
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,458
A junkyard filled with
wrecked automobiles.

192
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,958
What a strange place
for him to come to.

193
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,916
I wonder if he
works in the place.

194
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,583
[gasps]

195
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,875
[gasps]

196
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,291
[gasps]

197
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,375
[gasps]

198
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,416
[yells]

199
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,041
[SPEED groaning]

200
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,375
[POPS]
Hmm... What happened to it?!

201
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,208
How come you
smashed up the car?!

202
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,750
[TRIXIE]
Don't be so angry, Pops.

203
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,708
It could've been a lot worse.
At least Speed wasn't hurt!

204
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,166
[POPS]
Hmm... You're right.

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,791
It could've been worse
if Speed had been hurt,

206
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,583
and at least the engine
hasn't been damaged,

207
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,583
but the rest of the Mach 5
looks as if it was used

208
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,541
in a car wrestling
match and you lost!

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,375
That seems to be becoming
a popular sport.

210
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,000
Read about it right here.

211
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,250
[SPEED] Wow, so that's what
car wrestling looks like.

212
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,708
[SPARKY]
It's not that bad, Speed.

213
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,958
The winner gets 30,000 bucks!

214
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,750
Oh, who cares how dangerous
it is when you can get rich!

215
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,041
Don't be stupid!

216
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,833
Smashing cars on
purpose is ridiculous,

217
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,583
and anyone who does it shouldn't
be allowed to drive a car!

218
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,041
The human body can stand much
less impact than a car,

219
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,291
so you're bound to be hurt.

220
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,708
Ah!

221
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,500
Forget car wrestling and
figure how we're going to get

222
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,708
the Mach 5 back into shape.

223
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,916
[SPEED]
Pops is right.

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,166
A professional racer
shouldn't have anything

225
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,708
to do with car wrestling.

226
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,708
He should concentrate
on speed racing.

227
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,291
For the sake of Gizmo
and his mother,

228
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,833
I've got to find a way to stop
Mr. Zoomer from car wrestling.

229
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,500
I've got to before something
terrible happens to him!

230
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,541
[BOSS] How do you
like your new car, Gadge?

231
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,333
We especially built it
for your next match!

232
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,958
[GADGE] Wow, these guys
really mean business!

233
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,916
But I wonder how safe
it is for the driver.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,791
[BOSS] The car looks like
an ordinary sports model,

235
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,583
but we built in special secret
devices just for car wrestling.

236
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,583
Hey, Hammer, give
Gadge a complete rundown

237
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,166
on what we've added
to the model.

238
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,208
Okay.

239
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,125
[HAMMER]
There are five buttons here,

240
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,125
each one designed to activate
an ingenious weapon.

241
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,666
Now watch carefully when
I press button number one.

242
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,458
[HAMMER] Those spiked balls
will cause every tire

243
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,208
on any car that's following
to go flat and probably crash.

244
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,250
Now, button number two.

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,708
If any car is following
too closely,

246
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,125
you'll be able to
smash the engine.

247
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,916
That'll take care
of more competition.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,958
If a car is alongside this
device, it'll turn it over.

249
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,625
Now the fourth button.

250
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,791
[HAMMER] This cutter is powerful
enough to slice through

251
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,791
the strongest metal.

252
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,208
Now for button X.

253
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,166
It activates a special device
enabling you to fly up.

254
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,250
Yeah, this car can take off.

255
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,833
Nobody'll be able
to beat you, Gadge,

256
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,333
not while you're
driving that car.

257
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,083
[MECHANIC B] Hey, we just got
a letter from Speed Racer

258
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,375
challenging Gadge Zoomer for the
car wrestling championship.

259
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,833
He claims he beat him
a long time ago,

260
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,166
and now, will beat him again.

261
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,125
[GADGE]
Hmm... Speed, huh?

262
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,583
Don't worry about Speed Racer.

263
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,291
He doesn't know the first
thing about car wrestling,

264
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,875
so you'll have no
trouble beating him.

265
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,333
[GADGE] Why is Speed
interfering in my life?!

266
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,000
It was long ago, during the
Ocean Tank Grand Prix...

267
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,500
I'll never forget what happened.

268
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,125
Everybody thought I was going
to win. I was sure of it!

269
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,250
I was out in front, and Speed
was running in close second.

270
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,416
We started around the final lap

271
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,958
and Speed wasn't
able to pass me.

272
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,291
If we held those positions,
I was going to be the winner.

273
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,833
But then my luck
suddenly changed.

274
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,875
Coming out of the final turn,
I accelerated too fast

275
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,291
and lost control of the wheel!

276
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,416
Speed pulled ahead and
crossed the finish line first!

277
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I had run the greatest race
of my professional career!

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,333
I deserved to win,
but at the last second,

279
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,750
fate had stolen my victory

280
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,041
and Speed was the winner
of the Ocean Tank Grand Prix.

281
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,250
I've never gotten over my
frustration and disappointment

282
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,541
and my bitterness, and this
time, I'll get my revenge.

283
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,208
This time, he and the
Mach 5 will be finished!

284
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
Trixie, you mustn't tell Pops

285
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,791
about me entering the car
wrestling match tomorrow.

286
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,458
But do you really think
Mr. Zoomer will give up

287
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,916
being a car wrestler?

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,791
I'm not sure that he will,
but it'll be my only chance

289
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,250
to try and persuade
him to give it up

290
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,375
before something happens to him.

291
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,625
And the only way
I can persuade him

292
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,208
may be to beat him
at the car wrestling.

293
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,458
And then if he's smart,

294
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,000
he'll give up being a
car wrestler forever.

295
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,083
He used to be a pretty good
professional racing driver,

296
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,458
so if he gets his
confidence back,

297
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,291
he can go back to speed racing.

298
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,333
Now don't tell Pops any of this.

299
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,583
Did you hear everything
that Speed told me?

300
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,208
I'll keep it secret.

301
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,000
[TRIXIE]
Sparky.

302
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,500
[whispering]

303
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,375
Quiet!

304
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,166
[BOTH gasp]

305
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,500
[gasps]

306
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,083
There's so much whispering
going on around here,

307
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,083
I'm unable to do
my work! Now, quiet!

308
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,166
There, let's stop! Well,
we've done enough for today.

309
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,375
Now, I've got all the special
mechanisms repaired,

I can't wait for Pops
to fix the car!

317

We're gonna have to take every
one of those parts out of here

318
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,166
and carry them ourselves to the
race track. It's the only way.

00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Folks, in a few minutes,

331
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,833
we'll have the main event in the
great Car Wrestling Tournament.

332
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,625
Before it begins,
let me explain the rules

333
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,208
governing this dangerous match.

334
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,166
When the signal sounds, all the
cars will crash into each other.

335
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,708
Within five minutes, if a car
doesn't crash into another,

336
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,375
or if it is too badly damaged to
continue the wrestling match,

337
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,916
it will be disqualified.

338
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,416
As you know,

339
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,791
the driver of the car that
is still be able to be driven

340
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,875
will be awarded $30,000!

341
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,625
That's funny...
Where's the Mach 5? And Speed?

342
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,291
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention all car wrestlers,

343
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,750
start your engines
and circle the track!

344
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,708

Jack wasn't checked!

There wasn't time!

[ANNOUNCER]
Two hundred car wrestling cars

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,458
are now circling the track.

350
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,000
The main event
is about to begin.

351
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,000
The cars will then
crash into each other.

352
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,416
Look! The Mach 5
driven by Speed Racer

353
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,166
has just joined the wrestlers!

354

[ANNOUNCER] The flag is
waved and the match begins!

is smashing a lot of the
racers out of the match!

He's a top contender
for the championship!

[GIZMO]
What's the big idea?!

373
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,750
Speed's gonna be the new
champion of car wrestlers,

that's the big idea!

00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,583
And he was right.

468
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,000
I realize now this whole
sport of car wrestling

469
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,416
is wrong and dangerous.

470
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,166
And we should use our
special cars only for racing.

471
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,416
We'll take you to the doctor.

472
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,458
Come on.

473
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,166
[GADGE]
Speed.

474
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,083
[SPEED] Oh, hello,
Mr. Zoomer. How's Gizmo?

475
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,458
He'll be all right.

476
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,791
He just had a few scratches
on him, that's all.

477
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,875
[SPEED]
That's good news.

478
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,708
I'm sorry. I hope
you'll forgive me.

479
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,458
I've been behaving very badly.

480
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,708
I hated you since I lost that
race to you a few years ago.

481
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,833
Things could be squared if we
raced against each other again.

482
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,791
[SPEED] I'm glad to hear you
say that, and I'm ready.

483
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,791
It'll be a fair race, and
may the best man win, Speed!

484
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,375
--[GIZMO] My father's gonna win!
--What's that?

485
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,041
--[SPRITLE] My brother will!
--What's going on in there?

486
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,875
[SPRITLE]
Speed's the best racer!

487
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,916
Well, we'll be cheering
for both of them, okay?

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,416
[SPRITLE, GIZMO]
Ha!

489
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,458
