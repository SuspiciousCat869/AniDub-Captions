It used to be buried

We have nothing to hide,

00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,833
so I will be honest
with you, Mr. Racer.

180
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,375
That special car
was built by us.

Anything else?

183
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,625
The engine you used is the GRX.

00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,166
I don't know what
you're talking about.

185
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,583
And whatever engine we built
into the car is our business!

186
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,875
It's my business as well!

187
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,458
You dug that engine
out of the ground!

188
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,875
Out of the tomb of Ben Cranem!

189
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,208
The GRX engine was
built ten years ago.

190
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,500
And five test drivers
crashed because of it.

191
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,541
Even Ben Cranem
himself, the inventor,

192
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,750
crashed because of the GRX!

193
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,708
When we planted Ben Cranem
five years ago

194
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,958
after that terrible crash, we
planted the GRX along with him!

195
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,416
But it was a mistake!

196
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,208
I should have destroyed the
engine with my own hands!

197
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,291
Give me the GRX, now!
It's dangerous!

198
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,208
Let me destroy it the way
I should have years ago!

[ORIANA]
Do you think we are fools?!

Look! It's Speed driving!

323
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,750
He shouldn't be driving it!

324
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,791
Even Speed can't respond quickly
enough for all that power!

I've got to stop Speed before
that GRX gets the best of him!

331
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,750
He's going so fast now,
we'll never able to catch him.

332
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,875
And if he's not careful,
he'll smash up!

333

I've never driven
so fast in my life!

[SPEED] This speed's taking
me into another dimension!

It's fantastic!

Another dimension!
I-I can't grasp it!

A dimension born of speed!

He's moving so fast;
I can hardly see him!

That car's going to
mean the end of him!
