[SPEED] Racer X, why did
you disguise yourself

175
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,333

176

[RACER X]
Hm? I'll tell you.

177
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,375
I was taught to drive
mountainous roads

178
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,916
by a Kapedapekan named Kabala.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,583
I knew none of the tricks
of how to race along those

180
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,541
tortured roads and broken trails
when I first met Kabala.

181
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,541
Every racing car driver in
the world was afraid of him,

182
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,416
but he was kind
and helpful to me.

183
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,583
He taught me various
techniques which only he knew,

184
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,958
and then, when I became a
professional racing driver,

185
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,375
I had a race with Kabala
on a mountain path.

186
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,958
Suddenly, before he had
a chance to avoid it,

187
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:21,625
there was a landslide, and his
car fell into the valley below.

188
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,500
I searched for him,
but I never saw him again.

189
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,666
So, to return his kindness,
I disguised myself as Kabala

190
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,041
and tried to protect the
treasure of the Kapedapeks.

That's right, Speed. This race
was begun because someone didn't

its borders closed.

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
And if you win this race, Speed,
the borders of Kapedapek
