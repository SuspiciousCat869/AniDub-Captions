158
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,916
[RADIO] Hello. Hello.
This is the police.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,125
Who's calling and where?

160
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,166
[SPEED]
Forget it.

161
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,250
Checking up to see if
your car's all right?

162
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,958
You're a very conscientious kid.

163
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,500
[SPEED]
Oh-- I, uh-- That is, I--

164
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,333
This steering wheel's
got lots of buttons on it.

165
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,375
Let's see...

166
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,750
That's the automatic jack.

167
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,958
It raises the car several
feet so it can be serviced.

168
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,583
What's this for?

169
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,250
The B stands for "belt tires"
for driving in mountain areas.

170
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,958
That's a groovy idea.

171
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey. Which button
is for the weapons?

172
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,375
Sorry, but the Mach 5
doesn't carry them.

173
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,916
It was built for racing
driving and that's all.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,250
[BLAGGARD]
Hm...

175
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,875
And what's this button here?

176
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,041
[SPEED] That's for a
remote-controlled homing robot.

177
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,000
Is this the remote control?

178
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,875
Yes, but please don't fool
around with the homing robot.

179
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,458
[BLAGGARD chuckles]

180
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,208
It's like playing
with a toy airplane.

181
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,666
I haven't had this much
fun since I was a kid.

182
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,625
Fly up! Down!

183
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,875
What's this? I'll try it.

184
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,708
[SPEED]
Uh-uh, don't touch it.

185
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,541
Crazy, that homing
robot can really fly.

186
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,166
[BLAGGARD chuckles]

187
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,916
Now it's gone!

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,625
[SPEED] It's on its way
home to the family,

189
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,250
but they won't know where I am.

190
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,125
If only I'd been able
to give the homing robot

191
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
a message to carry.

192
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,500
[bell ringing]

193
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,791
[POPS]
All right!

194
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,708
Take it easy; I can
hear ya ringing the bell.

195
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,666
Who can it be at
this time of night?

196
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,166
Oh! Trixie!

197
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,166
Speed was supposed to take
me to a party tonight,

198
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,375
but he stood me up!
He never showed up at all!

199
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,041
Where is he? I wanna give
him a piece of my mind!

200
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,500
[POPS]
Hm...

201
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,083
That's funny,

202
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,208
he phoned me this afternoon to
tell me he was going on a trip.

203
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,666
He told you he was going away?!

204
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,083
But he gave me
a message for you.

205
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,250
He said you can
forget about the ring.

206
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,416
Forget about the ring, Pops?

207
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,000
He said it costs over $650,
so at least for now,

208
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,291
you might as well
forget about the ring.

209
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,000
Over $650?

210
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,625
Wait just a minute!

211
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,458
What're you so excited about?

212
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,166
Pops, that message was a code!

213
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,333
What do you mean a code?

214
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,583
And a couple of zeros

215
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,416
and it indicates the red
zone of his tachometer.

216
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,458
You're right.

217
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,666
And besides,
I don't know anything

218
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,291
about a ring Speed's
supposed to buy for me.

219
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,291
The code must mean
that he's in danger.

220
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,708
[SPRITLE]
Mommy, I'm hungry.

221
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,708
Could I have something to eat?
Another midnight snack?

222
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,583
[MOM] Spritle, what are you
doing up at this hour?

223
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,541
[SPRITLE] The homing robot
came home and woke me up.

224
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,291
[POPS]
What?!

225
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,625
The robot's here!

226
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,166
[SPRITLE] Ice cream makes
a great midnight snack.

227
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,083
I'll take ice cream!

228
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,291
Milk is better.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,958
[TRIXIE]
Uh-oh!

230
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,541
There's no note inside it!

231
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,791
That's not like Speed to send
it without any message in it.

232
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,291
[POPS]
Hmm...

233
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,875
But there seems to be some
red clay on the outside of it.

234
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,166
Oh, Spritle! What're you
and Chim Chim up to?

235
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,000
[TRIXIE]
Hmm...

236
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,833
[CLEPTO]
Ah,

237
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,833
what could go wrong on a
beautiful morning like this?

238
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,875
I can think of a million
things, Mr. Clepto.

239
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,916
I thought I heard a helicopter
last night. Did you hear it?

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,625
Uh-uh. I slept like
a baby last night.

241
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,750
Or rather, like an
old man. [chuckles]

242
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,958
[SPEED laughs nervously]

243
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,458
[SPEED]
Oh, well.

244
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,916
[SPEED]
But maybe that was Trixie

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,041
searching for us last night,
and she couldn't find us.

246
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,083
[THUG B]
Hey! Hey, Mr. Blaggard, look!

247
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,500
We found one of the
natives of Misty Valley.

248
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,833
[BLAGGARD]
Ah, good.

249
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,625
We can use her as a guide
so we don't get lost.

250
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,791
Why do you strangers want
to go into Misty Valley?

251
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,583
Listen, girlie, just show us
around and don't ask questions.

252
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,833
I've better things to do

253
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,750
than to act as a guide
for the likes of you!

254
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,458
We'll pay ya money.

255
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,666
Oh! That's different! [giggles]

256
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,541
Oh boy, are they
greedy around here.

257
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,666
What do we need her for?

258
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,708
We can look for
the treasure alone.

259
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,583
This kid will tell
you the directions,

260
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,250
so you travel with him.

261
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,416
Hey! Now wait just
a minute, buster!

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,291
Ooh! I'm going
to enjoy this kid.

263
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,833
My name is Lana

264
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,916
and you're the most handsome
boy I've seen in this valley.

265
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,375
Someday, I'm planning
to visit the big city,

266
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,375
and it would be groovy if I had
a handsome boy like you

267
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,541
to show me around.

268
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,250
I'd wear a fancy dress
and comb my hair.

269
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,500
Will you please stop talking?

270
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,583
I'm tryna keep my mind
on the road up ahead.

271
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,083
Oh, well, the least I could do

272
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,333
is point out some of the points
of interest in the valley.

273
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,791
Oh, look! Isn't that amazing?
You mustn't miss that!

274
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,833
[THUG C]
Huh?

275
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,833
[THUG C screams]

276
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,541
Hey, what's the big idea?

277
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,958
Now's your chance to get away.

278
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,875
Hurry!

279
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:50,708
[SPEED]
Why are you helping us?

280
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,791
[giggles]

281
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,750
[SPEED gasps]

282
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,000
Trixie!

283
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,291
Hang on!

284
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,500
[growls]

285
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,708
[TRIXIE]
Oh, there's no one back there!

286
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
They've stopped following us.

287
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,166
Trixie, how in the world did
you find out where we were?

288
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,416
I studied the bits of red
clay on this homing robot

289
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,375
and figured the only place
where this clay can be found

290
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,625
is Misty Valley.

291
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,791
Pops is waiting for us
in the village up ahead.

292
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,791
[SPEED]
Hi, Pops.

293
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,250
We're safe thanks to Trixie
figuring out where we were.

294
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,583
Well, Pops, you might as
well call the police now.

295
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,958
[chuckles]

296
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,166
[ALL gasp]

297
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,083
Well, I'm glad to see
all of you again.

298
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,166
I've got a surprise
for you in there.

299
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,500
Show 'em, Tiny.

300
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,750
[TRIXIE]
Pops!

301
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,291
You can't go anywhere!

302
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,125
Even if you do get free,
we're keepin' the helicopter.

303
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,208
[gasps]

304
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,458
[THUG D]
Hm?

305
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
Hey, come on out!
Whoever you are!

306
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,625
[BOTH snicker]

307
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,833
[BLAGGARD]
Okay, sonny,

308
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,041
now you'd better take
us to the treasure.

309
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,875
[BLAGGARD] So you claim that
it's right around here, huh?

310
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,875
[SPEED]
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,375
[BLAGGARD]
What makes ya so sure?

312
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,416
I think the markings on the
engine stood for directions.

313
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,625
And according to maps,
