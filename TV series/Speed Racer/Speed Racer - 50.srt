as their leader addresses them.

one year ago that Speed Racer

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,750
and his Mach 5 defeated us.

we would get our revenge!
That time is almost at hand!

he will accept the challenge!
That will be our opportunity!

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,541
Then, once again, we, the
great Car Acrobatic Team,

29
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,500
will be recognized as the
greatest racers in the world!

[SPEED] The story really
begins a year ago,

31
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,541
when I was driving in

32
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,750
the Alpine Race against teams
from all over the world.

33
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,625
It was a grueling race over
treacherous mountain trails.

34
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,000
And because of their skill
and their unique cars,

35
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,666
my closest competitors
were members of

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,625
the Car Acrobatic Team.

37
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,083
[SPEED] I took advantage
of every fair opportunity

38
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,958
to pull into the lead.
It was dangerous on that ice.

39
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,541
[SPEED] Seeing the Car
Acrobatic Team in action was

40
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,833
an unforgettable sight, but
Racer X warned me about them.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,875
Don't race against them.

42
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,500
To win, they'll stop at nothing.

43
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,000

knocked out of the race,

to cross the finish line.

The Car Acrobatic Team
suffered heavy losses,

46
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,583
and it was then that their
leader vowed vengeance.

47
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,541
You have beaten us, Speed Racer,

48
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,250
but I solemnly swear you
will pay for our defeat!

someday, and when we do,

about meeting their challenge
for another race.

too powerful and
too tricky for him.

Never mind. You're a

00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,375
as Racer X confronted
two of our top agents;

158
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,333
the leaders at one of
our main branches.

159
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,375
Now, observe carefully,

160
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,916
the skill with which
Racer X defeated

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,916
a whole company of our most
vicious and diabolical fighters.

162
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
[MAGNEATO] The next part
of the report will be made

163
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,333
by our agent from Hong Kong.

164
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,916
We were under orders to
assassinate a princess

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,166
from an oil-rich country.

166
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,416
Everything went
according to plan

167
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,541
and the assassination
was about to take place.

168
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,708
But Racer X was in Hong Kong
disguised as a businessman.

169
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,208
The assassination attempt failed
and our Hong Kong branch

170
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,083
was forced to close down.
Racer X's business was to

171
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
put us out of business,
and he did!

172
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,625
[SUPREMO]
I've heard enough.

173
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,458
The report is about nothing
but failure, failure, failure!

174
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,375
What have you people been doing
to get rid of Racer X, huh?!

175
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
Everything we can, sir,
but watch carefully.

176
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,541
There's more to our report.
Racer X is not the only one

177
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,500
who has caused us trouble.
A great many of our agents

178
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,250
have been defeated
by this young man.

179
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,541
[SUPREMO]
Oh? Who is he?

180
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,291
[MAGNEATO] A professional racer,
one of the best,

181
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,708
by the name of Speed Racer.

182
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,125
He drives a powerful specially
designed and built car

183
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,458
called the Mach 5.

184
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,625
Here, you see film clips
of the great Alpine Race

185
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,083
where he competed against the
Car Acrobatic Team among others.

186
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,333
[MAGNEATO]
In a moment,

187
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,625
you will see and learn something
fascinating. Watch closely!

188
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,708
[SUPREMO]
I'm watching, I'm watching!

189
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,916
[MAGNEATO]
And there you are.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,291
Speed Racer and Racer X
racing side-by-side.

191
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,708
[SUPREMO] So they competed
against each other

192
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,250
in the same race, so what?

193
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,750
[MAGNEATO] But Mr. Surpremo,
we've discovered that Racer X

194
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,375
is secretly Speed Racer's
older brother Rex Racer

195
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,125
who ran away from
home years ago.

196
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:16,875
[SUPREMO]
What?!

197
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,291
[MAGNEATO]
It's true!

198
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,791
And not even Speed Racer
knows Racer X is his brother!

199
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,750
[SUPREMO] That's astounding!
But are you sure it's true?

200
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,916
[MAGNEATO]
Compare their photographs,

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,375
see the resemblance
for yourself.

202
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,291
[SUPREMO] So, you have been busy
after all. A magnificent job.

203
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,958
Our next step is to get
rid of Racer X forever.

204
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,916
This is the Car Acrobatic Team.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,916
And now that they will
again race against Speed,

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,416
we're certain that Racer X
will also be around.

207
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,666
He knows that the Car Acrobats
are out for revenge

208
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,291
and he'll want to protect
his younger brother Speed.

209
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,541
That will give us
the opportunity

210
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,708
we've been looking for!

211
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,083
We will take care of
Racer X permanently!

212
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,666
[SUPREMO]
And what about Speed?

213
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,166
[MAGNEATO] Why worry about him?
Without Racer X to protect him,

214
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,333
he'll be an easy target
for the Car Acrobats

215
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,166
and they'll take
care of him for us.

216
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,083
All we have to do is
concentrate on getting Racer X.

217
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,333
[SUPREMO]
Very clever, Mr. Magneato.

218
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,000
You've got everything
worked out excellently.

219
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,500
[SUPREMO laughs]

220
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,625
Now, sir, I suggest we
put the plan into effect.

221
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,541
[CAPTAIN TERROR] We've been
waiting for you, Speed.

222
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,541
As you can see, we accepted
your letter challenging us

223
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,750
to one more race! And, this
time, you will lose! Lose badly!

224
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,875
Wait! What do you mean
my letter challenging you?

225
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,708
I got a letter from you
challenging me to one more race!

226
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,333
[SPEED]
That's why I'm here!

227
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,625
I accept the challenge, and I'm
going to win this time, too!

228
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,791
[CAPTAIN TERROR]
No, you won't!

229
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,041
We are the greatest
racers in the world,

230
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,708
and this time, we'll prove it!

231
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,250
You failed to prove it
the last time we met,

232
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,750
and you'll fail again! I'm
warning you; I'm gonna win!

233
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,208
[CAPTAIN TERROR] We'll see!
Come on, Speed! Let's go!

234
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,708
Heh, heh! Speed won't make it!

235
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,250
[gasps]

236
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,041
He's going over the cliff.

237
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,166
[screams]

238
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,416
[NARRATOR] Racer X,
secretly Speed's older brother,

239
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,875
races nearby as the
spy syndicate planned.

240
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:33,250
[MAGNEATO chuckles]

241
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,833
Well, we've been waiting for
you, Racer X, or should I say,

242
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,750
Rex Racer, the
international secret agent?

243
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,375
What's the idea of stopping me?

244
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,833
Eh, very sorry, but this was
the only way we could trap you

245
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,375
and now we're going to
get rid of you forever.

246
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,375
You'll never interfere
with us again.

247
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,208
[MAGNEATO]
After him!

248
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,500
[RACER X yells]

249
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,583
[BOTH scream]

250
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,958
Why'd you try to get rid of me?!

251
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,375
Who are you and what's the
name of your organization?!

252
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,583
Come on, tell me!

253
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,458
I'm with International
Spies Incorporated,

254
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,041
and we want to get rid
of you and your brother!

255
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,791
What's that?! You're trying to
get rid of my brother Speed?!

256
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,958
Right! We set time bombs in

257
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,541
all of the Car
Acrobatic Team's cars!

258
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,791
If they surround Speed, that'll
be the end of your brother!

259
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,375
[rapid gunfire]

260
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,000
[RACER X] I've got to reach
Speed before those time bombs

261
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,458
on the Car Acrobatic
Team's cars go off!

262
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,791
Now, hold the car steady.

263
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,708
One good shot, and it'll
be the end of Rex Racer!

264
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,375
[gunshot]

265
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,875
[MAGNEATO laughs]

266
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,083
A bullseye! Now he'll never
interfere with our plans again!

267
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,916
Okay! Another
successful mission!

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Now let's report
the news to Supremo.

269
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,375
[CAPTAIN TERROR laughs]
This road is so narrow,

270
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,541
he can't pass us and
pull into the lead!

271
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,666
[CAPTAIN TERROR]
Huh?!

272
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
[RACER X groans]

273
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,416
[CAPTAIN TERROR] What's the
idea of blocking the road?!

274
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,250
Can't you see we're in
the middle of a race?!

275
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,416
Get your car out of the way!

276
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,041
Wait a minute!
That man's Racer X!

277
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,500
You've got to stop
the race immediately.

278
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,875
There are time bombs planted
in every one of your cars!

279
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,125
[CAPTAIN TERROR] Time bombs?
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,500
Racer X, what's the matter
with you? You've been hurt!

281
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,416
[SPEED]
Huh?! Racer X is hurt?!

282
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,583
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

283
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,833
I found out that the
challenging letters

284
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,875
you each got were phonies.

285
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,250
You didn't write
them to each other.

286
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,750
[CAPTAIN TERROR]
Well, all I know is that

287
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,500
I didn't write a letter to Speed
challenging him to a race,

288
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,083
I got one from him!

289
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
But I didn't write it!

290
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,375
Both those phony letters were
sent by the International Spies

291
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,708
to trick me into coming here.
They want to get rid of me!

292
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,708
[CAPTAIN TERROR] This means
you need help, Racer X.

293
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,541
Speed, let's call off
this race and help him.

294
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,041
What do you say?

295
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,416
Good idea. I'm all for it.

296
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,958
And we'll race against each
other some other time.

297
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,500
[CAPTAIN TERROR] Come on,
let's try to find the spies!

298
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,916
Don't forget the time bombs!
They were planted in your cars

299
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,125
and they're timed to go
off within the next hour!

300
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,750
Keep away from your cars!
[groans]

301
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,250
[CAPTAIN TERROR] We've got
to use our cars right now.

302
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,750
We'll have to chance it that
the bombs won't go off

303
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,958
for a while, yet.

304
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,666
Do you know where the
spy headquarters is?

305
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,208
Yes.

306
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,208
[CAPTAIN TERROR] We'd never
be able to find it in a hurry,

307
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,208
we'll need you to
show us the way.

308
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,416
Are you strong
enough to do that?

309
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
[RACER X]
Mm-hmm.

310
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,750
[CAPTAIN TERROR]
Good. We'll use my car.

311
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,625
We'll take their own
time bombs back to them

312
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,000
and give them a taste
of their own medicine.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,583
[SUPREMO] So you've taken
care of Rex Racer, eh?

314
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,000
Excellent.

315
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,416
Thanks. And as for Speed Racer,

316
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,083
he's as good as
taken care of, too.

317
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,708
The time bombs are scheduled
to go off at sunrise.

318
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,041
[SUPREMO] Sunrise, huh?
That'll mean six o'clock.

319
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,375
That means the bombs will go
off in only 20 more minutes.

320

I can hardly wait!

Faster! You've gotta go faster!

322

We don't have much time left!

323
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
[SPEED] I hope we reach
the spy's headquarters

before those bombs go off!
We've got to!

[CAPTAIN TERROR] Look! There it
is! There's their hideout!

As soon as we surround it,
we'll get away from these cars!

Magneato, didn't you hear
something just now?

332
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,250
It's probably the wind howling
through those mountains.

Ah.

[CAPTAIN TERROR]
Racer X, how can we thank you?

If it hadn't been for you,

337
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,791
our race with Speed
would've ended in disaster.

338
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,458
We would've been blown
up with our cars.

339
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,083
Well, now, at least
we're rid of those spies.

Huh?

Well, Speed, it looks as if
the rest of your racing team

has flown here in a

All right, Racer X.

I am. But even though I am his
brother, I can't go home again.
