00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,250
I'd love to pick some, Speed.

We'd better get out of here!

The blades aren't
cutting. Why not?

164
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,625
I'm gonna find out.

165
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,833
The tree's made of
some kind of metal.

166
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,500
[SPEED]
Metal?

167
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,583
[SPRITLE]
Mm-hm!

168
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,000
How can a tree be metal?

169
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,625
[TRIXIE] I'm gonna
check all those flowers.

[gasps]

171
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
The flowers are
made of metal also!

[SPEED]
Huh?! No kidding!

173
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
Hard as it is to believe,
it's obvious that

174
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,458
everything in this whole place
must be made of metal.

175

Let's look around!

It's really amazing, Speed.

00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,041

Come on. To Trixie.

What's the matter?

Oh, I wanna look through it!

195

Be careful, Trixie! We don't
know what's inside that castle!

196
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,916
It might be a trap!

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
Don't worry, Speed!
It's much too beautiful

198
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,958
to be anything dangerous!
I'm not afraid!

199

I'd better keep an

No! You did not get them all!

No, Spritle!

227

He's using a projector to
flash a picture of himself.

[CREPIT]
Speed!

00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,291
Yes?

230
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,625
It's too bad that you
came here to my castle

231
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,750
because now you know
far too much about me.

232
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm sure you'll go
straight to the police,

233
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,666
but that can't be allowed!

234
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,041
[laughs]

235
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,500
Dr. Crepit, why does a great
man like you smash cars?

236
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,750
What's the reason?

237
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,416
Why have you caused the
police so much trouble?

238
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,375
The metal from those smashed
cars has been remolded

239
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,666
and used to build my castle and
everything else around here.

240
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,291
I've turned those ugly cars
into objects of beauty!

241
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,500
[SPEED] But, Doctor,
you haven't answered me yet!

242
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,041
Why have you done
what you've done?!

243
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,208
[CREPIT] Because I hate cars!
And for a very good reason!

244
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,083
I'm getting my
revenge against them!

245
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,083
I lost my wife when
she was hit by a car

246
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,625
and my son was crippled.

247
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,708
Ever since then, I've been a
lonely, old man and I hate cars.

248
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm wanna destroy
every one of 'em

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,708
so they won't cause
any more accidents!

250
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,541
The world managed all right
before cars were invented,

251
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,291
and I'm sure that now,
people can manage to get by

252
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,666
without them again.

253
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,333
Anyway, I hate cars, and
I hate those who drive them!

254
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,333
And so, I hate you,
and I'll destroy you!

I can walk after all!

I'm perfectly all right, Papa!

He was able to walk
all along, Doctor.

You were unable to

for what happened years ago,

Preparing the castle

to be a place where

can come and enjoy themselves.

You've gotta get rid

Throw away the big metal trees

Turn this place into a
