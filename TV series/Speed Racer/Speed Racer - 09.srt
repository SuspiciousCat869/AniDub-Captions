158
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,333
on the course itself.

159
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,250
The plateau areas around
here are very tricky.

160
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,750
The ground is hard.

161
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,458
But when it rains heavily,
the ground loosens and changes.

162
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,625
And tires skid treacherously.

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,750
Take my advice, Speed.

164
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,500
Otherwise, this will
be your last race.

165
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,833
Very few cars ever
reach the finish line.

166
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,125
It's just too dangerous.

167
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,291
Then you don't think
I can win, Racer X?

168
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,875
[RACER X] You can only
if you keep your mind

169
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,791
strictly on the hazards
of the course.

170
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,291
Oh, one more thing, Speed.
Listen carefully.

171
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,125
As you race down
toward the big jump,

172
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,666
don't be going too fast.

173
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,125
Because you'll cause
another landslide

174
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,541
and crash down into the river.

175
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,458
Also, when you reach the other
side and start to climb again,

176
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,416
don't try to go straight
up toward the top.

177
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,875
Zigzag along the slope.

178
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,333
It takes longer, but it's safer.

179
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,500
And in the long run,
you'll pick up some time.

180
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
Remember, throughout
the whole area,

181
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,166
there are patches of ice.

182
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,666
One wrong twist of
your steering wheel,

183
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,708
and that'll be the end of you.

184
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,750
You'll find this is the toughest
course you've ever raced

185
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,500
and you'll need every ounce
of experience and skill, Speed.

186
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,625
Thanks for the advice.

187
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,500
I'll try to follow
all of it, Racer X.

188
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,291
[chuckles] Because if you
don't run a good race,

189
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,416
I won't enjoy winning.

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
You'll be in the Alpine Race?!

Speed, I'm going to
win the Alpine Race.

I'm not gonna give you a break.

[chuckles]

194
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,458
I suppose I'll have
to redesign the Mach 5.

195
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,958
Then it'll be a better match
against the Acrobatic Team.

196
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,208
Hmm...

197

Huh?!

They're tricky,

They've got something else, too.
I can't figure out what it is!

[SPEED] If I can find out,
I might be able to beat them.

00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,708
Right. To win, one should
know the strengths

and weaknesses
of the competition.

Gee, Pops, it won't
be so easy to find out

Tomorrow, the great

You must observe
Captain Terror's

237
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,625
first and most
important racing rule:

Do everything to win.
Stop at nothing.

00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,000
And if you have to
break the law, break it.

Chim Chim and I did
a great job at spying.

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,125
The cars don't seem to have
anything unusual on them.

245
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,541
But every one of
them does, Trixie.

246
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,500
You couldn't spot it because
you're not an expert,

247
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,041
but each one of them
has a special device

248
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,083
to help them jump.

249
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,166
You can see it's
located right here.

250
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,166
This particular part
acts like a wing

clever designer, eh, Pops?

The most clever man in
the entire racing world.

254
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,833
[SPRITLE] Then the Mach 5
has no chance of winning.

Well, I'm afraid the other cars

Don't worry, Spritle.

so now I'll rebuild it.

Speed, don't you forget.

262
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,500
Driver and car have to
be equally good to win,

263
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,625
so do your best job.

But Pops is more important.

Pops wants you to be
in the race, Speed.

And if he were able to,
he'd tell you that himself.

00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,333
Nobody knows who he is
or where he came from.

315
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,458
Twenty more minutes
before the start.

316
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,541
[ANNOUNCER] All entries,
take starting positions!

317
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,833
[ANNOUNCER]
The race starts in 15 minutes!

318
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,333
[SPEED]
Now I'll see if the wings work.

319
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,125
They do! I've got a chance!

320
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,541
I figured Speed Racer would
be too yellow to turn up,

321
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,208
and I was right; he didn't.

322
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,125
[SPEED] I've got only
three more minutes.

323
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,875
[ANNOUNCER]
Here comes a last-minute entry.

324
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,875
It's the Mach 5,
driven by Speed Racer!

325
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,250
The race starts in 15 seconds!

326
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,583
Try to win, Speed.
But most of all, be careful!

327
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,250
[gasps]

328
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
[SPEED] The brakes don't
seem to work very well.

329
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,125
But I checked
everything carefully.

330
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,708
[NARRATOR] The dangerous
Alpine Race is well underway,

331
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,333
and already, there have
been several bad crashes.

332
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,916
Does Speed have a chance to win

333
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,625
against the treacherous
Car Acrobatic Team?

334
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,583
And will Pops be all right?

335
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,708
There are thrills and
terrible dangers ahead.
