a powerful bomb inside it.

inside the conference hall

and replace that lion statue

with this one
containing the bomb.

297
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,208
You must be very careful
how you handle it,

298
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,958
as any sudden bump
could set it off

299
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,625
and blow you and
the conference room sky high.

300

Let me show you where
the bomb is located.

I'm sure that they
have a heavy guard

around that conference hall

303
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,208
and will take every precaution
to see that nothing goes wrong.

304
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,750
But that shouldn't stop you.

305

If anyone challenges you or gets
in your way, get rid of him!

Do not hesitate to use your
weapons and be ruthless.

importance, don't forget.
