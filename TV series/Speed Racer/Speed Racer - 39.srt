00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,108
[RACER X]
Vice President Duper.

160
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,400
The Vice President?!
Are you sure of that, Racer X?

161
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,025
[RACER X] Well, sir,
he stands to become president

162
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,858
if President Montebank
doesn't pull through.

163
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,650
It's logical, isn't it?

164
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,817
[CHIEF]
Hmm...

165
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,983
Vice President Duper in
with the assassins, eh?

166
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,983
He probably hired them to
come and do his dirty work.

167
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,817
Unless this man and the
assassins can be stopped,

168
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,442
the country of
Abalonia's doomed.

169
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,275
Vice President Duper invited me.

170
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,483
Oh yes, Mr. Racer,
he's been expecting you.

171
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,108
If you'll follow me,
I'll lead the way.

172
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,817
That's strange.

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,192
Vice President Duper
lives underground?

174
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,650
[ELEGANTOR]
Well...

175
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,025
Ever since the bomb went off
at the President's house,

176
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,400
the Vice President is careful.

177
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,567
[SPEED]
I see.

178
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,317
I'm sorry, Mr. Racer,
but you'll have to wait here.

179
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,608
[ELEGANTOR] You stoneheads
blew the job once,

180
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:33,900
so I'm warning you...

181
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,983
You'd better not
blow it this time.

182
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,108
It's locked.
Now why'd he lock me in?

Oh, Racer X!

187
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,650
Hi, I came to talk to Speed.

188
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,775
You can't; Speed's
not here right now.

189
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,358
Where is Speed?

190
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,608
He left a little while ago for
Vice President Duper's house.

191
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,108
I'm too late then, Trixie!

192
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,400
Racer X, is anything wrong?

193
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,775
[SPRITLE] Every time we see
Racer X, he leaves in a hurry.

194
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,817
I wonder what he's up to and
where he's going this time.

195
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,025
I wonder why he's running.

have to pull a gun!

00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,692
I'm willing to go
wherever you say!

201

202
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,150

something to hide, I'll bet.

It's Speed Racer!

211
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,858
I heard that
Speed Racer's inside.

212
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:48,858
I wanna see him.

213
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,525
I'm sorry,
but he's left already.

214
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,650
Left already?

215
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:54,900
[RACER X] There's something
strange about that.

[cackles]

217
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:21,983
I find it hard to believe

218
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,275
that such an excellent
driver as Speed

219
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,858
drove his car right off
the road into the ocean.

220
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,483
Well, that's why we're
havin' the funeral.

221
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,817
It's very strange
and suspicious.

222
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,442
But it's a fact that he crashed.
There's no getting around that.

[door clicks]

Huh?

00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,775
Speed...

226
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,067
This funeral's for you.

227
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,650
I know, but I'm okay.

228
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,942
Get out of sight
before someone sees you.

229
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,942
Now tell me why you're letting
everyone think you crashed.

230
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,400
What's this
all about, Speed? Well?

231
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,067
I was trapped by
a gang of assassins,

232
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,567
who were trying to
take over this country.

233
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,650
They tried to get rid of me,

234
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:57,692
and if they think
they succeeded,

235
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,900
maybe I can find out
more about them.

236
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,108
Well, take my advice

237
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,483
and don't have anything more
to do with them.

238
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,692
I'm sure those men,
whoever they are, are dangerous.

239
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,483
After all, they tried
to get rid of the President.

240
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,858
And if you fall
into their hands again,

241
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:10,150
they'll make sure you won't
get away the next time.

242
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,650
I've gotta take the chance.

243
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,858
All right, if you feel that way,

244
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,775
then maybe the two of us
better work together

245
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,858
on the case to see that
those men are stopped.

246
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:17,650
Do you agree?

247
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:18,692
[SPEED]
Yes.

248
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:19,942
That man over there
is the leader.

[ASSASSIN B]
Hey, Boss.

250
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,275
I just heard that
President Montebank

251
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:28,942
is gonna make
a trip to La Mamba.

252
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,025
He must be better.

253
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,108
That's right, he's better.

254
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,233
So he's going to
La Mamba for a vacation.

255
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,025
I'm very glad to hear that.

256
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,150
[THUG A] This is Station 12;
Group A is ready, sir.

257
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,858
Our plans are completed
and everything's ready

258
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,150
to get rid of President
Montebank once and for all.

259
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,650
It won't be long before
you'll be appointed

260

the new president of Abalonia.

261
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,650
Gee, I'll be the
new president, thanks to you.

00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,150
Don't forget it.

263
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,358
And once you are the president,
you will follow my orders.

264
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,442
Or else we'll get
rid of you permanently.

265
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,150
Understand?

266
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,358
Yes, sir.

This is Number 9.

taking a walk in the garden.
