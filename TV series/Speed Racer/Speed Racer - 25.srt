we must release Pops Racer and

Prince Jam ruined the coronation
by showing up alive and well.

You've bungled another job.

But that's impossible.

Yeah, or rather, an imposter!

356
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,375
Prince Jam is a prisoner
right here with us.

357
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,583
We're gonna take care of him

358
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,125
along with our other
prisoner, Speed Racer.

359
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,416
Maybe that imposter who looks
so much like the Prince

360
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,000
is Speed's kid brother, Spritle.

361

That would figure,
because my partner,

has the birthmark of a clover

Prince Sugarin crowned.

Well, he has no birthmark
on his left arm,
