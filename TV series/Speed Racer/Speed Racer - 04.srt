Racer X is secretly
his older brother.

Now, Racer X thinks
over recent events.

[RACER X] It's true that,
in every race I enter,

24
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,958
there are terrible crashes.

25
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,208
But people are wrong to
think that I caused them.

I am not an evil man.

That's why I don't want you

...your older brother, Rex.

36
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,541
Years ago, when I had
no experience in racing,

37
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,000
I took the special racing
car that Pops had built,

38
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,625
and I entered the top race
at the Sunny Downs Track.

39
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,250
I wanted to win
more than anything.

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,291
I wanted to be world champion.

41
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:17,083
But I lost control of
the car and crashed.

42
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,583
I was lucky to be alive.

43
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,583
And anxious to race again.

44
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,083
But Pops was furious at me,

45
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,583
not only for wrecking
his special car,

46
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,875
but for racing without
the experience and skill

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,875
I needed to be a good driver.

48
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,833
He told me I
couldn't race again.

49
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,500
And I fought with him about it.

50
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,500
But he refused to
change his mind.

51
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,375
Finally, I had no choice.

52
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,333
I decided to go away to learn,
to practice, and to compete

53
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,958
until I would become the world's
champion racing car driver.

54
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,000
Until then, no one would ever
find out my true identity.

55
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
And to this day, Speed,

56
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,250
and until I do
become world champion,

57
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,416
neither you or anybody
else would ever learn

that I am really Rex Racer,
your older brother.

I wonder where he could be.

It's not like Speed
to disappear like this.

61
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,166
Oh, I certainly hope
nothing's happened to him.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,208
It's strange that the racing
car's disappeared, too.

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,916
I told you about the letter I
gave him from the Masked Racer,

00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,250
I'm gonna get back into mine.

321
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,875
It can still run and
I'll do my best to win.

322
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,208
I'm going to beat you, Speed.

323
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,541
This is the last lap.

324
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,916
But because of the accidents,

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,166
the first car is way
ahead of the rest!

326
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,666
The Masked Racer is pushing
his car to the side,

327
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,416
where he'll try to
make some repairs.

328
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,708
And there's Slick of the
Alpha Team in car number 2!

329
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,083
It looks as though
he may be the winner!

330
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,541
Here comes Speed Racer!

331
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
He's back at the
wheel of the Mach 5.

332
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,625
He's coming up fast!

333
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,166
Go, Speed, go! Go!

you'd be able to do it, Speed!

Hurray! [gasps]

You disobeyed my orders!

Speed did a wonderful
job of winning,

345
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,750
and we're both
very proud of him.

Right?

[POPS]
Hm?!

348
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,500
Wasn't he just great?

349
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,750
Why don't you let him be a racer

350
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,625
and drive the Mach 5
all of the time?

351
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,041
You know we'll have a
good chance of winning,

352
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,333
and he'll take good care
of the car you built.

353
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,750
Please, sir.

354
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,791
Please let Speed be a
professional racer all the time.

Oh, please.

356

a real champion.

I saw for myself how
skillfully he can drive.

He's a far better
driver than anybody.

The Masked Racer's gone.

why he let me win.
