the engine was the GRX.

from a graveyard, didn't they?

[POPS] Yes. But if I brought
the case to the police,

it would get a lot of publicity.

And other people would
learn about the GRX

and try to build
an engine like it,

Yes. On our way here, we stopped

inhaled some V Gas.

V Gas? What's that? Hm?

It sharpened his
reflective nerves

00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,625
so that he could respond faster

284

fear of velocity.

The Oriental Grand Prix

318
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
will start in
exactly 90 seconds!

319
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,000
All drivers are now in
their starting positions,

320
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,208
awaiting the signal
for ignition.

321
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,083
[SPEED]
What am I gonna do? I'm scared!

322
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,041
[ANNOUNCER]
Start engines!

323
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:32,250
[engines purr]

324
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:45,625
[engines roar]

325
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,791
[ANNOUNCER] The Mach 5 is caught
in the center of the pack

326
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,083
and, at this point, does not
look to be a possible winner.

327
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,416
It's reported that Speed is
not in top physical condition.

328
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,833
[ANNOUNCER]
At the end of the first lap,

329
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,041
The fantastic GRX is
leading by five seconds,

330
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,791
and already looks to be
the possible winner.

331
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,041
Go, go, go, go!

332
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,583
[POPS] Don't let anybody
know how afraid you are!

333
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,166
The Mach 5 can win if you're
not afraid to drive it

334
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,291
the way I build it to be driven!

335
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,875
[CURLY]
No one back there.

336
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,125
I'm going so fast; nobody'll
be able to catch up to me.

337
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,000
[POPS] Don't be scared. The
frightened guy finishes last.

338
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,166
Go, Speed, go!

339
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,458
If you're scared,
just step on the gas.

340
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,916
Push that accelerator
down to the floor!

341
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,916
[POPS] I built the
Mach 5 to win, Speed,

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,250
and with it, you can win!

343
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
[ANNOUNCER]
In the 15th lap,

344
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,541
the GRX is now leading
by fully half a minute.

345
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,625
This amazing car is now expected
to break all existing records.

346
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
The Mach 5 is in second place.

347
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,000
C'mon, Speed! You can win!

348
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,041
[POPS] Speed, if you're still
afraid, get out of the race.

349
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,916
If you're not scared,
then do what you want!

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,875
And I'll bet what
you want is to win!

351
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,375
[POPS laughs]

352
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,666
I'm okay and I'm gonna
do my best to win.

353
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:48,458
[CURLY growls]
Water. I've got to have water!

354
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,000
[ANNOUNCER]
The 27th lap.

355
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,083
And the GRX goes into the pit.

356
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,250
[GOON 1]
Uh-oh.

357
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,291
Get back in that car!

358
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,375
[gasps]

359
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,416
[grunts]

360
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,625
He lost too much time!

361
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,083
I'm afraid he's not going
to be able to catch up!

362
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,833
[engine sputters]

363
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,833
You'll never be able to
catch up to me, Speed.

364
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:24,750
[whimpers]

365
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,708
[yells]

366
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,333
[CURLY]
It's too fast!

367
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
[gasps]

368
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,000
[ANNOUNCER]
The GRX is out of the race

369
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,416
and the Mach 5 pulls
into the lead!

370
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,500
I didn't know that Curly
was the son of the man

371
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,000
who invented the GRX!

372
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,458
Neither did I, Speed.

373
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,500
I would've stopped him if
I'd known who he really was.

374
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,916
Isn't it strange?

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,333
Both father and son were
destroyed by that engine.

376
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,583
It proves something:

377
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,041
That traveling fast is
important to win a race,

378
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,250
but it's not the
most important thing.

379
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,416
Right!

380
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,791
It takes the combination
of a good driver,

381
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,708
and a really fine car in
tip-top shape to win a race.

382
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,583
[BOTH laugh]

383
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,041
Let's go home.
