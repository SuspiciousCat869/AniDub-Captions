began when Calcia,

daughter of famous
archeologist Dr. Bone,

22

discovered the ruins
of Cleopatra's palace.

00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,166
And Trixie and I went
searching for Calcia,

A falling rock had
struck her on the head.

that she was Cleopatra.

Splint Femur,

on the expedition.

And now he planned
to use Cleopatra--

Or rather, Calcia, to
command the local men

I drove to a distant pyramid,

atop it, and returned--

you'd have to work hard.
