I'm right, aren't I?

162
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,916
In winning at roulette
as well as car racing,

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,208
you must study all of
the elements involved:

164
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,375
Your competitors,
the conditions of the machines--

165
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,666
theirs as well as your own--

166
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,666
the velocity of the wind,
the weather itself,

167
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,416
and the atmosphere.
And most important of all,

168
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,083
you must know
your own condition.

169
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,083
Do you feel sharp? Alert?
And do you feel lucky?

170
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,958
The element of luck
can never be overlooked.

171
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,833
Perhaps it plays the most
important part of all.

172
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,000
And often, when you
feel lucky, you are lucky.

173
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,750
I guess you must make a lot
of calculations at the scene.

174
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,291
[FASTBUCKS]
I do.

175
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,000
But how are you able to figure
all those elements so fast?

176
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:24,875
It would take a genius!

One of the men playing roulette,
he's lost a lot of money

if I would lend him some,

Everything's right on schedule.

321
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,208
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and
gentlemen, a catastrophe!

322
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,250
The gasoline tanks supplying
fuel to the racing cars

323
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,625
have just blown up!

324
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,416
[PEOPLE gasp, scream]

325
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,041
[BOTH scream]

00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,416
Trixie and Spritle!

327
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,708
[FASTBUCKS cackling]

328
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,875
You're responsible for that!

329
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,500
You're right,
but it was only a test.

330
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,541
A car won't run
without any gasoline.

331
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,416
And what do you think if
all the gasoline in the world

332
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,958
was destroyed?

333
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,875
Airplanes, cars, buses, and
trucks wouldn't be able to run.

334
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,291
Only trains, that's all.

335
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,416
And if all my money
is invested in train stock,

336
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,833
I'll become a billionaire.

337
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,291
So all I have to do is destroy

338
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,791
all the oil refineries
in the world.

339
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,750
There are 293 in America,
64 in the Soviet Union,

340
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:30,000
17 in England. In fact, a total
of 640 throughout the world.

341
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,291
You saw how easy it was for me

342
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,958
to blow up those
tanks at the race.

343
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,750
Well, I can destroy
all the oil refineries

344
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,166
--in the world that way.
--You wouldn't dare!

345
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,541
Ah, but it's all arranged.

346
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,250
They're all scheduled
to be set off at noon today.

347
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,458
Can you imagine the confusion?

348
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,333
These machines can cause
electric short circuits

349
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,583
anywhere in the world.

350
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,208
And short circuits lead
to fire and explosion.

351
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,000
You are the most
dangerous man I've ever met.

352
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,208
And you're whacky.

353
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,875
No, I'm not whacky!
I'm a genius!

354
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,208
And I'm about to become
the richest man on Earth!

355
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,583
Unfortunately,
you know too much,

356
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
so I'm going to have to get
rid of you permanently.

357
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,833
I have just the method,
so stay right there.

358
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,541
I'll get back to you later!

359
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,875

363
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
[TRIXIE] It was lucky
that no one was hurt!

364
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,250
[SPARKY] Yeah, and that
the race has been delayed.

365
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,583
I wonder where Speed is.

366
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
He must've heard
by now what happened,

367
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,708
and I'm sure he'd
get here if he could.

368
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,541
He might've gotten
into trouble, don't you think?

369
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,583
Wait a minute, that Mr.
Fastbucks got into the Mach 5

370
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,958
up in the alps soon after
he robbed a bank in France!

371
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,583
And so I suspect
that he's got a hideout

372
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,083
somewhere up on those mountains!

373
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,416
[TRIXIE]
I'll bet you're right!

374
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,416
And I think Speed could be
his prisoner up there!

375
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,083
What're we waiting for?
Let's go!

376
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,375
Be careful up ahead.

377
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,958
The road may be slippery,
but you mustn't use your brake.

378
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,958
[TRIXIE] You make a groovy
navigator, Sparky.

379
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,000
[SPARKY]
I know!

380
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,250
Get ready to make a right turn,

381
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,083
and immediately after that,
make a wide left.

382
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
[TRIXIE] This is near
where we met Mr. Fastbucks!

So I figured that sooner
or later, you'd find me.

wouldn't enjoy it

watches it with you.
