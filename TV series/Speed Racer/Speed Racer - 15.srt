just what we were getting into.

21
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,041
[SPEED] It began when a car
called the Black Tiger

owned by Kim of Flathill

This slingshot was in the car.

It's evidence that
you, Speed Racer,

00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,250
So, we drove across
the desert in the Mach 5

where I could tell Kim

who had blown up his car.

To our surprise,

Kim turned out to be the son of

you could get me to join you

caused you so much trouble,

but we are engaged in a
revolution against Flathill.

It is our old country,

but the government is
being run by criminals.

with every means and

The only way to find out
is for the Black Tiger

to race against the Mach 5.

repair most of the car,

should be overthrown.
