in the Alpine Race,

18

the most dangerous
race in the world.

the tricky Car Acrobatic Team,

with ingenious wings.

has redesigned the Mach 5

wings underneath,

I may have a chance to beat
the Car Acrobatic Team.

[SPEED] There's something
wrong with the brakes.

00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,166
[SPEED] I thought I adjusted
the brakes correctly,

48

on things like that.

00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,166
Fixing the Mach 5 is my job!

161
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,416
He's right, and you better use
this time for resting up, Speed.

162
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,916
You have a lot
more racing to do,

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,333
so go over there and sit down.

164
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,500
[SPEED]
Aw, Trixie, I'll be all right.

165
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,958
[TRIXIE]
Do as I say and rest.

166
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,458
Oh. We can't make Speed do
anything he doesn't want to.

167
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,625
Only Trixie knows
how to handle him.

168
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,416
But I don't want her giving
him my snack! C'mon, Chim Chim!

169
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,833
The radio said the other
racers are taking a break,

170
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,250
so why don't you have
a little lunch, Speed?

171
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,958
Put that back.

172
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,291
It's my lunch, Speed, but
I'll be glad to do without it.

173
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,708
Here, take it.

174
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,500
You're fibbing, Spritle.
You've already had yours. Now...

175
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,708
...go away.

176
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,041
Hey, somebody, please
bring me some grease!

177
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,625
[SPRITLE]
Okay!

178
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,666
[SPRITLE growls]

179
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,416
[chuckles]

180
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Here ya are!

181
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,750
That's oil! Gimme some grease!

182
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,916
[TRIXIE]
This what you want, Sparky?

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,375
Yes, thanks very much, Trixie!

184
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,916
Too many mechanics
might spoil the car!

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,833
Let me help him!

186
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,416
[TRIXIE]
Keep out of the way!

187
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,541
[growls]

188
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,583
So you think I'm in the way.
Nobody talks to me like that!

189
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,833
Not even you, Trixie!

190
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
Put up your knuckles! Come on!

191
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,708
[babbling]

192
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,916
[TRIXIE]
Help, Speed!

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,958
[SPEED]
Huh?

194
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,541
[TRIXIE]
Oh!

195
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,083
Nobody says I'm in
the way! I'll show her!

196
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,833
Spritle, you'd better stop it.

197
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,083
Hey, what's going on?!
What's up?!

198
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,125
[BOTH gasp]

199
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,166
[TRIXIE gasps]

200
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,750
Speed, put me down!
What're you going to do?!

201
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,166
[SPEED]
Now you take a rest!

202
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,708
You see, Trixie, I'm not
the one in the way, you were.

203
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,208
[SPEED]
Okay, you're next.

204
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,625
[SPRITLE] Oh! Put me down!
What'd I do wrong?! Put me down!

205
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,125
[SPEED]
There ya are!

206
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:55,791
[TRIXIE]
You see?

207
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,500
[SPRITLE wailing]

208
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,666
Okay! The brakes are in
perfect working order!

209
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,666
What about you, Speed?

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,833
You haven't rested for a minute,

211
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,583
you've been on the
go since we got here!

212
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,750
Speed, you must be
pretty tired by now.

213
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,791
Well, the work's all done.

214
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,333
Let's let bygones be bygones,
and no matter how much we fight,

215
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,458
let's always be pals.

216
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,958
[SPEED]
Of course.

217
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,583
And we should never fight
over you racing in the Mach 5.

218
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,916
We won't. The Mach 5
means too much to us.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,083
After all, our lives are
wrapped up in this car.

220
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,083
I'm sorry for being
such a bad boy.

221
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,000
Spritle, you were supposed
to be taking a rest.

222
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Why aren't you?

223
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,541
I'll let you have my
friend for good luck!

224
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,791
But, Spritle,

225
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,250
isn't this supposed to
be your good luck charm?

226
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,791
[SPRITLE] Ah-ha. But I want
you to have it, Speed.

227
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,125
Just make a wish on it
and might come true!

228
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,458
Wish for winning the race!

229
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,333
All right. I'd like to win.

230
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,333
[SPRITLE]
Now maybe you will!

231
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,375
[SPEED] Hmm? I've been
sleeping too long.

232
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,916
I'd better hurry or I'll be late
getting back into the race.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,875
Hmm, a storm's coming up.

234
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,666
[gasps]

235
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
I'm on my way, Sparky.
Say goodbye to everyone.

236
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,458
[SPARKY]
Be careful!

237
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,708
And good luck...

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,958
[SPEED] Snake, why's
the course being blocked?

239
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,708
I was sure you wouldn't make it.

240
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,250
Look.

241
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,291
[gasps]

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,291
With the heavy rain,

243
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,000
parts of the course have
been completely washed away.

244
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,083
It's gonna be tough.

245
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,458
[SPEED]
Maybe we can take another way.

246
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,208
[SNAKE]
There is no other way.

247
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,333
And when we try to get through,
we'll cause more landslides.

248
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,625
Besides, our tires won't take
hold in that wet ground.

249
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
We've decided to draw lots to
see which one of us goes first.

250
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,250
It'll be more dangerous
for each car following.

251
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,625
[SPEED] It's a fair way
to do it, though.

252
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,458
[SNAKE] Everyone that wants
to draw for being first,

253
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,583
step forward.

254
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,666
[SNAKE]
What's the matter with you guys?

255
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,958
Are you racing car
drivers or chickens?

256
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,791
All right, now come on.
What about you, Speed?

257
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,666
I'll draw.

258
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,125
[SNAKE]
Good.

259
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,291
Well, finally now we know
who the brave men are,

260
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,541
and who're the chickens.

261
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,541
Wait a minute.

262
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,458
[SNAKE]
Huh?

263
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,166
The masked racer, Racer X.

264
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,041
I'm staying in the race
and I wanna join the drawing

265
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,875
to see who the
first driver will be.

266
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,541
Be my guest, but it
won't make any difference

267
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,416
because I'm gonna be the
only one to get through.

268
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
Well, I'm glad
you're safe, Speed.

269
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
But you have only one life,
so you'd better be careful.

270
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,875
Now let's get it over with;
let's draw lots.

271
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,166
I have six matches. Each one
of them has marks on them.

272
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,208
One mark means that
driver will go first,

273
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,750
the other positions
will be according to

274
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,916
the marks on the matches.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,250
Okay, draw.

276
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,333
I'll try it.

277
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,166
Ahh... It's got one notch
on it! That means I go first!

278
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,916
I go first! Wahoo!

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,250
You draw next, Tiger.

280
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,041
[TIGER]
Me? Uh, sure.

281
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm in third place.

282
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,833
Next.

283
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,291
[BRAWN]
Two notches. I go second.

284
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,333
Next.

285
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,458
I'll be the last. You go ahead.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,250
Heh...

287
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,458
[gasps]

288
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,083
[SPEED] Six notches.
I drew last position.

289
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,833
[SNAKE chuckles]

290
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,541
[SNAKE]
Your turn, Racer X.

291
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,208
I'll be in the fifth position.

292
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,750
It's all settled then, isn't it?

293
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,000
I get the fourth
position, don't I?

294
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,666
Start engines!

295
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,166
[engine revs]

296
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,208
[SNAKE]
Go!

297
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,333
Okay, Tiger, it's up
to you to make it now.

298
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,541
[TIGER]
Well, here goes!

299
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,125
Go for the Car Acrobatic Team!

300
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,250
I'll be following right
back of you, Tiger!

301
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,375
The drivers on the
Car Acrobatic Team

302
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,000
are supposed to be
better than that.

303
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,291
[SNAKE] They are.
I'll show ya. Just watch.

304
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,583
I'm gonna make the jump safely

305
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,208
and prove to you what
a fabulous driver I am.

306
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,375
[RACER X] Every time a
driver tries to make it,

307
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,958
some more of the earth caves in,

308
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,333
and it's going to be even worse
when we try to make the jump.

309
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,958
But as a professional racer,
I've got to meet the challenge.

310
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,541
If you're smart,
you'll give up the race.

311
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,125
But if you don't, good luck.

312
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,083
[SPEED]
Here I go...

313
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,291
[DRIVER A]
Don't go, kid.

314
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,291
There's no disgrace
if you turn back now.

315
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,666
[DRIVER B]
That's right, Speed.

316
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,083
You're just gonna throw
yourself down into the chasm

317
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,333
if you start now.

318
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,500
[RACER X]
As a professional racer,

319
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,333
I've got to meet the challenge.

320
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,291
[SPARKY] That's the worst
storm I've ever seen!

321
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,541
[TRIXIE]
It's a blizzard!

322
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,833
According to this bulletin,

323
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,958
not much information is
available because of the storm,

324
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,000
but apparently, more
than a dozen cars,

325
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,833
including members of the
Acrobatic Team and the Mach 5,

326
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,416
have had their way blocked
near Yawning Chasm Pass.

327
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,958
The racing committee is
considering changing the course

328
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,708
to a less dangerous area
before the cars and drivers

329
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,125
are completely wiped out.

330
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,625
Ohh... I hope Speed'll
be all right.

331
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,375
I hope he won't try to go ahead.

332
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,541
I'm not worried; he took my
good luck charm along with him.

333
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,458
It'll be just as lucky for
him as it has been for me,

334
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,833
right, Chim Chim?

335
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,208
[SPRITLE]
Please!

336
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,833
Say he'll be all right!

337
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,375
[SPRITLE wailing]

338
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,333
He'll bring you
plenty of good luck!

339
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,833
I'm gonna need it, Spritle.

340
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,583
[NARRATOR] Have the ice and
treacherous mountain course

341
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,791
been too dangerous for Speed?

342
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,791
And has the Mach 5 joined
the wreckage of the other cars

343
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,583
at the bottom of the chasm?

344
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:28,083
Is this Speed's last race?
