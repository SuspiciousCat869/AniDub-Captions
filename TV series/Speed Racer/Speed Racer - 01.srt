156
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,333
of the medicine you deserve!

157
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,208
As former champion of the
Westside Grunters and Groaners,

158
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,916
I promise you're in
for a lot of groaning!

Oh! It's Trixie!

Hey, Trixie, Trixie!
I'm down here!

168
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,416
[SPEED] Some motorcyclists
are racing up the road!

169
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,875
See if you can catch them!

170
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,041
[SPEED]
Pops' plans were stolen.

171
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,875
How could he've been
so careless, Speed?

172
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
[SPEED]
Trixie, hurry!

173
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,208
I'm going. I'll try
to find the men.

Tell Pops next time he shouldn't
give those plans away so easily.

189
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,833
Don't worry, Trixie,
these plans for the Mach 5

190
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,958
are the most valuable
thing we've got.

To me, Speed's more valuable.

[CHIM CHIM babbles]

195
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,916
[POPS] Somebody tried
to steal the plans,

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,083
so that must mean
that they're valuable.

197
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,250
Don't you think so?

198
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,583
Yes, but now that
you've quit your job,

199
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,958
you won't know what
to do with yourself.

200
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,416
And I know how you
like to keep busy.

201
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,833
How about remodeling my kitchen,
rebuilding the garage,

202
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,208
and planting some shrubbery.

203
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, what a groovy idea, Pops!

204
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125
And I'll help you
with everything!

205
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,916
Okay, but first, I'm gonna work
on remodeling the Mach 5 myself,

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and prove to them at the
factory that it really works.

[POPS laughing]

But where will you get
the money for the parts you need

209
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,375
to rebuild the car?

210
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,958
[POPS]
Money... Hmm...

211
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,041
Of course, if you worked hard,

212
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,666
I'm sure you could
finish the job.

213

Sure, Pops,
don't be discouraged.

214

Well, I am! Where will I get

[BIKER A] But we are
sorry, Mr. Van Ruffle.

226
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,250
Speed's strong, and
he got help from the sky

in the form of a helicopter.

botch the job, and they did.

Gimme 5,000 clams,
and I'll get the plans.

If you want those plans,
it'll cost you 5,000 clams.

If you don't want 'em,
forget it.

All right, it's a deal.

238
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,958
You'll have the plans
for the Mach 5.

[SPEED]
I won't be a professional racer.

240
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,541
Instead, I'll go to work
and earn enough money

241
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,250
so that Pops will be able
to rebuild the Mach 5.

Oh, hi, Speed!

This is a groovy
heap, isn't it?

[SPEED]
Yeah.

247
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,333
The engine in there is a V8
with double overhead cam.

Hey, what's the matter? What're
you lookin' so sad about?

I'm selling my car...

Huh?! Selling the Mach 5?!

[SPEED]
Mm-hm.

252
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,708
Oh, come off it.

253
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,291
Your father's against you
becoming a professional racer,

254
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,708
but you don't have
to sell your car.

255
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,583
It's not that, Sparky,
it's just that I need the money.

You need money? Why don't you
tell me what this is all about?

00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,333
I wanna give it to Pops so
he can build the super engine.

258
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,166
I get it, Speed, but they
told him at the factory

259
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,666
the engine wouldn't work.

260
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,041
I want Pops to build
the engine, Sparky.

261
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,208
I know how you feel, Speed,

262
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,083
but read this before
you do anything.

"A Trial Race across
Sword Mountain,

So why don't you enter it?

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
Pops would blow
a gasket if I did...

267
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,666
[SPARKY] But, Speed, wouldn't it
be worse if you sold the Mach 5?

268
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,333
You're right! I'll enter!

269
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,791
Now you're being smart, Speed,

270
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,625
but Sword Mountain's gonna
be a tough course to drive,

271
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,875
so I'll fix the Mach 5
for climbing mountains.

272
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,166
That'll be great! Thanks.

to get them, Mr. Ducey.

Oh, no? We'll see about that.

283

Where'd you hide those plans?
C'mon, where are they?

[SPEED]
Huh?

00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,875
I'll be back to get what I want.

286
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,500
Who was that?

287
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250
He came to get my plans
for rebuilding the Mach 5.

288
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,375
He carried a gun!

289

Oh, he did, huh?

and drawing the designs

was a brilliant idea.

of looking there!

[SPARKY]
Hey, Speed.

313
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,541
[groaning]

00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,291
[SPRITLE, SPARKY]
Speed!

315
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,375
Speed!

316
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,541
[SPARKY]
What's the big idea, Duggery?!

317
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,250
Now Speed won't be able to enter
the Sword Mountain race!

318
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,916
Speed's going to be
a professional racer?

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,250
That's very interesting.

320
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,083
You told him.

321
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,166
Ooh! I forgot it was secret.

322
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,750
I would've beaten
you anyway, Speed,

323
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,250
so you're lucky you won't
be competing! So long!

324
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
You were planning to be
in a professional race?

325
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,583
Pops isn't gonna like it!

326
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,750
He's not supposed to know!
Don't tell him, Spritle!

327
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,541
He wants to win money so
Pops can build the new engine.

328
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,958
[TRIXIE]
Oh, I see.

329
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,500
I won't tell Pops, and
don't you either, Chim Chim!

330
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,250
[ALL laughing]

[SPARKY whistling]

333
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,375
[SPEED]
Put her on.

334
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,125
[SPARKY]
Okay!

335
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,041
There. Now the Mach 5 has
Pops' special grip tires system

336
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,166
for mountain areas.

337
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,500
How can you lose?

338
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,875
Uh-oh.

339
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,708
There's one thing missing;
there's no windshield!

340
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,125
Let's forget about it, Sparky.

341
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,208
I'll just have to race
without any glass on the car.

342
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,791
Don't be foolish, Speed,
you need the protection.

343
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,541
There isn't time
to go looking for it.

344
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,291
But it'll be dangerous
without glass.

345
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,708
Here's the windshield glass.

346
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,041
[SPEED]
Huh?

347
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,041
Nice goin', Spritle!

348
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,083
That's not my glass, though.
That belongs to Pops.

349
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,583
Don't worry about it, Speed.
We'll take care of Pops.

[POPS]
Pops speaking.

352
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,375
[SPRITLE] Hi, Pops,
is it okay if Speed borrows

353
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,958
your windshield glass
for a little while?

354
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,208
[POPS]
Why does he want it?!

355
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,458
Where is Speed?! Huh?!

356
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,666
[SPRITLE] He's going to
race at Sword Mountain.

357
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,583
Ah! I shouldn't have
told Pops that.

358
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,583
[POPS]
He took my windshield, huh?!

359
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,041
I wonder what Pops
is so sore about?

360
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,458
[POPS] I've drawn
the designs in invisible ink

361
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,458
on that windshield, and now,
if the glass is broken,

362
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,208
those plans will
be gone forever.

363
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,708
Ah!

364
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,333
Clever of you to hide those
designs on that windshield.

365
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,583
It makes my job easier.

366
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,166
To get them, all I have
to do is take his car.

367
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,333
You'd better not!

I'm going to win
this race, Speed,

371
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,375
and those 5,000 bucks
will be mine.

372
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,458
You'd better not count
on them, Duggery.

373
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,375
Get ready! It's about to start!

[ANNOUNCER]
All drivers stand by.

When the flag is lowered,

377
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,541
all drivers will run
to their cars and start.

378
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,416
Racing positions on
the track will be determined

379
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,333
by quick starts and getaways.

380
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,041
Get ready.

381
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,291
The flag will be lowered

382
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,958
and the race will begin
in exactly 15 seconds.

383

[POPS grunting]

384
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,708
Call off the race?
Why should we do that?

385
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,708
Because if you don't,
there's going to be a disaster.

386
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,875
They'll do anything to
get my plans. Call it off!

Huh?

I dunno who's driving
those new cars in the race,

399
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,291
but they're looking for trouble.

I don't want any of 'em
trying to wreck me.

Look, Chim Chim,
we're in for it! Ah!

You'd better do as I say,

otherwise, I'll smash you
right off the course!

404
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,000
All I want is your windshield
glass. Give it to me,

or I promise you'll never
reach the finish line!

[SPEED] There's only one
reason he wants the glass:

407
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,666
I'll bet Pops hid
the design on it.
