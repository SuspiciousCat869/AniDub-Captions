00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,416
Now give me that
there roll of microfilm!

158
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,791
[THUG D]
A wise guy, huh?!

159
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,125
Hand me it!

160
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,666
[chuckles]

161
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,291
He was about to
pull the trigger.

162
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,208
[SPEED]
You're a girl!

163
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,000
Wait, I met you at the airport!

164
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
[WOMAN]
You have a good memory, Speed!

165
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,833
I put a string of flowers
around your neck.

166
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,166
My name's Kana. Tie him up.

167
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,208
[SPEED]
Okay.

168
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,416
Well, that takes care
of one of them,

169
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,875
but there are some more of them.

170
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,000
Hmm? Kana? Where are you?

171
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,625
--[engine revving]
--Kana! Kana! Kana!

172
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,041
[SPEED]
I wonder why she ran away.

173
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,875
And she must've taken
that film with her.

174
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,416
But she wouldn't have helped
me if she were one of them.

175
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,416
[THUG E]
Stop! Stop your car!

176
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,458
[gasps]

177
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,750
[THUG E]
Okay, now get out.

178
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,666
[gasps]

179
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,291
Kana!

180
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,458
Huh?!

181
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,083
[laughs] He drove right off
the highway into the ocean,

182
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,375
so we're not gonna be
bothered by him anymore!

183
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,916
[laughs]

184
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,666
Now which way?

185
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,250
Wait, stop, young man!

186
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,166
You mustn't come this way,
it's too dangerous!

187
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,750
[SPEED]
Dangerous?

188
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,416
A dragon lives within
that mountain.

189
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,000
[SPEED]
Hmm?! There's no such thing!

190
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,083
The stranger just pulled away
from here. I couldn't stop him.

191
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,375
He had to be lying.
Dragons aren't real. Not today.

192
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,958
[whirring]

193
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,000
Huh?

194
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,000
There was a sound. It was weird.

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,583
[whirring]

196
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,250
What was that in there?

197
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,416
What are they
building down there?!

198
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,208
[THUG F]
Don't move!

199
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,000
[SPEED]
Huh?!

200
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,791
[THUG F]
On your feet!

201
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,000
All right...

202
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,500
This is Point 8. Speed
Racer just broke away!

203
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,041
You must stop him!

204
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,875
[SPEED gasps]

205
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,333
[screaming]

206
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,750
[KANA]
Speed...

207
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,041
[SPEED groans]

208
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,625
[KANA]
Speed.

209
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,291
Oh, it's you, Kana.

210
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,583
[groans]

211
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,083
[SPEED]
W-Where are we? Huh?

212
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,250
[KANA]
In a dungeon. We're prisoners.

213
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,458
We are?

214
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,750
It comes back to me now.
I fell off a cliff.

215
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,958
They captured me, I guess,
when I was beneath the sea.

216
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,750
Then they brought me in here.

217
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,291
Well, you're awake now, Speed.

218
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,666
Why am I locked up?

219
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,375
Because you stuck your nose
where it didn't belong!

220
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,916
But it doesn't matter,

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,625
because we got the microfilm
from that Secret Service girl.

222
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,666
Kana's in the Secret Service?!

223
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,250
[OMAR]
That's right!

224
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,958
She works for the International
Secret Service. Didn't you know?

225
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,458
You're lucky we
took you prisoner.

226
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,750
Now you can participate in
the experiments we're planning

227
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,958
with the laser beam.

228
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,791
You're going to be
our first guinea pig.

229
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,125
You wouldn't dare
try to do that!

230
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,916
You mean you'd test
that laser beam on me?!

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,375
[OMAR]
That's exactly what I mean!

232
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,500
I won't cooperate!

233
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,125
I don't think you
have much choice!

234
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,833
We'll conduct the
test tomorrow morning.

235
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,541
[SPEED] You won't get away
with it! I'll see to that!

236
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,625
[OMAR]
Heh!

237
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,125
[KANA] Those evil men
will do as they say.

238
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry I got you into this.

239
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,333
That's all right.

240
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,291
The important thing is
for us to get out of here

241
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,458
before tomorrow morning.

242
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,791
But how are we going to do it?

243
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,416
[SPRITLE]
It's quiet out there now.

244
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,250
[gasps] Ooh...

245
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,333
[SPRITLE] Where are we, anyway?
Looks like a garage.

246
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,125
It's the Mach 5! Speed must
be here! We'll look for him!

247
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,541
First, let's get
something to eat!

248
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,208
Oh...

249
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,666
There's nobody in sight, but we
better be careful, Chim Chim!

250
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,750
[SPRITLE] Oh! There's a guard!
But he's asleep.

251
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,333
Chim Chim, go look around.
See if you can find any food.

252
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,291
[babbling]

253
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,875
There's food? There's food
inside that room? Good!

254
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:35,875
[GUARD]
What's going on...?

255
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,125
[SPRITLE]
He's waking up! Hit him!

256
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,041
Huh? Could that be Spritle?

257
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,000
Spritle! What're
you doing here?!

258
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,375
[SPRITLE]
Speed! We found you!

259
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,916
[gibbers]

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,083
Use the guard's key
and get me out, Spritle!

261
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,666
I'll have you out of
there in a minute! Hmm.

262
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,208
Ha! There you are!
I did it! [laughs]

263
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,250
[SPEED]
Kana, let's go!

264
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,375
C'mon, Speed,
you'd better hurry!

265
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,583
[THUG G]
Hold it!

266
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,375
Heh, heh! Sorry, but
no one's going anywhere!

267
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,583
[THUG G chuckles]

268
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,625
We can't get away!

269
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,708
You're right.

270
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,083
We won't shoot now.

271
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,958
We'll take care of ya
tomorrow with the laser ray.

272
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,583
[THUG G] After that, you won't
cause us anymore trouble.

273
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,333
See ya tomorrow.

274
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,250
What're they gonna
do with us, Speed?!

275
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,208
[SPEED]
We'll find out in the morning...

276
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,916
This morning, we brought the
laser gun for its first tests.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,041
When we built it, we followed
the design on the microfilm.

278
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,166
Watch!

279
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,833
[BOTH gasp]

280
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,750
Wow!

281
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,916
Now, I want all of you
to stay right there!

282
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,833
We've seen how well the laser
gun works on a stone wall,

283
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,666
now we'll see if it
works against humans!

284
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,833
Remember our plan...

285
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,833
Okay...

286
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,958
[KANA]
Please, let us go!

287
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,791
I can't! You know too much!

288
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,458
[SPEED]
Run!

289
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,791
Hey, wait!

290
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,875
This way, Speed! Hurry!

291
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,291
[explosion]

292
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,375
[SPRITLE] Hey, Speed,
over here! C'mon, look!

293
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,833
Here's the Mach 5!

294
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,458
Quick, everybody, hop in!

295
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,041
[ALL gasp]

296
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,333
Heh. You thought you
managed to get away,

297
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,000
but you'll never
be able to escape!

298
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,625
This tank is equipped
with a new laser gun!

299
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,791
Now, you shall be destroyed!

300
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,833
[gasps]

301
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,666
[KANA] How're we going to get
around these craters, Speed?!

302
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,791
[SPEED]
I don't know yet!

303
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,958
They're going to fall right
into one of those craters...

304
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,750
...unless I get them
with the laser.

305
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,416
Faster!

306
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,166
They've gone far enough!

307
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,458
Now I'll give them
a blast of the laser

308
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,125
that will finish
them off for good!

309
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,333
[PILOT A] Hey, one of the laser
cannons was just smashed!

310
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,625
And another!
Y-- What's that?!

311
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,875
Get it! Before
that robot gets us!

312
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,583
They got it! It was
caught in the beam!

313
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,541
Now, destroy the car and
everybody inside of it!

314
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,750
[SPRITLE]
