of three things:

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,125
Champion racers, top scientists,
and magnificent works of art.

158
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,583
I have stolen most of the great
works of art in the world.

159
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,166
And so that no one
knows they're missing,

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
I have replaced them
with excellent copies.

161
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,958
Now I wish to show
you something else.

162
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,500
You'll show us some
more works of art?

163
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,916
In a way, that's what they are.

[SPEED gasps]

168
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,791
[SPEED] Those so-called
works of art are terrible.

169
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,666
[MARK laughs]
It depends upon your taste!

170
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,000
But you haven't
seen anything yet!

171
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,166
In order to power
these missiles,

172
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,916
I will need the new fuel
you invented, Dr. Fantasty!

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,541
I will never let anyone
use my fuel for war!

174
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,791
Don't be hasty, Doctor!

175
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,666
I didn't say I would use
these missiles for war!

176
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,916
I have greater plans than that.

177
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,250
[MARK] Using this control
panel to guide the missile,

178
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,041
I can make it return
here automatically.

179
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
This missile itself is
equipped with an anti-radar

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,458
radar device, which
confuses ordinary radar

181
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,541
so that no country in the
world can detect the missile

182
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,166
while it's in flight, and
so cannot shoot it down.

183
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,125
With this device, I can
transport art treasures

184
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,375
from anywhere in the world and
I don't have to leave here.

185
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,416
Look!

186
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,375
[MARK] I need someone to collect
the art treasures for me,

187
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,541
and I decided that Speed,

188
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,875
who travels to races
all over the world,

189
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,000
will be the perfect one
to carry out the jobs.

190
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,625
That looks just like Speed,
but he's right here.

191
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,041
I know he is, but
watch what happens.

chance to push a button.

in your car!

That's what you think!
I won't do it!

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,375
And I won't let you use my fuel
for such a harebrained scheme!

Inspector, listen!

You've got to find that
plane that's missing!

211
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,166
There's no evidence
that it crashed

must've been captured!

I'm gonna try something.

311
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,625
[RACER X]
Oh no...

312
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,166
--Can't you find them?!
--[RACER X] I may be able to.

313
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,208
I'm following radioactive
signals being sent out

314
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,041
by one of the paintings they
took from the French museum,

315
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,250
one of the early Rembrandts.

316
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
[POPS]
The painting sends signals?!

317
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
[RACER X] We attached a
radioactive material to it.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,875
This counter picks up those
signals. You'd better fly lower.

319
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,000
It must be one of these islands.

320
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,083
Hiya, Speed!

321
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,500
[MARK]
Hold it right there!

322
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,875
That's it.

323
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,833
I'm disappointed. I thought
you came to rescue us.

324
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,541
Speed, they haven't
hurt you, have they?

325
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,916
Your jobs are all finished,

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,750
so you can take a
good rest in that cell.

327
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
I'll figure out what to do about
you and the others later...

328
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,750
...what to do about
you permanently.

329
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,458
Wait, listen!

330
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,625
What is it?

331
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,208
Let me work as Dr.
Fantasty's assistant.

332
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,208
I can be very useful
to him in the lab.

333
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458
Besides, from now on,
I wanna work for a winner,

334
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,625
and I think you're clever
enough to succeed in your plan

335
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,875
to dominate the world.

336
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,916
I wanna be on your
side from now on.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,750
[SPRITLE]
Speed, what're you saying?!

338
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
You don't really
mean that, do you?

339
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,416
You mean you'll be
a traitor, Speed?

340
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,000
You don't realize what a
great leader Mr. Meglaton is!

341
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,916
You'll give me the job?

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,375
[MARK]
Yes! Come this way.

343
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,500
[SPRITLE] Speed! Don't do it!
You'll be sorry, Speed!

344
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,583
[MARK] Well, Dr. Fantasty,
is the project completed yet?

345
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,291
Yes. Uh, Speed and I
have modified the engine,

346
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
and it's ready for testing.

347
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,708
Excellent. Get going.

348
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,916
Speed, man the engine.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
[SPEED]
Yes, sir.

350
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,583
Now give it to him!

351
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,625
[MARK]
Huh?!

00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:54,583
[alarm blaring]

353
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Speed, this is the button
for launching the missiles.

354
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,083
We can destroy the base and
try to ruin Meglaton's plans.

355
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:13,916
But it's dangerous.

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,125
If we fail to stop him,

357
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,833
we're going to be at
the mercy of that fiend!

358
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,166
[gasps]

359
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,041
Okay, Doctor! Fire the missiles!

00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,333
[FANTASTY]
Mm-hm.

00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,458
Oh! Missiles!

we've gotta get outta here

before it's too late!

Ah! Now I'm gonna get them!

00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,291
Where's Speed right now?!

[GOONS]
Huh?!

Oh!

00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,875
There! That's my brother Speed!

374
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,583
No one in the
world can beat him!

375
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,625
[FANTASTY]
Speed, the missile base

376
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,208
has been completely destroyed!

377
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,291
Good. And the prisoners
are rescued, Doctor.

378
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,708
That's good to hear. But that
fiend Meglaton is missing.

379
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,500
He's in with the works of art!

Stop!

Your best friend!

384
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,750
You're disappointed
in me, Doctor.

385
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,291
But I'm an ambitious man,

386
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,541
and I saw your invention as
the means to get what I wanted.

387
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,125
I knew that if I
possessed your rocket fuel,

388
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,416
I could possess the world!

389

Now that I've failed,

390
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,708
I don't intend to give these
works of art back to the world

00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,750
from which I got them!

[BOTH gasp]

00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,333
I'm going to blow up the works
of art as well as you two.
