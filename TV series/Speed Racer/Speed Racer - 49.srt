160
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,125
I know it's dangerous, Captain,
but we've got to try it.

161
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,458
It's our only chance!

162
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,958
We'll need a lot of luck!

163
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,750
What do you mean I can't go
along?! I gave you the balloons!

164
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,958
Don't forget that!

165
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,458
But there's room for
only three, Mr. Spindle.

166
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,000
It's my responsibility
to maintain the safety

167
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,250
of my passengers,

168
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,291
so you'll have to stay
behind on the island.

169
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,541
I'm going in the dirigible!

170
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,333
Listen! I may become the
richest man in the world

171
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,166
if I can only get off this
island before it's too late,

172
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,958
so I'm going along on the trip
and nobody's going to stop me!

173
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,291
I'd like to see them try!

174
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,333
All right. If nobody's
afraid of the danger,

175
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,791
then we'll draw lots
to see who's going.

176
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,625
These winners will go on
the trip. Let's draw them.

177
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,875
As you can see, there
are three long ones.

178
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,458
The idea's to draw a long one.

179
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,166
Anyone who doesn't wanna
go along, keep out of it.

180
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,708
Remember, it's going
to be so dangerous

181
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,625
that there's a strong chance
that whoever goes along

182
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,833
will never make it.

183
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,500
Think carefully before
you decide to draw.

184
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,958
I wanna be first!

185
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,666
You drew a short one.
You can't go along on the trip.

186
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,833
[SPEED] Let me draw next.
I drew a long one!

187
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,875
[BUILLON]
Huh?!

188
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
I think you cheated!

189
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,791
Please let me be next!

190
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,041
[PILOT A]
I'm sorry, but you're too young.

191
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:40,791
[SPRITLE gasps]

192
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,208
[PILOT A]
Mr. Racer.

193
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,833
I drew a short one,
so I'm not going.

194
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,041
[PILOT A]
Sparky.

195
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:45,916
And I'm not going.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,791
I'm too old for taking chances.

197
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,416
I don't wanna draw,
I'm liable to win!

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,750
Oh! I won, I'm going!

199
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,666
[WOMAN]
I'm not...

200
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,750
[TRIXIE]
Gee, I'm sorry, Suzie.

201
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,750
But anyway,
you'll be safer here.

202
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,750
I lost!

203
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,583
So did I!

204
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,000
[BUSINESSMAN]
Mm-mmm...

205
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,208
I picked a long one!

206
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,291
[SPINDLE chuckles]

207
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,333
I got it! I got it!

208
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,083
We both wish you
the best of luck.

209
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,083
[sobbing]

210
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,583
[PILOT A]
Don't feel badly, young lady.

211
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,458
Maybe a searching party will
find us before very long,

212
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,708
and you'll be able to reach
your mother in time.

213
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,666
[TRIXIE] Suzie, why don't
you take my place?

214
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Here.

215
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,750
[SUZIE]
You'll let me go instead of you?

216
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,791
You'd do that for me?

217
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,166
[TRIXIE]
Yes. You can go.

218
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,416
[BUILLON]
Will you take that much money?

219
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,916
You're offering to pay me that

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,250
for taking my place on the
balloon trip? My answer's no!

221
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,250
[BUILLON] I'll add this
to it! What's your answer now?

222
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,208
[SPINDLE] Uh-uh! I couldn't
even buy a house with that.

223
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,708
Let me add one more stack to it.

224
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,958
Then you'll be able to buy a
house the size of a palace!

225
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,208
[SPINDLE]
Mm-mmm.

226
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,458
Here, now you can buy a
fleet of cars to go with it.

227
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,041
[SPINDLE]
My answer's still no.

228
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,583
[BUILLON]
Okay, how about if I give you

229
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,333
all the money I've got?!

230
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,125
It's a deal!

231
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,125
[BUILLON]
I can go!

232
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,333
[SPINDLE]
Mm...

233
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,416
And he doesn't even know if
he'll make it in that balloon.

234
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,708
We might be rescued
from the island

235
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,583
before he even gets
down to Earth.

236
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
[POPS]
That's it! Keep holding it down

237
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,166
till they're ready to take off.

238
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,791
Otherwise, those balloons'll
lift it right up into the air.

239
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,125
[SPINDLE] Well, hurry up.
What're they waiting for?

240
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,125
We wish you the best
of luck, Speed.

241
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,166
[SPEED]
Thanks, I'll need it.

242
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,416
[SPARKY]
And be careful.

243
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,666
[SPEED]
Don't worry, Sparky.

244
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,791
[TRIXIE]
Hope you get there in time!

245
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,166
Thank you, Trixie.

--You're going up fine!
--the propellers yet, Speed!

00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,666
[SPEED]
So long!

252
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,375
We'll send a rescue party as
soon as we reach the main land!

253
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,791
[SUZIE]
Goodbye!

254
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,666
[BUILLON]
Can't this thing go any faster?!

255
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,875
After the sun sets, we'll use
the stars for guidance.

256
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,333
At the rate of ten
miles an hour,

257
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,458
we should see the main land
sometime tomorrow morning.

258
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,583
That is, if nothing goes wrong.

259
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,833
I hope you're right.

260
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,125
I hope everything goes
the way you planned it.

261
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,500
We have a good
chance to make it.

262
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,125
That old scientist
helped us plan it.

263
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,875
Of course, he might be wrong.

264
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,916
Oh, Speed, it'll mean
so much to my mother

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,583
if I can only reach her
before it's too late.

266
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,833
She might even get better!

267
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,750
And I might even be able
to join the Grand Prix

268
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,875
if everybody gets
rescued in time.

269
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,250
My ears feel funny. Hey! Could
we be losing altitude, Speed?

270
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,041
We have dropped a little.

271
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,125
What do you think caused it?

00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,041

Huh?

[BUILLON]
Hmm...

285
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,875
That's why we lost
some altitude.

286
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,625
We'd fly better if
we got rid of them.

287

Well, I'm sorry,

288

but now you've gotta take
me along for the ride.

We're too far up
for me to get out.

290
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,416
The only way we'll be
able to stay in the air

291
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,166
is to lighten the load those
balloons are holding up.

292
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,625
I'm sorry, but we'll have to get
rid of everything we don't need.

00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,583
[BUILLON]
Hmm? What do you mean?

294
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,125
I mean we'll have
to throw everything

00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,458
except food and water overboard.

It's too important to me!

everything has to go!

here again, he'll calm down!
