And not girls either!

161
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,916
You're wasting my time,

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,416
so the three of you
might as well go on home.

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,875
Not so fast, Mister.

164
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,875
We're not here to try out
for the job of test driver.

165
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,250
Go ahead, Speed.
Apply for the job.

166
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,458
Come on, next.
Speak up, what's your name?

167
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,250
But Trixie, they already
fired me from the job.

168
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,500
The supersonic car's
crash wasn't your fault

169
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,250
or the fault of
Pops' design either!

170
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,833
It's just a mystery, that's all.

171
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,625
Maybe a spy from another company

172
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,458
put something in the car
to make it crash.

173
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,291
No, Spritle.
I guess I'm to blame.

174
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,666
No one else.

175
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,250
Speed... You're a great driver;
you mustn't give up.

176
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,750
Thanks, but you're beginning
to sound just like my father.

177
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
[SPRITLE]
Come on, Speed!

178
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,041
Don't be scared.

179
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
Come on, try out for the job.

180
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,958
Okay, Spritle, you win.

181
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,791
First question:

182
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,708
What is the world record
for automobile speed?

183
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,458
It's held by an American car.

184
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,875
In 1964, the American
Dream number 3

185
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,708
won at 500.5 miles an hour.

186
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,458
Very good.
Next applicant, please.

187
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,125
Mm-mmm. I'm sorry, but you're
not what we're looking for.

188
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,375
Next applicant is number 555.

189
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,250
[ALL gasp]

190
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,083
[PRESIDENT]
Put him through the tests.

191
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,125
His reactions are sharp.

192
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,416
His nerves are perfect
for test driving the car.

193
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,125
[BUSINESSMAN C] Uh, Mr.
President, we have the results

194
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,750
of all the applicants' tests.

195
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,583
[PRESIDENT]
Good, and what are the ratings?

196
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,333
Which one of them is at
the top of the list?

197
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,541
[BUSINESSMAN C] This one, sir.
Number 555, Speed Racer.

198
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,500
[PRESIDENT]
Hmm...

199
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,125
[FERNO]
But, sir!

200
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,666
His name should be
taken off the list.

201
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,791
He smashed up the car once and
if he gets behind the wheel,

202
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,583
he's liable to do it again.

203
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,208
Mr. Tycootis? This is
Dante Ferno calling you back.

204
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,083
[TYCOOTIS]
Mm-hmm.

205
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,833
I heard about Speed being hired.

206
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,458
But don't worry about it.

207
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,041
Mm-hmm.

208
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,958
Yes, I made some plans to take
care of Speed and his father.

209
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,958
Right.

210
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,375
The supersonic car failed once,

211
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,541
and I'm going to see that
it fails completely again.

212
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,250
Yeah.

213
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,166
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,416
[SPEED]
So now, I have a chance

215
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,958
to drive the
supersonic car again.

216
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,125
I'm glad to hear it, Speed.

217
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,666
I always knew you're
not the kind of guy

218
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,333
who gives up after
only one failure.

219
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,708
I swear, this time there
won't be any failure.

220
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,541
[POPS]
Ahh...

221

Get 'em, boys!

00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,458
This is the perfect place
to get rid of 'em permanently!

227
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,916
Me and the boys
like target practicing

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,291
to see how close
we can miss you,

229
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,958
but now it's time to do
a little shooting for real.

230
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,041
Go ahead, look behind you.

232

It's all over for you, Speed.

233
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,708
You'll never drive
the supersonic car again.

234
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,791
And you'll never
build another car, Pops!
