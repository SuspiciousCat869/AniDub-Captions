158
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,583
Now you don't have an
alibi for your whereabouts

159
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,708
at midnight last night,
Speed, so I have no choice

160
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,958
but to place you under
arrest for armed robbery.

161
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,333
[gasps]

162
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,833
[NIGHTCALL] Come away from
that window, Lorena.

163
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,875
Because we lied to the police,

164
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
the poor boy was
put under arrest.

165
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,250
And now he'll be tried
and sent to prison

166
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,583
for a long time!

167
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,916
It's not right!

168
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,958
Lorena, the arrest of
that boy is unimportant

169
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,458
when one considers the great
importance of our operation.

170
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,333
But, Father--

171
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,333
[NIGHTCALL]
Now be quiet.

172
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,750
I've got to report
to Mr. Cumulous.

173
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,000
Mr. Cumulous, everything has
gone well, as planned.

174
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,500
[CUMULOUS]
Good work, Nightcall.

175
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,458
[NIGHTCALL] I've been studying
the designs of the Mach 5.

176
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,500
And it appears that the
car has even more power

177
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,083
than we suspected!

178
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,541
[CUMULOUS laughs]

179
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,958
Do you think you're telling
me something I don't know?

180
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,333
I know all about the Mach 5!

181
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
That's why I want to be
the owner of the car.

182
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,250
And I will be!

183
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,916
I want you to study its design
and build another one for me.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,625
Whatever you want,
I will do, Mr. Cumulous.

185
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,625
I'll have the job finished
in one hour from now.

186
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,041
[CUMULOUS]
No sooner than one hour?

187
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't imagine it
would take you that long.

188
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,750
[NIGHTCALL]
I'm sorry, sir.

189
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,083
[CUMULOUS]
Aah, Lorena.

190
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,666
Your father is a genius.

191
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,291
What's more, he has brains
and knows how to use them.

192
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,583
When we achieve the success
we so richly deserve,

193
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
and for which we've
been scheming so hard,

194
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,750
your father will be
one of our top men.

195
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,833
Nobody knows yet of
our grandiose plans,

196
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,291
and so, no one suspects us.

197
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,250
But, someday, the whole world
will be at our command.

198
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,041
[cackles]

199
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,541
[ANNOUNCER] This is where
Speed Racer is being held

200
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,291
as the robbery suspect.

201
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,375
The police believe that
a gang of espionage agents

202
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,500
may be working with Speed.

203
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,916
[SPEED]
I just don't get it.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,208
Why did Lorena say
she didn't know me?

205
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
Why didn't she admit
I drove her home

206
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,291
and stayed with her and
her father till midnight?

207

[POLICE C]
You hooligan!

208
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,333
I don't want any more trouble
from the likes of you.

209
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,666
Now, get in there and be quiet!

210
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,625
Thanks very much for
lockin' me up, Officer.

211
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,541
Now I'll be able to get
some free grub for a while.

212
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
[THUG]
Aah, hello, Speed.

213
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,000
Huh?

214
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,208
I heard you'd been
locked up with a bum rap,

215
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,625
but you didn't do the job.

216
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,166
Where'd you hear that?

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,000
Your old pal, Dr. Nightcall,
is the one who told me, Speed.

218
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,666
[SPEED]
No kidding. Dr. Nightcall?

219
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,416
[THUG] Yeah, he says
he wants to talk to ya.

220
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,916
So you gotta bust outta here.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,333
But without some expert help,

222
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,708
how're you gonna
get out, huh? Well?

223
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,958
[chuckles] Don't worry.
I come prepared.

224
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,916
A small plastic bomb, just the
thing for unlockin' cell doors.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,541
[THUG chuckles]

226
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,791
Watch.

227
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,791
This was Dr. Nightcall's idea.

228
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,750
[THUG]
Get down.

229
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
[SPEED] Maybe if I talk
to Dr. Nightcall,

230
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,916
I can get a clue
as to who really stole

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,750
those important documents.

232

Can't you move any faster?

He's down that corridor!

[DETECTIVE]
It's no use, Speed.

00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,750
You'll only make it worse
by trying to escape.

250
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,375
When somebody's committed
a crime, Speed,

251
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,750
one of the few things
they can do is

252
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,041
pay for it by
serving their time.

253
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,125
[SPEED]
I've been framed!

254
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,500
I fell right into
some kind of trap

255
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,500
and now--now I don't
see any way out!

256
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,333
Speed is no criminal;
he's always been a good boy.

257
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,458
I'm sure he would never
commit a robbery.

00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,583
You're right, Pops.

259
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,583
This whole thing's
a terrible mistake.

260
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,958
But I can't figure it out.

261
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,750
All the witnesses claim
they saw the Mach 5

leaving the scene of the crime.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,041
How can they be
telling the truth?

264
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,208
I believe Speed, and that
girl Lorena was lying

265
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,000
when she said she
never saw Speed before.

266
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,250
There's something very strange

267
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,333
about Lorena and her
father, Dr. Nightcall.

268
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,541
But I just don't
know what it is.

I was gonna tell you,

Can we make a deal?

You can have some cake later.

I remember cruising down
one of the streets

when he came across the girl
with the engine trouble.

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,833
Speed offered to drive her
home and she said "Okay."

When they got there,

she asked him to come in

310
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
[SPRITLE]
Then the girl asked Speed

311
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,541
to stay and have
something to eat.

312

[SPRITLE]
It was torture to watch.

There were all kinds of
goodies--fruit and ice cream.

00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,333
There was chocolate

All right, all right, Spritle!
Then what happened?

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,291
[SPRITLE]
When the coffee was served,

317
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,416
Speed suddenly fell asleep.

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,791
The girl went away.

But then her father
came back into the room

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,458
to make sure Speed
was really asleep.

321
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,625
After that, he went to a model
ship and pressed something,

322
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,083
and the wall opened up!

323
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,541
And he went down some stairs.

324
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,500
The man drove the Mach 5 away,
but he came back later.

325
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,666
And we climbed into the trunk
again and fell asleep

326
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,833
and didn't wake up
till we were back home.
