the right man to marry,
and you'll marry him for love,

308
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,416
not because your father promised
you as a prize in a race.

309
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,125
Goodbye, and good luck.

310
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,166
[LOVELACE]
Good luck.

311
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,333
Speed Racer, I present
you with a trophy

312
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,541
for the world championship.

313
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,708
Hello, Daddy.

314
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,666
[GOLDMINTER]
Huh?! My daughter Lovelace!

315
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,500
Forgive me for the way I
tried to disrupt the race,

316
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,375
it was wrong! As for you...

317
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,125
I'll forgive you for
trying to run my life

318
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,416
by picking a husband for me!

319
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,750
[GOLDMINTER]
Oh, Daughter!

320
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,000
--[LOVELACE] Daddy!
--Of course, I forgive you!

321
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,291
Will you forgive me?

I do, Daddy!

[SPEED]
When I first started on the road

324
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,333
of a professional racer,
I had no idea how much training

325
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,791
and skill and experience I
would need. And how much help.

326
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,875
I owe a debt of gratitude to
Pops,Trixie, Spritle, Sparky,

327
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,916
and even to Racer X,
wherever he is.

328
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,541
[RACER X] Speed suspected I'm
his long-lost older brother,

329
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,125
but he never found out for sure.

330
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,333
Now, I'll be able to continue
keeping an eye on him always.

331
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,083
He's the greatest racing
driver in the world now,

332
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,583
and he deserves the
championship. I'm proud of him.

333
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,083
Come on, Sparky, let's go!
There are more races to be won!

334
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,541
[NARRATOR] Speed has won the
most fantastic race ever run,

335
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,708
but on the road ahead
waits a whole world

336
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,541
of thrills and adventure!
