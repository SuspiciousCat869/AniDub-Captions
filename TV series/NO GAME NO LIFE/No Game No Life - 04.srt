1
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,596
What is this?

2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,387
What have you done to him?

3
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,633
King, oh, foolish King,

4
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:26,643
to be so cruel as to give your
servant the order to slay his own queen?

5
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:31,677
And now you tremble with rage with not a
word or explanation to your loyal followers?

6
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,162
My Queen...

7
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:34,998
I cannot ask you...

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,574
or the knights who lowered
their swords out of love for you

9
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:42,300
to take their weapons and wield
them against their comrades.

10
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:44,834
But it is now clear,

11
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:48,226
your beloved King has been struck by madness!

12
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:52,070
I believe that you are the only
one who can lead your people now.

13
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:56,487
Alas, the King is mad! He must be brought to justice!

14
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:02,812
My Queen, the decision is in your hands.

15
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,924
Excellent choice, my Queen, my brave, honorable Queen!

16
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:15,953
You and your righteous warriors saw the
truth through the enemy's nefarious illusions.

17
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,908
Now rise against your oppressor and usher in peace!

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,134
Wait a minute, is this...

19
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:24,270
A revolt.

20
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:27,790
The appearance of a third force, rebellion.

21
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,467
Then Sora planned all this?

22
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:32,621
I told you...

23
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:35,409
I'd win without having to fight.

24
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,132
Win without having to fight?

25
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,390
Yes, of course.

26
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:25,743
The one who inherits the throne must have
a special sort of wisdom, my dear Stephanie.

27
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:30,083
I believe it will take a creative approach
to save Elkia from its current plight.

28
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,979
Yeah, but...

29
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:35,174
As you know, we Imanity are the weakest race in Disboard.

30
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:40,725
And that's why we must find our own unique
way of facing those who are stronger than us.

31
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,594
We must be clever.

32
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,479
Well, that's what your grandpa thinks anyway.

33
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:46,623
I understand.

34
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:51,247
Surely there's someone out there
with the wisdom to save Elkia,

35
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:55,584
Some brave soul who knows how to
turn their weakness into strength.

36
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:57,634
Could it be?

37
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:58,754
Hear me out.

38
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,337
We do not seek bloodshed.

39
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:04,610
We seek what all men seek‐ peace
and the right to live our lives freely.

40
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:07,685
All forces assist the Red Queen's men now.

41
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:12,348
Good, surround them. Don't let a single man fall.

42
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,550
Why, you spineless traitors.

43
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,955
The red pieces are protecting them.

44
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:21,669
Yep, To the black pieces, it's like a protest.

45
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,798
Will they be able to kill their former comrades?

46
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,584
I can't believe this.

47
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,135
They beat my Elf magic?

48
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,527
What race could possibly be helping the cheat?

49
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:33,809
There's no way I can let someone
like him take over this country.

50
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,979
Hey, Crazy King Lady, didn't you know?

51
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,394
You still have some options here.

52
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:43,580
In real war, the battle doesn't always
have to end with the king being killed,

53
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,782
but you know you're not coming out on top.

54
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,854
Surrender.

55
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:49,579
Oh...

56
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,328
This is how you win without fighting.

57
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:56,156
Sora.

58
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,383
Surrender?

59
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,243
I won't let you get away with this.

60
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,299
I earned this country.

61
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:12,302
And it will belong to me.

62
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:17,187
All forces, sacrifice your lives to slay the enemy king!

63
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,126
Go forth and destroy every last traitor.

64
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:21,539
March!

65
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,469
Sora, we backed her too far into a corner.

66
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:31,106
She's lost it.

67
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,322
Yeah. I know.

68
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,532
This is worse than before.

69
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:38,606
There's no such thing as a peaceful solution after all.

70
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:39,925
That's why I did it.

71
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,696
Huh?

72
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,603
Sora...

73
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:48,512
Oppression, rule by fear, dictatorships.

74
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,372
People never learn.

75
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,440
Throughout history, for whatever reason,

76
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:57,237
the lives of tyrants always seem to end the same way,

77
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,669
assassination at the hands of someone close to them.

78
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,410
It happens without fail.

79
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:10,647
Sorry about that.

80
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,310
I guess our world just isn't as friendly as yours is.

81
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:16,416
When it comes to war and murder,

82
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:19,927
I'm afraid we have way more experience than you do.

83
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:26,896
And the victory goes to the challenger, Team Blank!

84
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:31,392
Your dear old grandpa believes with all his heart

85
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:33,719
that someone will rise to the challenge,

86
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,129
someone who understands true
strength through their limitations

87
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:41,775
and knows how to use the strengths
of others to their advantage.

88
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,101
This person will come to be the hope

89
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,904
and the potential of Imanity.

90
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,258
Potential?

91
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:53,025
Oh, I knew that dress would suit you, my dear.

92
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,199
So did I pull it off?

93
00:06:59,396 --> 00:06:59,997
Uh...

94
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,504
I mean, this is the kind of strategy
your grandpa believed in, isn't it?

95
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,265
More or less.

96
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:10,060
I think the old man was onto
something, so I hope I did him justice.

97
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,260
And now no one will call him a fool, I hope.

98
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:16,709
Thank you!

99
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:20,510
Thank you so much! This means everything to me.

100
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,348
Sora, Shiro...

101
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,575
There, there, Steph.

102
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,682
What kind of trick did you use?

103
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:29,374
Trick?

104
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:30,407
Don't play dumb.

105
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,576
You may be clever, but there's no way
that Imanity could beat Elf magic unaided.

106
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,341
Why, thank you, I am quite clever, aren't I?

107
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,614
You should be glad.

108
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:39,296
Huh?

109
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,046
To be perfectly honest,

110
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:46,050
I didn't think that your idea of getting the Elves
to rule alongside Imanity was such a bad one, really.

111
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:46,773
Then why did you...

112
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:50,347
Because your attitude towards Imanity is crap.

113
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:55,240
Doesn't the idea that we can't survive without
Elves' protection seem a bit self‐deprecating to you?

114
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:55,863
Hold on!

115
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:58,855
You can't see that the Imanity
have their own way of doing things.

116
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,644
That's why you lost.

117
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:06,116
You were so stuck up on the idea that
we had some imaginary spell going on,

118
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,811
that you couldn't see our merits for what they were.

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,014
Stop saying things like that.

120
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,867
Humans can't defeat magic. It's just not possible.

121
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,870
If that's what you think, that's fine.

122
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:21,135
I guess you just can't see your own potential.

123
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:22,851
But listen...

124
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,774
it doesn't matter whether we're up against elves or gods.

125
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,984
Blank never loses a fight.

126
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,996
You got that? Don't underestimate humanity.

127
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,629
Huh?

128
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,723
Whoa! Aw, shit.

129
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:52,729
Do you have any idea how much trouble I went
through to get the elves to help me, do you?!

130
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,686
Wait, uh, look...

131
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:00,422
I didn't underestimate anyone! I was serious!

132
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,250
Sora, look what you did. You made her cry.

133
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,967
This is my fault?!

134
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,350
Look, I know you're still a virgin and all,

135
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,208
but can't you even talk to girls?

136
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,408
What?! Come on!

137
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,994
Now, this gentleman standing before us, Sora,

138
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,647
is the new winner of the tournament for the crown.

139
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:22,126
Before I go on, is there anyone to challenge him?

140
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:29,475
Very well, then in accordance with the final wish of
our former king, I crown Sora the new King of Elkia!

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,215
Hold it!

142
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:31,932
What the... this again?

143
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,877
It's not Sora. It's Blank.

144
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,087
The both of us are Blank together, you see?

145
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,764
So you got two Kings.

146
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:41,267
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that won't do.

147
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:45,795
The 10 pledges require us to
specify a designated representative,

148
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,811
a single representative.

149
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:49,870
Then we'll split it up, I guess.

150
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,284
I'll be the king in name only...

151
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,361
Objection!

152
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,631
If you become king by yourself,
then you're gonna make a harem.

153
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:57,324
You won't need me anymore.

154
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:58,181
A harem?

155
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,099
What are they even talking about?

156
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:05,621
If it's going to be name only, I will be the king.

157
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,524
It's all same, isn't it?

158
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,582
All right then, fine, I'll start over‐

159
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:11,933
Objection!

160
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,492
Now, now, wait a second, Dear Sister.

161
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,478
It's rare for you to make a joke like that.

162
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,056
Are pigs about to fly?

163
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,275
Watch out. I mean it.

164
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,617
Very well then,

165
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,834
I guess we'll just have to play a game, won't we?

166
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,423
Better prepare yourself,

167
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,735
'cause there's no way I'll lose.

168
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:34,950
Just one more round.

169
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,594
Okay...

170
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,941
Admit defeat already, would you?

171
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:44,643
You're the big dummy who said two wins in a row.

172
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:49,036
What's wrong with there being
more than one king anyway, huh?

173
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:53,461
Sora, hold on and take a look
at this, pledge number seven.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,261
"Conflicts between groups will be conducted by an
appointed representative with absolute authority."

175
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,867
We were both representatives, so we both have authority?

176
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:11,299
Okay, that's a hell of a lot longer than it needed to.

177
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:11,551
Yep.

178
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:14,867
It's your fault for not paying more
attention to the rules in the first place.

179
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:15,654
You're turning red.

180
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,909
Duh, I mean she has a mistake, hasn't she?

181
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,069
It's 'cause I took her panties.

182
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,605
Why are you making me wear this stuff?

183
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,949
Because we're all wearing fantasy costumes.

184
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:28,255
Well, I'm totally digging the
2‐D effects on her skirt right now.

185
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,613
What does that even mean?!

186
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,584
Anyway, you guys need to do your job, okay?

187
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:38,279
Since we haven't had a king for so
long, our domestic affairs are a mess.

188
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,006
You handle the internal stuff.
I'm trying to do a no‐item run.

189
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,129
Would you quit using traps?

190
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:44,335
It works better this way.

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,565
This won't do at all.

192
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:48,542
Unfortunately, due to the decline of Elkia,

193
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:52,891
rumors have been spreading that some of the
ministers are collaborating with other nations.

194
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:55,030
As the new king, you need to make sure that they don't‐

195
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,530
That's all? Easy solution.

196
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:02,662
In line with the pledges, we'll play
rock‐paper‐scissors, and you're gonna lose on purpose.

197
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,902
I'm scissors. You're paper.

198
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:10,717
Whoever loses will be forbidden from presenting
false reports or arbitrary messages from here on out.

199
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,140
Do you understand?

200
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,417
We're taking advantage of the wording in the pledges.

201
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:17,272
Now there won't be any more spies.

202
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,862
All right, let's go.

203
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:20,824
Aschente!

204
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:24,126
As you can see, with things being how they are,

205
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:26,147
our region is in dire need of provisions.

206
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,840
Right, yeah, okay,

207
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,882
in that case, here's what you're gonna need to do.

208
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:30,557
Yes, sir?

209
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:34,798
Let's see, we'll introduce
crop‐rotation‐based agriculture.

210
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,595
You'll have one field with...

211
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:39,542
Wheat, root crops, barley, and room for pastures.

212
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,496
You'll rotate the crops in that order.

213
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:42,871
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,199
Treasury... bonds?

215
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,813
I'll give you the details later.

216
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:49,411
You'll issue these bonds and make the banks buy them.

217
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,421
That'll make a budget

218
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,802
Uh, yes, sir.

219
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:55,369
Now we just sit back for a
few turns and see how things go.

220
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,422
Uh, just who are you two, anyway?

221
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,877
You handled all those problems so easily.

222
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,159
Steph, I'm the type of player who does all
the boring stuff at once when I play "Civ."

223
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:11,314
thing I downloaded a ton of reference
texts while studying for quiz games.

224
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,561
That's not fair, Sora. You're cheating.

225
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,337
Don't call me a cheater,

226
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:19,704
not when we're in a world where cheating
means manipulating the playing field with magic.

227
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,142
It looks like they're ready.

228
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,051
All right, I guess this is it.

229
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,411
It's beginning.

230
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,899
Wait a minute, are you really wearing that?

231
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,260
Why not? Gotta be comfortable to do my job, don't I?

232
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:35,593
Sora?

233
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:37,707
Hmm, if you're ready...

234
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,741
then let's do this.

235
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,632
Uh...

236
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,460
Hidey‐ho!

237
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,772
Sora, you're freaking out.

238
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:06,839
Shut up, I'm just as scared of crowds you are.

239
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,490
I'm just better at faking it.

240
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,305
Huh?

241
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:23,370
My beloved citizens, no, my fellow humans,

242
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:26,972
we Imanity live in a world where war is forbidden,

243
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:28,504
and yet despite this fact,

244
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,280
we have managed to lose almost all of our
lands to our neighboring nations, save Elkia,

245
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,900
our final stronghold.

246
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,761
So I ask you now,

247
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:39,155
is it because our last king failed us?

248
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:42,040
Because we are the lowest ranked of all the races?

249
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,683
Because we can't  use magic?

250
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,870
Because we are fated to die helpless?

251
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:48,777
Not a chance. No way!

252
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:55,768
In the ancient war, the gods, the elves, the Warbeasts,
and all the other races battled against each other,

253
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,490
and we not only fought amongst them,

254
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:00,011
we lived to survive to this day!

255
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:05,563
Do you ever ask yourself how was it that
this whole continent was once ruled by humans?

256
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:08,924
Is it because we are a race that specialized in violence?

257
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,824
We can't use magic like the elves.

258
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,270
We're not physically strong like the Warbeasts.

259
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,688
Nor do we have the longevity of the Flugel.

260
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,092
So then what made us able to conquer this land?

261
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,203
We must've been warriors, right?

262
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:25,457
Nay, my brethren, we were able to survive and to fight...

263
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,869
because we are weak.

264
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:35,150
In every era and every place, the strong sharpen
their fangs while the weak sharpen their intellect.

265
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:37,344
Then why are we in such danger now?

266
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,807
It's because the ten pledges
have broken the banks of the strong

267
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:44,916
and they have learned to sharpen their
minds just as we had to out of necessity.

268
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:51,191
Now the wisdom, the strategies that we the weak
once monopolized, the power to beat all the odds,

269
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,208
the strong have gained them all!

270
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,433
That's what brought us to this state.

271
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:01,386
Now answer me this‐

272
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:04,619
what makes you bow your heads like that?

273
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,343
Did you hear me? Why do you bow your heads?!

274
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,298
You should be proud to be weak!

275
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,532
We are the weak, just as we have always been.

276
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,878
Don't you see? Nothing has changed at all!

277
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,159
True, the stronger races may imitate our weapons,

278
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,994
but they will never master them.

279
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,091
Why, you ask?

280
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:29,946
Because at the heart of our strength lies a fearful
anxiety born of our most humiliating weaknesses.

281
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:35,714
This fear has given us the insight to not
only escape from magic but to learn its secrets.

282
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,337
It has given us the wisdom of experience

283
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:41,117
because we must predict the future to survive!

284
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,176
I say it once more...

285
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,098
be proud to be weak!

286
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:48,427
We are the noble weak who have throughout history

287
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:53,034
torn out the throats of those fools who
sit idly by and boast of their strength.

288
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:57,117
I hereby declare as Elkia's 205th king‐

289
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,731
And its queen, too...

290
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:01,575
That we will rule this kingdom together.

291
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:09,402
It's here.

292
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,729
Each leader of each race is given their own jewel,

293
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:14,311
the race piece.

294
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,428
We hereby declare we'll live as the weak,

295
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:23,176
protect our weak brethren, and we will use
our wisdom to make the strong bow before us!

296
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,158
We are as we once were and as we will always be.

297
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,939
Hear this, my people, you are part of a long legacy,

298
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,989
the wisest of the races, one that could become anything

299
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:37,401
because we came into this world with nothing!

300
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,174
Now let's begin this game.

301
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,145
You've suffered enough, haven't you?

302
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,654
You've endured enough humiliation, right?

303
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,841
It all ends now. Are you ready, Imanity?

304
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:54,273
As of this moment, my country, Elkia,

305
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:58,961
will officially be declaring war on the rest of the world.

306
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:02,083
What?! Let's show them what we're made of!

307
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:03,737
We'll take back our land...

308
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:05,762
And everything else, too!

309
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

310
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:12,555
What in the world do you think you're doing?!

311
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,891
Oh, my God, would you relax already?

312
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,425
You're acting all crazy.

313
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,589
How can I be calm at a time like this? Declaring war,
are you two trying to destroy this country or something?!

314
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:26,069
Could you please at least try to
think before you open your pretty mouth?

315
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,271
How are the other nations going to
view the fact that we took out the elves?

316
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,417
They'll think were backed by someone really powerful, see?

317
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,543
Yeah, but still‐

318
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:39,043
Which means until they know who that mysterious race is...

319
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,338
They won't be able to attack us.

320
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:44,660
Yep, everybody's gonna start suspecting everybody else,

321
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,297
and they'll all end up doing nothing.

322
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:49,029
That's why we took the risk of declaring war.

323
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:52,414
And in the meantime, we'll be able to
shore up the homefront at our leisure.

324
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,390
Cool, huh?

325
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,922
They put that much thought into it.

326
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:02,003
Blank.

327
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,212
Maybe those two really can do it.

328
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:12,384
So we've gone from our tiny bedroom to a crappy inn

329
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:15,235
to Steph's room and now the royal chambers.

330
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,777
This one's gonna be the hardest relax in.

331
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:19,644
The Flugel.

332
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,287
Huh?

333
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,023
"Possessing great longevity
and superior magical capability,

334
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:29,463
this angelic race lives on the
giant floating Phantasma Avant Heim."

335
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:35,335
"Their insatiable thirst for knowledge compels them
to challenge others for books from all over the world."

336
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:39,324
I bet we could get one of those
guys to come over to our side.

337
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,666
We've got knowledge from another world, after all.

338
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,213
Wh‐what was that?

339
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,625
Sora...

340
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:57,887
Well, well.

341
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,137
Looks like things are starting to get fun, huh?

342
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,100
It's that kid who thinks he's God.

343
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,698
Oh, please, I don't just think that I'm God.

344
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:06,225
I am God, silly.

345
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,305
And you should call me Tet, remember?

346
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,927
Not again!

347
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,557
How do you like it? My world, I mean.

348
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,266
Are you enjoying it so far?

349
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:20,046
Sure, I like your style, kid.

350
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,909
Might be nice if the God from
our world was as hands‐on as you.

351
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:25,035
Yeah?

352
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,547
But our enemies can use magic,
something we can't do at all.

353
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,432
Our only remaining territory is one city.

354
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,719
Our situation is appallingly bad,

355
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:35,341
and to protect the name of Blank,

356
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,304
we can't lose a single game, that's the world we're in.

357
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:39,789
What do you think?

358
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:41,419
It's great.

359
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,357
Isn't it?

360
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,710
Well, awesome, I guess it was a good idea to
bring the two of you here after all, but know this.

361
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,947
I don't favor any individual race.

362
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:53,342
I'm usually not so hands‐on myself.

363
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:56,185
Although... remember what I said.

364
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:59,460
Everything in this world is decided by games.

365
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:00,850
I see.

366
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,387
In other words, even the title of
One True God is decided by a game.

367
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,555
You got it.

368
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:11,012
That's why I set it up so that
there were exactly 16 races.

369
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,580
Each side on a chess board has 16 pieces.

370
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,797
So I guess defeating all the races
gives you the right to challenge God, huh?

371
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:21,165
I love the way your brain works.

372
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:23,565
You guys catch on to how things work here so quick,

373
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,829
it's hard to believe you came from another world.

374
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,427
Why, thank you, God‐dude.

375
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:29,969
But, hey, careful what you wish for.

376
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,195
Don't forget that it's Blank's policy
to be number one in whatever game we play.

377
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:40,160
And that attitude is exactly why I was certain that you
wouldn't be able to resist the temptation to challenge me.

378
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:44,593
Now wait a minute, you do recall
that you lost to us once already, right?

379
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:48,557
I do, and that's why I won't lose next time.

380
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,189
Hey, God‐kid.

381
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,763
You can call me Tet. Okay, Tet.

382
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,265
You'd never lost before, had you?

383
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:01,390
The God of Play was so very, very upset at his first loss,

384
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,248
he just had to bring us here, am I wrong?

385
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,479
Interesting. What makes you think that?

386
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:10,614
'Cause I get it.

387
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,582
I know where you're coming from, bro.

388
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,596
You see, Blank doesn't lose.

389
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:18,804
But we've lost to each other more times than I can count.

390
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,593
You're not allowed to quit while you're ahead.

391
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,425
Oh, boy, was I ever right to choose you two crazy kids.

392
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,270
That's right, I don't want you dropping out of the game,

393
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:34,835
and I do want a rematch.

394
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,249
Are you disappointed that's the reason I brought you here?

395
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,333
No way,

396
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:43,640
I'm actually relieved it's not some lame‐ass reason
like saving humanity or something along those lines.

397
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:46,801
Well, I'm gonna head back then. Bye‐bye!

398
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:47,747
Hey, Tet!

399
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:48,167
Hmm?

400
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:51,528
Thanks a lot for dragging us into this world.

401
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,968
Like, I think this is where we really belong.

402
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,320
Thanks a bunch. We owe you.

403
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,292
See you around.

404
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,072
Next time, on the chessboard.

405
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,422
Wait, so that's Tet?

406
00:23:12,812 --> 00:23:14,607
Sora, Shiro!

407
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:18,581
Hey, don't tell me that kid was actually the One True God!

408
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,425
Yeah, why you ask?

409
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,672
Are you serious?

410
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:24,779
You said you'd beat him in a
game. Are you freakin' crazy?!

411
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:25,886
Forget about it, Steph.

412
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:27,288
Just get us down from here.

413
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:30,022
Now that we've gotten all the particulars out of the way,

414
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,556
Please allow me to begin this tale properly.

415
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,813
Once upon a time...

416
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,155
We'll start by conquering the world,

417
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,707
and then our goal is to beat God at his own game.

418
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,012
Now it's time for an amazing story,

419
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,403
one I promise you've never heard before.

420
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,288
We sure had fun last night, didn't we?

421
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:53,172
Oh, yeah, playing games is the best thing ever.
