1
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,420
And the first piece makes its move.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,961
What'll you do next?

3
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:16,908
Query... Do you, "A," desire the destruction of Imanity?

4
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:20,379
Or "B," have you finally decided to take action?

5
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:25,553
Now, now, don't you dummies know that
eavesdropping on people isn't very polite?

6
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:30,342
Query... an event fluctuation was detected
just before the new king was crowned.

7
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,870
We assume this heralds your intent to join the battle.

8
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:36,207
Oh, you fallen gods are a serious buzzkill.

9
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,701
You guys still think you're so hot.

10
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:43,276
Well, listen, Mr. High and Mighty,
Old Deus‐ First Order of The Exceed‐

11
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:45,510
I'm not on anyone's side.

12
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:49,110
So you can just keep playing your same boring games,

13
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:50,341
but they're coming.

14
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:54,694
They're coming all the way to your front door.

15
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:04,339
After seeing the way those two rallied
the people of Elkia to their cause,

16
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:06,364
I felt like they were our saviors.

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,089
Well, not anymore.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,663
They just delegate all their kingly duties to
me and the ministers and then spend the whole day

19
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:14,468
sitting around playing games!

20
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,687
Today's the day.

21
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,480
Today's the day I end this once and for all!

22
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:04,912
Hyah! Hmm!

23
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,179
My eyes!

24
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:11,706
Okay, you slackers, time to get
out of bed and do your job as king.

25
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,270
Damn it!

26
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,662
I made sure this room was hidden
from the vile rays of the morning sun!

27
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,221
It's after noon, you dope.

28
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:20,421
36 o'clock is too early.

29
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:21,890
Is that watch even real?

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,476
Ugh, you tossed my precious books all over the place.

31
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:29,141
Yeah, put them back in your grandpa's room for me, okay?

32
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,750
Sora, as the new king, that room is supposed to be yours.

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,015
It's been that way for many generations, so
you can't just decide to move out of it on a whim.

34
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:41,218
Yeah, but the bed's lopsided. It's hard to sleep in.

35
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,223
The floor is for champs.

36
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,589
Oh, no, you are not going back to sleep!

37
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:48,576
I find it really embarrassing
to think that you're the new king

38
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:51,379
who's been entrusted with the
lives of over 3 million Imanity.

39
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:55,043
I'm embarrassing, am I? Sorry to be a disappointment.

40
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,751
You're entitled to your own opinion,

41
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:57,793
but hear this...

42
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,590
Not in this world or any other
will Blank do any real work!

43
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,099
Don't underestimate...

44
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,912
The will of Humanity!

45
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,684
If that's the will of humanity,

46
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:08,486
then we're better off going extinct.

47
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:09,821
That's it.

48
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:13,031
My patience for your shenanigans has finally run out.

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,318
Sora, I challenge you to a duel!

50
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,136
Oh...

51
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:19,505
so you want to play a game with me, huh?

52
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:20,745
Sure about that?

53
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,963
Yes, that's right, I would.

54
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:25,964
Okay, so pledge number five‐

55
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,451
It says here that since we're the challenged party,

56
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,486
we get to set the rules of the game.

57
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:31,336
Still in?

58
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:32,443
Yes.

59
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,212
B‐but as one of the greatest minds in human history,

60
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm sure you would never choose a game

61
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,621
where you have an advantage over little old me.

62
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,269
All right, fine, pick whatever
game you think you're good at.

63
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,890
And what are we playing for?

64
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:50,168
If I win, then you have to become a decent person!

65
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,816
Holy crap, if the ten pledges are absolute

66
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,037
then they can even grant crazy wishes like that.

67
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:02,840
In that case, Steph, instead of making me respectable

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,842
just make me, like, totally satisfied IRL.

69
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:05,452
I‐R‐what?

70
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,153
Why do I need to be respectable if I can be content?

71
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,180
Go ahead, challenge me.

72
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,394
I'll do everything I can to lose!

73
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,519
Sora, you're not allowed to lose to anyone but me.

74
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,877
Wait, darling sister,

75
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,149
would you stand between your brother and true happiness?

76
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:20,936
Blank can't lose a game,

77
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,455
no matter how painful the cost may be.

78
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,564
But it's impossible for me to
lose to Steph in an honest game.

79
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:30,468
Whatever!

80
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:31,335
All right! Whoa! Yes?

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,052
I'll bet on the tiny, ridiculous, remote chance,

82
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,325
that somehow against the will of the universe, you'll win.

83
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:40,344
Wow, you've really gone and done it now.

84
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,577
In that case the game I pick is...

85
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,184
Blackjack?

86
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,019
Okay, I'll be the dealer, and you'll be the player.

87
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,339
Is that all right, Sora?

88
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,355
groans )

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,859
Well, at least try to be interested!

90
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,940
At least try to look awake!

91
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,366
Now look here, you, blackjack is 100% a game of chance.

92
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,646
All your cheating and dirty little
tricks won't help you this time, understand?

93
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,924
Come on! Say it with me.

94
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,045
Aschente!

95
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,315
Aschente.

96
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,431
You fell right into my trap.

97
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:11,250
A game of chance? Or so I'd have you think.

98
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,396
'Cause that's not how I'm going to play.

99
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:14,905
Yes, that's right.

100
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:18,107
I've learned that you can cheat as
long as your opponent doesn't find out.

101
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:22,811
I've been practicing this trick in secret and I'm
gonna use it to knock your skinny butt down a peg!

102
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,498
Dearest granddaughter, the weak must use their
wisdom to kick all the skinny butts they can.

103
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:30,357
Such is the hope of all humanity.

104
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,131
Thank you, grandfather for believing in our potential.

105
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,183
And thank you, Sora, for
teaching me how to beat you with it!

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,032
Hit me...

107
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:41,735
Stand.

108
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,947
Well, I've got 21.

109
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,376
19 here.

110
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:53,668
I'm just getting started.

111
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:03,837
Well, it's time for the final round.

112
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:04,927
Best of luck!

113
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,254
I think we know who's going to be winning, though.

114
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,432
Blackjack is one of the rare games

115
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:12,188
where the player has an advantage over the dealer.

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,690
What's that supposed to mean?

117
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,320
The dealer has to draw another
card whenever he's below 17,

118
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:19,744
so he has a high chance of going to bust.

119
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,770
But you haven't had that happen even once.

120
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,628
That's some pretty impressive luck.

121
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,658
I'll stand this turn.

122
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,198
Has he just given up?

123
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,066
He didn't even look at the cards.

124
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:35,005
Well, looks like the game is over.

125
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,897
Yep, sure is.

126
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,968
In a natural blackjack,

127
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:44,303
you get back 2.5 times what you bet.

128
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,821
That means I win. Yay.

129
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:50,029
But I had humanity on my side.

130
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,832
Stephanie, my dear girl...

131
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:52,517
Grandfather!

132
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:56,250
Don't you know if your opponent
is a human, you're just screwed,

133
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:57,148
just screwed...

134
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:58,514
Hold on! What?!

135
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:00,057
I didn't think of that!

136
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:01,560
Oh, what a hollow victory.

137
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:04,610
Truly content people are just an urban legend anyway.

138
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:07,921
I refuse to accept this! How did I
lose? You must have been cheating.

139
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,623
And what's that supposed to mean?

140
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:12,269
I thought you said that blackjack
was a game of pure chance?

141
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,446
I used card counting.

142
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:17,369
Card counting?

143
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,086
I don't think I know what that is.

144
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,843
You think of the cards as
numbers and count them in your head.

145
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,851
Cards between two and six are +1,

146
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:26,784
ten and above are ‐1, and seven through nine are 0.

147
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:27,841
Easy peasy.

148
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:32,201
So you just count the number of cards that
have been played so far to mathematically find

149
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:35,246
the numerical probability for what will be played next.

150
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,356
So you used math in a game?

151
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:40,951
I didn't know that was even humanly possible.

152
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,113
Wait just one second! Isn't that cheating?

153
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,465
No, cheating refers to techniques
like the forced shuffle you were doing.

154
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:51,285
You knew from the start?

155
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,448
Yep, and it made counting that much easier.

156
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:58,229
Oh, impossible, he not only saw through
my tricks, he used them to defeat me?!

157
00:08:58,961 --> 00:08:59,699
Ow!

158
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,669
Hey, there, where you off to?

159
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:03,163
Oh, just back to work.

160
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,839
Remember all of those radical
policies you proposed yesterday?

161
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:09,288
I kind of have to meet with the nobles
who oppose them now, and they're angry.

162
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,942
Huh? That took longer than I thought.

163
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:14,810
I guess I'll go act like a king for once, then.

164
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,589
Huh?

165
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:21,477
This is outrageous! You'll pay for this!

166
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,972
Don't think you can humiliate
the nobles and get away with it.

167
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,132
That's former nobles from now on.

168
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:26,504
Preposterous.

169
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:31,067
Your titles, your land, money,
holdings, all property of the state now.

170
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:33,450
Well, given how quickly I changed things up,

171
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:35,874
people were bound to throw a hissy fit sooner or later.

172
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,599
Frankly, I'm surprised that it took as long as it did.

173
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:42,205
I know you didn't like them, but
you didn't have to be so mean about it.

174
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,128
I'd worked so hard to keep them under control peacefully.

175
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,131
Huh? Kept them under control?

176
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,786
I used data from the experiments we'd
conducted on the royal family's lands.

177
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:54,750
Then I distributed the commercial rights to
all the noble factions that backed my family.

178
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,134
Utilizing the success we gained from doing that,

179
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,903
we were able to keep the other
major political factions in check.

180
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:04,160
At the same time, we could quietly break
down the smaller groups, thus whittling away

181
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,485
our opponents' power base.

182
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,939
If you hadn't just humiliated those guys,

183
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:11,696
we'd likely could have had a bloodless
victory over the entire opposition!

184
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,514
Uh, what's wrong with you two?

185
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,561
I didn't think this was even possible,

186
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,140
but, Steph, you are actually not a humongous idiot.

187
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,451
You mean you thought I was stupid this whole time?

188
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,312
But that can't be right. You are a Steph, aren't you?

189
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:26,856
Is it my imagination, or did you
just use my name as a derogatory term?

190
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,603
Shut up, Steph, you're just a Steph.

191
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,239
My God! You two are terrible!

192
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,981
That is possibly the most unfair insult in history!

193
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:37,119
In fact, I graduated top of my class at
the most prestigious academy in the country,

194
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:40,600
and I have connections with every
major family through my former classmates.

195
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:45,426
She graduated from high school
already and has lots of friends.

196
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:48,823
You know, she's like an entitled
rich little princess literally.

197
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:51,016
And she has big boobies, too.

198
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,955
Sora? Shiro?

199
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,287
We didn't decide did we, what we were gonna
make you do for losing that game of blackjack?

200
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,526
You're really gonna get it now, Steph.

201
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,599
No mercy.

202
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:05,879
Wait! No!!

203
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,735
Th‐there are t‐too many people here.

204
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:17,640
Ahh!

205
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,930
Sh‐Shiro, don't let go of my hand no matter what!

206
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,676
You... you made me, Sora.

207
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,942
It was your idea to come to town, Sora.

208
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:25,942
What's going on?

209
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,398
We got something we need to do. Uh...

210
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:33,435
Wait, why is everyone looking at us funny?

211
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,811
That's because...

212
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,695
you made me wear this crap! Of
course they're going to stare!

213
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:40,228
Woof.

214
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:42,627
Couldn't you have come up with a
more dignified demand than this?

215
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,733
Okay, Steph, now shake.

216
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,299
Oh, my God, I can't disobey.

217
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,912
That's the rule, Steph.

218
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,987
In accordance with the law of the pledges,
you are officially our dog for the day.

219
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,045
Now your outfit is weird...

220
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,383
but they seem more scared than anything else.

221
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,594
I'll tell you why.

222
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,920
It's because the king of Elkia is walkingaround
with someone dressed as a Warbeast on a leash.

223
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:06,819
Wait!

224
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,147
You say you're dressed like a Warbeast?

225
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:11,960
"Exceed rank number 14.

226
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,178
Their territory, the Eastern
Federation, is one of the largest.

227
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:18,050
They possess superior senses and physical abilities,

228
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:21,397
as well as a sixth sense that
allows them to read people's minds!"

229
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,198
In other words, the Eastern Federation is an
Eden composed entirely of hot girls with animal ears!

230
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,334
No, there are men and old people, too.

231
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,584
Okay! Time to conquer the beasts of Paradise!

232
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:33,950
We're going after the animal girls!

233
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,824
Ready, let's go!

234
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,257
Wait! They're one of the three
biggest countries in the world!

235
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:43,485
Silence! You and your false ears shall not stand between
me and the joy of authentic animal‐eared goddesses!

236
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:48,108
The Eden I've only dreamt of awaits its true master!

237
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:49,459
Hmm?

238
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:51,437
Sora, before you do that...

239
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,106
Oh, that's right.

240
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:54,568
Onward we go.

241
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:55,485
Lead the way.

242
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:55,911
Right.

243
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:56,704
Wait a sec.

244
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:59,112
I'm tied up?

245
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,899
Son of a bitch.

246
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:08,359
I can't believe we didn't find a single thing anywhere.

247
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,012
This kingdom is weird.

248
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,155
I know, right?

249
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:16,152
This looks good, but it tastes like dookie.

250
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:19,610
I think there's a shortage of
things like sugar, salt, and butter.

251
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,834
Is that why Steph's cookies were so good,

252
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,002
because they have better ingredients at the castle?

253
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:24,558
Mm.

254
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,879
I finally found you!

255
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,699
Oh, hey, Steph. Where you been?

256
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,916
What do you mean? Uh, huh?

257
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,576
You left me tied to a lamppost in the middle of town.

258
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:36,517
You're saying you just conveniently forgot?

259
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,749
Sorry about that, Steph.

260
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:38,535
Now sit.

261
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,976
You asked for forgiveness and then you make me sit.

262
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,946
This is so wrong!

263
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,820
I can't take this anymore.

264
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,824
I've got to do something about these two.

265
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,826
But if I'm going to stand any
chance of beating them in a game,

266
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,892
it has to be a game based on pure luck,

267
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,378
one where they can't calculate their way into winning.

268
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:56,521
I've got it.

269
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,287
I demand one more match!

270
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,178
Now stand.

271
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,949
Hmm, okay, what do you want from me now, Steph?

272
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:06,542
The same thing you wanted this morning
that I didn't understand‐ The IRL.

273
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,878
Oh, Steph, I knew you would‐

274
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:11,514
I will be happy to except on behalf of Blank.

275
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,890
If you lose, you have to do one thing I tell you to.

276
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:17,752
Sis, please, my manhood needs this.

277
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:18,856
That's fine with me.

278
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:24,663
We'll compete to see whether the next person
to go down that alley is a man or a woman!

279
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:26,664
Best out of ten wins.

280
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,032
Aschente! Aschente!

281
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:32,028
This doesn't make sense!

282
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,283
Did you really think it'd be random?

283
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,312
People usually have reasons for going into town, you know.

284
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:37,899
Huh?

285
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:41,178
What Shiro did is assessed the male‐to‐female ratio

286
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:45,414
by applying data on time‐based variables,
occupations, and employment rate for this area

287
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,553
to the general trends that we've observed in the past.

288
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:48,259
I rule.

289
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,719
Do you always take this stuff so seriously?

290
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,923
But, of course, because when it comes to games...

291
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:55,640
We're always serious.

292
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,000
It's time to pay up, Steph.

293
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:02,042
I think I'll take your underwear.

294
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,674
That's it isn't it?

295
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,002
I really am ruined forever now, aren't I?

296
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:12,594
Hey, Shiro, this is actually starting
to get really depressing and sad.

297
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,222
I'm just 11 years old.

298
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,307
I'm a kid, so I don't understand.

299
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,350
You seem like you're in a bad mood.

300
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,427
might want to go easy on Steph from now on.

301
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:22,436
Whatever.

302
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,790
I'll have you know, I'm just getting started.

303
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,427
As far as my skills go, you haven't seen anything yet.

304
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,985
On the contrary, I think we've both seen plenty.

305
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,740
You'll regret that one!

306
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,027
Aschente!

307
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:06,516
One, one more, I want to play one more game!

308
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,106
You don't have much left to lose.

309
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:14,056
A temporary defeat is, uh, trivial so
long as it leads to ultimate victory!

310
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:18,236
Hey, you know, I'm starting to understand
why Elkia ended up in such a bad state.

311
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:21,740
This time it'll be pure, 100% chance!

312
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,456
How many seconds until those birds fly away?

313
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,931
Fine, I'll let you bet first.

314
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,383
Aschente. What's your bet?

315
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,600
Huh? A‐aschente.

316
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:35,754
Uh, let's see, I bet 30 seconds.

317
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:39,193
Then I'll take... three seconds!

318
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,953
Hey, that's against the rules! I don't
believe you stated any rules, right?

319
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,520
Steph, just give it up, already.

320
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:49,753
Why?

321
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:50,172
Huh?

322
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,193
What did I ever do to deserve this?

323
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:56,562
All I want is to help people

324
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,803
for the sake of Elkia. Why
can't luck be on my side even once?

325
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:01,770
Steph...

326
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,249
'Cause nothing's decided by chance alone.

327
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:07,789
Huh?

328
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,133
Rules, statistics, emotional states,

329
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,707
any number of invisible factors can can combine

330
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,639
to produce an unpredictable but inevitable result.

331
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,649
So the victor's decided before the game even begins.

332
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,626
Luck isn't a thing.

333
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,228
For example, what's the probability of drawing
the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers?

334
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,817
It's one in 52, isn't it?

335
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,678
Normally, yes. But what if it's a brand‐new deck?

336
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,984
The position of the cards in a
new deck are typically identical.

337
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,790
So that means If you take out the jokers
and draw the card at the very bottom...

338
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,770
it's the ace of spades almost 100% of the time.

339
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,239
Uh, hold on!

340
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,553
Oh, that's right, I didn't say a
word about it being a new deck, did I?

341
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:51,577
Rather... you didn't ask.

342
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:55,497
You see, being in the know gives you the
power to turn the probability of winning

343
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:58,945
from 1.92% to 100%.

344
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,829
The more knowledgeable party
will be the inevitable victor.

345
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:05,340
This is why the Imanity keep losing over and over

346
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:08,160
and why we're at a loss for what to do next.

347
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:09,794
Uh, explain.

348
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,037
We don't have enough information.

349
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:15,764
Before we can invade the animal‐girl
kingdom we have to know something about them,

350
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:18,433
anything, though preferably their weakness.

351
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,731
We've heard that they have a sharp sixth
sense but that's not too much to go off of.

352
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,327
They can read minds.

353
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,727
If that's true, then nothing we come
up with is gonna work against them.

354
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:28,341
It won't even be a real game.

355
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:31,281
I've read every book and paper
in the palace and found nothing.

356
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,926
And there's not a single
bookstore or library in this town.

357
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,579
Do these people even care?

358
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,503
Do they want to lose forever?

359
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:42,929
Has he been looking for information
about this world ever since he was coronated?

360
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:46,703
You know what they say, only an
idiot starts a fight he can't win.

361
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:51,614
True, but we have to do something
or we'll never get anywhere!

362
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:57,325
Even if it means sacrificing ourselves, we have
to keep fighting for Elkia before it's too late.

363
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:01,131
One more screw‐up, and this kingdom is finished.

364
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,928
I know you're proud of this country,

365
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,977
but it's still on the verge of destruction.

366
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:07,986
Don't forget that.

367
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,522
All that time,

368
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:12,491
they weren't fooling around after all.

369
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:16,415
Rather, they were shouldering the
fate of 3 million Imanity and I...

370
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,477
I didn't‐ I didn't even realize it.

371
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:27,092
You know, all things considered, you really did a
good job of keeping things in check. so far, Steph.

372
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,076
I was wondering why there was so little
resistance to all those radical reforms of ours.

373
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,048
You really had those noblemen in line.

374
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:38,511
Good job being smart, Steph.

375
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,847
What you said seriously helped us out.

376
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,086
So thanks for that.

377
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:46,090
Sora... Shiro?

378
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,132
Please, don't cry.

379
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,428
Let's all keep working hard together, right?

380
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:51,406
Okay, Steph?

381
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:54,013
That's all I want. That's all I want!

382
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,763
That's nice, but we're still backed in a corner here,

383
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:01,702
and we don't have the key to the one exit I can find.

384
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,126
What the? It's dark already?

385
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,749
Wow!

386
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,205
Awesome.

387
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,055
Laputa really exists.

388
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,790
Oh, that's the kingdom of Avant Heim.

389
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,802
It's one of our world's Phantasmas.

390
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,891
You mean, the second‐ranked Exceed?

391
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,473
How the hell am I supposed to play a game with that?

392
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:27,412
Sora, do you think‐

393
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,100
Yeah.

394
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,894
The best thing would be for us to get one of
those Flugel up there and bring them over to our side.

395
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,689
But how are we gonna get to 'em?

396
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,669
Ba *se

397
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:40,837
It's not falling.

398
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,461
I guess it's gonna take more than magic words.

399
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:45,264
If you're looking for a Flugel,

400
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,623
there's one that lives near here.

401
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,243
Huh?

402
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:51,684
About five years ago, it showed up at
the doors of the Elkia national library.

403
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:55,990
It defeated my grandfather in a game
and won the library and everything in it.

404
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,324
Funny, huh?

405
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:59,303
Oh, you had a library, huh?

406
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,868
You bet your knowledge away?!
Are your heads full of shit?!

407
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,355
That's humanity's only weapon!

408
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,890
Steph, sit. Down, girl.

409
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,575
Stay.

410
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,553
No, please, wait! People are staring at me!

411
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:16,123
Exceed rank six, the Flugel,

412
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:20,937
They were the soldiers on the front lines,
created during the ancient war to kill the gods.

413
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:25,450
I can't believe there was one so close.

414
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:30,050
Wait, Sora, are you two sure you really
want to challenge a monster like that?

415
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,685
The only way we're going to
stand a chance of saving this place

416
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,459
is if we can get a hold of the
knowledge this god‐killer has.

417
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:38,233
You don't have to come if you don't want to.

418
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,402
Of course

419
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:40,156
I want to come.

420
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:42,231
Steph, from what I hear

421
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:45,410
the Flugel supposedly only played one game, and that's it.

422
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:46,775
Is that really the case?

423
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,095
Yes, according to the records.

424
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,444
Perfect.

425
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:52,861
Well, looks like this is it.

426
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:56,189
Time to start conquering the world.

427
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,830
Whoa...

428
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:58,372
Neato.

429
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,343
Now then, where's this cute little angel of ours?

430
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:30,162
That's not the kind of angel I was expecting.

431
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,328
That's an angel of death.

432
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,408
Excusez‐moi, you wee little personas.

433
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:42,007
I'm afraid mi library is no sus library.

434
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,389
Whoa...

435
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,621
That ruined it.

436
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,025
Woe is to Steph.

437
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,351
Death should not have taken thee so young.
