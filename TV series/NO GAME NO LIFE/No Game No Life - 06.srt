1
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:12,104
Welcome, I'm the one they call Jibril.

2
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:14,924
You are King Sora and Queen Shiro?

3
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,212
What business do the new rulers of Imanity have with me?

4
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:20,385
Oh, so you know us already.

5
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,081
That'll make this easier.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,997
I'll just tell you then.

7
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:27,397
I want this library.

8
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,014
You amigos want to take moi library away.

9
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:13,407
My word, that's not es possible. I would comprende.

10
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:15,821
Okay, Steph, this is a Flugel, right,

11
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:17,956
a god‐killing warrior just like you said?

12
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,246
That's what she's supposed to be.

13
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,479
I must have been as cattywampus as a
squab hit in the face with a bean gun.

14
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:24,625
Or, wait, sorry, pea shooter, I mean.

15
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,904
She corrected herself.

16
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:28,104
You remind me of this awful comedian I saw,

17
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,504
so, if you're doing this on purpose, please spare us.

18
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,338
Pourquoi?

19
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:34,332
I had thought it was a uniquely
avant‐garde way of speaking,

20
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:36,406
but you're saying somebody already beat me to it?

21
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,207
Yeah, and they suck, too.

22
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,586
Let us return to the matter at hand.

23
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,348
You said you desire my library.

24
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:45,139
Should I assume that means...

25
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,697
that you wish to challenge me to a game, human?

26
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:51,479
Uh‐huh. I do, actually.

27
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,362
How interesting.

28
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,595
Before the ten pledges were put into effect,

29
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,877
we Flugels spent our days collecting
severed heads off the corpses of our victims.

30
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:03,044
However, now that murder is forbidden,

31
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,525
we are satisfied with collecting knowledge instead.

32
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:10,308
It's no exaggeration to say the books containing
that knowledge and the places where they are held,

33
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:14,693
are, in Flugel society, considered
to be as valuable as one's life.

34
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:19,699
So since you're asking me to bet my life away,

35
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,137
what are you offering me in exchange?

36
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:27,127
More than 40,000 books from another world.

37
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,274
Oh, no, you didn't.

38
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,037
It's okay, Shiro, in our line of work,

39
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,309
that's a really good sign.

40
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,280
For 40,000, that's quite a prize.

41
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:38,718
Where do you keep all these books?

42
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:39,999
Right in here.

43
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,159
I got them to study for quiz games‐

44
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,377
dictionaries, medical reference guides, philosophy books.

45
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,841
It's chock‐full of information from our world.

46
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,400
Wait, you're honestly trying to tell
me that you came here from another world?

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,006
Yep.

48
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:55,609
That's not possible.

49
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,103
Huh?

50
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,741
You want to back us up here?

51
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,647
Oh, I, uh...

52
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,778
If you were going to summon a
living creature from another world,

53
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,885
it would require a massive amount of
magical energy to sustain them here.

54
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:11,176
I'm afraid that even the Old Deus would
find such a task extraordinarily difficult.

55
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,717
I don't really get it, but proof trumps all.

56
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,892
Look at this. Not sure if you can read it.

57
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,564
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,588
I can speak every one of the
over 700 languages fluently, so...

59
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,806
I can't read these words.

60
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,275
A brand‐new language?

61
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,842
And there are 40,000 books full of this?

62
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,568
So much knowledge from another world!

63
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:34,682
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

64
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,335
Hey, you're drooling! You're drooling on it!

65
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,559
Oh, my, excuse me. I see.

66
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,253
I am indeed interested in this little thin board thingy.

67
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:47,306
And yet, I fear I still can't trust that you're from
another world without some sort of proof to persuade me.

68
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:48,382
Help me out here.

69
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,198
What kind of proof are you looking for?

70
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,542
Could you please allow me to inspect your bodies?

71
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,503
Inspect our bodies? Why would you do that?

72
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,658
What the hell are you checking for anyway?

73
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,239
Your erogenous zones.

74
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,457
Oh! do it for as long as you like,
as hard as you like, wherever you like!

75
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,930
Nothing good can come from this.

76
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,001
Sora, that's rated‐R stuff.

77
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,337
Damn it, you're right. Fine!

78
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,259
Just leave the stupid pants on, but listen up!

79
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,079
This is a give and take situation.

80
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,367
You touch me, and I get to feel you up, too!

81
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,369
Are you crazy? She's not just gonna let you.

82
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,429
Of course. That'll be perfectly fine.

83
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,785
I'm losing my mind!

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,883
So do you not care for how it feels

85
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,751
when I stroke you that way?

86
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,070
Uh, no, it feels pretty okay, I suppose,

87
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,611
more so than one might expect.

88
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,581
but, uh, how to put it?

89
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,980
I guess I'm just feeling a little let down,

90
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,373
kind of disappointed.

91
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:45,030
Is this not one of your erogenous zones?

92
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,917
I mean, no, it isn't, not really.

93
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,333
but, frankly, even if it was,

94
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,754
I don't think any man would
be willing to admit that, okay?

95
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,131
And allow me to add I was hoping you'd
touch me somewhere else, to say the least.

96
00:05:55,474 --> 00:06:01,290
But all of our power comes from the pulsating
lines of currents called our spirit circuits.

97
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,356
These lines are more concentrated at our wings

98
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:08,448
which is why they are so very
sensitive and also very erogenous.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,191
Um, you like that, baby? What, right here, you say?

100
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:14,310
And when you touch me like that I just...

101
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,942
What are we even doing anymore?!

102
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,453
I'm just helping a girlfriend
out by stroking her soft parts.

103
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:21,152
Right, sis?

104
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:23,013
Yep, it's super healthy.

105
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,766
I can't believe that I'm seeing this.

106
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,595
I mean, she's a god‐killing ultimate weapon.

107
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:34,141
Ahem, as far as I can tell, there would appear

108
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,416
to be no spirits whatsoever residing within your bodies.

109
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,045
In other words, by the standards set in our world

110
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,287
you two aren't technically even defined as life.

111
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,201
Flugel are like living deities and Imanity fungus.

112
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,591
So what does that...

113
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:47,863
Make us?

114
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:50,644
Completely unknown!

115
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,274
A mystery is the most wonderful thing in existence.

116
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,984
It is the wellspring from which all new knowledge is born,

117
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:00,320
and there is nothing quite as spectacular as the unknown!

118
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,735
Uh, okay, good for you.

119
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,993
Guess it's safe to assume that we've
proven we're not from your world, then?

120
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:06,969
Yes, that's right.

121
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,115
I assumed you were nothing more than
a feeble Imanity, but I was mistaken.

122
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,531
My apologies. I meant no offense.

123
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,208
Of course, I will accept your challenge,

124
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:20,015
but I'm afraid I don't really have much to offer
you that's worth 40,000 books from another world.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,201
I just want the library.

126
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,990
How about I bet myself as well as everything I have.

127
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,507
Really?! Seriously?!

128
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,056
Jackpot!

129
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,581
Is that acceptable?

130
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:32,759
Oh, yeah, we want all of your
personal rights as a living being.

131
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,409
Why, that's just excellent.

132
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:38,931
Oh, if I win, I would like to add a clause
that states that you have to come by the library

133
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,283
for tea once in a while.

134
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,707
I'm ever so eager to learn more about you.

135
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,983
I have no problem with that,
assuming you do win, of course,

136
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:51,462
but in that case, we get a
second request if we win, right?

137
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:56,451
Yes, in the extraordinarily unlikely
event that such a miracle occurs.

138
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,438
The game will be word chain,

139
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:09,257
but not your run‐of‐the‐mill kind of word chain‐

140
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,839
Materialization word chain.

141
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:12,602
Oh...

142
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,555
Materialization word chain?

143
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,099
Yes, the rules are simple.

144
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,849
Just like a normal word chain,

145
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,085
if you use a word that's already been used,

146
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,233
fail to answer after 30 seconds, or can no
longer continue, then it's game over for you.

147
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,119
Can words be in any language?

148
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,870
Yes, but just so you know,
imaginary things that do not exist

149
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:32,823
won't count as a proper answer.

150
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:36,558
And remember, we're playing materialization word chain.

151
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,203
If you say something that's here,

152
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,251
it will disappear.

153
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:42,237
If it's not here, it will appear.

154
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,272
I'm sure you can guess the implications.

155
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:47,895
Of course, once the game's over

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,547
everything that happened will be undone.

157
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,908
So don't hesitate to show off your knowledge.

158
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:53,425
I got it.

159
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,284
Okay, Shiro, come sit here.

160
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,017
We'll do this together just like we always do.

161
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,354
It makes no difference. You are completely outmatched.

162
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,888
Take all the help you can get and try to stay alive.

163
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:06,883
What? Wait, you mean you can die?

164
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:10,300
You can, but only as a consequence
of actions taken in the game.

165
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,468
Your opponent cannot directly attack you.

166
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:14,988
Okey dokey, then, folks, You have fun.

167
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,768
I'll just be on my merry way‐

168
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:17,690
Here we go.

169
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,336
All right, let the game begin.

170
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:24,275
Give us your best shot.

171
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:25,485
Would you please stop ig...

172
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,898
Steph, sit, stay.

173
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:31,305
No, now I cant run away. I've had it with this.

174
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:31,641
It's not fair!

175
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,571
I will offer you the first move.

176
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,270
Pick any word you like.

177
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,772
So let me think about this.

178
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,407
Okay, I'll start with...

179
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,805
atom bomb!

180
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:44,406
Huh?

181
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,631
What is this?

182
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,016
Bkuli'ans!

183
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,240
Self destructing for your first move, hmm?

184
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:09,204
That was Bkuli'ans,

185
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:12,531
one of the highest level sealing spells, very handy.

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,673
You were fortunate.

187
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:17,854
If I hadn't decided to be so benevolent as to
protect you, the game would have ended already.

188
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,326
Benevolent? Oh, give me a break.

189
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,011
Bkuli'ans!

190
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:25,005
I was simply testing the waters to see what
lengths you'd be willing to go to in order to keep

191
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,110
this interesting little game of ours running.

192
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,786
Pretty great lengths, it would seem.

193
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:29,672
That's right.

194
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:33,107
Now that I've busted out the most
powerful weapon in my planet's arsenal,

195
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,420
I see that you won't be so easy to dispose of.

196
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,494
I'm so glad we understand each other.

197
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,702
The last thing I want is to waste my time in a dull game.

198
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,083
Oh, don't worry,

199
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,952
I think I can keep these things lively.

200
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,976
Spirit circuits.

201
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,905
Well, you certainly got right to it.

202
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,292
I wanted to try out the new phrase I learned.

203
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,525
What? You mad?

204
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,580
No, it's fine.

205
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:01,346
Not having them in me just
limits my physical abilities a bit

206
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,681
and prevents me from flying,

207
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,842
but I still have spirits in my body,

208
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,060
so I'll be able to manage.

209
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,774
If anything, I suppose it just makes me a bit anxious.

210
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,855
Oh, like when your cell phone
can't get a wireless connection?

211
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,358
Cell phone? Wireless?

212
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,003
Do they have something to do
with that magic board doohickey?

213
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,228
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, back off!

214
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,432
if I lose, then I'll tell you.

215
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,929
Sora, I think she's...

216
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:24,996
Yeah, she's really getting into this game.

217
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,758
Hey, Jibril, your turn, come on.

218
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:30,517
Oh, yes, that's right. I'll do an easy one.

219
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:31,407
Stallions.

220
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,702
Stall‐

221
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,704
Okay, naughty bits.

222
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:35,252
Huh?

223
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,293
Huh?

224
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:36,853
You cool?

225
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,273
Why do you keep doing weird things to me?!

226
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,773
I'm getting a little tired of this bleak scenery.

227
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,862
Let's liven things up a bit.

228
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,894
Beach.

229
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:00,985
Okay, this is nice and all,

230
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,774
but it's rough on someone who never leaves home.

231
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,441
My turn!

232
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,480
Hooter‐nub!

233
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,135
Oh, I get it. Let me try this.

234
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,183
Bikinis.

235
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:11,099
Jibril, you don't understand at all!

236
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,371
If you want to see bikinis,

237
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:13,761
you need to get rid of the clothing first!

238
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:14,905
That's how it works!

239
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,414
Oh, I see, I'm sorry I ruined it.

240
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:18,815
Too bad I can't take it back.

241
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,214
Would you two at least pretend like
this is a life or death struggle?!

242
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:21,952
Whatever.

243
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,382
Suitcases.

244
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:25,900
Don't you mean baggage?

245
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,108
Anyway, how does squall sound?

246
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,826
Huh? Hey, wait.

247
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,570
It all worked out in the end, Jibril!

248
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,482
Getting a up skirt look at a
bikini bottom is a rare thing.

249
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:37,047
and since Steph wasn't wearing underwear,

250
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,804
we don't have to worry about an extra
pair of panties getting in the way.

251
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,998
Oh, yay, I'm so glad it worked out.

252
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,159
And now it'll be complete.

253
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,874
Ladies wear!

254
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:47,400
Huh?

255
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,432
Oh?

256
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,626
No!

257
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:54,948
How do you like that, sis?

258
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,600
No nether regions at all,

259
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,256
and we've still got the shoes, knee socks and collar.

260
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,676
In other words, it's even better than pure nudity.

261
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,368
Obviously, suitable for all ages,

262
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:07,039
very healthy and natural, moderately
sexy, but not like super dirty or anything.

263
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,002
Hey, you know what we should call this?

264
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,132
the super healthy un‐nude beach deluxe!

265
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,878
Sora, Omega good job.

266
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:17,906
Give me back my clothes! Give me back my dignity!

267
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:28,254
Hey, Jibril, don't you ever get hungry?

268
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,205
Mantle.

269
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:30,969
Oh, I'm fine.

270
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,733
Unlike you pathetic humans,

271
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,060
I don't require the intake of organic substances.

272
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,245
Elooshig'o.

273
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:38,485
I see.

274
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,090
But you get tired, don't you?

275
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,615
The sun will come up soon.

276
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,164
Hurry up and lose those already.

277
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:44,253
Outer core.

278
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,709
Aw, if you're all pooped and
you want to quit, go right ahead.

279
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:50,004
I'm not going to stop you.

280
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,420
I've already had more fun than I've
ever expected playing with you weaklings.

281
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:54,277
Epic clock.

282
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:58,003
You keep calling us weaklings and feeble.

283
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,863
It's really starting to get on my nerves.

284
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:00,845
Killer creature.

285
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,717
Well, to a mighty Exceed rank six like yourself,

286
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,401
I'm sure us folks at the bottom of the list

287
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,551
must look like ants or whatever, huh?

288
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:10,765
But you know what? Ants are pretty
strong and there's lots of them, too.

289
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,391
I humbly apologize.

290
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:17,542
I hadn't considered the idea that you Imanity were
smart enough to think of yourselves as anything but weak.

291
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:21,007
Well, if you think that
longevity and strength equal power,

292
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,088
then you must be even dumber than we are.

293
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:26,703
You're saying I'm inferior to Imanity?

294
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:32,142
Please, do understand that my feelings towards
you are best described as curiously, not respect.

295
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,578
So don't get too comfortable, little ant.

296
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:36,968
I could easily squish you. anytime I like.

297
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,446
Effulgent oil.

298
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,886
And that's exactly why you're weak.

299
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,770
You're so egocentric, you don't even know it.

300
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,224
Egocentric?

301
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:47,781
Yep, I'll write it.

302
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,792
It means you think you're the center of everything.

303
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:53,533
Obviously. I know what the word means.

304
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:55,742
And what makes you think I'm so egocentric?

305
00:14:55,767 --> 00:15:01,056
You say you're curious about the unknown, but you're so
wrapped up in yourself, that you can't even appreciate it.

306
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:03,798
It's about time I taught you a lesson.

307
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,831
Allow me to show you...

308
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,206
just how weak you really are.

309
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,265
Hey, Steph, thanks for the hard work.

310
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,046
If you hadn't kept all those monsters at bay,

311
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,595
there's no way we would have won.

312
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,020
That's a little premature.

313
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:17,376
Sorry about this, Steph.

314
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,988
This'll kill you, so try to hang in there.

315
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:21,832
Wait, what?

316
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,649
Lithosphere!

317
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:32,105
Huh?

318
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,499
Huh?

319
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:43,854
The lithosphere is our planet's outer surface.

320
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,580
You were too busy enjoying yourself

321
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,916
to see that I was slowly dismantling this planet,

322
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:50,790
starting with its mantle, then erasing the outer core.

323
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,810
Maybe you would have caught that
if you weren't so damn egocentric.

324
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,361
You failed to fear and respect the unknown,

325
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,125
and that, my dear, is what makes you weak.

326
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,024
Now I see.

327
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,797
This is why you erased my spirit circuits.

328
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,847
You wanted me to fall to my doom.

329
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:11,750
The core has an internal temperature of 6,000
degrees and a surface temperature of 3,000 degrees.

330
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:17,120
Well, you're in the same pickle I am, so
let's keep playing and see who goes first.

331
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,862
You were worried about the sun coming up, right?

332
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,983
Early morning halo.

333
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,764
Oxygen gas.

334
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,283
So you want to smother me to death now?

335
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,096
You'll have to do better than that.

336
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,850
Let's keep this game going.

337
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,210
Sonata.

338
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,150
Agricultural enthusiasts.

339
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:39,359
You're making this way too easy.

340
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,505
Okay, still air.

341
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,682
Once the air comes back, I can breathe.

342
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:47,153
What the...

343
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:50,715
Yes, I was right, Jibril doesn't know atomic theory.

344
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,884
You thought if you couldn't breathe all
you had to do was bring back air, right?

345
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:58,266
Nope, not quite. All I got rid of was oxygen.

346
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,500
The rules say if something's there, it disappears

347
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,495
and if it isn't there, it appears.

348
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:07,407
The other gases disappeared and oxygen came back.

349
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:08,956
In other words, at these pressures,

350
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:11,506
your body cannot absorb this much oxygen properly,

351
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,318
and it becomes as good as poison to your system.

352
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:15,484
That may be so.

353
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:17,843
but at this rate, you're just as doomed as I am.

354
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,094
Ew.

355
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,510
Circular breathing.

356
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,590
What, don't tell me you didn't see that one coming?

357
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,664
This is the difference between you and us.

358
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,459
Shiro, let's go.

359
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:29,984
Okay.

360
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,679
Real atmosphere.

361
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,540
Can you feel that?

362
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:41,623
The zero pressure environment
created by the absence of the atmosphere

363
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:44,563
will cause the air left inside of you to expand

364
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,494
until you burst!

365
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,830
If you understood that, then you'd know why

366
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,537
we exhaled the way we did.

367
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,040
Still, it is useless.

368
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,472
My voice?

369
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,952
Sound can't travel in a vacuum,

370
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,440
so if you can't answer in the next 30 seconds...

371
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,459
Then I lose.

372
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,390
Is that what you're thinking?

373
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,595
Hmm, it's too bad you're nothing
but a pathetic little Imanity.

374
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,839
You do your race proud, for what it's worth,

375
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:21,151
but I'm afraid that this is the absolute end of the road.

376
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,502
Do you see now?

377
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:29,047
This difference between us is a barrier
that Imanity will never be able to overcome.

378
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:31,834
Why, you can't even find a way to answer me.

379
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,721
Isn't it ironic?

380
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:39,781
In the end, you will lose as a result
of the soundless fiery world you created.

381
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,498
Alas, you never stood a chance.

382
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,725
When Coulomb's force vanishes and all that's
left is the nuclear force that draws atoms together,

383
00:18:55,986 --> 00:19:01,245
the result is an astronomical phenomenon that
normally only occurs by the gravitational collapse

384
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,904
of super massive planets,

385
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,477
a hyper nova,

386
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:08,667
an explosion capable of destroying
stars dozens of light years away.

387
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:13,135
It has the temperature of 50 billion degrees Celsius,

388
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:15,118
rivaling the dawn of creation.

389
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,764
Just try and survive that, Flugel!

390
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,559
He's right. So he got me after all.

391
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,048
Even if I die, only a fraction
of a second earlier, I still lose.

392
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,037
I see now for the first explosion was simply a ruse
to see if he could words his opponents didn't know.

393
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:36,115
That little demonstration gave him all the
information he needed to set his trap for me.

394
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:40,362
He orchestrated it so that everything that
happened after that was just a distraction

395
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,241
to keep me entertained enough to miss his true intent.

396
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,518
Now that I think of it,

397
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,980
the game was over after the very first move.

398
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:52,513
These otherworldly beings, no, these Imanity,

399
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,434
they're a terrifying race of creatures.

400
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,006
I died, didn't I?

401
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,936
Yep, welcome back.

402
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,241
First you degrade the crap out of me, then
you use me as a decoy and then just sat back

403
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,647
and watched me die?!

404
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:23,507
The inhumanity! I mean, in‐Imanity!

405
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,207
Steph, sit and beg.

406
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:29,148
How long is this day anyway?

407
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,435
Well, I'm sure you have a lot to complain about.

408
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,160
But if it weren't for you, we would have lost.

409
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,497
Thanks a lot, Steph. You're great.

410
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:40,882
I was utterly defeated.

411
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:44,028
No matter how much you tried to lure me,

412
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:47,825
in the end, there was no way to
know I would answer with "egocentric."

413
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,360
That's the kind of risk a madman would take.

414
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,607
I am challenging God, after all.

415
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,491
Could a sane person do that?

416
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,440
You're going... to do what?

417
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:00,919
It was Tet who called us to this world.

418
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:06,313
He wants us to challenge him, so we'll
give him a run for his money, right?

419
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,458
Now then, Jibril,

420
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:12,765
since you lost, according to the pledges,
everything you have now belongs to us.

421
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,949
Oh, that's right, those 40,000
books in my tablet were just bait.

422
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,658
Feel free to borrow it and read
them whenever you feel like it.

423
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,368
You can keep using the library, too, if you want.

424
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:24,276
Oh, my dear departed lord,

425
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,795
oh, Artosh, he who created us but no longer draws breath,

426
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:30,458
at last I achieved the long‐held dream.

427
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,674
I found those worthy to call master.

428
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:36,146
Those who I can serve faithfully
with every ounce of my being.

429
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,515
Though born of Imanity, they would
command the Elves and even myself,

430
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:43,328
overturning my preconceived notion of the world.

431
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,663
My masters, my lords,

432
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,611
I, Jibril of the Flugel, ranked six in the Exceed

433
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,050
member of The Council of Wings,

434
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:56,111
henceforth offer my very being to you.

435
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,607
From now on, I will find no greater pleasure

436
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,562
than carrying out your will, my dear masters.

437
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,341
Well, all righty, that sounds great.

438
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,541
Right, Shiro?

439
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:06,311
Mm.

440
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:08,639
Welcome to the team.

441
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:15,383
Okay, guys, I've been a dog long enough!

442
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:17,690
I mean, I'd be dead in dog years by now.

443
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,278
I used to be a gamer like you.

444
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,337
Then I took an arrow in the knee.

445
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,123
Stop it. Just stop.
