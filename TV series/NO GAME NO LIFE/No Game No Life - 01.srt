1
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,406
I don't believe this!

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,987
There's only four of them!

3
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,743
They beat 1,200 players all on their own?

4
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:47,061
Enough, this ends now!

5
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:10,777
You're mine.

6
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:31,526
No! You can't dodge that.

7
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,428
You can't dodge that!

8
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,511
Tell me if this story rings a bell.

9
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:40,476
It may just be an urban legend,
but I assure you, it's a good one.

10
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:43,010
There exists a band of anonymous players,

11
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,839
gamers who obliterate anyone who comes to face them,

12
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:48,755
reaching scores never achieved before or since.

13
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,359
in every game they play, their win records are flawless.

14
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:54,963
Since their user names are always left empty,

15
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,786
they are simply known to people as "Blank".

16
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:00,547
And according to every player who has encountered them,

17
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:02,497
they're indeed unbeatable.

18
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:03,583
Cheaters?

19
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,407
You think that's how they keep winning?

20
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,713
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

21
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,924
It's got to be just a lousy group of hackers.

22
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,048
Come on, there's no way they could beat
1,200 people with just the four of them.

23
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:16,329
Auto‐aimers and wall hacks, hitbox manipulation.

24
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,513
They got to be cheating.

25
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,594
Oh, do they?

26
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,795
And here I thought cheating was our expertise.

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,087
Otherwise, I'd wouldn't be able
to cast so many spells like that.

28
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:27,006
I don't know. This is different.

29
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,694
But Blank dodged them anyway.

30
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:33,379
They already knew I was cheating to cast
consecutive spells before I even did it.

31
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,237
They're amazing.

32
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:37,852
They're like super geniuses or something!

33
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:39,806
You think maybe they'd go out with me?!

34
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:41,500
Oh, God.

35
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:46,386
And so the rumors spread with their infamy.

36
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,684
You know, urban legends are like a kind of wish.

37
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:51,145
Because...

38
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:54,132
in reality...

39
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:57,588
the least interesting answer

40
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:00,496
is usually the correct one.

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,342
We won... somehow.

42
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,849
Hey, listen, Little Sis,

43
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:14,170
could you do me a favor and please stop
controlling the main account for Blank with your feet?

44
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,505
Kind of nasty.

45
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,229
Hungry, I'm still hungry.

46
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,161
Want some, Sora?

47
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,464
Sure, why not?

48
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:42,753
Really splurging on some fancy rations, huh, Shiro?

49
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,968
Nutrition's important.

50
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,234
Listen, the human brain can
function as long as it has glucose.

51
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,893
White bread is best in terms of cost‐performance.

52
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,753
Yeah. Thanks for the lecture.

53
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:57,833
But I need other types of nutrients,
too, or I won't get any bigger.

54
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,704
You're already a perfect,
flawless beauty, you darling girl.

55
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,668
Mm.

56
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,085
Hey, what time is it?

57
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,943
Um... 8:00 A. M., the middle of the night.

58
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,834
What day?

59
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,923
Does that even matter to a NEET?

60
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:11,644
It does!

61
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,282
It tells me when MMORPGs are going to have new events!

62
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,791
And wha‐ wait!

63
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,628
I know you've been up for five days straight,
but if you quit now, I won't have a healer!

64
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,924
I know you can do it.

65
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,000
You seriously think I can
control four characters at one time?

66
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,024
Just believe.

67
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,564
Wait, no! Please don't fall asleep!

68
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:33,308
If you go to sleep, Shiro, everyone
and by everyone, I mean me will die!

69
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:36,445
Okay, fine, fine, I'll do it!

70
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,672
I can take these suckers!

71
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,005
This world is chaotic, unfair, and unforgiving.

72
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,967
It has no meaning or value.

73
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:52,588
However, some people simply refuse to accept this,

74
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:55,109
even though they know they can't change anything.

75
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:59,035
They wish that the world could
be just a little more interesting.

76
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:03,443
And that's how urban legends
are formed, from wishes like that.

77
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,440
Okay, so let's get things started.

78
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:11,094
Let's offer a subtle stylistic
catalyst for a chance at a new beginning.

79
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,525
Let's ask the question...

80
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,297
"Have you ever heard the latest rumor?"

81
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:19,372
Email.

82
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:23,433
Listen, your brother's been playing
four characters on four separate screens.

83
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,205
I don't know what you want, but
I'm seriously about to drop dead here.

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,429
It may be from a friend.

85
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,240
Whose friend?

86
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,733
Your friend?

87
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,013
That's weird.

88
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:37,564
I thought I heard my sister say
something really mean and sarcastic to me.

89
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:42,085
Huh?

90
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:45,368
What is this?

91
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:49,253
And how does this guy know
that the two of us are siblings?

92
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,331
What should we do?

93
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:57,666
Is he trying to cut a deal with us?

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,377
Well, it might be fun to see where this goes.

95
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:08,100
Huh? Chess?

96
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,967
Well, good night.

97
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:15,097
Huh, wait, wait! Don't fall asleep yet. I can't
handle a high‐level chess simulation on my own!

98
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:21,890
Chess is a finite two‐player,
zero‐sum, perfect information game.

99
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,813
Luck plays no part in it.

100
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,882
Theoretically, to each game, there is
a perfect solution that will never fail.

101
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:37,119
Of course, that's only if you have a mind capable of
calculating the 10'^120 possible states of the board.

102
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,305
Chess is no different

103
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,705
than simply playing tic‐tac‐toe.

104
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,155
That's right.

105
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:53,920
Shiro has beaten a program designed to
defeat grandmasters 20 times in a row,

106
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,653
alternating between going first and second.

107
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,163
However...

108
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,367
It cut off its own piece's advance.

109
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,672
Hold on, Shiro.

110
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,481
What?

111
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,589
A program will always select the best strategy.

112
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:11,241
You can win 'cause they're predictable.

113
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:15,777
But this one's deliberately
using a bad move to lure you in.

114
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,033
It's a human.

115
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:17,850
Hmm...

116
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,744
Don't worry, if it's a contest of
skill, you've got this in the bag.

117
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,364
I'll tell you when they're up to something tricky.

118
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,103
The two of us, Sora and Shiro,

119
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,885
form two halves of a whole.

120
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,529
Now let's see if there's somebody

121
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,730
who's got the balls to beat us.

122
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:44,194
Checkmate! You are winner!

123
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,806
Yeah, we won!

124
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,475
I haven't worked this hard in a long time.

125
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:53,539
Was that guy really human?

126
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:55,484
Huh?

127
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,908
What the hell?

128
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:13,489
What do you mean, "is it fun?"

129
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:17,485
In this game there's no way to
know the rules or how to win,

130
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,371
yet there are 7 billion players all
making whatever moves they want.

131
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,309
If you lose too much, or win
too much, there are penalties.

132
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:28,321
You can't pass your turn, and if
you complain, people look down on you.

133
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:32,000
There's no parameters or freakin' genre or anything.

134
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,542
You know what you call that?

135
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,774
You call it...

136
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,647
A crappy game.

137
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:50,457
Uh, believe me, if there's a world like that,

138
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:51,799
then the two of us,

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,881
well, we were born in the wrong one, for sure.

140
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:01,795
Huh? What the...

141
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,636
Sora?

142
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,378
You know what? I think so, too!

143
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:11,009
In fact, it sounds like you two don't
have any business living in this world at all!

144
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:13,115
So how does this sound?

145
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:14,861
How would you like a second chance

146
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:19,155
to be made anew in the world in which you
should have been born in the first place?

147
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,031
Welcome to the world of my creation!

148
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,566
What's going on?!

149
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:33,625
This is the ideal world you've always dreamed of‐

150
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,080
the world of games!

151
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:35,971
It's Disboard!

152
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,272
Shit!

153
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,109
You see, everything in this
world is decided by a simple game...

154
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:44,232
Government, politics, even the lives of its people.

155
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:45,559
Who are you?

156
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,853
Me? They call me Tet.

157
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,660
I live over here. I'm a god.

158
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,337
A god? You're so short.

159
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,848
Now's not the time! We're gonna die!

160
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:58,860
Try to stay focused, please. So everything
here is decided by ten simple pledges.

161
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:04,555
One‐ Killing others, waging war, and stealing
from people is strictly forbidden in this world.

162
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,036
Two‐ All conflicts, no matter how great or small,

163
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:09,760
must be resolved through games.

164
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,310
Three‐ Before the games begin, each player must
bet something that they agree is of equal value.

165
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:21,207
Four‐ As long as it doesn't go against number three, what
they bet and the rules of the game will not be questioned.

166
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:25,801
Five‐ The challenged party has the
right to determine the rules of the game.

167
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:30,774
Six‐ All bets made in accordance
with the pledges must be upheld.

168
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:36,851
Seven‐ Conflicts between groups will be overseen
by appointed representatives with absolute authority.

169
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:41,443
Eight‐ Being caught cheating during
a game results in an instant loss.

170
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:46,639
And nine‐ In the name of Almighty God,‐that's
me‐ the previous rules may never be altered.

171
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,069
Okay, great, now would you shut up and save us?!

172
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,732
The ground! the ground, the ground, the ground!

173
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:52,249
Shiro!

174
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:52,804
Sora!

175
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,214
Number ten‐ Let's all have fun and play together!

176
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,945
Huh? Hey!

177
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,608
I look forward to seeing you two again.

178
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:22,120
I'm pretty sure it won't be long.

179
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,877
Sora?

180
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,779
Where are we?

181
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:52,640
You know what, sis?

182
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:53,608
Hmm?

183
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:58,874
I've always thought life was just a game
for masochists and losers, and what happened?

184
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,569
The game just crashed!

185
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,640
Oh, what's going on?

186
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:06,144
This game is total crap!

187
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,667
Long ago, in the far distant past,

188
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,768
the gods, along with their families and creations,

189
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,514
waged a seemingly never‐ending
war for the right to rule this world,

190
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,368
They fought for the right to become the One True God.

191
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,538
Eventually, it became clear there would be no real victor,

192
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:31,997
as the sky, the sea, the land and the stars
were all destroyed in the devastating battles.

193
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:36,619
However, hidden amongst the
wreckage, a single deity had survived.

194
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:39,662
Although he never participated in the conflict,

195
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:41,429
the title became his.

196
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,271
His name was Tet,

197
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,344
and he was known as the God of Play.

198
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:52,936
You creatures who have fought with violence, blood, and
death, who built a tower of corpses that rises to the sky,

199
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,296
and who still call yourselves wise,

200
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,022
tell me this:

201
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,759
What makes you different from wild animals?

202
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:03,791
In the face of their shattered world,
excuses were meaningless and God spoke

203
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,688
"Thou shalt not kill one another.

204
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,994
Murder and thievery in this
realm is henceforth forbidden."

205
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,414
You 16 races full of greed and hubris, I
command you to use your ingenuity and wit,

206
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:18,180
your great fortunes and power
to build me a tower of knowledge

207
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,658
and to prove to me...

208
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,350
Your strength of mind.

209
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,166
Okay, I think I get it.

210
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,447
So everything in this world is decided by games,

211
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,144
because the God of Play is in charge?

212
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,109
That's right, and by the way...

213
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,410
Hmm? What now?

214
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,197
Do you suppose you could find it in your
heart to at least leave us a pair of pants?

215
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:39,608
Uh, Numero seis‐ Any bets made in
accordance with the pledges must be upheld.

216
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:44,658
So we bet everything we could offer, including our
lives, and you in turn, bet everything you had on you,

217
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,281
which just so happened to include your pants.

218
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,749
Okay, that's true, but still,

219
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,800
You can't leave us here like this!

220
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,001
Let's go, Shiro. Roger.

221
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,848
Please, double or nothing!

222
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:56,356
I can't go back to the village in my undies.

223
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:59,156
Huh, seems like even bandits can't rob or kill you.

224
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,372
That's pretty convenient.

225
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,391
Nah, I bet they couldn't even if they tried.

226
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,811
Anyway.

227
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:09,253
Seems like everything comes
down to your skill at the game.

228
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,971
Hey, how about you speed this up?

229
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:23,251
Would you shut up! I'm thinking here!

230
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,190
I just need a second, okay?

231
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,019
Yeah, you can think all you
want, but it won't change your hand.

232
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,213
A gambling tournament to decide the next king?

233
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,787
It was the Old King's dying wish.

234
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:39,034
Apparently, he wanted the next ruler to
be humanity's greatest gambler or something.

235
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,481
Huh, so even the ruler is decided by a game.

236
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,090
The red‐headed girl is Stephanie Dola.

237
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,901
She's the granddaughter of the Former King,

238
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,650
but because of his will, she can't inherit the throne.

239
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:53,264
So she's entered the gambling tournament as well.

240
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:57,824
Hmm? Hey, Shiro, are you doing okay?

241
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,444
I'm good.

242
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,709
Huh? What's the matter?

243
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,173
Got a crush? Yeah, right.

244
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,662
I was just wondering if you
were going to enter this thing.

245
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,748
Who, me?

246
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,252
Oh, no, this is all I need right here, Kiddo.

247
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,746
And... besides...

248
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,881
Kurami over there is so strong that most
of the other players have already pulled out

249
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,719
before they had the chance to lose.

250
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,351
In other words, you're too scared to enter?

251
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:24,636
What'd you say?

252
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,489
So, as long as you don't actually lose to her,

253
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,262
you can go home and tell all your friends

254
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,494
whatever you want, am I right?

255
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:34,100
"Oh, I won because she was so pathetic. I let her go."

256
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,119
Well, aren't you something?

257
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:39,773
So let's play, Little Boy.

258
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,420
Sorry, but I don't play for fun.

259
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:43,071
You got to put something on the line...

260
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,827
like that bag of cash.

261
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:47,043
What? Do you know much is in here?

262
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:51,484
The deal is that we have to bet something
of equal value or it isn't official.

263
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,170
Pledge three, right? I suppose that's fair.

264
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,290
How's this?

265
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,928
You can do whatever you want with
the two of us. Our lives are yours.

266
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:01,463
Sell us, leave us to die, your choice.

267
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,392
Seriously?

268
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,405
Why not?

269
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,294
We'll play a single hand of poker.

270
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,100
Uh...

271
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,088
What do you say?

272
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:11,229
I'd love to show one of the locals how it's done.

273
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,571
Confident, huh?

274
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,422
Better watch that mouth of yours.

275
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:17,417
All right, have it your way.

276
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,024
I swear by the pledges.

277
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,143
I swear by the pledges.

278
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,222
Aschente!

279
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:34,738
Just a stupid redneck kid with
more confidence than experience.

280
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:39,528
A bluff like that might work on
the backward dolts in your village...

281
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,642
...but not here!

282
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,049
Sora.

283
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,597
Oh, no, run into some bad luck? Poor baby.

284
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:57,705
Yeah, I started the day with a 10,000‐meter
skydive, then walked forever under the blazing sun.

285
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,463
through some screwed‐up wilderness

286
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,019
definitely a bad day.

287
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,607
You did what now?

288
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:04,817
Just forget I said anything. You ready?

289
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,367
Ready... and waiting.

290
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,544
How about you?

291
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,394
Perhaps you'd like to draw the cards again?

292
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,017
No thanks, we're cool.

293
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:13,763
Oh.

294
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,871
In that case... too bad, kiddo!

295
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,831
Full house, Asshole!

296
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,358
Oh, you're right. That is too bad.

297
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:24,298
Huh?

298
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,081
Ro...

299
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,088
Royal...

300
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:33,084
s‐straight...

301
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,127
f‐f‐flush?!

302
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,392
Oh, no way! No friggin' way

303
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,140
Uh, yeah, way.

304
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:44,049
That's more than one in 6 million odds!

305
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,177
Yep, and you just got really unlucky.

306
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,941
But how?!

307
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:48,879
Pledge six

308
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,675
All bets must be upheld, am I right?

309
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:52,008
So pay up.

310
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:57,293
Just... who are you people?

311
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,398
Nobody special, just...

312
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,584
a new player in town.

313
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,802
Sora, that was mean.

314
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:13,689
You could have least tried to hide you were cheating.

315
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:16,429
Well, let's review pledge number eight, shall we?

316
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:19,298
Being caught cheating during a game means an instant loss.

317
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,516
In other words, if you're not caught, it's fine.

318
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:24,089
How much is in there?

319
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:24,836
No clue.

320
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,141
Well, just leave it to me.

321
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,049
Big Bro's an expert at negotiations.

322
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,712
I'll take a room. One bed will be just fine.

323
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:35,443
How many nights would this get me?

324
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:37,699
Just one night.

325
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,686
I'm really tired.

326
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:43,268
Come on, dude, You're gonna tell me
how many nights I can really stay here?

327
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:48,201
If you're trying to cheat someone, you should pay
more attention to your tone and where you're looking at.

328
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,706
Fine, two nights, then.

329
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,344
Man, you really are not good at this!

330
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,773
Listen, Pierre, if you're gonna lie, you
better be careful who you do it to, okay?

331
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,269
Okay, four nights, awesome.

333
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,424
Hey, kid, what's your name?

334
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,305
Hmm?

335
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,476
You can just leave it blank.

336
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,739
Sorry for the wait, Shiro.

337
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,599
That girl's about to lose it.

338
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:17,798
No kidding.

339
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:21,182
Doesn't look like anyone taught
her what "poker face" means,

340
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:22,549
unlike her opponent.

341
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:24,224
Hmm, she's cheating.

342
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,425
Think so, yeah.

343
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:27,460
But how?

344
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:30,597
It doesn't make sense.

345
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:34,046
Now wait a minute.

346
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:36,619
Something else is going on here.

347
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,752
Seriously?

348
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,192
You can fold whenever you want.

349
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,590
Would you please shut up already!

350
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,147
Just be quiet and focus on your own cards, all right?

351
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,424
Finally!

352
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,944
Listen, that girl is cheating.

353
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,081
Uh...

354
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,513
Hey, you still playing or what?

355
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:15,874
Huh? Oh, yes, of course I am.

356
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:19,981
Smartphones, DSPs, Tablet PC.

357
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,859
I got the battery and the solar
charger, cables, and everything.

358
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,314
Is this it?

359
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:29,866
Well, all things considered, after everything that
happened today, I'd say we're lucky to have this much.

360
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,598
I can't connect.

361
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:33,798
Figures.

362
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:37,477
This really is an honest‐to‐God fantasy world.

363
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,550
And the way she was cheating...

364
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,425
that was like its own fantasy, too.

365
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:46,518
Sora, can you beat real magic?

366
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,964
I guess that was a dumb question.

367
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,569
Hey, Shiro...

368
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:02,155
usually, in, like, comics and stuff when
the main characters end up in another world,

369
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:04,410
they try their best to find a way home, right?

370
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:15,452
But why would they want to go back
to a world if it's total... shit?

371
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,628
I thought the same thing.

372
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:36,148
Well, then it's settled.

373
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,846
Let the real game begin.

374
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:32,000
Shiro, as your brother, I'm really happy that
you love me so much, but let go of me for a second.

375
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,374
Who's there?

376
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,507
Come on, man, I paid up front already.

377
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:47,485
Would it be okay if I came in for a second?

378
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,504
We're gonna save the day?

379
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:52,912
Sure, why not, it'll be fun, right?
