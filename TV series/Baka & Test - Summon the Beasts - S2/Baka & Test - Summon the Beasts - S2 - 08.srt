1
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,625
- ( violin music playing )

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
- ( inaudible )

3
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,583
- ( inaudible )

4
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,000
- ( inaudible )

5
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,833
- ( Minami speaking
 in German accent )

6
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,791
I'M GOING TO JAPAN.

7
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,208
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,875
- Minami: IT WAS A
YEAR AGO TODAY,

9
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,791
DURING THE
ORIENTATION CEREMONY.

10
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,791
I'D JUST MOVED TO JAPAN
FROM GERMANY,

11
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,291
SO I WASN'T VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE LANGUAGE YET.

12
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,875
- NICE TO MEET YOU, AND I HOPE
YOU HAVE A GOOD YEAR.

13
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,750
- "IF I WANT TO FIT IN HERE,

14
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,541
I HAVE TO MAKE A GOOD
FIRST IMPRESSION.

15
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,791
I CAN'T GO UP THERE
AND EMBARRASS MYSELF.

16
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,125
NO GETTING NERVOUS
OR FIDGETY

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,291
AND MAKING EVERYONE THINK
I'M CRAZY."

18
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,958
THOSE WERE THE SORTS OF THINGS
GOING THROUGH MY HEAD

19
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,750
AS I WAITED MY TURN TO INTRODUCE
MYSELF TO THE CLASS.

20
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,791
- Fukuhara: NEXT WE HAVE
MINAMI SHIMADA.

21
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,458
- HELLO EVERYONE, MY NAME
IS MINAMI SHIMADA.

22
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,000
IT'S SO NICE TO
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

23
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,208
- ( students murmuring )

24
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,208
- WHAT HAPPENED?

25
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,291
DID I DO SOMETHING
STRANGE ALREADY?

26
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,666
- I'VE BEEN TOLD MISS SHIMADA IS
A RETURNEE STUDENT FROM GERMANY.

27
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,708
I IMAGINE IT'LL BE DIFFICULT
FOR HER TO ADJUST FOR A WHILE.

28
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,541
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS IN
JAPAN SHE'S STILL NOT USED TO,

29
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,333
SO DO YOUR BEST 
TO HELP HER OUT.

30
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,333
I KNOW IT SEEMS DIFFICULT,
BUT TAKE IT SLOW.

31
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,333
IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE
CHINESE KANJI,

32
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,625
START WITH ONE CHARACTER
AT A TIME.

33
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,250
- CHINESE?

34
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,416
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU
SO MUCH.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,125
EMBARRASSING.

36
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,250
WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST TELL ME I
WAS WRITING IT WRONG

37
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,375
INSTEAD OF STARING?

38
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,583
- Minami: MY DAD HAD TOLD ME
EVERYONE IN JAPAN WOULD BE NICE,

39
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,000
AND THAT I'D BE ABLE TO 
MAKE FRIENDS SUPER EASY.

40
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,541
BUT THAT ONE CLASS PROVED HIM
WRONG IN THIRTY SECONDS.

41
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,958
I FELT LIKE CRAP.

42
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,625
- HEY, MY NAME'S YUUJI SAKAMOTO.
REALLY GLAD TO BE HERE.

43
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,041
- THAT'S THE ONE EVERYONE CALLED
"THE DEMON" AT HIS OLD SCHOOL,

44
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,666
AND I CAN SEE WHY.

45
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,125
- DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE
TO SWITCH CLASSES?

46
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,083
- ( German accent ) HAVE I COME
TO A SCHOOL OF DELINQUENTS?

47
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,875
NO, NO, NO.

48
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,291
FATHER SAID
JAPAN IS VERY SAFE,

49
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,916
SO I AM SURE HE IS NOT AS
SCARY AS HE LOOKS.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,208
- I'M HIDEYOSHI KINOSHITA.
IT'S NICE TO MEET ALL OF YOU.

51
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,875
- OH MY.  IS THIS GIRL
REALLY WEARING A BOY'S UNIFORM?

52
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,333
MAYBE SHE'S ONE OF THOSE GIRLS
WHO ISN'T INTO WEARING SKIRTS.

53
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,083
AND THAT IS OKAY.
IT'S NOT WEIRD AT ALL.

54
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,208
DAD SAID THERE IS NOTHING
STRANGE OR SCARY ABOUT JAPAN,

55
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,875
AND HE IS RIGHT.

56
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,666
- I'M KOUTA TSUCHIYA,
AND I TAKE PIC--

57
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,875
PICNIC LUNCHES.

58
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,333
I'M VERY GOOD AT STALKI--

59
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,625
UH, NOT GOOD AT ANYTHING.

60
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,333
- PLEASE WAIT, THERE IS
SOMETHING YOU DROPPED.

61
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,666
- FORGET WHAT YOU SAW
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

62
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,958
- OKAY, THAT WAS NOT CREEPY.

63
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,625
HE USES THAT CAMERA
TO RECORD THE CLASSES.

64
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,875
NOTHING STRANGE.
JUST LIKE FATHER SAID.

65
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,916
- AND NOW STRAIGHT FROM
NAGATSUI JUNIOR HIGH,

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,125
THE ONE AND ONLY,
AKIHISA YOSHII!

67
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,333
( laughs )

68
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,708
- THAT KID IS STRANGE.

69
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,583
THEY'RE ALL FREAKS!

70
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,666
FATHER LIED TO ME!

71
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,083
- ( students chattering )

72
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,500
- YOU'RE A RETURNEE STUDENT?
THAT'S SO COOL.

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,583
- HEY, WHEN DID YOU GET BACK
TO JAPAN?

74
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,666
- WERE YOU BORN IN GERMANY?

75
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,500
- Minami: LIKE THEY'D NEVER
SEEN A RETURNEE STUDENT.

76
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,916
EITHER THEY WERE
HONESTLY INTERESTED

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,458
OR TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

78
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
- ARE YOU, LIKE,
REALLY GOOD AT GERMAN?

79
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,166
- ARE YOU GONNA JOIN A CLUB
AT THIS SCHOOL?

80
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,125
- DID YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND
ON THE OTHER SIDE?!

81
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,333
- ( German accent )
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

82
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,708
THEY'RE ALL TALKING SO FAST,

83
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,958
I CAN BARELY PICK
UP A FEW WORDS.

84
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,166
I DON'T REMEMBER IF IT'S
"PLEASE SLOW DOWN"

85
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,041
OR "PLEASE BE QUIET."

86
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,375
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT CATS ARE?

87
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,916
- WHAT DO PEOPLE EAT OVER THERE?

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,041
- WHAT SIZE BRA DO YOU WEAR?

89
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,166
- WAIT A MINUTE.

90
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,583
WHAT DID THAT GIRL SAY
THIS MORNING

91
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,583
THAT MADE THOSE GUYS BACK UP?

92
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,041
IT WAS JUST ONE PHRASE.

93
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,500
OH, YAH.
I REMEMBER NOW.

94
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,458
DA...
- All: DA?

95
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,375
- DAMN STUPID PIGS.
SHUT YOUR FAT TRAPS.

96
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,791
- All: UH...

97
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,666
- UH?

98
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,916
- Minami: NEEDLESS TO SAY,

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,208
THAT DID NOT MAKE A
GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

100
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,166
- ( students chattering )

101
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,000
- I ASKED DAD ABOUT IT LATER.

102
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,833
TURNS OUT IT'S NOT
THE NICEST THING TO SAY

103
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
TO PEOPLE YOU WANT
TO LIKE YOU.

104
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,041
AFTER THAT,
THEY WERE SCARED.

105
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,291
NONE OF THEM EVEN WANTED TO
COME CLOSE TO ME.

106
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,583
WELL, EXCEPT FOR ONE PERSON.

107
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,000
- EXCUSE ME.
SHIMADA, RIGHT?

108
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,791
- OH, HI!

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,791
- ( squeaking )

110
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,083
- ( sighs )
- WHAT?!  WHAT'D I DO?!

111
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,250
- ( German accent ) DO YOU ALL
THE TIME WEAR THOSE TO SCHOOL?

112
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,250
- YOU MEAN THE SAILOR SUIT?
NO, I OVERSLEPT.

113
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,833
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYMORE TIME.

114
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,666
I JUST GRABBED SOMETHING
AND RAN OUT.

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,125
- SO BEING IN A HURRY
MADE IT OKAY

116
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,375
TO DRESS UP
IN A SAILOR COSTUME?

117
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,375
IF THIS IS HOW
JAPANESE STUDENTS THINK,

118
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,125
I'LL NEVER FIGURE
THIS PLACE OUT.

119
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,625
- HEY, ARE YOU GONNA MOVE?

120
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,250
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA KEEP
BLOCKING THE EXIT

121
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,666
AND RAMBLING ON LIKE AN IDIOT?

122
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,500
- THERE IS NO NEED TO BE RUDE,
BUDDY!

123
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,833
SHIMADA'S JUST NOT USED TO
LIVING IN JAPAN YET, OKAY?

124
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,333
THAT DOESN'T MAKE HER AN IDIOT.

125
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
- OH, SHUT UP!
I WAS TALKING TO YOU, STUPID.

126
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,583
- OH, YEAH?  WELL, WHAT'S
SO STUPID ABOUT ME?!

127
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,375
- EVERYTHING!  AND WHOSE
DRESS ARE YOU WEARING?

128
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,375
- IT'S A SHIRT,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE PEOPLE

129
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,708
BY WHO THEY ARE
OR WHAT THEY'RE WEARING!

130
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,083
- HOW ELSE AM I GONNA
JUDGE THEM?

131
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,750
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE,
DUDE.

132
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,208
- WHATEVER!
YOU'RE STUPID TOO.

133
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,541
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES!
THIS MORNING!

134
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
THAT REALLY PRETTY GIRL
TRIED TO TALK TO YOU

135
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,000
AND YOU JUST IGNORED HER
LIKE A TURD.

136
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,416
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

137
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,833
AND WHY WERE YOU STARING
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

138
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,458
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU

139
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,208
FROM THE VERY FIRST TIME
I SAW YOUR STUPID ASS.

140
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,958
- I COULD SAY THE SAME TO YOU!

141
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,375
WHAT KIND OF DILL WEED CALLS
SOMEONE THEY JUST MET AN IDIOT?

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,750
ONLY A LUNATIC, THAT'S WHO!

143
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,125
- OH, NO WAY!

144
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,833
SAILOR SISSY BOY IS
CALLING ME CRAZY?

145
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,333
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THAT
CIRCUS MONKEY BACK HIS OUTFIT?

146
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,833
- I'M GOING TO GOOD-BYE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

147
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,208
- Minami: I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING THEY WERE SAYING,

148
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,500
BUT I GOT THE IDEA I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO AHEAD

149
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,875
AND AVOID THEM.

150
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,791
I WAS TRYING TO GET BACK TO
A NORMAL SCHOOL LIFE,

151
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,458
NOT CREATE MORE DRAMA
FOR MYSELF.

152
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,375
THINGS WERE GREAT IN GERMANY.

153
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,083
BUT HAZUKI, MY LITTLE SISTER?

154
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,583
SHE NEEDED ME.

155
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,458
SHE'S WHY I CAME BACK
TO JAPAN WITH DAD

156
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,000
WHEN HE GOT HIS JOB TRANSFER.

157
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,291
STILL, I WASN'T SURE
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

158
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,083
- ( German accent )
SO THE GIRLS' ROOM IS BLUE

159
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,708
AND THE BOYS' IS PINK HERE,
IS IT?

160
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,916
YES, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
VERY AWKWARD.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,375
- ( boys screaming )

162
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,750
- WHAT THE HELL?!
WHY ARE THERE GIRLS IN HERE?!

163
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,541
- Hideyoshi: WHERE?
I AM NOT A GIRL!

164
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,875
- COME RIGHT HERE,
KINOSHITA!

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,291
- NO!

166
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,041
I HAVE TO PEE REALLY BAD!

167
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,583
- ( both pant )

168
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,250
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DID I HAVE TO LEAVE?

169
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:07,875
- ( shouts in German )

170
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,000
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

171
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,708
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS,

172
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE WHO WALKED
INTO THE WRONG RESTROOM.

173
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,416
SHIMADA, WAIT!

174
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,750
- ( German accent )
I KNOW IT'S JUST THE FIRST DAY,

175
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,416
BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT JAPAN
IS FREAKING ME OUT.

176
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,041
I'M SURE IT'LL START TO MAKE
SENSE EVENTUALLY.

177
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,500
I JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT

178
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,916
AND PUT UP WITH A BIT
OF CRAZINESS UNTIL THEN.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,041
AT LEAST I GET TO SPEND
SOME MORE TIME WITH MY FAMILY.

180
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,083
- JUST A LITTLE HIGHER--
AAH!

181
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,291
- YES.

182
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,083
JAPAN DEFINITELY
FREAKS ME OUT.

183
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,250
- ( violin music playing )

184
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,958
- Minami: THERE WERE
ONLY STRANGE PEOPLE, EVER.

185
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,375
- ( inaudible )

186
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,375
( German accent )
FRIENDS.

187
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,083
- ( dog barking )

188
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,458
- Minami:
BAKA AND TEST!

189
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,208
CLASSES WERE IN FULL
SWING AFTER ABOUT A WEEK.

190
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,750
I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HOW
QUICKLY IT WAS MOVING.

191
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,958
MODERN JAPANESE CLASS WAS HARDER
THAN ANY OTHER CLASS I HAD.

192
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,958
EVERYONE WAS FLUENT,
AND I COULD BARELY FOLLOW ALONG.

193
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,833
WHEN THE TIME CAME TO
READ CLASSICS,

194
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,416
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH GIBBERISH.

195
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN HOW ABOUT YOSHII?

196
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,750
IN THIS CASE, CAN YOU TELL ME

197
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,875
WHAT THE CONJUGATION OF THE
WORD "HA-BERRY" IS?

198
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,208
- YES.
IT'S "HANNARI," SIR.

199
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,833
- NOW WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ME
A WORD IN THE KYOTO DIALECT

200
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,458
WHEN I ASKED YOU
FOR THE CONJUGATION

201
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,250
OF A CLASSIC JAPANESE WORD?

202
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,250
IT'S SO IRRELEVANT
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY REFRESHING.

203
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,166
- HUH?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

204
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,791
- ( laughter )

205
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,500
- ( chuckles )

206
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,708
HUH?

207
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,250
- THAT'S ALL.

208
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,083
MAKE SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
EVERYTHING WE DID TODAY

209
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,250
BEFORE OUR NEXT CLASS.

210
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,833
- ( German accent )
 IT'S FINALLY OVER.

211
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,833
- Minami: I MAY HAVE
BEEN FREED FROM THE JAWS

212
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,583
OF THE MOST BORING
CLASS EVER, BUT...

213
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,458
- HEY! WAIT UP, SHIMADA!
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED NOW?

214
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,666
- WHERE AM I GO?
- UM, YEAH, RIGHT.

215
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,625
- WHAT IS IT TO SAY
"TO GO HOME"?

216
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,291
- DID YOU SAY, "WHAT A SEA"?

217
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,166
- TO.  GO.  HOME!

218
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,125
- ( distorted ) OH, "HOME."
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

219
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,291
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SAYING SOMETHING

220
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,833
ABOUT "THE SEA" FOR A SEC.

221
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
I'M SORRY.  IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND YOU SOMETIMES.

222
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,375
GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR BEING CULTURED

223
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,208
AND STUDYING ABROAD, HUH?

224
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,916
YOU'RE LIKE A FOREIGNER NOW,
YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

225
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,875
- Minami: GETTING USED TO A
LANGUAGE AGAIN IS HARD ENOUGH

226
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,083
WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK IT 
AT LIGHTNING SPEED...

227
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,958
BUT I WAS SO STRESSED OUT
THAT I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE.

228
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,416
MY HEAD WAS POUNDING

229
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
AND MY BRAIN COULDN'T EVEN
PROCESS WHAT I WAS HEARING.

230
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,208
- BELIEVE ME, I WISH
I COULD DITCH THIS PLACE TOO.

231
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,583
I'M DYING OF BOREDOM HERE.

232
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,750
BUT WE STILL GOTTA GO BACK
TO HOMEROOM AFTER THIS.

233
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,333
- HUH?

234
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,625
- I GUESS YOU COULD SHORTEN IT

235
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,166
AND CALL IT HOME IF YOU WANTED.

236
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,500
THEN IT WOULD BE
TRUE FOR EVERYONE.

237
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,500
HOW WEIRD WOULD IT BE
IF WE ALL SAID

238
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,791
WE WERE GOING HOME...

239
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,791
- WHAT IS HE SMILING ABOUT?
IS IT REALLY THAT FUNNY THAT

240
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,416
I CAN'T SPEAK MY OWN LANGUAGE
VERY WELL?

241
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,125
- ( speaks French badly )

242
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,041
- HUH? 
- UH...

243
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,750
( speaks French badly )

244
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,583
- WHAT?

245
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,583
"TUNA SOMETHING,
SOMETHING MONAMIE"?

246
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,708
WHY IS HE TALKING ABOUT FISH?

247
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,541
HE'S JUST SPOUTING OFF
GIBBERISH.

248
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,666
AND ON TOP OF THAT, HE'S NOT
EVEN SAYING MY NAME RIGHT.

249
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,958
- ( speaks French badly )

250
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,125
- PLEASE STOP!
I DO NOT KNOW!

251
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,375
- UH--

252
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,041
- ( crying )

253
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

254
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,750
THIS IS SO HARD.

255
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,791
WHY DOESN'T ANYONE
UNDERSTAND ME?

256
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,416
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M NOT TRYING.

257
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,041
WHAT IF--

258
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,708
WHAT IF THEY ALL HATE ME NOW?

259
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,708
( inaudible )

260
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,958
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

261
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,375
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
COME BACK HERE.

262
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,416
I WON'T TO GO HOME.

263
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,666
( crying )

264
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,208
- Minami:
NOTHING HAD CHANGED.

265
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,625
I STILL COULDN'T FOLLOW ALONG
IN CLASS.

266
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,583
I REALLY WANTED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO,

267
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,416
BUT THAT'S HARD TO DO WHEN
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

268
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,416
IT WAS KIND OF A NIGHTMARE.

269
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,791
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY

270
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,375
ABOUT FIRST IMPRESSIONS
LASTING FOREVER.

271
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,416
I PROVED THAT THE DAY
I SHOWED THEM

272
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,333
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE
MY OWN NAME.

273
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,916
- ( German accent )
WAIT.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,041
I'M SURE I NEVER
CORRECTED THIS ONE MYSELF.

275
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,000
BUT WHO...

276
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,500
- SO CHECK IT OUT.

277
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,000
THE GUYS FROM AKEBONO JUNIOR
HIGH WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL

278
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,000
FOR GRUB FROM
THE SCHOOL STORE.  YOU IN?

279
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,625
- HECK YEAH, I'M IN!

280
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,458
I HAVE, LIKE,
NOTHING FOR A FOOD BUDGET.

281
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,083
- I'M IN TOO.

282
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,541
- WOULD YOU MIND
IF I JOINED YOU GUYS?

283
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,750
PLAYING SOME BALL
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

284
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,500
- THAT'S WEIRD.
WHEN DID THEY BECOME SO CLOSE?

285
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,291
- Hideyoshi: UH, I DON'T KNOW.
- Akihisa: I GOT THIS.

286
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,166
( speaks French badly )

287
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,916
AM I SAYING IT RIGHT?

288
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,958
( speaks French badly )

289
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,125
- WHAT IS WITH HIM?

290
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,833
WHY DOES HE KEEP TALKING TO ME
IN GIBBERISH?

291
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,041
NOW HE IS JUST
MAKING FUN OF ME.

292
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,041
THE LEAST HE COULD DO IS
GET MY NAME RIGHT.

293
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,791
MINAMI, NOT MONAMI, JERK.

294
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,583
IF YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM,

295
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,708
WHY TRY SO HARD TO UPSET ME?

296
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,500
- ( speaks French badly )

297
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,291
<i>TU NE VOUDRAIS--</i>

298
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,833
- ( speaks German )

299
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,958
- YOU WANT TO SHAVE FUR
OFF A BEAST?

300
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,958
- I SAY...

301
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,833
- WHAT A "SHE-MAN" YOU ARE?

302
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,500
AS IN-- WAIT.

303
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,416
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE A DUDE?!

304
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,875
OH, THAT'S COOL, I GUESS.

305
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,291
- THIS BOY IS
THE BIGGEST IDIOT ON EARTH!

306
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,916
- THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE
 ABOUT YOU BEING A SHITTY GUY.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
GUESS YOU PISSED HER OFF, MAN.

308
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,125
- OH, REALLY?

309
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,166
- YEAH.  YOU THOUGHT A GIRL
WAS ACTUALLY TELLING YOU

310
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,250
SHE WAS A GUY,
AND DIDN'T EVEN QUESTION IT?

311
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,666
THAT'S HARSH, BRO.
- I AM SO SORRY, SHIMADA!

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,666
I DIDN'T MEAN IT,
AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

313
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,333
WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR CHEST
IS FREAKISHLY FLAT

314
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,791
OR THAT MY ELBOWS ARE
BEING TORN OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS!

315
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,000
- I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING THEY'RE SAYING,

316
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,208
BUT I'M CERTAIN
I HEARD "FLAT-CHESTED."

317
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO HIM?

318
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,458
YOU ARE A VERY BIG SHIT MAN!

319
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,125
I HATE THIS.

320
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,708
I HATE IT HERE.

321
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,583
I WISH I NEVER MOVED.

322
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,666
- HEY, SHIMADA.

323
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,416
JUST WANTED TO SAY I DON'T
KNOW THAT IDIOT VERY WELL,

324
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,375
BUT I THINK
HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT.

325
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,958
AND I ALSO THINK

326
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,666
THAT YOU MIGHT BE FREAKING OUT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

327
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,250
- ME?  WHY?

328
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,750
- I KNOW HE ACTS WEIRD
 WHEN HE TALKS TO YOU,

329
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,125
BUT WHAT HE'S SAYING IS NICE.

330
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,208
- SO THAT'S THE WORD
FOR "IDIOT."

331
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,000
THAT'LL BE USEFUL AROUND HERE.

332
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,125
( speaks French )

333
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,416
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

334
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,583
HE'S PROBABLY TRYING TO
CONFUSE ME SO I'LL LOOK STUPID.

335
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,000
AS SOON AS I FIND IT,
I'LL SAY SOMETHING

336
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,541
JUST AS RUDE BACK.

337
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,250
- ( inaudible )

338
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,666
- <i>"TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS.</i>
<i>TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS..."</i>

339
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,166
WHERE IS IT?

340
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,666
UGH, THIS IS MAKING
MY BRAIN HURT.

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,875
WHY CAN'T I FIND IT?

342
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,500
EVEN IF HE'S USING SLANG,
SOMETHING SHOULD'VE POPPED UP.

343
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,875
AND DOES HE REALLY NOT KNOW
MY NAME BY NOW

344
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,333
OR IS HE CALLING ME "MONAMI"
JUST TO BE ANNOYING?

345
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,708
WAIT A MINUTE.

346
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,166
- ( violin music playing )

347
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,625
- ( gasps )

348
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,416
HERE IT IS.

349
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,375
FRANCE.

350
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,375
<i>"TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS</i>
<i>DEVENIR MON AMIE."</i>

351
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,125
SO IT ISN'T IN JAPANESE.

352
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,541
I BET HE WAS TRYING TO LOOK UP
SOMETHING IN GERMAN,

353
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,125
BUT FOUND IT IN FRENCH
ON ACCIDENT.

354
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,833
WOW.
HE REALLY IS AN IDIOT.

355
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,666
- Minami:
AFTER I FIGURED THAT PART OUT,

356
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,541
I COULDN'T FIND
A FRENCH-GERMAN DICTIONARY

357
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,333
ANYWHERE IN THE LIBRARY.

358
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,750
I HAD TO TRANSLATE THE WHOLE
THING INTO ENGLISH FIRST

359
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,000
AND THEN BACK INTO GERMAN.

360
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,708
I HAD NO IDEA IF
I WAS SPELLING IT RIGHT

361
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,333
OR EVEN PRONOUNCING IT
WELL ENOUGH TO GUESS.

362
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,875
- ( German accent )
THERE.

363
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,916
<i>"TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS"</i>
IS SECOND PERSON.

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,541
IT SHOULD MEAN "COULD YOU."

365
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,541
<i>"DEVENIR"</i> IS "BECOME."

366
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,958
HE WAS SAYING <i>"MON AMIE,"</i>
 NOT "MINAMI."

367
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,375
AND <i>"MON AMIE"</i>
MEANS "MY FRIEND."

368
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,000
SO IF I PUT IT ALL TOGETHER,
IT MEANS...

369
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:38,333
"COULD YOU BECOME MY FRIEND?"

370
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,250
- <i>TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS</i>
<i>DEVENIR MON AMIE?</i>

371
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,083
<i>TU NE VOUDRAIS PAS</i>
<i>DEVENIR MON AMIE.</i>

372
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,625
- HE HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS
TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT.

373
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,250
HE LEARNED THE WRONG LANGUAGE

374
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,708
FROM A COUNTRY
HE'S NEVER BEEN TO.

375
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,958
HE DOESN'T EVEN
WORK THAT HARD

376
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,916
FOR THE CLASSES IN
HIS OWN LANGUAGE.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,583
HE'S NOT THAT SMART...

378
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,875
BUT HE TRIED.

379
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,333
HE TRIED SO HARD.

380
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,916
COULD YOU BECOME MY--

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,166
MY FRIEND?!

382
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,375
OH, THAT IS SUCH A NICE WORDS!

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,416
I COULD.

384
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,458
GOOD MORNING, YOSHII!
HOW ARE YOU?

385
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,750
- UH, MORNING, SHIMADA.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

386
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,125
WHOA.  HI.
WHAT'S UP, YOU ALL RIGHT?

387
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,625
- I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
- UH, 'KAY?

388
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,208
- WHAT A SHIT--

389
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,041
- WHAT'D I DO NOW?

390
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,791
I'M SO SORRY.

391
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,000
DID I DO SOMETHING 
TO UPSET YOU AGAIN?

392
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
- NO, I AM NOT MAD!

393
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,416
HOW DO YOU SAY...

394
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,916
"YOU WERE NOT A SHIT PERSON."
YOU SEE...

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,875
I WAS.

396
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

397
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,791
- Fukuhara:
QUESTION NUMBER NINE:

398
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,208
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE ACTIONS
BY GROUPS THAT REACH OUT

399
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,333
TO POLITICIANS
IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE POLICIES?

400
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,333
- Minami: FLIRTING?
- WHO'S YOUR DADDY?

401
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,958
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME:
ME, ROMANCE

402
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,208
AND NEGOTIATION SKILLS.

403
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,125
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
