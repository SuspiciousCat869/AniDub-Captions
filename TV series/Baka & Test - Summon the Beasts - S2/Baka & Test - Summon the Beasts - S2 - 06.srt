1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,416
- Fukuhara:
TODAY IS THE SECOND DAY

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,791
OF FUMIZUKI ACADEMY'S
ACADEMIC TRA--

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,666
HEY, I WASN'T FINISHED YET.
- ( singing in Japanese )

4
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,416
- Fukuhara:
AT THE ACADEMIC CAMP,

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,250
CLASSES "A" AND "F"
ARE TRAINING TOGETHER.

6
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,958
- YUUJI, YOU LIKE
STUDYING TOGETHER, DON'T YOU?

7
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,208
- SHOUKO, YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT YOUR SEAT, DON'T YOU?

8
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,750
- SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE
LAME STUDY HALL AT CAMP, ANYWAY?

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,750
AREN'T WE GONNA HAVE
REGULAR CLASSES?

10
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,375
- NO, WHY WOULD WE?

11
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,083
UNLESS YOU CAN MIRACULOUSLY
UNDERSTAND CLASS "A's" MATERIAL.

12
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,541
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH

13
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,875
IN YOUR FRIEND, FRIEND.

14
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,291
AFTER ALL, CLASS "F" AND "A"

15
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,791
AREN'T REALLY
ALL THAT DIFFERENT TO ME.

16
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,375
- YEAH, WELL,
COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,416
- MAINLY 'CAUSE I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND EITHER ONE. 

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,083
- HOW COULD I NOT
HAVE SEEN THAT COMING?

19
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,500
- DID THEY NOT TELL YOU
THE REASON WE'RE HERE?

20
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,083
THEY'RE TRYING TO MOTIVATE
ALL THE DIFFERENT CLASSES.

21
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,000
- IF THEY MAKE EVERYONE STUDY
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER,

22
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,041
SUPPOSEDLY, CLASS "F"
IS GONNA BE INSPIRED 

23
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,708
TO TRY TO BE MORE
LIKE CLASS "A."

24
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,875
AND CLASS "A" WILL SEE THAT
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LOSERS,

25
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,333
LIKE WE ARE.

26
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,916
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THOSE "A" GUYS,

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,833
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS PLAN
WILL WORK ON OUR CLASS,

28
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,250
LIKE AT ALL.
- SHOUKO.

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,166
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE.

30
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,708
HEY, GUYS, I THINK I'M GONNA
STUDY IN HERE WITH YOU.

31
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,583
- IT'S AIKO KUDOU.

32
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
- WHAT'S UP, CREEPERS?
HOW WAS LAST NIGHT?

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,500
I HEARD YOU PERVS TRIED
TO PEEK IN THE GIRL'S BATHROOM.

34
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,208
IF YOU WANTED TO
SEE IT SO BADLY,

35
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,416
YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD ME.

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,708
ARE YOU STILL UP FOR IT?

37
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,500
I'LL LET YOU SEE
MY UNDERWEAR RIGHT NOW.

38
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,208
- WHAT? YOU WHAT?

39
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,708
- Shouko: I DON'T THINK SO.
- ( groans )

40
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,000
- KOUTA, ARE YOU
FEELING SICK OR SOMETHING?

41
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,833
YOU LOVE THIS.
I'M TALKING PANTIES.

42
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,500
PANTIES ON A GIRL, YOU KNOW.

43
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,375
I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
LOSING MY MIND OVER THIS, CAN I?

44
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,875
- DON'T LET HER 
GET TO YOU, AKI.

45
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,000
SHE'S WEARING LEGGINGS
UNDER THAT SKIRT.

46
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,375
- WHAT?! AIKO, YOU MONSTER.

47
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,541
HOW COULD YOU BE SO HEARTLESS?

48
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,041
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT, BOYS.

49
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,458
BUT I STILL HAVE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE.

50
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,791
- LIKE WHAT?
- IT'S A MINI-RECORDER, RIGHT?

51
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,875
- Aki: Kouta, are you
feeling sick or something?

52
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,208
- COOL, HUH? YOU CAN HAVE
A LOT OF FUN WITH THESE. 

53
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
- Aki: I love-- Aiko--

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,083
I'm losing my mind over--
a girl.

55
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,041
- ( gasps )

56
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,500
- YEAH, THAT IS PRETTY FUN,
ISN'T IT, MIZUKI?

57
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,958
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
HAD MORE FUN THAN THIS MOMENT.

58
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,041
- OH, BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING?

59
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,125
- OF COURSE.
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

60
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,083
- YOU SHOULD RUN NOW.
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK

61
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,500
WITH MORE STUFF
TO TORTURE YOU WITH.

62
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,208
YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.  GO!

63
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,041
- I DON'T GET IT, HIDEYOSHI.
I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG.

64
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,458
- HEY, AKI, LISTEN.
- HEY, YUUJI.

65
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,375
- WE NEED TO FACE
THE POSSIBILITY

66
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,750
THAT AIKO IS THE WIRETAPPER.

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,375
- GOOD POINT.  SHE'S GOT
MAD SKILLS ON THAT RECORDER.

68
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,083
- AKIHISA, IT'S UP TO YOU TO
FIND OUT IF SHE'S THE CULPRIT.

69
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,125
- UNDERSTOOD.

70
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,166
I HAVE A QUESTION.

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,458
- AWESOME, ASK AWAY.

72
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,666
- ARE YOU--

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,375
WAIT, IF I JUST WHIP OUT

74
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,708
"ARE YOU THE BLACKMAILER,"

75
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,083
SHE'S PROBABLY NOT
GONNA BE HONEST ABOUT IT.

76
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,416
- AM I WHAT?

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,166
- WHAT? I MEAN,
ARE YOU ESPECIALLY--

78
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,958
- ESPECIALLY?
- THINK, AKI.

79
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,416
YOU CAN DO THIS.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
LET'S SEE,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

81
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,166
WITH A BURN MARK ON THEIR BUTT,
SO THERE'S THAT.

82
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,791
AAH!
- HMM?

83
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,000
- AIKO, I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULD SHOW ME YOUR BUTT.

84
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,083
THANK YOU.

85
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,625
- THAT'S SOME SMOOTH
TALKING THERE.

86
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,583
- YOU ARE THE MAN, MY FRIEND.
- WAY TO PUT IT OUT THERE.

87
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,916
I BOW BEFORE YOU.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,250
- Aki: Aiko, I'd appreciate it
if you would

89
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,791
show me your butt.
Thank you.

90
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,583
- THIS IS STARTING
TO GET EMBARRASSING.

91
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,583
- NOT HER FAULT.
SHE JUST RECORDED IT.

92
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,000
- PLEASE, AIKO, YOU HAVE
TO DELETE THAT ONE!

93
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,208
Please, Aiko, you have to--
show me your butt.

94
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,375
( screams )

95
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,416
- Minami: WOW, DID YOU
HEAR WHAT I HEARD?

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,250
- Mizuki: WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

97
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,791
- YOU KNOW, THE SOUND
OF A DEAD BOY

98
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,458
DIGGING AN EVEN
DEEPER HOLE FOR HIMSELF

99
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,125
THAN THE ONE HE'S ALREADY IN.
- OH, YES, I DID HEAR THAT.

100
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,958
AND SUCH A PERSON
CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE

101
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,583
WITHOUT THE PROPER PUNISHMENT.

102
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,125
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

103
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,708
LET ME EXPLAIN.
IT'S JUST THAT...

104
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,291
THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
- I love butt.

105
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,958
- IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
AIKO!

106
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,583
YOU'RE GONNA GET ME KILLED
IF YOU DON'T STOP.

107
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,208
- SERIOUSLY, AIKO,
STOP MESSING AROUND.

108
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,541
- HELP ME, KOUTA.
- ( laughs )

109
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,208
- DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL TAKE HER ON. 

110
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,458
- THANK, OLD BUDDY, OLD PAL.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

111
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,041
LISTEN TO ME.

112
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,625
YOU BOTH HEARD WRONG EARLIER.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAY

113
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,166
THIS WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
- I love butt.

114
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,000
- OH MY GOD!
- Especially Yuuji's butt.

115
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,541
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
KOUTA, YOUR NOT HELPING.

116
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,125
- AIKO KUDOU, YOU STILL
HAVE MUCH TO LEARN.

117
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,708
- NOT TOO BAD.  YOU'RE JUST
AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT YOU'D BE.

118
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,166
- AKIHISA, I WILL NEVER
LET YOU HAVE YUUJI.

119
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,333
- I DON'T WANT HIM THOUGH!
- AKI, TELL THE TRUTH.

120
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,791
DO YOU REALLY LIKE 
HIS BUTT THAT MUCH?

121
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,250
WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH MINE?
- I MEAN, I SORT OF

122
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,041
ALWAYS KNEW IT, BUT HEARING
THE WORDS OUT LOUD

123
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,125
BREAKS MY HEART.
- NO, GUYS, LISTEN!

124
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,250
I'M NOT INTO THAT
KIND OF THING, I SWEAR!

125
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,791
- YOU'RE NOT INTO IT?!

126
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,500
HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT A FAD.

127
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,500
- MIHARU? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

128
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,166
- I WANTED TO SEE YOU!
SO I SNUCK OUT OF CLASS "D"

129
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,958
AND CAME HERE!
I COULDN'T GO ANOTHER MINUTE

130
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,416
WITHOUT SEEING MY BABY.

131
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,208
- SUGAWA BARRIER!

132
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,916
- ( coo's, kisses )

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,625
OH! GROSS!
YOU MAKE ME SO SICK.

134
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,041
YOU STUPID, UGLY,
FILTHY PIG!

135
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,041
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO ME, DARLING?

136
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,833
ALL I WANT IS
TO LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER

137
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,208
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.
- FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME,

138
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,333
I AM NOT INTO GIRLS.
I DO NOT SWING THAT WAY.

139
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,458
- EXCUSE ME.  WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE STUDYING.

140
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,291
COULD YOU PLEASE TRY
AND KEEP IT DOWN?

141
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,541
- OH, SORRY, KUBO.

142
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,458
- ALSO, IN THIS DAY IN AGE,

143
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,625
MAKING FUN OF HOMOSEXUAL LOVE
SEEMS LESS THAN TOLERANT.

144
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,875
JUDGING INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE
WITHIN A SOCIETY

145
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,791
BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENCE
IN PREFERENCE IS UNNECESSARY.

146
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,166
A PERSON CAN'T HELP
WITH WHOM THEY FALL IN LOVE.

147
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,708
AND NO ONE SHOULD
ASSUME OTHERWISE.

148
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,125
IF YOU'RE MOCKING THEM,
YOU'RE MOCKING NATURE ITSELF.

149
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,041
- HE'S RIGHT, LOVE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT GENDER, BABY.

150
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,500
- LOVE MIGHT NOT,
BUT I SURE DO.

151
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,708
- LOVE CERTAINLY DOES NOT
CARE ABOUT GENDER.

152
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,208
NICE.

153
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,666
- OKAY, I'M FEELING
KIND OF AWKWARD.

154
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,958
- LOVE DOES NOT CARE
ABOUT GENDER.

155
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,333
I SEE.
- WHY DO YOU KEEP

156
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,875
LOOKING AT ME AND
YUUJI LIKE THAT?!

157
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,833
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
FOR THE LAST FRICKIN' TIME,

158
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,166
I NEVER SAID ANY OF THAT...
- I love Hideyoshi.

159
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,958
- ...STUFF YOU HEARD.  STOP!
DAMN IT!

160
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,250
- OH, AKIHISA, I REALLY DON'T
KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT.

161
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,666
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.
HIDEYOSHI, YOUR NAME WAS...

162
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,000
ON THAT MINI-RECORDER THINGY.
- Butt is what I...

163
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,166
especially love, Kubo.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

164
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,833
( cries )
- Show me your butt, Kubo.

165
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,666
Show me your butt.
I love Kubo.

166
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,541
Kubo, show me your butt.

167
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,333
I love Kubo.
- WELL, THIS IS UNEXPECTED.

168
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,125
NOT THAT I DON'T PROFOUNDLY
APPRECIATE IT OF COURSE.

169
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,208
- Fukuhara: THIS IS HOW
RUMORS GET STARTED, KIDS.

170
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,666
- I THINK I'VE GOT IT.

171
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,000
I'M PRETTY SURE AIKO'S
THE ONE WHO'S BLACKMAILING US.

172
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,291
- IF SHE HANDLES EXTORTION

173
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,250
THE WAY SHE HANDLES
HER LITTLE RECORDER-THING,

174
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,958
THEN THAT MAY VERY
WELL BE THE CASE. 

175
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,708
- LET'S TAKE HER DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

176
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,416
- WE ONLY GET ONE CHANCE.
WE DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP.

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
- RIGHT, BECAUSE IF WE DO,

178
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,500
THE ACTUAL BUTT-BURNED CULPRIT

179
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,458
COULD END UP BEING LOST
TO JUSTICE FOREVER.

180
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,291
- YEAH, AND ON TOP OF THAT,
SHE'LL KEEP BLACKMAILING YOU.

181
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
- UH-HUH, THIS IS DEFINITELY

182
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,541
A BETTER-SAFE-THAN-SORRY
SITUATION.

183
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,291
- SO WE CAN'T GO BARGING IN
UNLESS WE'RE 100% SURE.

184
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,791
I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

185
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,208
- IF ONLY WE COULD
SEE HER BOOTY,

186
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
WE COULD FIND OUT
IF SHE HAS THAT BURN MARK.

187
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
- I BET SHE GETS PISSED,
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST TRY

188
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,208
FLIPPING HER SKIRT UP?

189
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,708
- SHE'S WEARING LEGGINGS,
REMEMBER?

190
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,041
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

191
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,125
- AT THIS POINT,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

192
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,916
WE HAVE TO PEEK IN
ON THE GIRLS BATHING.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,458
- THIS IS GETTING
TO BE A THEME.

194
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,041
- HOW DO WE PEEK, THOUGH?

195
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,041
WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD PLAN
BECAUSE THOSE GUARDS

196
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,916
ARE GONNA DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET IN OUR WAY.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
- Hideyoshi: WELL, THAT
HALLWAY'S A STRAIGHT SHOT.

198
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,750
A FRONTAL ATTACK
IS OUR ONLY OPTION,

199
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,541
UNLESS YOU KNOW OF
ANOTHER WAY IN THERE.

200
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,583
- Yuuji: OH, THERE'S
ALWAYS ANOTHER WAY. 

201
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,083
THE FRONT IS JUST
GONNA BE THE EASIEST.

202
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,166
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
A STRONG FORCE

203
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,791
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH.

204
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,916
- YOU MEAN, WE NEED
REINFORCEMENTS?

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- Aki: I'M ON IT.

206
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,958
- ( door opens )
- FELLAS, WHAT DO WANT FROM US?

207
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,666
- WELCOME, EVERYONE.

208
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,125
- SIMPLE, SUGAWA.
FELLOW CLASS "F"-ERS,

209
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,375
WE HAVE A LITTLE PROPOSITION
TO MAKE TO YOU.

210
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,666
- PROPO-- WHAT?

211
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,833
- I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO DO ANYTHING.

212
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:08,916
- YEAH, I'M KIND
OF UP FOR NOTHING.

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,625
- REALLY?
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED

214
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
IN WATCHING THE GIRLS
TAKE A BATH?

215
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,333
- WE NEVER SAID THAT.
KEEP TALKING.

216
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,708
- LAST NIGHT, WE TRIED
PEEKING ON THE GIRLS

217
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,291
WHILE THEY WERE
IN THEIR BATHROOM,

218
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,916
BUT A COUPLE OF
JERK-ASS TEACHERS

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,291
THAT WERE GUARDING THEM
AMBUSHED US

220
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,583
AND RUINED EVERYTHING.
- SO, WHAT NOW?

221
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,416
- WE'RE MAKING
ANOTHER ATTACK TONIGHT.

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
YOU'RE JOB, IF YOU
CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT,

223
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,333
IS TO ELIMINATE
THE GUARD IN QUESTION.

224
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,500
AFTER THAT, YOUR REWARD

225
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,750
WILL BE THE CHANCE
TO SEE UTOPIA.

226
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,208
- WE'RE IN!

227
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,500
- ALL RIGHT, KOUTA. 
WHAT TIME ARE WE AT?

228
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,375
- IT'S CURRENTLY 20:10.
ABOUT 10 MINUTES HAVE PASSED

229
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
SINCE THE TARGETED LADIES
FROM CLASS "A"

230
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,208
STARTED GETTING 
THEIR LATHER ON.

231
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,833
- THIS IS PERFECT TIMING, MEN.

232
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,958
WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP 
INTO FOUR GROUPS NOW.

233
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,458
GROUP "A," FOLLOW ME.
- "B."

234
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,208
- GROUP "B," FOLLOW AKI.
- "C."

235
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,625
- GROUP "C," FOLLOW HIDEYOSHI.
- "D."

236
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,416
- AND GROUP "D,"
FOLLOW KOUTA DIRECTIONS.

237
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,916
UNDERSTOOD?
- ROGER THAT.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,875
- LISTEN UP!
FINALLY, BROTHERS,

239
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,041
THIS IS OUR TIME,

240
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,875
OUR TIME TO REACH UTOPIA.

241
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,916
NO MATTER WHAT
MAY GET IN YOUR WAY,

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,875
YOU MUST NOT
ALLOW IT TO STOP YOU.

243
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,625
USE EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

244
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,625
GODS AND DEMONS ARE MORTAL TOO.
WE WILL SLAY THEM.

245
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,416
WE'RE ABOUT TO
CHANGE THE FUTURE, MEN.

246
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,291
AND NOTHING
IS GONNA STOP US.

247
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,625
- I WAS QUITE FIRM
WITH THEM YESTERDAY.

248
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,916
SURELY, THEY WON'T TRY
ANYTHING AGAIN TODAY. 

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
- ( running footsteps )
- HMM?

250
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,000
- ( roaring )

251
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,333
- APPARENTLY, THIS PACK
OF PERVERTS IS PERSISTENT.

252
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,583
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.

253
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,875
SUMMON!

254
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:33,875
- ( grunts )

255
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,958
- YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
- SUMMON.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,375
- Group C: SUMMON!

257
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,291
- BAD NEWS. 
HIDEYOSHI AND GROUP "C"

258
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,791
HAVE ALL BEEN STOPPED
BY MR. FUSE.

259
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
- THIS IS THE PERFECT
CHANCE TO PASS THROUGH.

260
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,000
FUSE IS DISTRACTED.

261
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,625
HEADS IN THE GAME, GUYS!
- YEAH!

262
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,625
- ALL TOGETHER, 
ATTACK THE FUSE!

263
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,583
- ( shouting )

264
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,541
- Aki: NOW, FORWARD HO!
- Fuse: STOP RIGHT THERE, YOSHI!

265
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,708
- IN YOUR FACE, SUCKA!
- Class F: IN YOUR FACE!

266
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,291
- NOT ANOTHER STEP!
YOU GUYS MAKE ME SICK.

267
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,125
GUYS AREN'T ALLOWED
PAST THIS POINT.

268
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,958
GO BACK TO YOUR GRODY,
GROSS PIGSTY WHERE YOU BELONG.

269
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,583
- AKIHISA, THEY'VE
GOT MORE PEOPLE

270
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,166
AND THEY'RE SMARTER THAN US.
- I'M ASKING NICELY.

271
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,333
OUT OF OUR WAY.

272
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,500
- AND PUT MY PRINCESS'S

273
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,250
FLAT CHEST ON DISPLAY
FOR YOU TO SEE?

274
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,333
HELL TO THE NO!
- YOU'RE WRONG.

275
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,083
MINAMI'S FLATTER
THAN FLAT CHEST 

276
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,791
ISN'T WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
- YOU'RE LYING.

277
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,416
HER SUPER FLAT CHEST
HAS CAST A SPELL ON YOU.

278
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,583
BUT IF YOU MAKE ANOTHER MOVE,
THEN I'M GONNA FLATTEN YOU.

279
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,416
- BELIEVE ME.
HOWEVER FLAT,

280
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,000
A FLAT CHEST IS
JUST A FLAT CHEST.

281
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,166
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON

282
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,583
THAN MINAMI'S FLAT,
BOY-LIKE CHEST

283
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,166
LIKE HOW MY ELBOW'S ABOUT 
TO BE FUSED INTO MY SPINE!

284
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,708
- GO AHEAD, SAY IT AGAIN.
I DARE YOU.  ONE MORE TIME.

285
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,083
- HE'S PRACTICALLY BEGGING
FOR PUNISHMENT, ISN'T HE? 

286
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,916
- YOU CRACK ME UP, YOSHI.

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,375
WHAT EXACTLY DID
YOU WANT TO SEE?

288
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,083
KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPY?

289
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,250
IF IT WAS ME.
- Shouko: I DON'T THINK SO.

290
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,000
- ( groans )
- I WILL NOT PERMIT AN AFFAIR.

291
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,291
- DAMN IT, SHOUKO
IS EVEN HERE TO STOP US.

292
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,500
THIS IS BAD.

293
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,125
- IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE

294
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,541
THAT YOU CAME HERE
TO FIND THIS?

295
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,041
I FOUND A PREVIOUSLY 
UNFOUND HIDDEN CAMERA

296
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,666
THAT HAD BEEN LEFT IN
THE GIRL'S CHANGING ROOM.

297
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,583
I JUST STUMBLED ACROSS IT.

298
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,375
AND IT'S NOT MINE.
- CRAZY.

299
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
- SO THEN, WHAT ARE 
YOU THINKING, KOUTA?

300
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,708
SHALL WE DO THIS NOW?
- HELL, YEAH.

301
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,208
- ( laughs )

302
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,958
SUMMON!

303
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,083
- Aki: TELL ME YOU
GOT THIS, KOUTA?

304
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,458
- I'M ALL OVER IT.  GO!

305
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,541
- TIME FOR SOME
SENSITIVITY TRAINING!

306
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,583
- ( groans )

307
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,666
- I KNEW YOU WOULD
TRY THIS AGAIN,

308
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,541
YOU LITTLE IDIOTS.
- IRON MAN.

309
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,708
- DO WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH HIM
WITHOUT USING OUR AVATARS?

310
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,416
- NO WAY, WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

311
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,083
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
SOME SERIOUS COUNSELING, KID.

312
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,333
YOU HEAR ME, YOSHI?!

313
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,708
- CRAP, THIS IS WHERE I DIE.

314
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,041
- DON'T GIVE UP, MY BROTHER.

315
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,458
- SUGAWA!
- LET GO OF ME NOW.

316
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,666
- DUDE, YOU CAN'T LET YOURSELF
GET TAKEN OUT HERE.

317
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,416
YOU'RE A PROBATIONARY STUDENT.

318
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,541
YOUR AVATAR IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN TAKE OUT THE IRON MAN.

319
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,541
PLEASE, AKIHISA.

320
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,958
RUN AWAY FOR NOW.
LIVE TO TELL THE TALE.

321
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,125
- WE'RE DONE LISTENING TO YOU.

322
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,416
- ( groans )
- YOU MONSTER!

323
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,416
SUGAWA!
- Boy #1: SUMMON!

324
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
- Boy #2: SUMMON!
- Boy #3: SUMMON!

325
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,500
- Boy #4: SUMMON!
- Boy #5: SUMMON!

326
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,208
- Boy #6: SUMMON!

327
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,208
- BACK UP AKIHISA'S WITHDRAWAL.

328
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,916
- CLEAR A PATH
FOR HIM TO ESCAPE.

329
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,416
- RUN, YOSHI,
AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

330
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,416
- YOU GUYS.
- ( grunts )

331
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,125
- YOSHI'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

332
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,708
PROTECT HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

333
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,000
- ( guys cheer )
- GO, YOSHI.

334
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,541
RUN.

335
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,958
( screams )

336
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,708
- ( screams continue )

337
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,833
- OKAY, I'M TRUSTING
IN MY FRIENDS.

338
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,625
I'LL SURVIVE.
I'M GONNA DO THIS.

339
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,625
I WON'T FAIL YOU.  I WON'T.

340
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,541
I'M SORRY, GUYS.
I'M SO SORRY.

341
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,750
( groans )

342
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,583
( cries )
I SWEAR IT.

343
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,083
I SWEAR I'LL REACH UTOPIA.

344
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
NOTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD
CAN STOP ME.

345
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,833
- ( chimes play )

346
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,041
- Fukuhara: Akihisa Yoshi
of class "F."

347
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,625
Please come to the
counseling office immediately.

348
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,208
- WOW, HOW COULD I
NOT SEE THAT COMING?

349
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,958
- IT'S MORNING ALREADY?
THAT SUCKS.

350
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,166
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
WENT TO SLEEP,

351
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,500
LIKE, FIVE MINUTES AGO.

352
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,666
( gasps )

353
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,416
( laughs )

354
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,666
IT WAS ONLY A DREAM!

355
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,500
SO WEIRD.

356
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,333
( gasps )

357
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,416
NO WAY
THAT'S GOING DOWN!

358
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,625
- ( screams )
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

359
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,625
IS YUUJI SLEEPING
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BED AGAIN?

360
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "AGAIN"?

361
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,791
- HE HAS A TENDENCY 
TO MOVE AROUND A LOT

362
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,041
WHILE HE'S SLEEPING.
AT DAWN, IT WAS ME. 

363
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,333
TURNED OVER AND
THERE HE WAS.

364
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,458
- YOU BASTARD!

365
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,916
HOW DARE YOU
TAKE AWAY INNOCENCE!

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,458
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!
- ( muffled screaming )

367
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,708
- OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
AIKO TOLD ME

368
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,958
SOMETHING INTERESTING YESTERDAY.
- OH, YEAH, WHAT?

369
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,625
- SHE SAID THERE'S STILL
A HIDDEN CAMERA

370
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,708
IN THE GIRL'S CHANGING ROOM?
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

371
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,250
- DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES
HER THE BLACKMAILER?

372
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,666
- I DON'T.  THAT WOULDN'T BE
A SMART MOVE.

373
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,083
WHY WOULD SHE
GO OUT OF HER WAY

374
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,541
TO MAKE HERSELF LOOK SUSPICIOUS
IF IT WAS REALLY HER?

375
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,791
- WE STILL HAVE TO
CHECK IT OUT THOUGH.

376
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,750
- EITHER WAY, IF WHAT 
SHE SAYS IS THE TRUTH,

377
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,416
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.
- WHY IS THAT?

378
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,583
- BECAUSE IF WE GET OUR
HANDS ON THAT HIDDEN CAMERA,

379
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,166
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE
THE GIRL'S CHANGING,

380
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,250
WHICH MEANS WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND THAT BURNED BUTT.

381
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,750
- GOOD THINKING. 
- I'M PRETTY SURE

382
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,750
I CAN FIND THAT BAD BOY
IN UNDER FIVE SECONDS.

383
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,208
- YEAH, ME TOO,
BUT THAT'S IF

384
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,958
THERE REALLY IS A CAMERA THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

385
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,166
- THE LAST ONE WAS FOUND BY
THOSE ANGRY CHICKS

386
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,666
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, RIGHT?

387
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,666
DOESN'T IT SEEM ODD
FOR A PERSON WHO'S SO GOOD

388
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,208
AT SNEAKING PICTURES
AND WIRETAPPING

389
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,000
TO LEAVE SOMETHING WHERE IT
COULD BE FOUND BY AMATEURS?

390
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,250
- A FALL-BACK PLAN.

391
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,625
- IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN.

392
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,541
THAT FIST SO-CALLED "HIDDEN"
CAMERA WAS JUST A DECOY.

393
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,208
IT'S WHOLE PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE
THE GIRL'S SUSPICIOUS OF US.

394
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,750
THE ONE AIKO FOUND
IN THE CHANGING ROOM

395
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,708
HAS GOT TO BE
THE MAIN CAMERA.

396
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,208
- AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO

397
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,625
IS GET THE NEW-FOUND
HIDDEN CAMERA

398
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,500
AND WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE.
- NO CAN DO.

399
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,750
IT'S LOCKED OUTSIDE OF
BATHING TIMES, REMEMBER?

400
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,750
- CAN'T WE JUST KEEP TRYING
THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN, THOUGH?

401
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,916
- THINK ABOUT IT, AKI.

402
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,750
DO YOU KNOW THE REASON
WE LOST YESTERDAY?

403
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,125
- I DON'T KNOW.

404
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,791
MAYBE BECAUSE HALF 
THE GIRLS WERE SENT

405
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
TO OFFENSIVELY DEFEND
THE BATHROOM.

406
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,250
- WHICH MEANS WE SHOULD DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

407
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,875
TO STRENGTHEN OUR FORCES, RIGHT?

408
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,125
WE NEED GUYS FROM THE OTHER
CLASSES TO HELP US.

409
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,375
- I COULD GET BEHIND THAT.

410
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,958
- AND GAINING A LITTLE
BIT OF MANPOWER

411
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,333
ISN'T THE ONLY REASON
WE NEED TO GET

412
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,208
THOSE CLASSES INVOLVED.

413
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,041
WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME
PROTECTION AFTER THIS THING.

414
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,500
- WE ARE?
- EVEN IF WE FIND THE CULPRIT,

415
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,458
EVEN IF WE DO SUCCEED IN PEEKING
IN ON THE GIRL'S CHANGING,

416
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,958
WE ARE GONNA BE PUNISHED
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS. 

417
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,083
- I GET IT.
IF THEY'RE A BUNCH OF US,

418
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,166
THEY WON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHO DID THE PEEKING.

419
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,666
- EXCEPT THEY ALREADY KNOW
THAT WE'RE BEHIND IT.

420
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,791
- Yuuji: FUMIZUKI ACADEMY
IS A PILOT SCHOOL

421
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,250
THAT'S GETTING
A LOT OF ATTENTION.

422
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
IF A SCANDAL HAPPENS,
THEY'LL HAVE TO EITHER PUNISH

423
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,625
THOSE INVOLVED OR HIDE THE FACT
THAT ANYTHING HAPPENED.

424
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,666
- SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS ATTACK IN A BIG GROUP

425
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,083
AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO PUNISH ANYONE.

426
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,833
GOOD CALL, YUUJI.

427
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,500
WHEN IT COMES TO
MAKING UP DIRTY PLANS,

428
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,958
YOU ARE THE MASTER.
- I JUST CALL IT

429
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,250
BEING RESOURCEFUL.

430
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,708
LET'S GET OUR COMRADES
TOGETHER BEFORE TONIGHT.

431
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,416
FOR CLASS "A," WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TRY KUBO.

432
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,583
AKI, THAT'S GONNA 
BE YOUR TERRITORY.

433
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,458
- IF ANYONE CAN DO IT,
YOU CAN.

434
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,291
- SO TRUE.
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

435
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,833
BUT, GUYS, WHY ME?

436
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,375
- USE THIS TO PROTECT YOURSELF,
JUST IN CASE.

437
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,250
- OKAY.

438
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,666
WHAT'S GOING ON, KUBO?
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

439
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,083
- I'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE.

440
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,750
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

441
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,125
- THANKS, BUT I'M GOOD HERE.

442
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,666
- YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO IS FINE.

443
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,833
- I HAVE A QUESTION.
IT'S MORE OF A FAVOR.

444
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,375
WILL YOU--
- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

445
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,833
- THAT WAS FAST.
- I APOLOGIZE.

446
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,833
I UNCHARACTERISTICALLY
LOST MY COOL.

447
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,916
NOW LET ME HEAR WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

448
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,041
- YEAH, SURE. WILL YOU HELP
US PEEK ON THE GIRLS?

449
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,875
- I WON'T HELP YOU!
- THAT WAS FAST.

450
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,375
WHY NOT?
- I JUST LOST RESPECT FOR YOU.

451
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,958
AMONG A GROUP OF PEOPLE,
THEY'RE RULES TO FOLLOW.

452
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,666
THIS FOLLOWING OF SAID RULES
IS HOW SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

453
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,083
IS FORMED, YOSHI.

454
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,375
BASICALLY PLANNING ON BREAKING
THOSE ESTABLISHED RULES

455
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,125
MEANS THAT YOU HAVE
NO RESPECT FOR SOCIETY

456
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,041
AND ARE UNFIT FOR IT.

457
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,000
IS THAT REALLY THE KIND
OF PERSON YOU WANT TO BE?

458
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,875
THAT BEING SAID,
TRYING TO LOOK AT GIRLS

459
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,125
WHILE THEY'RE BATHING
IS DISGUSTING

460
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,458
AND MAKES ME 
WANT TO PUKE.

461
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,750
- OH.

462
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,916
I FAILED.
I FAILED BIG TIME.

463
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,291
- FIGURES.  I'M GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY, THOUGH.

464
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,041
- OF COURSE I AM.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING DANGEROUS.

465
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,375
- SURE YOU DIDN'T.

466
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,625
SO SINCE CLASS
"A's" A BUST, 

467
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,125
LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH
THE OTHER CLASSES.

468
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,666
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU UP TO, LOSER?

469
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,416
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN?
WHAT WOULD I BE UP TO?

470
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,916
- I'M SO NOT GONNA
WASTE MY BREATH

471
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,541
TELLING YOU NOT TO
CAUSE ANYMORE TROUBLE,

472
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,791
BUT, YEAH, DON'T DO IT.

473
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,916
- PEEKING ON GIRLS WHILE
THEY BATHE IS SO CLICHE.

474
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,083
- WHAT?

475
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,083
- YOU'D JUST COMPARE ME
WITH EVERYONE ELSE

476
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,458
IF WE'RE ALL NAKED.

477
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,000
I CAN'T STUFF NOTHING.

478
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,375
AND THEY'RE FAR LESS PERKY
WHEN BRA-LESS.  IT'S TRAGIC.

479
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,666
- I NEVER IMAGINED
YOU'D TRY TO PEEK ON US.

480
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,958
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO GO ON A DIET.

481
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,916
THAT'S BEYOND
MEAN OF YOU, AKIHISA.

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,958
- WHAT I WANT TO SEE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 

483
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,125
- Yuuji's butt.
- IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING

484
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,125
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

485
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,458
STOP DOING THAT!

486
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,333
- Fukuhara: ONCE AGAIN,
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOWDOWN

487
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,291
HAS ARRI-- WHAT?
- SERIOUSLY, WE COULDN'T GET

488
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,375
ANYONE TO HELP US...
- Fukuhara: NOT AGAIN.

489
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,791
- BESIDES CLASS "D"
AND CLASS "E"?

490
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,541
- CLASS "B's" REP
IS KYOUJI NEMOTO.

491
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,375
SO THERE'S REALLY
NOT MUCH UNITY.

492
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,750
CLASS "C's" REP IS THAT
FREAKIN' HARD-ASS YUKA KOYAMA.

493
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,208
DUDE, I DON'T BLAME THOSE GUYS
FOR BEING TERRIFIED OF HER.

494
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,416
- STILL THOUGH,
IT'S BETTER THAN YESTERDAY.

495
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,791
THE GIRLS CAN ONLY SEND OUT
HALF OF THEIR GROUP AT A TIME

496
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,000
TO DEFEND WHILE 
THEY'RE BATHING.

497
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,333
AS LONG AS WE CAN
HOLD BACK THE TEACHERS,

498
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,416
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

499
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,875
- I'VE ALREADY LET
EACH CLASS KNOW

500
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,583
WHEN WE'RE PLANNING
TO START THE OPERATION

501
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,375
AND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.
- PERFECT.

502
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,708
LET'S GET THIS THING DONE.

503
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,875
- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM!
WE'RE TOO LATE.

504
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,250
THEY WERE WAITING TO AMBUSH US
IN THE DINING HALL.

505
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,250
- WHAT?!

506
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,291
- OUR FORCES ARE
CURRENTLY SPLIT UP

507
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,958
AND SCATTERED
AROUND EACH FLOOR.

508
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,916
- WHO FIGURED
THEY'D MOVE FIRST?

509
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,041
- THEY'RE LIKE MIND READERS.
- DAMN, I BET IT WAS SHOUKO.

510
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,458
- YEAH, SHE DOESN'T LIKE
YUUJI PEEKING ON ANYONE BUT HER.

511
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,500
- THERE'S NO TIME
FOR HESITATION NOW.

512
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,375
WE NEED TO REORGANIZE
OUR FORCES.

513
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,000
THEN WE'LL MAKE OUR MOVE.

514
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,000
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
PEEK ON US, LOSERS.

515
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,541
- WHY ARE THE GIRLS HERE?
- ( chatter, fighting )

516
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,166
- GUYS, CONCENTRATE ALL
YOUR ENERGY ON ONE POINT.

517
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,791
WE'LL BREAK THROUGH THERE.
LET'S GO.

518
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,708
- Guys: YEAH!
- YUUJI!

519
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,291
WE'VE GOT ENEMIES
AT THE FRONT.

520
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,541
- THEY PROBABLY SET TRAPS FOR US
THROUGHOUT THE HALLS.

521
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,750
SO STAY ON YOUR TOES.
BE READY FOR ANYTHING!

522
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,041
- YUUJI, WE'VE BEEN WAITING.

523
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,833
- SHOUKO, CRAP.

524
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,250
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

525
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,166
- I TOLD YOU I WOULD 
NOT PERMIT AN AFFAIR.

526
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,333
YOU IGNORED ME,
BUT YOUR BODY WON'T.

527
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,958
- YOU BOYS ARE IN NEED
OF SOME SERIOUS

528
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,708
MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL
COUNSELING.

529
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,750
- MISS TAKAHASHI,
THE YEAR-TWO HEAD TEACHER.

530
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,041
YUUJI, WITHDRAW!
- SORRY.

531
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,333
THAT IS SO
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

532
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,291
- AIKO! MR. OOSHIMA!

533
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,791
- YOU NEVER LEARN, DO YOU?

534
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
- AKIHISA, IF YOU WANTED
TO SEE IT THAT BAD,

535
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,666
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME?

536
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,875
WE COULD HAVE WORKED
SOMETHING OUT.

537
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,791
- NO, YOU DON'T FRIGHTEN ME.

538
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,416
I'LL FIGHT MY THROUGH
TILL THE END.

539
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,083
SUMMON!

540
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,166
- SUMMON!

541
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,791
- YO!

542
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
- HE'S FAST.

543
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,625
- ( screams )

544
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,375
WHAT? NO WAY!

545
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,666
- HER SCORE IS IN THE 7,000's?

546
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
- THAT'S HIGHER
THAN ANYONE.

547
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,958
- ( smirks )

548
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,333
- WHAT DO I DO?
- NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

549
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,291
WE'RE GOING AFTER THEM
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT

550
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,541
AND GRANTING NO MERCY.
- WE ARE?

551
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,958
- EVERYONE, LISTEN UP.
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

552
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,375
FORGET ABOUT THE PLAN.

553
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,833
DO WHATEVER COMES
NATURALLY TO YOU.

554
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,083
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

555
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,833
THINK USING YOUR HEART.
JUDGE USING YOUR BRAIN.

556
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,083
AND ULTIMATELY,
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

557
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,625
FROM HERE ON,
YOU GUYS CALL THE SHOTS.

558
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,375
ALL RIGHT, MAKE YOUR MOVE NOW.

559
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,083
- PLEASE FORGIVE US!

560
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,250
- ( gasps )

561
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,000
AREN'T THE FOUR OF YOU
GOING TO BEG FOR FORGIVENESS

562
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,291
LIKE YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS?

563
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,250
OR HAS YOUR PRIDE
GOTTEN THE BETTER OF YOU?

564
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,958
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
WE DON'T HAVE PRIDE.

565
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,458
WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE.
- HE'S RIGHT.

566
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,500
THIS ISN'T ABOUT US
BEING PROUD.

567
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,875
SOMEDAY, MAYBE YOU'LL 
BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND.

568
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,166
WE HAVE NO REASON TO 
APOLOGIZE HERE TODAY.

569
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,333
- WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE
HELP IS ON THE WAY?

570
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,750
- AKI'S WRONG.
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

571
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,541
- HELP ISN'T ON THE WAY.

572
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,833
BUT IT WOULDN'T
MATTER IF IT WAS.

573
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,041
- Fukuhara: THEY BOTH KNEW
THEY WERE DEALING WITH PEOPLE

574
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,375
WHO WOULD MAKE THEM SUFFER,

575
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,666
EVEN IF THEY GOT DOWN
ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES

576
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,041
AND BEGGED FOR FORGIVENESS.

577
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,416
ALTHOUGH, THIS IS THE THIRD
NIGHT OF THE TRAINING CAMP,

578
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,708
THE GUYS STILL HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT

579
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,708
WHO THEIR BURNED-BUTT
BLACKMAILER IS.

580
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,750
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?

581
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,291
WHAT WILL BECOME OF
AKIHISA AND YUUJI'S--

582
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,833
YOU'RE CUTTING
ME OFF AGAIN. 

583
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,916
- ( music plays )

584
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,916
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THIS?

585
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

586
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,625
- BAKA AND TEST.

587
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,750
- Fukuhara: QUESTION 7:

588
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,166
"WHAT DO YOU CALL PHYSICAL
AND MENTAL TORTURE

589
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,791
USED TO MAKE
A PERSON OBEY YOU?"

590
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,583
- Yuuji: I'M SORRY, SHOUKO!

591
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,125
- Fukuhara:
( hums wedding march )

592
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,625
- Aki: NEXT EPISODE, "ME,
PEEKING, AND FAR AWAY PARADISE."

593
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,375
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
