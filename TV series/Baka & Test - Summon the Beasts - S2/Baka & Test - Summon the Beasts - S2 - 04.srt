1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,166
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,208
YOU HAVE TO DRESS UP 
LIKE A GIRL IF I WIN.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,708
- ( chuckles )
YOU'RE PRETTY FUNNY SOMETIMES.

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,416
- WHAT'LL BE FUNNIER
IS WHEN I WIN

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,750
AND YOU'RE DRESSED UP
LIKE A GIRL.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,458
- OH, YOU.
SUCH A KIDDER.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,083
- I'M NOT KIDDING.
I REALLY WANT YOU

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,416
TO DO THIS FOR ME, AKI.
- THAT'S WEIRD.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,958
Akihisa: <i>HOW DO I ALWAYS END UP</i>
<i>IN THESE SITUATIONS?</i>

10
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,625
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,625
- Fukuhara: IT ALL BEGAN EXACTLY
ONE HOUR AND 15 SECONDS AGO.

13
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,333
- HEY, YUUJI,
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY "DOUBT IT"?

14
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,208
- WOW, YOU'RE A BRAVE ONE TODAY.

15
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,375
- SERIOUSLY.  EVEN AFTER
YOU LOST THE OTHER DAY

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,958
AND HAD TO BUY
ALL OF US BURGERS?

17
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,291
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

18
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,708
- I COULD GO FOR THAT.

19
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,041
- ( scoffs )
PLEASE.

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,166
I'M GETTING MY
REVENGE ON TODAY.

21
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,458
- WHAT REVENGE?

22
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,041
JUST GIVE ME YOUR WALLET.

23
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,333
THAT WAY, I CAN BUY
WHATEVER I WANT FOR LUNCH.

24
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,958
- DREAM ON.

25
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,125
SO, SAME RULES
AS BEFORE, RIGHT?

26
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,291
- Fukuhara: AND NOW,
CLASS F'S RULES

27
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,541
FOR THE GAME ENTITLED
"I DOUBT IT."

28
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,125
EACH PLAYER PLAYS
A CARD FACE DOWN.

29
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,708
- Akihisa: ACE.

30
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,083
- Fukuhara: THEY CALL OUT
THE CARD THEY PLAYED.

31
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,000
THE OTHER PLAYERS DECIDE
IF THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.

32
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,750
IF SOMEONE THINKS THEY'RE LYING,

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,250
THEY SHOW THIS BY SAYING--
- Yuuji: DOUBT IT.

34
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,916
- Fukuhara: IF THE PERSON
WHO PLAYED THE CARD WAS LYING,

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,416
THEY MUST COLLECT ALL THE CARDS
PREVIOUSLY PLAYED.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,916
IF THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,416
THE PERSON WHO CALLED
"DOUBT IT"

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,583
HAS TO COLLECT THE CARDS.

39
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,125
THIS CONTINUES UNTIL
ALL THE CARDS ARE PLAYED.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,166
- Akihisa: DOUBT IT.

41
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,958
( groans )

42
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,416
- Akihisa: DOUBT IT.

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,833
- Fukuhara: USUALLY,
THE FIRST PERSON TO 

44
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,166
GET RID OF ALL THEIR CARDS
WINS THE GAME.

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,000
- Kouta: DOUBT IT.

46
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,666
- All: THERE'S ALSO AN EXTRA
CLASS F SPECIAL RULE.

47
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,166
- Fukuhara:
I'M GETTING TO IT.

48
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
CLASS F HAS A SPECIAL RULE.

49
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,958
THE WINNER IS DETERMINED WHEN
A PLAYER IS LEFT WITH TWO CARDS.

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,791
- Akihisa: IT HELPS THE GAME
MOVE A LOT FASTER.

51
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,958
- Hideyoshi:
THE KEY IS TO MAKE SURE YOU GO

52
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,125
AS CLOSE TO LAST
AS POSSIBLE.

53
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,958
- NORMALLY, THE GAME STARTS
AT THE LOWEST NUMBER POSSIBLE,

54
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,625
BUT CLASS F PLAYERS
START WHEREVER THEY WANT.

55
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,375
- THINK HARD, DUDE. YOU COULD
BE DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE.

56
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,166
- Kouta: MM-HMM.

57
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,125
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M UP FIRST.

58
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,125
EVERYONE READY?
ACE.

59
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,833
- THAT MEANS I'M NEXT,
RIGHT?  TWO.

60
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,625
- THREE.
- OH, CRAP.

61
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,958
IT'S MY TURN.  FOUR--

62
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,625
- All: DOUBT IT.
- WHAT?!

63
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO
FINISH SAYING THE NUMBER.

64
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,541
- IT WAS OBVIOUS
YOU WERE LYING. 

65
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,958
- THE "OH, CRAP"
KIND OF GAVE YOU AWAY.

66
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,250
- PLUS YOU'RE NO GOOD
AT CARD GAMES.

67
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,541
- ( sighs )

68
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,708
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

69
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,500
I'M A MASTER AT
PLAYING CARDS. 

70
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,208
I LOST THAT HAND ON PURPOSE.
IT'S CALLED STRATEGY.

71
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,208
( gasps ) EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF YOU WAS LYING. 

72
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,541
THAT SUCKS!

73
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,208
- Fukuhara: TICK-TOCK.

74
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,250
- OKAY, THIS IS IT.
NO MORE SCREWING AROUND.

75
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
IT'S GO TIME.
- THREE.

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,791
- FOUR.
- ( chuckles )

77
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,708
ANOTHER FOUR ALREADY,
AKIHISA?

78
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,125
I DOUBT IT.

79
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,625
- IDIOT.  WHY DON'T YOU
SUCK ON THAT!

80
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,833
- NO WAY.  DID YOU JUST
HOLD ONTO THE FOUR

81
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,416
FROM THE LAST ROUND
OR SOMETHING?

82
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,583
- SO IT WAS A SET UP THEN?
- NOT BAD.

83
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041
- ( chuckles )

84
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,875
NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW

85
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,291
THAT I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
I HAD A FOUR THE FIRST TIME.

86
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,250
- Fukuhara: TICK-TOCK.

87
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,708
- ( sighs )

88
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,375
FINALLY DOWN TO SIX CARDS.

89
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,416
HIDEYOSHI'S ONLY
GOT FOUR LEFT.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,250
SO IT'S BETWEEN
HIM AND ME, I GUESS.

91
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,541
WHAT ARE THOSE TWO PLANNING?

92
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,291
- OH, GOOD.
I HAVE A SIX.

93
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,708
KOUTA, YOU'RE UP.
HAVE YOU GOT A SEVEN?

94
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,291
- SEVEN.

95
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,625
- ( stammers )
I MEANT TO SAY I DOUBT THAT.

96
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
- NICE MOVE.  HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE US PARANOID

97
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,458
SO WE'LL SAY DOUBT IT
WITHOUT THINKING.

98
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,583
OKAY, I-- HUH?

99
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,250
- HI, GUYS.  WHAT KIND OF
GAME ARE YOU PLAYING OVER THERE?

100
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,291
- OH, HEY, HIMEJI. WHAT ARE
YOU STILL DOING HERE?

101
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,458
- ONE OF MY TEACHERS
NEEDED HELP AFTER CLASS,

102
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,708
SO I STAYED.
I'M GLAD I DID TOO,

103
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,458
BECAUSE HE GAVE ME
THIS AS A REWARD. 

104
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,791
THEY LOOK REALLY YUMMY.

105
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,833
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO
TRY SOME?

106
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,750
- IT DOES LOOK GOOD,

107
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,166
BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF "I DOUBT IT."

108
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,583
HOW ABOUT AFTERWARDS?

109
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,333
WE'RE EACH BETTING THAT--
( gasps )

110
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,333
I SHOULDN'T SAY BETTING.
IT SOUNDS LIKE GAMBLING.

111
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,333
- HMM.
- MM.

112
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
- HMM.

113
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,333
- DID I SAY BETTING?
I DIDN'T MEAN BETTING.

114
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,083
I JUST MEANT THAT THE LOSER
GETS A PENALTY, THAT'S ALL.

115
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,375
- OH, A PENALTY? 
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

116
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,333
- OH, YOU KNOW.
- EVERY TIME YOU LOSE,

117
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,583
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
SOMETHING OFF.

118
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,333
- ( gasps )
LIKE CLOTHES?

119
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,166
- YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

120
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,500
- NO, AKIHISA.
PLEASE.

121
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,166
- ( squeals )

122
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
WHY?!  YOU GUYS
ARE SUCH PERVERTS.

123
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,000
- HOW ARE WE PERVERTS?

124
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,333
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
SEEING ANYTHING FORBIDDEN.

125
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,416
WE'RE ALL GUYS HERE.

126
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,958
- All: DOUBT IT.

127
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,416
- WHOA!  WHY ARE YOU
GIVING ME ALL THOSE CARDS?

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,958
I DIDN'T EVEN CALL ANYTHING.

129
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,208
- EVEN IF IT IS
JUST YOU GUYS, 

130
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,875
IT'S STILL INAPPROPRIATE.

131
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,375
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A CHOCOLATE PICNIC AND CHAT?

132
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:20,041
( gulps )
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

133
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,083
AMD STUFF.

134
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,625
- OKAY, FINE.  WE WILL.

135
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,375
BUT AFTER THIS GAME,
ALL RIGHT?

136
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,875
I'LL KICK THEIR TAILS
AS QUICK AS I CAN.

137
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,375
- UM, HIMEJI, YOU OKAY?

138
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,791
- RIGHT.
SO THIS IS AN EIGHT.

139
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,625
- NINE.

140
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,208
- THIS IS 10.
- JACK.

141
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,541
- QUEEN OF HEARTS.
- I DOUBT IT, HIDEYOSHI.

142
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,458
- ( sighs )
I GUESS THAT MEANS

143
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,375
YOU HAVE ALL THE QUEENS,
DON'T YOU?

144
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,208
OH WELL.
HEY, WE'RE ALL GUYS,

145
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,708
SO THIS ISN'T
A BIG DEAL RIGHT?

146
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,541
- ( both gasp )
- HERE IT GOES.

147
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,291
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU CHICKENING OUT? 

148
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,416
- ( giggles )

149
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

150
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
SILLY, YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP
AT SCHOOL,

151
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,666
GOOBER-PILE-FACE.

152
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,000
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

153
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,458
SNOOZERS ARE LOSERS.

154
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,250
GUESS I'M PLAYING FOR
HIDEYOSHI NOW,

155
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,083
SO WATCH OUT.
- THAT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD.

156
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,750
I MEAN, YOU WOULD
HAVE TO TAKE YOUR--

157
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,083
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.
YOU'VE GOT A MAN OVERBOARD.

158
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,833
- HE WON'T BE
OVERBOARD FOR LONG.

159
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,333
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

160
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,583
- HE'S A VERY VERY VERY
SLEEPY BOY.

161
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,291
- THE BOTTLE.  LOOK.

162
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,416
( grunts )

163
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,833
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

164
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,125
- IT LOOKS LIKE KOUTA'S
FEELING A LITTLE SLEEPY TOO.

165
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,791
- Akihisa: WHAT THE HECK
IS HAPPENING?

166
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,125
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING IS
SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH HIMEJI.

167
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOUGH.

168
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,208
IT'S LIKE SHE'S
POSSESSED OR SOMETHING.

169
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,500
WAIT, COULD IT BE?
HOLY CRAP.

170
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,041
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

171
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,708
HIDEYOSHI TRIED TO
TAKE HIS CLOTHES OFF

172
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,375
IN FRONT OF YOU, AKIHISA.

173
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,416
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'D
DO A THING LIKE THAT.

174
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,875
- Akihisa: THIS IS INSANE.
IT'S THOSE CHOCOLATES.

175
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,708
SHE'S DRUNK OFF
WHATEVER'S IN THEM.

176
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,166
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING
A SHARK FACE, AKIHISA?

177
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,041
- I'M JUST UPSET

178
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,208
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH PLAYERS ANYMORE.

179
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,375
LOOKS LIKE THE GAME'S OVER NOW.
- NO.

180
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,291
WE DON'T HAVE TO STOP
PLAYING THE GAME AT ALL.

181
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,875
WE STILL HAVE FOUR PLAYERS,

182
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,666
AND THAT'S ENOUGH, RIGHT?
- NO, WE DON'T.

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,875
- YES, WE DO.
- SHOUKO?!

184
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,625
WHEN THE "H'" DID YOU GET HERE?

185
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,416
- IF YOUR CLOTHES ARE TO BE
FORCEFULLY STRIPPED OFF OF YOU,

186
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,583
AS YOUR FIANCEE,
I SHOULD BE THERE.

187
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,041
- I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY

188
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,791
YOU CAN GET MORE WRONG INTO
ONE SENTENCE.

189
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,666
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE PLAY

190
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,166
BOYS TEAM VERSUS GIRLS?
- I LIKE THAT.

191
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,416
WE CAN FINISH
A LOT QUICKER THAT WAY TOO.

192
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,333
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- CAN'T HELP IT, DUDE.

193
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,500
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH QUICKLY AND BOUNCE.

194
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,666
- YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T
LET THEM TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF.

195
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,250
THAT'S WRONG.
- WE WON'T.

196
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,666
- THEY'RE GONNA START
FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE,

197
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,750
AND WANT TO STOP PLAYING.
- I GET YOU.

198
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,958
LET'S DO THIS THING.

199
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,500
- ( both groan )

200
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,333
- YOU CAN'T JUST
TAKE OFF A SOCK, AKI.

201
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,458
IT'S NOT FAIR.

202
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,916
- YUUJI, I EXPECTED
MORE OUT OF YOU.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,208
- LET'S STOP PLAYING.
YOU WIN.

204
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,625
- OH MY GOSH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE JUST STARTED.

205
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,166
- YEAH, BUT SHOUKO'S
REALLY TIRED, RIGHT?

206
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,208
- DOUBLE UP.
- LOOK...

207
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,500
YOU DON'T WANT US TO GET NAKED
IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS, RIGHT?

208
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,041
- IT'S OKAY.  YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES.

209
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,458
YOU CAN PUT THIS ON INSTEAD.
- OH, NO.

210
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,458
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

211
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,541
I JUST WENT BLIND.
- ( giggles )

212
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,208
- TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T
LISTEN TO ME WHEN I SAID

213
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,791
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
PLAYING THIS GAME.

214
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,708
NOW YOU HAVE TO PLAY
BY MY RULES.

215
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,583
- Akihisa:
THE EMERGENCY DUDE CODE.

216
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,416
- Both: HMM.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

217
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,291
LET'S GET BACK
TO THE GAME.

218
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
OH, LOOK WHAT I DID.

219
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,250
ALL RIGHT, GO.

220
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,875
OH, MAN!

221
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,291
- YOU DON'T THINK WE'D
FALL FOR THAT,

222
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,166
DO YOU, TRICKSY BOYS?

223
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,291
NOW PLAY NICE.

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,708
- YUUJI, I KNOW YOU
BETTER THAN THAT.

225
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
YOU NEVER MAKE STUPID MISTAKES
WHEN PLAYING CARD GAMES.

226
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,000
- ( gasps )
- SO NAUGHTY.

227
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,000
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE TO
PLAY BY THE RULES, DO YOU?

228
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
- THIS IS VERY BAD BEHAVIOR.

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,875
- Fukuhara: TICK-TOCK.

230
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,625
- SEVEN.

231
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,750
- Akihisa: IT WON'T BE
MUCH LONGER NOW.

232
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,000
I CAN'T GET THIS WRONG,
OR I'LL BE SCREWED.

233
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,291
HUH?
( gasps )

234
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,083
IS THAT KUBO?

235
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,333
NO WAY.  THANKS, KUBO,
FOR HOOKING A BROTHER UP.

236
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
YOU'RE THE BOMB.

237
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,458
I GOTTA MAKE THIS SOUND
LIKE I THOUGHT OF IT MYSELF.

238
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,875
IT MUST HAVE REAL
EMOTION IN IT,

239
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,291
LIKE GREAT POETRY.

240
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,583
YOU SAY IT'S A SEVEN,
BUT I DOUBT IT!

241
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,500
- SORRY, SWEETIE.
IT'S DEFINITELY A SEVEN.

242
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,833
- DAMN IT, KUBO!

243
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,750
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!
I SUCK.

244
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,625
- ( sighs )
- DO YOU MIND EXPLAINING TO ME

245
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,375
WHAT THE CRAP IS
WRONG WITH YOU? 

246
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,625
WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU
TRUST KUBO WITH OUR NAKEDNESS?

247
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,375
- 'CAUSE I'M AN IDIOT.

248
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,166
- Fukuhara: TICK-TOCK.
- ( Akihisa groans )

249
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,041
- I'M STARTING TO HAVE

250
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,083
MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT WHETHER
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

251
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,708
- I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

252
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,375
WE'RE FRIENDS, HIMEJI.

253
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,208
WE SHOULDN'T PLAY AGAINST
EACH OTHER LIKE THIS.

254
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,416
WE SHOULD JUST STOP
RIGHT HERE WITH NO PENALTIES.

255
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,750
- ( sighs )
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,

256
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,166
YOU'LL BE AN INTERNET SENSATION

257
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,750
AND YOU'LL BE
SURROUNDED BY GIRLS.

258
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,583
- FIRST OF ALL,
I NEVER SAID I'D CROSS-DRESS.

259
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,250
AND SECOND, I NEVER SAID
YOU COULD TAKE PICTURES 

260
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,916
AND PUT THEM ON THE WEB.
- YUUJI.

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
IF IT GETS TO BE TOO MUCH,
YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES

262
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
WHILE I TAKE YOUR PICTURE.
- WE ARE NOT GONNA LOSE.

263
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,416
I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN!

264
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,583
- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I
SHOULD TELL YOU.

265
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,416
- GREAT. AND WHAT
MIGHT THAT BE?

266
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,458
- IF I END UP HAVING TO TAKE MY
CLOTHES OFF FOR WHATEVER REASON,

267
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,083
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THE GAME IS OVER.

268
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,333
WE'RE GONNA KEEP PLAYING
TILL THE END.

269
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,291
- NO WAY.
- SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

270
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,916
- IT'S A GOOD THING I PICKED
OUT SUCH CUTE UNDERWEAR TODAY.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,250
- OH, COME ON NOW!

272
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,875
- WHY DO THEY WANT TO TAKE
THEIR CLOTHES OFF?

273
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,416
- Fukuhara: INDEED.

274
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,083
- WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SAY YOU'RE PLAYING A KING,

275
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,375
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND SAY "I DOUBT IT" NOW.

276
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,291
- ( whimpers )

277
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,500
FOUR.
- FIVE.

278
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,458
- AND SIX.

279
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,708
- UH, I DOUBT IT?

280
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,166
- ( both screaming )

281
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,041
HURRY IT UP, DUDE!
THEY'RE GAINING ON US.

282
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
NAKED ON THE INTERNET!

283
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,208
- SLOW DOWN.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT--

284
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,500
- SORRY. PLEASE HELP US!
- WE'LL TAKE A REMEDIAL CLASS.

285
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,041
- HOLD ON.

286
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,666
WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

287
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,541
- DO YOU THINK WE COULD
TALK ABOUT THIS SOME OTHER TIME?

288
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,541
- HOLY CRAP, IT'S THEM.
WE GOTTA GO.

289
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,750
- ( both scream )

290
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,541
- AKI, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING, SILLY?

291
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,541
YOU FORGOT TO PUT ON
YOUR NEW CLOTHES.

292
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
- YOU WON'T GET AWAY.
- ( scoffs )

293
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,875
THEY'RE BEING CHASED
BY GIRLS WITH SCHOOL UNIFORMS,

294
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,833
AND I DON'T EVEN CARE
TO KNOW WHY.

295
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,708
- Kouta: BAKA AND TEST!

296
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,458
- All: WHAT?

297
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,666
AN AVATAR SYSTEM TEST RUN?

298
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,250
- OH, GOOD.
YOU CAN READ.

299
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,833
YES, I WOULD LIKE
YOUR HELP WITH THIS.

300
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,000
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE COULD HELP WITH THAT?

301
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,583
- I DON'T THINK IT,
I KNOW IT.

302
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,416
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
I KNOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO

303
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,125
DEAL WITH THE HIGHER
SCORING AVATARS.

304
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,750
- OH, YEAH.  YOU'RE RIGHT.

305
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,833
AND I ALMOST FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THAT LITTLE INCIDENT.

306
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,583
- TRUST ME, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I ENJOY BRINGING UP.

307
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,333
BUT NOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

308
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,083
ONE OTHER THING
I MUST INSIST ON,

309
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,708
KEEP CLASS A AND HIMEJI
OUT OF THIS.

310
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,166
- WAIT, THAT'S ME.
BUT I WANTED TO HELP TOO.

311
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,666
- TOO BAD.
- AW, THAT SUCKS.

312
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,583
WELL, WE'LL MISS YOU.
- I DO APPRECIATE

313
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,208
YOUR COOPERATION
IN THIS MATTER. 

314
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,875
I'LL GO AHEAD AND
COUNT YOU ALL IN.

315
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,208
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
THAT'S GONNA BE A PAIN.

316
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,708
WHY DO WE HAVE TO
DO THIS AGAIN?

317
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,750
I MEAN,
PROBATIONARY STUDENTS ALREADY

318
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,958
HAVE SO MANY CHORES TO DO.

319
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,000
THERE MIGHT NOT BE
ENOUGH TIME.

320
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,708
- HOWEVER, THERE'S PLENTY OF
TIME TO RUN AROUND THE HALLWAYS

321
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR,
IS THAT CORRECT?

322
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,166
- I'M SO SORRY.

323
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,666
- I'M NOT COMPLETELY HEARTLESS.

324
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE FAIR
TO COMPENSATE YOU IN SOME WAY.

325
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,083
A COUPLE OF LUNCH TICKETS

326
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,875
OR A COUPON BOOK SHOULD
BE ENOUGH, YES?

327
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,916
- All: SWEET!
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

328
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,458
I'LL CREATE A MOCK FIELD
OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING

329
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,041
FOR YOU TO PRACTICE ON.
FIRST UP WILL BE...

330
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,958
KOUTA TSUCHIYA, KINOSHITA,
THEN SHIMADA.

331
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,083
YOSHII, OF COURSE,
AND SAKAMOTO

332
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,000
NOW DO NOT LET ME DOWN.
- Yuuji: WAIT JUST A SECOND.

333
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,291
I'VE GOT HIGH SCORES.

334
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,875
HOW COME I'M BEING
PUNISHED WITH THESE LOSERS?

335
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,000
- YOU ASK ME THAT AS THOUGH 
YOU BELIEVE I HONESTLY CARE.

336
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,333
- HEY!

337
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,833
THIS IS SO STUPID.
- YEAH, IT IS.

338
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,083
- CAN YOU STOP WHINING?
IT'S NOT HELPING US

339
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,416
GET THIS DONE ANY FASTER.
NOW COME ON.

340
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,416
WE JUST HAVE TO SUMMON THEM,
THAT RIGHT?

341
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,416
- THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

342
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,958
- BRING IT.
- All: SUMMON.

343
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,166
- ( giggles )
THAT'S WEIRD.

344
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
I GUESS WE'RE STILL
IN OUR UNIFORMS

345
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,666
SINCE THIS IS JUST
A TEST RUN.

346
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,083
- BUT WE DON'T
HAVE ANY WEAPONS.

347
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,833
- WE'RE SO CUTE.
- THIS REMINDS ME OF

348
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,625
WHEN WE WERE IN FIRST YEAR.
OH, NO.

349
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,125
- ( all gasping )

350
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,500
- ( Avatars giggling )
- THEY SEEM REALLY HAPPY.

351
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,958
- HAGASAURUS SAID THE NEW UPDATE

352
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,583
WAS FOR USABILITY
IMPROVEMENTS, RIGHT?

353
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,625
- I NEED ADVICE.
SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE

354
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,666
HAPPENED THIS MORNING,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

355
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,958
- HUH?  WHAT HAPPENED?

356
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,708
WHAT WERE YOU
JUST TALKING ABOUT?

357
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,375
- UH, ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

358
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,208
- OUR NEIGHBOR TOLD ME
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME, 

359
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,416
WHICH IS COURAGEOUS, BUT ALSO
KIND OF WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

360
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,666
- ( gasps )
- WHOA!

361
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,333
YOU MEAN A GUY
OUTSIDE OUR SCHOOL

362
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,791
ADMITTED HE HAD A CRUSH
ON YOU? THAT'S GREAT.

363
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,125
DOES THAT HAPPEN
TO YOU A LOT?

364
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,125
- OF COURSE NOT.
I'M A GUY, REMEMBER?

365
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,291
WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN TO ME?

366
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,375
- IT'S THE THIRD
TIME THIS MONTH.

367
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,000
- ( all murmur )

368
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE FINALLY ADMITTED IT.

369
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,375
- NO, THAT WAS THE MINI DOUCHE.

370
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,458
HIDEYOSHI DOESN'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF.

371
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,333
- IT'S TRUE. HE'S VERY SECRETIVE
WHEN IT COMES TO HIS LOVE LIFE. 

372
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,875
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

373
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,458
I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.
- HOORAY!

374
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,333
SHE SAID SHE BELIEVED ME.
I'M A GOOD ACTOR!

375
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,166
( giggles )
WHY BE QUIET?

376
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,500
I'M SO HAPPY.

377
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,541
- ( chuckles )
AH!

378
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
I HAVE A QUESTION.
GOT A SEC?

379
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,500
- MAYBE.
- DO YOU WANT TO TALK DIRTY?

380
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,750
I'M ALL ABOUT IT.
- ( laughs )

381
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,833
NOT THAT I'M OPPOSED TO
THAT KIND OF THING AT ALL,

382
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,833
BUT THIS HAPPENS TO BE ABOUT
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

383
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,000
- SORRY, I'M ONLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT'S UNDER YOUR SKIRT. 

384
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,250
- ( laughs )
HE DOESN'T MESS AROUND, DOES HE?

385
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
AT LEAST HE'S FUNNY.
- PLEASE STOP IT.

386
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,708
- WHAT'S UNDER YOUR SKIRT?
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR SKIRT?

387
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,625
THIS IS AVATAR ABUSE,
YOU KNOW.

388
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:45,083
- ( laughs )
YOU GOTTA LOVE HIS HONESTY.

389
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,458
I THINK I MIGHT WANT
TO PLAY WITH HIM A LITTLE.

390
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,166
- ( both sigh )
- SO YOU WANT TO SEE

391
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,416
WHAT'S UNDER MY SKIRT,
DO YOU?

392
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,833
- NO, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

393
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,250
- UNDER YOUR SKIRT
LIES THE DOORWAY

394
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,625
TO ALL MY HOPES AND DREAMS.

395
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,375
I WANT TO SEE ALL 
YOU HAVE TO OFFER.

396
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,291
THERE'S NO SKIRT
I DON'T WANT TO EXPLORE.

397
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,625
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE
LONG AND STRAIGHT,

398
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,625
TIGHT, MINI, FLARED,
PLEATED,

399
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,375
THEY'RE ALL EXCEPTIONAL.

400
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,791
DON'T TRY TO TRICK ME
WITH THOSE CULOTTES THOUGH.

401
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THOSE THINGS ARE,

402
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,625
BUT THEY ARE NOT SKIRTS.

403
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,666
- PLEASE DON'T LISTEN
TO THIS GUY.

404
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,625
- HMM.
- YAY!

405
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,416
- THEY'RE SAYING WHAT THEIR
SUMMONERS ARE THINKING.

406
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,958
- ( giggles )
- WHOA.

407
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
I ACTUALLY TOUCHED
HER AVATAR WITH MY HANDS.

408
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,458
- THIS IS GONNA GET
WAY CRAZY.

409
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,750
- ALL RIGHT.
HAND THAT LITTLE BRAT OVER.

410
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,625
- MM!  NO!

411
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,375
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE
WITH AKI.

412
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,875
- SO NOT ONLY DO THEY TALK,

413
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,625
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO
DISOBEY US?

414
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,791
- THEY'RE LIKE REAL LIVE
STICKY CHILDREN WITH OPINIONS.

415
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,958
- THAT'S IT.
THEY'RE LIKE KIDS.

416
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,125
- PICK ME UP, PICK ME UP.
- NO TOUCHING!

417
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,041
LET GO OF HIM RIGHT NOW.
- NO!

418
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,416
- HEY, PLEASE DON'T
WORRY ABOUT.

419
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,416
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M USED
TO THIS SORT OF THING.

420
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,791
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.
- HUH? YOU'RE USED TO WHAT?

421
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,333
- WELL, KIDS REALLY LIKE ME
FOR SOME REASON.

422
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,416
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY FEEL
LIKE THEY CAN RELATE TO YOU.

423
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,833
- OH, WHATEVER, YUUJI.
- PAY ATTENTION TO ME NOW.

424
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,666
- RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
- KNOW WHAT?

425
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,333
WHEN I'M A LITTLE
MEAN TO YOU,

426
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,000
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE...

427
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,166
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU--
- ( screams )

428
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,500
WHAT FIELD DID 
YOU HATCH FROM?

429
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,666
ARE YOU TRYING TO RUIN ME?
- AKI, WHAT'S THE MATTER? 

430
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,041
ARE YOU OKAY? SAY SOMETHING.

431
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,166
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN
LISTENING TO ME.

432
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,916
- I'M SORRY.

433
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
- IT'S A GOOD THING
I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

434
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,916
'CAUSE THAT LITTLE BRAT--
- SO YESTERDAY,

435
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,250
THIS GIRL FROM FIRST YEAR
TOLD ME SHE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

436
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,708
- ( Minami screams )

437
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,625
- ( straining )

438
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,625
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, AKI?

439
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,875
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO USE
HER TO DIG INTO MY STUFF?

440
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,791
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- WHAT?

441
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,250
SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S
PUTTING IT ALL OUT THERE.

442
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,041
- OH, DON'T YOU
BLAME THIS ON HER.

443
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,625
WHY DON'T YOU SUMMON
YOUR BABY BEAST,

444
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,833
AND WE'LL SEE
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

445
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,041
- AAH!

446
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
THERE'S NO WAY I'M BRINGING
THAT LOOSE CANNON OUT.

447
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,708
I HAVE TO AVOID IT.

448
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,875
- SO THEY SAY
WHATEVER WE'RE THINKING?

449
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,791
- HUH? WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'M SORRY.

450
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,791
- ( gasps )
NOTHING, I WAS JUST MUMBLING.

451
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,958
HEY, CAN YOU READ THIS
FOR ME BY ANY CHANCE? 

452
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,375
- UH, SURE.
"KAKU-SA-MON-DAI,"

453
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,791
I THINK.

454
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,750
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU READ IT PERFECTLY.

455
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,250
- HMM?

456
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,833
- NO! WHY'S HE HERE?

457
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,833
MOTHER OF CRAP!
- I'M SORRY, AKIHISA.

458
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,750
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT,

459
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,250
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
THIS WOULD DO IT.

460
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,583
- NICE WORK, MIZUKI.
SO SPIT IT ALL OUT. 

461
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,666
WHO DO YOU LIKE?
IS IT SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM?

462
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,458
- I NEED A DISTRACTION.
SOMEONE DISTRACT ME!

463
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,416
- HMM.
- NO WAY.

464
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,083
- Both: OH, MAN.
NOW I CAN'T USE THAT IDIOT.

465
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,500
- Both Yuujis:
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S AN IDIOT!

466
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,666
- Both Akis:
WHAT'D YOU SAY?!

467
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,541
- ( chuckles )
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

468
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,375
- ALMOST.
I'M SO CLOSE.

469
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,708
- ( all gasp )

470
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,875
- I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE NOTICED,

471
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,250
BUT I USUALLY WEAR
LEGGINGS UNDER MY SKIRT.

472
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,791
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE TODAY.

473
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,625
- ( chuckles )
LIKE WE EVEN CARE.

474
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,041
- FOR THE LOVE OF MICE,
FLIP IT UP!

475
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,625
- THIS ISN'T GONNA END WELL,
IS IT?

476
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,416
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
I'M FROSTY.

477
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,916
- LEAVE IT TO ME.
I'LL DO IT.

478
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,666
- WHY DOES HE WANT TO
RUIN MY ENTIRE LIFE? 

479
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,291
- AKI, COME HERE!
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

480
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,791
- ME TOO.
I HAVE A QUESTION I WANT TO ASK.

481
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,458
- HEY, YUUJI...

482
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,958
- Fukuhara:
WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT.

483
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,083
- ( both murmur )

484
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,458
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR HAVING
A BRAIN FULL OF SMUTTINESS.

485
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,375
- I HOPE YOU BOTH HAVE
LEARNED A FEW THINGS. 

486
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,541
- I DON'T WEAR LEGGINGS WITH
MY SKIRTS EITHER, YOU KNOW.

487
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,375
- OH, MAN.  WHAT A RIOT.
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

488
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,791
- All: OW OW OW OW.

489
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

490
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,083
- PROBABLY THE WORST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

491
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,375
- ( chuckles )
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

492
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,416
I OVERSLEPT THIS MORNING,
SO I WAS RUNNING LATE.

493
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,875
LEFT THE HOUSE
WITHOUT A BRA.

494
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,416
- Both: PLEASE STOP,
WE CAN'T TAKE IT!

495
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,750
- Both Avatars:
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A BRA?!

496
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,791
- ( both groan )

497
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,125
- YUUJI.

498
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,750
- NO, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

499
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,000
I'M A GUY.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

500
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,250
- COME HERE.

501
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET ME GO.

502
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,583
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

503
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,000
- YOU HAPPY?
- AND WHY WOULD I BE HAPPY?

504
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,333
THIS MEANS NOTHING.

505
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,333
- ( cheering )

506
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,458
- I AM NOT HAPPY!

507
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,583
- YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.
I'D SAY YOU'RE IN LOVE.

508
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,250
- YOU'RE THE COOLEST GUY
I KNOW.

509
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,083
I'M SO JEALOUS
I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT.

510
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,583
- BUT THAT'S OKAY.
'CAUSE LOOK WHAT I GOT, RIGHT?

511
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,666
- Fukuhara:
WE WILL RETURN IN A MOMENT.

512
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,416
- I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD...
- MM-HMM.

513
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,916
- BUT THE TIMING
HAS TO BE RIGHT.

514
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,666
YOU CAN'T JUMP INTO
THAT SORT OF THING.

515
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YES, MA'AM.

516
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,041
- IT TAKES TIME.  YOU HAVE TO
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER FIRST.

517
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,708
AND YOU SHOULD BE IN LOVE.
- LIKE US!

518
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,375
- AKI LOVES ME.
- ( gasps )

519
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,208
- ( sighs )

520
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,625
- AKIHISA?
- ( both gasp )

521
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,250
- YO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

522
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,208
- I KNOW THIS SEEMS
COMPLETELY RANDOM, 

523
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,208
BUT I STILL WANT TO KNOW.

524
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,541
IS THERE ANYONE YOU LIKE?

525
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,875
- Both:
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

526
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,208
- I'M SORRY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

527
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,416
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT IN THE MOOD

528
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,875
TO TALK ABOUT WHO YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN

529
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,041
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED SO FAR TODAY. 

530
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

531
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,000
- LET ME JUST TRY ASKING
A DIFFERENT WAY.

532
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,208
- ( gasps )
NOT AGAIN. 

533
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,166
I WON'T LET HER TRICK ME.
( chuckles )

534
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,916
- IS THERE ANYONE YOU KNOW
THAT YOU LIKE MORE THAN OTHERS?

535
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,500
- YEAH, SURE.  I MEAN,
SAMON IN CLASS G'S PRETTY COOL.

536
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,791
- WAIT, HOLD ON!

537
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,166
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED SAMON.

538
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,041
( gasps )

539
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,333
- NOW WHAT WERE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

540
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,666
WHO IN THE SCHOOL WE LIKE?

541
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,291
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.
YOU TRICKED ME.

542
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,833
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
HIMEJI?

543
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,250
YOU TRYING TO SAY
YOU HAVE SECRETS 

544
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,583
YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW ABOUT?

545
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,250
- NO.  IT'S TOTALLY OKAY.

546
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,000
I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

547
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,750
- BUT IF I'M BEING HONEST,

548
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,291
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
HAVING NAUGHTY THOUGHTS EARLIER,

549
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,833
WELL...

550
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,000
I STARTED TO FEEL FUNNY

551
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,250
AND HAVE STRANGE THOUGHTS TOO.

552
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,291
- NO!

553
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,625
- ( footsteps approach )

554
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,083
- SO HOW'S IT GOING IN HERE?
( gasps )

555
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,583
- NO!
- SIT STILL.

556
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,500
STAY HERE.  STOP IT!
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

557
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,166
- WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?
LOOK AT THEM.

558
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,958
WHY CAN'T THIS SORT OF THING 
EVER HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE?

559
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,083
- ( theme music playing )

560
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

561
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,416
- ( door opens )

562
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,083
- HI THERE.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

563
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,458
- MY NAME'S NAKABAYASHI.
I'M THE REP FOR CLASS E AND I.

564
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,208
I WANTED TO EXPRESS
SOMETHING TO YOU

565
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,291
THAT I'VE BEEN HOLDING IN
FOR A LONG TIME.

566
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,958
WELL, I GUESS I HAVEN'T BEEN
HOLDING IT IN FOR THAT LONG.

567
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,791
BUT STILL,
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS,

568
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,375
SO BEAR WITH ME PLEASE?

569
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,291
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT I TELL YOU SOME--

570
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,875
WELL, SOME UNPROFESSED WORDS.

571
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,791
- TELL ME SOME
UNPROFESSED WORDS?

572
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

573
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,875
- ( both gasp )

574
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,833
- I LIKE YOU AND I REALLY WANT
YOU TO GO OUT WITH ME.

575
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:35,833
- WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES
AKIHISA SO DEVILISHLY CHARMING

576
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,666
AND IRRESISTIBLE?
HIS WALK,

577
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,500
HIS WORDS, HIS THOUGHTS?

578
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,458
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
IS PERFECTION!

579
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,416
- Fukuhara: GOODNESS.

580
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,833
- NAKABAYASHI?
- YES, KUBO?

581
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,833
- I'M SORRY.
- I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE

582
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,791
HUMILIATING WAY
TO BE REJECTED!

583
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,416
- Fukuhara:
QUESTION NUMBER FIVE.

584
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,833
WHAT DO YOU PAY
IF YOU'VE BURNED A LOVED ONE?

585
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,333
- Kouta: WHAT?
UM, I HAVE NO IDEA.

586
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,416
- Fukuhara:
ALIMONY VERA.

587
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,083
- Akihisa: NEXT EPISODE...
ME, PEEKING, AND TRAINING CAMP!

588
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,625
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
