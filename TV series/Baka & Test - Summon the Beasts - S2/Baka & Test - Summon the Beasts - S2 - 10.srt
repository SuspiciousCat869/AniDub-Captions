1
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,291
- MINAMI, I--
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,083
- UH, I'M...

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,916
SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
- WHATEVER.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,291
SHOULDN'T YOU BE MAKING OUT
WITH MIZUKI OR SOMETHING?

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,791
- UH, NO.

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,041
WE SHOULD BE THINKING
OF ANOTHER STRATEGY. 

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,416
I MEAN, IF WE LOSE
AGAINST CLASS B,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,458
HIMEJI MIGHT HAVE TO
CHANGE SCHOOLS.

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,208
THEN WE'D BE STUCK
TRYING TO REPLACE HER.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,041
- WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY, JERK?!

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,458
- ( gasps )

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,625
- WHY IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT
MIZUKI WITH YOU?

13
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,833
WHY DOES SHE GET TO BE
THE ONLY ONE WHO MATTERS?

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:43,833
- SHE'S NOT.

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:44,958
- WELL, YOU COULD
HAVE FOOLED ME.

16
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,625
WHY DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT MY FEELINGS?

17
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,125
YOU TREAT ME LIKE I'M A GUY.

18
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,125
- WHAT?
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, I SWEAR.

19
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,041
- IF THEY TRY TO MAKE HER MOVE,
I'LL TALK TO MIZUKI'S PARENTS

20
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,875
AND YOU CAN BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

21
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,041
- MINAMI--

22
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,791
- JUST STAY OUT OF MY
LIFE, ALL RIGHT?

23
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,083
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

24
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,541
- ( theme music playing )

25
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

26
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,208
- Fukuhara: AND NOW TO 
RECAP THE LAST EPISODE.

27
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,041
WHOO-HOO.

28
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,208
NEMOTO KYOUJI,
THE CLASS B REP

29
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,041
WAS PLANNING TO DECLARE
WAR ON CLASS F.

30
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,958
HE FIGURED THEIR
FIGHTING POWER WAS LOW

31
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,250
SINCE THEY JUST FINISHED
THEIR SUSPENSION.

32
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,500
AKIHISA AND FRIENDS
THEN DECIDED TO PROVOKE CLASS D,

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,041
HOPING THEY WOULD 
DECLARE WAR FIRST.

34
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,000
FIGHTING CLASS D
WOULD GIVE THEM TIME

35
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,916
TO TAKE THEIR RECOVERY TEST
AND REBUILD THEIR STRENGTH.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,833
THEY FIGURED CLASS B
WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO STRIKE

37
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,291
IF CLASS F HAD A LITTLE MORE
FUEL IN THEIR TANK, SO TO SPEAK.

38
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,000
- Yuuji: TO GET D'S ATTENTION,
WE DECIDED AKIHISA AND MINAMI 

39
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,625
SHOULD PRETEND
TO BE DATING. 

40
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,208
THAT WOULD REALLY
PISS OFF MIHARU

41
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,416
AND IT WOULD BE ON.
BUT NOW THAT WHOLE PLAN IS SHOT,

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,250
SO HERE WE ARE.
- ( chuckles ) 

43
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,583
- MAN, YOU'RE SUCH A TROLL.

44
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SCREWED THIS UP.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,041
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

46
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,666
HOW DOES ANY OF THAT
DRAMATIC CRAP HELP

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,750
WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO, MAN?

48
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,166
- SORRY.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,916
- I DEFINITELY THINK
MORE ACTING LESSONS 

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,666
WERE REQUIRED HERE.

51
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,291
I THOUGHT SHIMADA AND HIMEJI
WERE VERY BELIEVABLE THOUGH.

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,416
- OH, WOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

53
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,291
- WHY DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT MY FEELINGS?

54
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,791
YOU TREAT ME
LIKE I'M A GUY.

55
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,791
- HEY, KOUTA.
WHAT ARE THINGS LOOKING LIKE

56
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,291
OVER THERE IN CLASS B?

57
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,291
- THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT
70% RECOVERED,

58
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,375
AND IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE
SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY

59
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
GETTING READY FOR
THE NEXT WAR.

60
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,375
- THEN THEY'RE MOVING 
FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.

61
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,875
- THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

62
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,291
THEY'RE REALLY ON A MISSION.

63
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,291
- WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STALL THEM.

64
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,958
SO GET READY, KOUTA.

65
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,125
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO
START A RUMOR IN CLASS B.

66
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
- HIT ME WITH IT.
- TELL THEM CLASS D

67
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,458
IS PREPPING FOR AN ST WAR,
AND CLASS B IS THEIR TARGET.

68
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,041
- WORD.

69
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,041
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK?

70
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,958
- THE ONLY THING NEMOTO
REALLY CARES ABOUT

71
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,500
IS GETTING BACK ON TOP.

72
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,250
THE DUDE WANTS TO WIN,
PERIOD.

73
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,333
HE'LL TRY TO AVOID
FIGHTING A SERIES OF WARS

74
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,500
TO KEEP HIS CLASS
FROM GETTING EXHAUSTED.

75
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,666
IF HE FINDS OUT CLASS D
IS AFTER THEM HARDCORE,

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
HE'LL LAY OFF OF US
FOR AWHILE.

77
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,166
- MAKES SENSE.
IT'S NOT LIKE 

78
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,750
CLASS F'S EQUIPMENT IS
A PRIZE FOR ANYONE.

79
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,666
- SO HIDEYOSHI, YOU'RE UP.

80
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,500
IT'S NOW YOUR DROP TO DRAW
MIHARU SHIMIZU OUT OF CLASS D.

81
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,083
YOU'LL BE THE ONE
TO HANG ON MINAMI

82
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,083
AND MAKE LEZZI-TRON
WANT TO ATTACK US. 

83
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,916
- ( grunts )

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,583
- AS SOON AS THEY STRIKE,
WE'RE HOME FREE.

85
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,791
SO BRUSH UP, BRO.

86
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,416
- BUT WHY DO I
HAVE TO DO IT?

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,083
- THANKS FOR GIVING ME
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER

88
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,333
HOW AKIHISA RUINED
OUR ENTIRE LIVES AGAIN

89
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,750
AND HOW WE CAN'T USE HIM OR
HIMEJI FOR THIS TASK ANYMORE.

90
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,541
- OH, YEAH.  I'M ON IT.

91
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,791
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?
- WHO, ME?

92
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,791
- YES, YOU.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

93
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
I COULD GO FOR A SANDWICH.

94
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,375
- THAT IS NEVER
GOOD NEWS, MY FRIEND.

95
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,375
YOU ARE THE CORNERSTONE
OF THIS OPERATION,

96
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,041
AND WE NEED TO FILL YOU UP
WITH SOMETHING GOOD

97
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,333
SO YOU'LL BE
READY TO FIGHT.

98
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,625
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HIMEJI?

99
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,625
- WHAT?
YEA, I MEAN...

100
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,208
IF HE'S HUNGRY,
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO FOCUS

101
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,333
ON GETTING THE JOB DONE.
- ( groans )

102
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,708
- SO THAT'S ON YOU THEN.

103
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,208
FIND SOMETHING TO
STUFF HIS FACE WITH.

104
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,250
- I FORGOT.
I HAD LUNCH ALREADY,

105
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,333
AND I'M PRETTY STUFFED.

106
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,708
I COULDN'T SWALLOW
ANOTHER MOUTHFUL.

107
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,916
- IS THAT THE LUNCH
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, HUH?

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,791
- IT'S DELICIOUS.

109
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,958
- AAH!
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

110
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,708
- YOU WERE ASKING FOR IT, MAN.

111
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,291
SO, HIMEJI, YOU THINK YOU COULD
MAKE SOMETHING FOR AKIHISA?

112
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,875
- SURE, I'D BE DELIGHTED TO.

113
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,708
- HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

114
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,041
- FEED YOU. NOW WHAT DO
YOU FEEL LIKE EATING?

115
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
- I DON'T KNOW.
( gasps )

116
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,708
IF I PICK SOMETHING HEALTHY,
I JUST MIGHT SURVIVE.

117
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,333
- WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY,
YOU KNOW.

118
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,250
- OKAY, THERE HAVE TO BE
AS FEW INGREDIENTS AS POSSIBLE

119
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,250
SO THERE'S LESS CHANCE
SHE'LL POISON ME.

120
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,916
I CHOOSE BOILED EGGS.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,416
- SOUNDS PERFECT.

122
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,833
AKIHISA WOULD LIKE YOU 
TO MAKE HIM SOME JELLO.

123
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,416
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S IN THAT.

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,083
WHAT IF IT SLOWS ME DOWN?

125
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,500
- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
YOU EAT DURING THE OPERATION.

126
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,166
- ( grunts )
- MAKE SURE TO PUT IT

127
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,083
IN ALUMINUM POUCHES
SO HE CAN CARRY THEM WITH HIM.

128
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,750
- I WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT COLOR IT IS IN THERE.

129
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
- I'LL DO IT.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!

130
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,250
- WAIT!  CAN YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME WHAT KIND YOU'RE MAKING,

131
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,916
SO I'LL HAVE SOME IDEA?

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KNOCK IT OFF.

133
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,750
LOOK, CALM DOWN. NOBODY'S
REALLY GONNA MAKE YOU EAT THAT.

134
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,166
- HUH?
- I NEEDED HER TO HELP US

135
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,833
MAKE SOME MORE WEAPONS,
THAT'S ALL.

136
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,416
( chuckles )
- OH.

137
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

138
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,708
- BECAUSE NOW SHE'S
GONNA TRY TO FEED IT TO YOU,

139
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,000
AND THAT'S GONNA BE 
FREAKING HYSTERICAL.

140
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,833
- YOU'RE A COLD-HEARTED SNAKE.

141
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,041
- ( giggles )

142
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,125
FIRST THING ON THE LIST
IS TO GET THE GELATIN

143
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,708
AND SUGAR NICE AND READY.
- NOT BAD.

144
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,458
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

145
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,208
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
- NOW TO MIX THE COCOA POWDER

146
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,041
IN WITH THE CORN POTAGE
LIKE CHOCOLATE COVERED POPCORN.

147
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,458
- WHOA.  WHERE DID SHE
GET THAT RECIPE FROM? 

148
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,958
- SHH, SHUT UP. 
SHE'LL HEAR YOU.

149
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,958
- WILL IT BE THE ORANGE
OR THE SCALLION?

150
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,208
THEY'RE BOTH SO GOOD,
I CAN'T DECIDE.

151
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,250
- SERIOUSLY? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.

152
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,041
- KNOCK IT OFF, YO. 
SHE'S TRYING TO PICK

153
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,541
INGREDIENTS THAT ARE
THE MOST NUTRITIOUS,

154
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,666
YOU UNGRATEFUL TURD.

155
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,375
- SCALLIONS ARE MUCH HEALTHIER,

156
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,291
ESPECIALLY WITH NATTO.
- MAKE IT STOP.

157
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,583
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THINK I
REMEMBER READING SOMETHING

158
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,916
ABOUT NATTO THAT SAYS IT'S NOT
AS GOOD FOR OUR BLOOD FLOW

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,916
AS WE ONCE THOUGHT.
- SAFE.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,166
- BUT IT'S STILL AN
EXCELLENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN.

161
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,375
- ( groans )

162
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,916
- THERE WE GO.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,666
AND I JUST REMEMBERED
IT'S BLUE FISH SKIN

164
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,333
THAT IMPROVES BLOOD FLOW.
( giggles )

165
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,333
- IT'S A DOUBLE PLAY.
- THAT'S A FISH.

166
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,750
WHY IS SHE PUTTING A
FISH IN JELLO? THAT'S GROSS.

167
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,833
- SHE KNOWS HOW HARD
IT IS FOR YOU TO BE

168
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,750
SUCH AN IDIOT, SO SHE'S TRYING
TO FEED YOUR BRAIN.

169
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,166
IT'S SWEET, REALLY.
- HE'LL LOVE THIS. 

170
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,333
OH MY GOSH,
THIS ISN'T GOING TO TASTE GOOD.

171
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,333
- I KNEW YOU'D
COME THROUGH, HIMEJI.

172
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,500
- EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ADD MUSTARD TO NATTO.

173
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,166
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO FIX IT!

174
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
- AND MAYBE A LITTLE
GINGER FOR THE FISH.

175
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,458
- YOU'RE JUST
MAKING IT WORSE.

176
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,333
- WHAT OTHER SECRET
INGREDIENTS CAN I ADD?

177
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,208
- SECRETS DO NOT
MAKE GOOD FOOD. 

178
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,375
- I KNOW!
I BET SOME HOT SAUCE

179
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,166
WILL MAKE IT EXCITING.
- LET'S GO.

180
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,291
- ( crying )

181
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,625
- YOU HEAR ANYMORE,
YOU WON'T EAT IT.

182
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,041
- I DIDN'T GET TO SEE
HOW HOT THE HOT SAUCE WAS.

183
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,541
WHAT IF I CAN'T TAKE IT?
I'M AFRAID OF HEAT.

184
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,708
- Fukuhara:
NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS.

185
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,166
- I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE IT.

186
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,958
I MADE A MESS OF 
THE HOME EC ROOM.

187
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,791
I'M GONNA GO
CLEAN IT UP.

188
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,541
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THESE?

189
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,458
- WELL, I THINK NEMOTO
IS SENDING A MESSENGER

190
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,875
OVER TO CLASS D.

191
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,541
HIS MISSION WILL BE
TO FIND OUT

192
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,958
IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY
STARTING A WAR LIKE WE SAID.

193
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,375
- OH, GREAT.
NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

194
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,875
AS SOON AS HE GETS THERE,
HE'LL SEE

195
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,791
WE MADE THE WHOLE THING UP.
- VERY SIMPLE.

196
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,416
WE HAVE TO ASSASSINATE
THE MESSENGER.

197
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,958
- ( gasping )
- WE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

198
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,708
SOMEONE FROM CLASS D DID IT,

199
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,125
LIKE A DECLARATION OF WAR
BEFORE THE FIGHTING STARTS.

200
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,125
- WHEN HE FINDS OUT
ONE OF HIS MEN IS DOWN,

201
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,916
HE WON'T QUESTION WHO DID IT.
- I DON'T KNOW. IT SOUNDS CRUEL.

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,750
- BATTLES ARE CRUEL,
MY FRIEND.

203
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,166
KOUTA, IT'S TIME
TO GET MOVING.

204
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,541
- INDEED, IT IS.

205
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,583
- WHAT THE HECK'S THAT?
- ( students gasp )

206
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,500
- ( grunts )
WHO'S THAT? 

207
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,291
( gagging )

208
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,125
- REST IN PIECE.

209
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,000
- ( gasping )

210
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,916
MOMMY.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,125
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

212
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,875
- PERFECTION AS USUAL.

213
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,541
- THAT WAS SERIOUSLY IMPRESSIVE.

214
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,041
- SOME ARE JUST
BORN WITH IT.

215
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,875
THAT WAS A NICE
LITTLE WARM-UP THOUGH.

216
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,291
- HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING?

217
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,458
- Kouta: YOU'RE ASKING
TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

218
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,625
- WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE
IS THAT NOW NEMOTO SEES THIS

219
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,625
AS A WARNING CASUALTY
FROM CLASS D.

220
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,500
- GOOD.
NOW WE HAVE TIME TO PREPARE.

221
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,083
- YEP.  SO HOW HAVE
NEGOTIATIONS BEEN GOING?

222
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,625
- WE AGREED TO MEET IN ONE OF
THE EMPTY CLASSROOMS.

223
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,250
MINAMI SAID SHE WOULD
BE THERE AS WELL.

224
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,875
- AND THAT'S WHERE
THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

225
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,208
WE'VE GOT THIS THING
IN THE BAG.

226
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,458
- HOW DO WE KNOW FOR SURE

227
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,208
THOSE GUYS ARE GONNA
RESPOND TO THAT?

228
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,041
- OH, I'VE GOT IT
ALL WORKED OUT.

229
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,750
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

230
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,958
- THERE IS STILL ONE THING
THAT KIND OF WORRIES ME.

231
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,375
- WHAT IS IT?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

232
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,666
- I SAW NEMOTO EARLIER.

233
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,250
HE WAS TALKING VERY INTENSELY
TO SOMEONE IN CLASS A.

234
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,666
- CLASS A, HUH?
THAT'S VERY STRANGE.

235
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,041
I WONDER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.
- THERE YOU ARE.

236
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,666
- ( gasps ) SHOUKO.
WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

237
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
WHY ARE YOU STILL AT SCHOOL?

238
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,916
- WHY WOULDN'T I
BE AT SCHOOL?

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,416
- I'M SO SORRY.

240
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
I JUST HEARD THAT
YOUR MOM COLLAPSED TODAY.

241
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,666
- NO WAY.
ARE YOU POSITIVE IT WAS MY MOM?

242
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,791
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP. THE
WOMAN'S NEVER EVEN HAD A COLD.

243
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,958
- SHE NEEDS YOU.
LET'S GO CHECK ON HER.

244
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,333
I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF

245
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,916
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,916
- THIS IS YOUR MOTHER
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. 

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
- SHE'S FINE. I'LL CHECK
ON HER WHEN I GET DONE.

248
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,583
- YOU'RE DONE NOW.
- LET ME GO.

249
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,916
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,250
- SOMETHING'S FISHY HERE,
AND IT'S NOT FISH.

251
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IS HE OKAY?

252
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,875
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHY WOULDN'T YUUJI BE

253
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,958
THE FIRST ONE THEY CONTACTED
ABOUT HIS MOTHER?

254
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,958
- MAYBE BECAUSE
THEY COULDN'T REACH HIM?

255
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,208
HE SAID HE HAD TO TAKE
HIS PHONE IN FOR REPAIRS.

256
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,583
- THEN THEY COULD HAVE
JUST USED THE P.A. SYSTEM.

257
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,958
- SO THAT MEANS THAT NEMOTO
WAS PROBABLY TALKING TO

258
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,541
SOMEONE IN CLASS A
ABOUT ALL THIS.

259
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,375
- HE KNEW YUUJI
WOULD GO WITH SHOUKO.

260
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,541
- THAT EVIL SON OF A--
- THIS SUCKS.

261
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,666
IF I UNDERSTOOD RIGHT,
OUR NEXT STEP IN THE OPERATION

262
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,500
WAS TO PISS OFF MIHARU
SO SHE'D ATTACK YUUJI.

263
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,250
- NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

264
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,166
- NOT A PEEP.

265
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,708
- WHAT IS NEMOTO
TRYING TO DO?

266
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,125
DO YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE 
FIGURED OUT OUR STRATEGY?

267
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,458
- NO, BUT HE'S PROBABLY TRYING
TO BUY SOME TIME AS WELL.

268
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,291
- I BET HE'S TRYING
TO KEEP US AT BAY

269
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,250
UNTIL HE FIGURES OUT EXACTLY
WHAT CLASS D IS PLANNING.

270
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,833
- WELL PLAYED, NEMOTO.

271
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,791
- BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,
RIGHT?

272
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
- MINAMI, HI.
- ( scoffs )

273
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,666
I ONLY CAME HERE

274
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN'T
DO THIS WITHOUT ME, OKAY?

275
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,333
- SO WHAT'S OUR
PLAN OF ACTION NOW?

276
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,833
- YEAH, I GUESS
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

277
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,750
YUUJI ISN'T HERE,
SO WE HAVE NO CHOICE

278
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,916
BUT TO HANDLE THIS
ON OUR OWN.

279
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,958
- Miharu: BAKA AND TEST!

280
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,750
- SWEET SUGAR DUMPLING! 
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

281
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,166
HUG ME!
- NO!

282
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,083
LET GO, MIHARU.
YOU'RE CHOKING ME.

283
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,333
- OH, LAMBKIN,

284
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,666
YOUR SWEET BREASTICLES
REMIND ME OF THE OCEAN.

285
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,166
SO SMOOTH AND PERFECT!

286
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,958
- MAYBE YOU'RE
THINKING OF THE HORIZON

287
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,458
WHICH IS FLAT
AND LEADS TO NOWHERE.

288
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,458
- YOU'RE STILL TOUCHING ME.
I SAID GET OFF.

289
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,708
- YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
I THINK OF YOU EVERY MINUTE

290
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,500
360 DAYS A YEAR.

291
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,291
- SO YOU MUST TAKE
THE HOLIDAYS OFF, 

292
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,875
GOOD FOR YOU.
- ENOUGH OF THAT.

293
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,708
MINAMI IS AKIHISA'S GIRLFRIEND.

294
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,791
WHAT THEY HAVE IS LIKE
BEAUTIFUL AND STUFF.

295
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,541
I WON'T LET YOU
COME BETWEEN THEM.

296
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,458
- WAY TO GO.
JUST AS WE PLANNED.

297
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,583
- WHAT SORT OF INSANITY
ARE YOU SPITTING AT ME?

298
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,791
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT MY GUMDROP PRINCESS 

299
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,041
WANTS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THAT MOLDY MUFFIN WRAP?

300
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,333
LOOK AT THAT FACE. IS THAT A
FACE THAT LOVES TROLL BOYS?

301
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,958
WHAT MAKES AN
APE FART LIKE YOU

302
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
THINK YOU'RE WORTHY OF 
THE GINGERSNAP GODDESS?

303
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,291
- NO.  YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT EXACTLY A STUD.

304
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,750
I'M PRETTY SCRAWNY,
AND I'M NOT SMART, BUT--

305
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,041
- I DON'T CARE.
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

306
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,875
THIS GOES WAY BEYOND
LOOKS OR SKILLS,

307
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,416
YOU SHALLOW ASS.

308
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,250
THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.
- ( gasps )

309
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,666
- I'VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

310
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,833
AND THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE
YOU SUPPOSEDLY CARE ABOUT

311
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,000
IS DISGUSTING.

312
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,666
MY PRINCESS IS IN
THE SAME CLASS AS

313
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,916
BOTH YOU AND HIMEJI,
BUT FOR SOME REASON 

314
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
YOU TREAT THEM BOTH
VERY DIFFERENTLY.

315
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,750
YOU ARE AS SWEET 
AS CANDIED APPLES

316
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,916
WHEN IT COMES TO HIMEJI. TREAT
HER LIKE SHE'S THE PRINCESS.

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,583
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MY LOVE,

318
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,833
NOT ONLY ARE YOU RUDE
AND INCONSIDERATE,

319
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,875
BUT IT'S LIKE YOU FORGET
SHE'S A GIRL ALTOGETHER.

320
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,666
ARE YOU THAT STUPID?
DO YOU NOT SEE THE CHARM

321
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,250
AND DELICACY THAT OOZES
FROM HER EVERY PORE?

322
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,750
WHAT KIND OF PIG-BRAINED IDIOT
TREATS SOMEONE LIKE HER

323
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,500
AS JUST ONE OF THE GUYS?

324
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,875
THIS IS NOT JUST AN ASSESSMENT
OF YOUR MISERABLE LOOKS

325
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,000
OR YOUR EMBARRASSING
SUGGESTION OF ACADEMIC SKILLS.

326
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,875
YOU MAKE ME SICK.
THIS IS ABOUT A BLACK SOUL

327
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,041
WHO WOULD THROW THE HEART OF
A PERFECT ANGEL IN THE TRASH

328
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,250
JUST TO PURSUE SOMEONE
AS AVERAGE AS HIMEJI.

329
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,666
IT'S PATHETIC. YOU
THINK MINAMI'S A GUY?

330
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,000
MAN, YOU REALLY MUST BE
DUMBER THAN YOU LOOK, AKIHISA.

331
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,333
- ( crying )

332
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,916
- ( gasping )
- MINAMI!

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,541
- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
YOU CATCH UP TO HER?

334
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,541
YOU GONNA WRESTLE WITH HER
AND CALL HER NAMES

335
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,833
UNTIL YOU BOTH LAUGH
AND THEN SPIT SHAKE ON IT?

336
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:37,125
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU GO REMIND
HER WHY SHE SHOULD HATE YOU.

337
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,375
- I'LL GO TALK TO HER.
MIHARU'S RIGHT.

338
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,708
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS
ANY WORSE RIGHT NOW.

339
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,291
- UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE,

340
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,666
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M NOT NEEDED.

341
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,208
- DID YOU REALLY COME TO SHOVE
YOUR SORRY EXCUSE FOR LOVE

342
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,125
IN MY FACE?

343
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,708
'CAUSE I'LL TELL
YOU RIGHT NOW,

344
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,250
YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO
COMPETE WITH ME

345
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,208
FOR ANYONE'S HEART.

346
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,333
YOU NEED TO PROVE SOMETHING,
OBVIOUSLY.

347
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,083
BUT LOVE IS NOT ABOUT WHO WANTS
TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU HAVE,

348
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,416
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS

349
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,750
HOW HARD YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR SOMEONE LIKE HER.

350
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,625
SO I'VE ALREADY WON.

351
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,500
- MIHARU, WAIT.

352
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,166
- I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
MORE I WANT TO SAY TO YOU.

353
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,750
- NO, YOU'VE SAID IT ALL.

354
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,166
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU,

355
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,291
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

356
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,333
- WE, THE SECOND YEAR
STUDENTS OF CLASS D

357
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,375
HEREBY DECLARE WAR
ON CLASS F!

358
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,958
- All: WHAT?!

359
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,791
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

360
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,333
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS SAID
IT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED. 

361
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,375
- WE WEREN'T EXPECTING A WAR.
NOW WHAT?

362
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,916
- IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH FIGHTING
WITH THIS LOW LEVEL OF STRENGTH.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,625
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S PART OF OUR PLAN.

364
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,458
- YUUJI.
- JUST AS WE THOUGHT,

365
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,291
IT WAS A BUNCH OF
STRATEGIC B.S.

366
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,250
MY MOM'S FINE
AND HEALTHY AS A DONKEY.

367
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,125
- YOU MEAN HORSE,
BUT THAT'S AWESOME.

368
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,458
- WAY TO STEP IT UP,
AKI, MY MAN.

369
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,291
- IT DIDN'T GO EXACTLY
AS WE PLANNED,

370
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,958
BUT YOU STILL MANAGED
TO HIT THE TARGET

371
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
AND UNLEASH THE CHICK BEAST.
- NOW WE'RE AT WAR.

372
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,375
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'LL
BE ABLE TO FIGHT THEM ALL.

373
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,833
- IT'S TRUE.
WE'LL NEVER SURVIVE

374
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,333
IN AN ALL OUT BATTLE.
WHICH MEANS...

375
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,583
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT
REPRESENTATIVES ONE-ON-ONE.

376
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,875
- I HAVE TO SAY, I'M IMPRESSED
YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

377
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,000
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.
- BELIEVE ME,

378
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,583
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS BATTLE MY LOVE SQUIRREL,

379
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,583
BUT IF IT MEANS A CHANCE
AT MAKING JERK JERKY

380
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,291
OUT OF THIS PIG,
IT'S WORTH IT.

381
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,000
- I GUESS WE'LL
SEE ABOUT THAT.

382
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,791
OKAY, IT'S ALL YOU
FROM HERE ON OUT, BUDDY.

383
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,166
MAKE ME PROUD, SON.
- I AM ALL OVER THIS ONE.

384
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,166
- YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

385
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,583
I HOPE YOU'RE READY, DORK.

386
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,208
MAY WE HAVE PERMISSION?

387
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,708
- I APPROVE!

388
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,291
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

389
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,750
- READY AND... 
- Both: SUMMON!

390
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,541
- BEFORE WE BEGIN, I HAVE A
QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU.

391
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,625
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER.

392
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,708
DID YOU MAKE ALL THAT UP
JUST SO YOU COULD START 

393
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,833
THIS WAR WITH CLASS D?

394
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,166
RIGHT.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

395
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,041
- BEFORE WE LEFT, 
I SAW HER TEAR UP.

396
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,875
I KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE
THE THINGS I SAID TOUCHED HER.

397
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,500
I UNDERSTOOD HER PAIN.
PAIN YOU CAUSED HER!

398
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,666
SHE SHOULD NEVER EVEN HAVE
TO KNOW THOSE FEELINGS EXIST!

399
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,625
- HOW ARE YOU ALLOWED 
TO BE IN HER PRESENCE?

400
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,875
YOU SHOULD BE
CHAINED AND LOCKED UP.

401
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,291
YOU COULDN'T BE TRUSTED TO
HOLD A CONVERSATION WITH HER

402
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,875
WITHOUT MANIPULATING AND
THEN DISMISSING HER FEELINGS.

403
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,250
IT'S NOT FAIR!
IT'S NOT FAIR!

404
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,750
YOU LIED TO HER.
YOU USED HER.

405
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,416
YOU ONLY PRETENDED
TO BE HER FRIEND

406
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,416
SO THAT YOU COULD
KEEP HER AROUND FOR BATTLES!

407
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,833
YOU DON'T GIVE
A CRAP ABOUT HER!

408
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,708
- ( shouts )
- ( grunts )

409
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,625
- YOU'RE WRONG.
I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH!

410
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,125
- ( screams )

411
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,083
- I'M NOT THE SMARTEST
GUY IN THE WORLD,

412
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,083
BUT I KNOW THERE ARE SOME
THINGS YOU NEVER JOKE ABOUT.

413
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
EVER.
I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH!

414
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,916
- WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE
A WORD YOU SAY?

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
- THEY WEREN'T JUST WORDS.

416
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
WHAT I SAID WAS
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL!

417
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,000
- ( screams )

418
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,916
( grunts )

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,708
- I'M NOT FALLING FOR IT
A SECOND TIME.

420
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,625
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
- ( both gasp ) 

421
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,125
- WHAT THE CRAP?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

422
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,833
- YOU CAN GO NOW.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE ON OUT.

423
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,125
- YOU'RE KIDDING. 
THIS IS FOUL PLAY.

424
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,250
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

425
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,708
- YOU CAN CALL IT
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

426
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,958
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF GAME.
THIS IS WAR.

427
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,625
IT'S WAR!
- NO!

428
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,041
- GO GET 'EM, BOYS.

429
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,291
- ( moans, shouts )

430
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,416
- STOP IT!  TRAITORS!

431
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,791
OW!
( whimpering )

432
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,041
WHY?!  WHY ARE THEY
ATTACKING ME?

433
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,958
( yelping )

434
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,125
THIS IS THE WORST PAIN
I'VE EVER FELT.

435
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,916
IT'S LIKE A MILLION SHARP BLADES
SHOOTING IN AND OUT OF MY BODY.

436
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,083
- MIHARU.

437
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,583
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M
PRETTY SURE THAT KIND OF PAIN

438
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,000
WILL LAST AWHILE.

439
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,583
I KNOW HE DESERVES
MUCH MORE THAN THIS,

440
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,166
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU
CAN FORGIVE HIM FOR NOW?

441
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,583
- MAYBE FOR NOW.

442
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,875
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING I'M GOING
TO GET OVER VERY QUICKLY.

443
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,083
- ( shouts )
- PROMISE ME THIS PUNK-ASAURUS

444
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,833
WILL BE CONFINED TO
THE REMEDIAL CLASSROOM,

445
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,250
AND I'LL GRANT 
THE CEASE-FIRE.

446
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,666
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

447
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,583
WAS THIS PART OF YOUR PLAN,
DOUCHER?

448
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,125
- OF COURSE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

449
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,500
I KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY
WE COULD WIN AGAINST CLASS D

450
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,000
IN OUR CURRENT STATE.

451
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,833
SO I JUST FIGURED
NEGOTIATING A CEASE-FIRE

452
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,750
WAS THE BEST THING TO DO.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

453
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,333
YOU STILL HURT 
MY LOVE KITTEN,

454
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,166
AND THAT PART HASN'T CHANGED.
- ( groans )

455
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,791
AND I'M SO SORRY FOR THAT,
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY-- GAH!

456
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,875
- I'M ONLY LETTING YOU
OFF THE HOOK THIS EASILY

457
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
BECAUSE I BELIEVE SOME OF THE
THINGS YOU TOLD ME WERE TRUE.

458
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:48,041
- AAH!
- ( screams )

459
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,541
- SO JUST IMAGINE WHAT YOU'D
BE GETTING IF YOU HAD LIED.

460
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,541
- AND THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A SWEET DEAL.

461
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,958
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S HEAD BACK.

462
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,375
GOOD JOB.
- All: YEAH!

463
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,541
- ( stammers )

464
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,958
( whimpers )
HUH?

465
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,375
AHH.

466
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,041
- IT'S SO GREAT
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

467
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,625
- Fukuhara: WITH THAT,
THE WAR WAS FINALLY OVER.

468
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,708
- WHAT'S THE SCOOP, KOUTA?

469
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,625
- IT LOOKS LIKE NEMOTO
AND CLASS B FINALLY GAVE UP.

470
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,208
- YEP.
JUST AS WE PREDICTED.

471
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,041
- GOOD.
I STILL CAN'T SEE

472
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,041
WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN OUT OF IT ANYWAY.

473
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,625
- OH, YEAH. I PICKED THIS
THING UP LIKE YOU ASKED.

474
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,500
- WHAT ARE YOU 
USING THAT FOR?

475
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,958
- Miharu: DID YOU REALLY
COME TO SHOVE YOUR SORRY

476
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,583
- WHAT?
- EXCUSE FOR LOVE IN MY FACE?

477
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,333
- NO, PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.
- I MAY OR MAY NOT

478
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,416
HAVE RECORDED THAT
ENTIRE CONFERENCE.

479
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,750
- NO, WHAT IS IT REALLY?

480
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,541
IS IT SOME KIND OF NEAT NEW
AUDIOBOOK YOU FOUND?

481
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,833
- KEEP SQUEEZING.  HE'S STILL
GOT ENOUGH AIR TO TALK.

482
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,458
- STOP SQUIRMING LIKE THAT.
- LET ME GO!

483
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,916
- I GOT YOU NOW.

484
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,208
AND SORRY, I AM NOT
LETTING YOU GO.

485
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,083
- TURN IT OFF!

486
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,125
- YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD.
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

487
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,291
- Miharu: I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
MORE I WANT TO SAY TO YOU.

488
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,708
- ( muffled shouts )

489
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,541
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY SEEM.

490
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,000
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
REALLY DATING MY BUTTERCUP.

491
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,666
THAT WAS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.
- 'KAY.

492
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,250
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
UHH...

493
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,125
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

494
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,208
WHO RECOGNIZES
HOW AMAZING MINAMI IS.

495
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,125
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE STILL TRYING!

496
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,291
DO YOU NOT GET THAT I SAW YOU
SAY AWFUL THINGS TO HER?

497
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,708
I SAW YOU TREAT HER
LIKE A GUY,

498
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,333
AND I SAW HER CRYING
BECAUSE OF IT.

499
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,208
- OKAY, LISTEN.

500
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,875
I DON'T TREAT HER LIKE
A PRINCESS, YOU'RE RIGHT.

501
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,875
AND I'M PROBABLY ACTING
THE SAME WAY AROUND HER

502
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,666
AS I WOULD MY GUY FRIENDS
WITH THE WAY I JOKE AND STUFF.

503
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,125
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE...
- BECAUSE WHY?

504
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,125
BE CAREFUL.

505
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,291
- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO.

506
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,958
MINAMI IS SOMEONE I CAN
JUST BE MYSELF AROUND. 

507
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,958
I DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON
AN ACT FOR HER.

508
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,541
I LOVE HANGING OUT WITH HER

509
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,541
BECAUSE WE JUST GET
EACH OTHER'S WEIRDNESS.

510
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,250
YOU CAN'T KID AROUND
WITH MOST GIRLS LIKE THAT.

511
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,208
AND IT'S THE DUDE PART
THAT MAKES HER SO HOT.

512
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,500
( gasps )
- WHOA.

513
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
YOU JUST SAID SHE WAS HOT.

514
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,000
- YEAH, I HEARD IT TOO,

515
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,000
AND I DON'T DISAGREE, BUT I'M
SURPRISED YOU SAID IT OUT LOUD.

516
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,708
- ME TOO.  SO ROMANTIC.

517
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,416
- WHY?  WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?

518
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,625
WHY DID THEY OUT OF ALL PEOPLE
HAVE TO HEAR IT?

519
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

520
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,916
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT WAS
JUST SO SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL.

521
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,333
- YOU SAID THE DUDE PARTS
MADE HER HOT.

522
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,875
MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST.

523
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,333
- YOU <i>CAN</i> BE YOURSELF
AROUND HER.

524
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,916
- Akihisa:
SOMEONE KILL ME, PLEASE.

525
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THIS SUCKS.

526
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,958
- NO, DON'T STRETCH MY ARMS.
( giggles )

527
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,500
SIS!  OH MY GOSH,
YOU'RE HERE.

528
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,208
I MISSED YOU!
- HI.

529
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,541
I MISSED YOU TOO.

530
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,166
- OH, NO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

531
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN CRYING. 

532
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,625
- I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

533
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,291
- OH, NO, TEARS!

534
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,791
DID SOMEBODY CALL YOU
A NAME AT SCHOOL?  TELL ME.

535
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,125
- IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST--

536
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,791
- WHAT HAPPENED?

537
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,375
- THE WORST THING THAT
COULD HAVE POSSIBLY HAPPENED.

538
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,041
I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE,

539
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,000
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF HE LOVES ME BACK.

540
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,208
- ( theme music playing )

541
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

542
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,375
- ( sighs )
I HATE TODAY SO MUCH.

543
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:22,125
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO APOLOGIZE
TO MINAMI FOR WHAT I SAID?

544
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,791
- HEY.
- ( gasps )

545
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,875
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TODAY?

546
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,916
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP, AKI.

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,750
- ( gasps )

548
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,500
MINAMI...
- THAT'S MY NAME.

549
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:36,333
- YEAH.  UH... IT IS.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

550
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

551
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,958
SO YOU JUST TOLD ON YOURSELF.
WHAT LIES ARE YOU SPREADING?

552
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,750
- NOTHING!
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

553
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,500
- GOOD.  BECAUSE NEXT TIME 
YOU PULL A STUNT LIKE THAT,

554
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,208
I'M NOT LETTING YOU OFF
WITHOUT A PUNCH.

555
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,541
- HUH?
- ( giggles )

556
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,291
YOU IDIOT.

557
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,333
- Fukuhara:
QUESTION NUMBER 11.

558
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,916
WHAT DO YOU CALL SOMEONE
YOU WERE CLOSE TO

559
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,500
WHEN YOU WERE SMALL?

560
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,333
- Yuuji:
A CHILDHOOD FR-- ( gagging )

561
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,875
- Shouko: A FIANCEE.

562
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,791
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME, YUUJI,
SHOUKO, AND CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.

563
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,750
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
