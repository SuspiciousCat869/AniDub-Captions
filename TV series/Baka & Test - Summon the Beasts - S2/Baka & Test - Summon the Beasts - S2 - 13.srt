1
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,208
- Fukuhara: LAST TIME,
AKIHISA AND THE GANG

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,208
SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES
PARTICIPATING IN AN INTER-GRADE

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,208
COURAGE CONTEST.

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,875
DUE TO THE ADEPT STRATEGY
OF THE YEAR THREE STUDENTS,

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,291
LED BY TSUNEMURA
AND NATSUKAWA,

6
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,625
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE SOO-NA-KAWA DUO,

7
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,208
THE GANG FOUND THEMSELVES
IN A BITTER STRUGGLE.

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,666
YADDA YADDA YADDA.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,500
LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

10
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,250
- WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO NOW?

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,666
MOST OF OUR CLASS 
HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,083
BY YEAR THREE ALREADY.

13
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,583
- WE'VE GOT A WEAPON.

14
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,166
A SECRET WEAPON,
SO DON'T WORRY. 

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,583
- A SECRET...
- WEAPON?

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,208
- HUH?
- All: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,666
- ( theme music playing )

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

19
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,125
- SO...
- ( whimpers )

20
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,916
- I GUESS WE'RE
THE SECRET WEAPONS, HUH?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,583
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

22
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,208
I MEAN, I'M NOT
SCARED AT ALL, ARE YOU?

23
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,000
- ( both scream )

24
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,500
- ( whimpers )
- NICE.

25
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,916
THAT WAS SCARY.
YOU OKAY?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,583
- YEP.  WELL, SORT OF.

27
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,750
I'M JUST NOT USED
TO SEEING JAPANESE GOBLINS.

28
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,333
GERMAN GOBLINS WOULD BE
A DIFFERENT STORY.

29
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,291
- AAH!

30
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,666
- ( both scream )

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,500
( muffled screaming )
- ( groans )

32
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,208
- I CAN'T BREATHE.
PLEASE LET ME GO. 

33
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,125
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS ANYMORE.

34
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,208
LET'S GO.  PLEASE, AKI.

35
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,875
- ( gasps )
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

36
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,291
THIS ISN'T LIKE
HER USUAL SELF.

37
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,375
WHY IS MY HEART 
BEATING SO HARD?

38
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,291
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

39
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,833
THEY MUST HAVE A SPECIAL
PEN THROWING DEPARTMENT

40
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,041
OR SOMETHING.

41
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,875
- ALL PIGS WHO DARE
TRY TO SEDUCE MY LADY

42
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,458
SHALL BE ELIMINATED!

43
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,625
- WE GOTTA GO.  LIKE NOW.
- WHAT?  WHY?

44
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,208
- I'LL NEVER LET YOU 
GET AWAY, MY DARLING.

45
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,791
I'LL SEPARATE YOU FROM
THAT DISGUSTING SWINE 

46
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,875
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!
( cackles )

47
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,375
- HEY, MIHARU,

48
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,958
DO YOU REALIZE YOU LOOK
MORE LIKE A GOBLIN

49
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,166
THAN THE ACTUAL GOBLINS?

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,541
- ( groans )

51
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,833
- WELL, THAT'S ODD. I WAS
CERTAIN THEY RAN THIS WAY.

52
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,416
LET'S MOVE ON THEN. WE'LL SIMPLY
HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,333
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
PUMPKIN.

54
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,583
- HECK YEAH.
THEY FELL FOR IT.

55
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,666
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE NOT HIDING SOMEWHERE?

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,416
- ( chuckles )
I GUESS IT'S TIME

57
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,375
YOU GOT USED TO
JAPANESE GHOSTS AND GOBLINS.

58
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,500
- NO WAY.  I'LL JUST
GO BACK HOME TO GERMANY.

59
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,250
SCREW THIS.
- YOU SURE?

60
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,250
YOU'LL GET SO LONELY.
- HOW COME?

61
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,500
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

62
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,583
I ACTUALLY HAVE FRIENDS
IN GERMANY TOO, DUMMY.

63
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,708
- YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

64
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,791
- WHAT?

65
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,333
- I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT YOU, SILLY.

66
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,416
IT'D BE LONELY FOR
THE REST OF US IF YOU LEFT.

67
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,625
- ( gasps )

68
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,833
PLEASE, I KNOW
YOU'RE JUST TRYING

69
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,125
TO GET ON MY GOOD SIDE AGAIN.

70
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,291
- THAT ISN'T TRUE AT ALL.

71
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,125
I MEAN, WE'RE ALWAYS
TOGETHER, AREN'T WE?

72
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,166
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING 
ABLE TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY.

73
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,625
- ALWAYS TOGETHER?
- WHAT DID I SAY? 

74
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,291
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
- NO.  JUST THINKING.

75
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,333
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU
I WOULD ALWAYS BE BY YOUR SIDE?

76
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,041
- WELL, I'D SAY WHERE I SIT
IN THE CLASSROOM IS DRAFTY,

77
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,291
SO IT'S USUALLY COLD.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

78
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,708
I WAS TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

79
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,125
- OKAY, LIKE WHAT?

80
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,458
- IT'S JUST THAT...

81
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,583
WELL, I--

82
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,541
AAH.

83
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,291
( groans )
- ( gasps )

84
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,583
MINAMI, WHAT HAPPENED?
OH.

85
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,000
I'M BACK.

86
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,708
- OH, WELCOME BACK,
AKIHISA.

87
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,375
HEY, WHERE DID MINAMI GO?

88
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,041
- I DROPPED HER OFF
AT THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

89
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,083
SHE PUSHED HERSELF TOO HARD
AND NEEDED TO REST.

90
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,500
- WELL PLAYED, AKI.

91
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,750
THE PLAN WENT OFF
WITHOUT A HITCH. 

92
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,083
- All: HMM?

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,458
- ( both grunt )

94
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,916
- ( gasping )
- BOO!

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,750
YOU INTERRUPTED
THE SEARCH FOR MY LOVER,

96
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,291
AND NOW YOU MUST PAY!

97
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,541
- ( Avatars grunting )

98
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
- ( screaming )

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,541
- THAT GIRL'S A MONSTER.

100
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,916
- IS SHE THE SECRET WEAPON
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,708
- THAT SHE IS.

102
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,333
- WEIRD.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

103
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,000
WHY MIHARU IS
LOOKING FOR MINAMI,

104
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,500
BUT WHAT IS KUBO LOOKING FOR?
( gasps )

105
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,750
DO YOU THINK KUBO MIGHT
HAVE A THING FOR MIHARU?

106
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,083
- OH, AKI.

107
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,958
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
BE SO DAMN CRUEL? 

108
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,458
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE KUBO CRY.
- HUH?

109
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,708
- YOU'RE TOO MEAN.
- WHAT THE CRAP, GUYS?

110
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,541
- WELL, YOU SURE DID
KEEP US WAITING LONG ENOUGH.

111
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,125
WE MAY HAVE LET
OUR GUARD DOWN THIS MORNING,

112
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,541
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET A TASTE OF
WHAT THE REAL YEAR THREE POWER--

113
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,541
- EXCUSE ME, BUT HAVE YOU BY
CHANCE SEEN AKIHISA YOSHII

114
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,708
AND MINAMI SHIMADA?
- ( groans )

115
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,375
HEY, YOU INTERRUPTED MY
IMPASSIONED THREAT, YOU BASTARD.

116
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,958
- YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

117
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,875
WE CAN GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO REALLY LAUGH ABOUT.

118
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,375
- Both: SUMMON!

119
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,666
- I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.
- Both: SUMMON.

120
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,875
- All: NO WAY!
- THEY'VE GOT OVER 400 POINTS.

121
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,916
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,375
- SCIENCE GEEKS ARE
SCIENCE GEEKS.

123
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,375
NOT MUCH WE CAN
DO ABOUT IT.

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,416
- ( gasps )

125
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,791
- ( cackles )

126
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,500
- WILL YOU STOP IT WITH THE
FREAKY LAUGHING?

127
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,791
ENOUGH ALREADY.

128
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,000
- YOU'RE UP, JACK WAGON.
- ( gasps )

129
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,041
- TAKE THIS!

130
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,583
- ( Class F sighs )

131
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE KUBO LOST.

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,333
- IT'S UP TO US. 
WE SHOULD GO NOW.

133
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU TWO HAVEN'T GONE YET.

134
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,416
- NOT SO FAST. THE FIGHT WON'T
BE A BIG DEAL FOR SHOUKO,

135
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
BUT MY PHYSICS SCORE
IS 150 AT THE MOST. 

136
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,833
THAT'S GONNA MAKE FOR 
A PRETTY ROUGH BATTLE.

137
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,916
- BUMMER. WE NEED ANOTHER
PAIR TO GO IN THERE,

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,541
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYONE LEFT.

139
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,833
- BUT THERE IS
ANOTHER PAIR LEFT.

140
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,458
RIGHT THERE.
- ( gasps ) 

141
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,958
WHO, ME?  I MEAN,
I KNOW I'M NOT DISQUALIFIED,

142
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,958
LIKE I DIDN'T
SCREAM OR ANYTHING,

143
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,291
BUT MINAMI CAN'T
GO BACK INSIDE. 

144
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,291
- NOT HER.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

145
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,208
THERE'S ANOTHER GIRL HERE
WHO HASN'T BEEN INSIDE

146
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,958
THE HAUNTED HOUSE YET
AND ISN'T SHOUKO.

147
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,541
- I GOT NOTHING.
- AKIHISA?

148
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,208
I THINK THEY MIGHT BE
TALKING ABOUT ME.

149
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,875
- SHE CAN'T. SHE'S AFRAID OF
GHOSTS AND GOBLINS BIG TIME.

150
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,791
SHE WON'T MAKE IT.
- YOU'RE WRONG.

151
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,833
I CAN DO IT.
- ( gasps )

152
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,041
- MINAMI WAS AFRAID TOO,

153
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,625
BUT SHE DIDN'T
LET THAT STOP HER,

154
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,041
AND NEITHER SHOULD I.

155
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,625
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL DO IT. 

156
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,583
I'M GOING INTO
THAT HAUNTED HOUSE WITH AKIHISA.

157
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,166
COULD YOU WALK
A LITTLE SLOWER PLEASE?

158
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,583
- YEAH, SURE.

159
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,500
- I'M NOT AFRAID.
I'M FINE.

160
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,416
I'M NOT SCARED AT ALL.
I'M WITH AKIHISA,

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,083
SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BE FRIGHTENED OF,

162
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,500
WHICH IS GOOD, 
SINCE I'M FINE.

163
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,875
- HEY, HIMEJI,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

164
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,333
- NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

165
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,833
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME IN.

166
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,083
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- ( gasps )

167
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,666
THANK YOU.

168
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
I'M ALWAYS DEPENDING ON YOU,

169
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,666
SO IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS
YOUR TURN TO DEPEND ON ME.

170
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,666
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,958
PLUS I DON'T MIND IT AT ALL
WHEN YOU DEPEND ON ME.

172
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,375
- ( whimpers )

173
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,666
- YOU'RE REALLY CUTE,

174
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,000
AND YOU'RE LIKE WAY SMART.

175
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,666
ON TOP OF THAT,
YOU'RE SUPER SWEET.

176
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,500
IT'S LIKE I'M
PROTECTING A PRINCESS.

177
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,791
- ( gasps )

178
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,291
- THE ONLY WEIRD PART IS THAT

179
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,708
YOU'RE HANGING OUT 
WITH A GUY LIKE ME.

180
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,125
YOU OKAY?

181
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
- I'M FINE.
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

182
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,833
I'M NOT A PRINCESS.
- ( gasps )

183
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,625
- I'M A KLUTZ. I GET REALLY
JEALOUS FOR NO REASON,

184
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,291
AND I HAVE A TENDENCY
TO FAINT.

185
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,750
I'M SO NOT A PRINCESS.

186
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,708
- COME ON, THAT'S NOT--
- YES, IT IS!

187
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,541
YOU JUST REFUSE TO
ACCEPT THE TRUTH

188
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,666
FOR SOME STUPID REASON.

189
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,708
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING
THAT'S NOT PERFECT ABOUT ME.

190
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,541
AND I THINK IT'S SO
YOU CAN HAVE A REASON

191
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,541
TO KEEP FROM GETTING
CLOSE TO ME.

192
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,291
- WHY WOULDN'T I
WANT TO GET CLOSE TO YOU?

193
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,875
- I DON'T KNOW.

194
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,125
IT'S PROBABLY
OUT OF CONSIDERATION.

195
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,791
YOUR EYES SEE ME,

196
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,291
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
ACTUALLY SEE THE REAL ME.

197
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,500
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.
CAN YOU SEE THE REAL ME?

198
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,125
- THIS IS AWKWARD.

199
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,666
- Nishimura:
BAKA AND TEST.

200
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,125
- ( panting )

201
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,583
HIMEJI.

202
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,750
( yelps )
DAMN IT. 

203
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,750
I DON'T REMEMBER
A WALL BEING HERE.

204
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,583
OW.  SON OF A CRAP!

205
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,708
AAH!
( grunts )

206
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,375
AH, FINALLY.
WHERE WERE YOU?

207
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,583
YOU GOT UGLY.
- OH, CAN IT.

208
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
AND LET GO OF MY HAND.
- WAIT, YUUJI?

209
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,791
WHAT THE HELL? 
WHERE'S HIMEJI?

210
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,208
MOTHER TRUCK.
WHERE AM I?

211
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,208
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

212
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,208
HIMEJI'S PROBABLY
JOINED UP WITH SHOUKO BY NOW.

213
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,625
- WHAT?  I NEED YOU
TO BREAK THIS DOWN.

214
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,625
- IT WAS ALL A PART OF
THOSE YEAR THREE LOSERS' SCHEME.

215
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,375
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
EITHER SHOUKO OR I

216
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,958
ARE GONNA SCREAM AT
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

217
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
- YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.

218
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,791
- SO THEY TURNED OFF
ALL THE LIGHTS

219
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,375
AS A WAY TO GET US SEPARATED.

220
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,708
AND ONCE THAT WAS DONE,
THEY JUST MADE A PARTNER SWITCH.

221
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,375
- I GET IT.

222
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,208
- WELL, SHOUKO AND HIMEJI
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER

223
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,708
THAN THEY WERE
WITH EITHER OF US,

224
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,708
SO IT WORKS OUT.

225
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,416
- BRO, TELL ME THE TRUTH.

226
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
- WHEN I'M ALONE IN
THE HAUNTED HOUSE WITH SHOUKO,

227
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,708
THE FEAR I FELT WHEN
SHE ATTACKED ME

228
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,333
WITH A SPIKE ROD RETURNS.

229
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,666
- OH.  I THINK I SEE HER
AROUND THE CORNER.

230
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,250
-  ( gasps )
AKIHISA DEFLECTOR SHIELD.

231
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,750
- AND NOW I KNOW
HOW AFRAID YOU REALLY ARE.

232
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,666
- MIZUKI,
IS ANYTHING THE MATTER?

233
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,291
- YES, I THINK SO.

234
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,958
- DO YOU HEAR THAT?

235
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,375
HEY!

236
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,791
( whispers )
HIMEJI, OVER HERE.

237
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,833
- Ghostly Voice:
HIMEJI, OVER HERE.

238
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,333
- THERE'S NO ONE WHISPERING.

239
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,583
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I'M FINE.

240
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,083
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

241
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,833
- WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING
ISN'T WORKING.

242
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,750
YOU'RE GONNA FREAK THEM OUT
EVEN MORE, DUDE.

243
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,500
WE DON'T WANT THEM
TO SCREAM, DO WE? 

244
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE WE
SHOULD KEEP OUR DISTANCE.

245
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,833
- Both: TIPTOE, TIPTOE.

246
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,375
TIPTOE, TIPTOE, TIPTOE.

247
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,833
- ( gasps )
- AAH!

248
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,541
- ( silent scream )

249
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,291
- ( grunts )

250
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,125
- ( whimpers )

251
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,166
- MIZUKI, CALM DOWN.
WE'LL BE FINE.

252
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,208
- HUH?
- FACE MY ULTIMATE CURSE.

253
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,875
- ( silent scream )

254
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,583
- ( gasps )

255
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,875
- ( whimpers )
RIGHT.  I'M NOT SCARED.

256
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,750
WE'RE FINE.  I'M SORRY.

257
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,000
- DON'T BE.
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL.

258
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,666
- SHE'S SCARED.
- TRUE.

259
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,458
DUDE, LOOK. I GOT IT.
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HER,

260
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET HER
DEAL IN HER OWN WAY.

261
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,166
- OKAY, WHY DO I
HAVE TO DO THAT?

262
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,458
- SHE WANTS TO BE
A CLOSER FRIEND TO US.

263
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,875
ONE WE CAN RELY ON
AND WHO DOESN'T NEED SAVING.

264
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,833
- ( gasps ) YUUJI, YOU COULD
HAVE TOLD ME THAT EARLIER.

265
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,791
- OR YOU COULD HAVE
JUST LISTENED TO HER.

266
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,625
SHE COMPLAINED A LOT ABOUT
ALWAYS BEING HELPED BY EVERYONE

267
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,291
WHEN SHE DIDN'T NEED IT.

268
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,958
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

269
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,916
- ( moaning )

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,375
- ( murmurs )

271
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,750
- JUST KEEP WALKING.

272
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,333
WE'RE FINE, AREN'T WE?

273
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,500
- YES, WE ARE.
AND I'M NOT SCARED.

274
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,708
I'M NOT SCARED BECAUSE 
THOSE AREN'T EVEN REAL.

275
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,250
- YOU CAN DO THIS.
I BELIEVE IN YOU, HIMEJI.

276
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,041
- DID WE MAKE IT?

277
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,708
- DAMN.
YOU TWO ARE CHICKS.

278
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,333
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE
SCREAMED OR SOMETHING BY NOW?

279
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,083
- THEY'RE JUST
ANOTHER OBSTACLE.

280
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,583
ALTHOUGH I WAS REALLY HOPING
THIS WOULD BE OUR MOMENT

281
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,166
TO TRASH THOSE LOSERS
YOSHII AND SAKAMOTO. 

282
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,041
- YEAH, I BET THEY RAN
THE HELL OUT OF HERE. 

283
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,416
- LOSERS AND COWARDS.

284
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,375
- THEY ARE NEITHER LOSERS
NOR COWARDS.

285
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,500
- Both: HUH?
- TAKE IT BACK.

286
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,541
- HUH?
- ( both laugh )

287
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,541
- YOU DON'T KNOW THEM
VERY WELL, DO YOU?

288
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,958
- THEY'RE ALWAYS
GETTING INTO TROUBLE,

289
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,958
AND THEIR GRADES ARE
COMPLETE AND UTTER CRAP.

290
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,208
IF THOSE TWO ASSES
AREN'T LOSERS,

291
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,458
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHO IS.

292
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,041
- SHE BRINGS UP
A GOOD POINT THOUGH.

293
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,958
GARBAGE MIGHT BE A BETTER
TERM FOR THOSE TWO.

294
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,541
- HOLD ON.
THAT WAS TOO FAR.

295
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,375
YOU ARE BEING
TERRIBLY RUDE TO GARBAGE.

296
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
- ( both laugh )

297
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,875
- TRUE, GARBAGE AT LEAST
HAS THE COURTESY

298
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,541
TO STAY IN THE DUMP
WHERE IT BELONGS.

299
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,958
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
THEY'RE IDIOTIC LOSERS

300
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,875
WHO ARE TOO DAMN CHICKEN
TO FIGHT THEIR OWN BATTLES.

301
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,125
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO AWFUL?

302
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,083
- ( beeping )

303
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,625
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT

304
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,541
AKIHISA AND YUUJI'S GRADES
AREN'T THE BEST

305
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,208
IN LIKE THE WHOLE
ENTIRE WORLD,

306
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,000
AND YEAH, MAYBE THEY DO
HAVE A WAY OF GETTING

307
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,333
INTO TROUBLE A LOT,

308
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,791
BUT THAT DOES NOT 
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT

309
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,583
TO SAY SUCH MEAN
AND HATEFUL THINGS ABOUT THEM.

310
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,833
YOU DON'T KNOW THEM.
THEY'RE TWO OF THE KINDEST

311
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,666
AND MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE I'VE
EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO MEET.

312
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,833
- THAT COULD BE,
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE LIKELY

313
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,583
YOU JUST DON'T REALIZE
HOW STUPID THEY ACTUALLY ARE.

314
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,166
- AND HOW STUPID ARE YOU
TO JUDGE SOMEONE

315
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,833
BASED ON THEIR
GRADES IN SCHOOL?

316
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO LIFE THAN THAT.

317
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,916
SOME THINGS CAN'T BE 
MEASURED WITH SCORES!

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
- JEEZ, WILL YOU STOP YELLING?

319
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,250
THEY'RE LOWER THAN DIRT
AND WE DON'T CARE,

320
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,375
SO JUST GET OVER IT.
- THEY'RE NOT LOWER THAN DIRT!

321
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,791
- ( beeping )
- AND THEY'RE NOT LOSERS AT ALL!

322
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,000
YOU'RE THE STUPID ONES!

323
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,833
- ( beeping continues )
- SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP.

324
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,583
YOU'VE BEEN DISQUALIFIED.
GET OUT.

325
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,250
- YOU'RE THE ONE YELLING NOW.

326
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,791
WE'RE LEAVING.
COME ON, MIZUKI.

327
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,458
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT
SHE SAID, YUUJI?

328
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,208
APPARENTLY YOU AND I 
ARE PRETTY WONDERFUL.

329
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,875
- THAT'S NEWS TO ME.

330
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,875
I MEAN, I'M NOT
AS BAD AS YOU ARE,

331
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,500
BUT I WOULD HAVE BET MONEY
THAT I WAS A GIANT LOSER. 

332
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,041
- ME TOO.  IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M AS BAD AS YOU.

333
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,458
BUT I COULD HAVE SWORN I WAS
LOWER THAN DIRT, AM I RIGHT?

334
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,875
- TOO BAD THEY GOT
DISQUALIFIED.

335
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,208
TALK ABOUT A WASTE. SHE
DIDN'T SCREAM THAT WHOLE TIME,

336
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,458
AND IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.
- I KNOW RIGHT?

337
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,541
IT'S JUST A DUMB GAME.

338
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,375
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE
IT SO SERIOUSLY.

339
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,333
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S UP TO US. 

340
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,375
- YES, IT IS.
SHALL WE?

341
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,916
- Both: GET READY, YOU BASTARDS.
IT'S ON NOW.

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,250
- COME ON.

343
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,041
I'M KIND OF OVER WAITING
FOR THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW?

344
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,708
- YEAH, BUT WHY WOULD
THEY WANT TO SHOW UP?

345
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,000
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL WIN
WITH THEIR SCORES.

346
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,666
- SURPRISE.
WE SHOWED UP.

347
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,791
- WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?
- FOR REAL.

348
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,666
IT'S ABOUT FREAKING TIME.
LET'S DO THIS!

349
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,250
- NOT SO FAST. WE HAVEN'T
CHOSEN THE PENALTY YET.

350
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- HOPE YOU'RE NOT TRYING

351
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,833
TO GET OUT OF THIS,
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

352
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,583
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY
NOT FREAKING OUT?

353
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,666
IT WAS YOU THAT MENTIONED
THE PENALTY IN THE FIRST PLACE,

354
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,666
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

355
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,500
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT
KIND OF PENALTY?

356
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,958
- HOW ABOUT THE LOSERS DO
WHATEVER THE WINNERS SAY?

357
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,458
SOUND GOOD ENOUGH TO YOU?

358
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,000
- SURE.  WE CAN WORK WITH THAT.
- LET'S GET STARTED THEN.

359
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,000
- All: SUMMON!

360
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,833
- WHAT KIND OF CRAP SCORES
ARE THOSE?

361
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,750
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL
BEAT US WITH THOSE NUMBERS.

362
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,083
- YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT.
READY TO DO THIS, AKI?

363
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,500
- BORN READY, YUUJI, MY MAN.
( chuckles )

364
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,666
- Both: GO!

365
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,000
- DAMN IT! THOSE IDIOTS
ARE RUNNING AWAY.

366
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,666
- WELL, LET'S GO
CATCH THEM THEN.

367
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,750
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY DOING?

368
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,500
- WHERE DID THEY GO?

369
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,791
- I THINK I HEARD THEM
OVER THERE.

370
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,291
- ( both panting )

371
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
- THE HAUNTED HOUSE
ISN'T MAKING THIS EASY.

372
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,208
- Yuuji: YOU BOYS AREN'T
ALREADY TIRED, ARE YOU? 

373
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,666
- THE HALLWAY
BACK OVER THERE.

374
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,208
DAMN IT.
- HEY, UPPER CLASSMEN GIRLS,

375
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,875
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.
- WHY, YOU--!

376
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,083
- Akihisa: DUDE, YOU GUYS 
ARE SLOWER THAN I THOUGHT.

377
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,958
- Yuuji:
HEY NOW, THAT'S RUDE.

378
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,875
- Akihisa: COME ON, THEY ACT
LIKE THEY'VE NEVER RUN BEFORE.

379
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,791
- Yuuji:
AW, GIVE THEM A BREAK.

380
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,750
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE 
GIVING US ALL THEY GOT.

381
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,833
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BOYS?

382
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,958
- YOSHII AND SAKAMOTO,
GET OUT HERE!

383
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,791
- Yuuji: WHY DON'T YOU USE
THOSE BIG OLD BRAINS OF YOURS

384
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,708
AND FIND US ALREADY? 
- Akihisa: SERIOUSLY,

385
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,125
I'M GETTING TIRED
OF HIDING.

386
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,791
HOW HAVE THEY NOT
FOUND US YET?

387
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,875
- ( both chuckle )

388
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,375
- WE KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

389
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,375
- YEAH, WE CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH
IT, LOSERS. THEY'RE GONE!

390
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,000
- DID WE LEAVE
THE PHYSICS FIELD?

391
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:01,958
( gasps )

392
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,333
- ( beeping )

393
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,791
- I DO APOLOGIZE,

394
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,208
BUT THIS IS A DECOY.

395
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
- YOU DIDN'T SEE 
THROUGH ANYTHING.

396
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,083
- I DON'T GET IT!
- MAY WE HAVE YOUR PERMISSION

397
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,958
TO SUMMON?
- YES, YOU MAY.  I APPROVE.

398
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,916
- Akihisa and Yuuji:
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,666
SUMMON!

400
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,333
- GUESS WHAT? WE'RE IN THE MATH
FIELD NOW, SUCKERS. YOU CAN'T

401
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,083
FIGHT WITH YOUR FAVORITE
LITTLE PHYSICS SCORES ANYMORE.

402
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,416
- NO! THAT WAS
A DIRTY TRICK.

403
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,416
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
SO UPSET ABOUT?

404
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,166
THERE'S NO RULES SAYING WE CAN'T
CHANGE AROUND THE SUBJECTS

405
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,916
AT CHECKPOINTS.
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,166
TOO AFRAID TO FIGHT US WITH 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN PHYSICS?

407
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,833
COME ON.
- DON'T BE STUPID.

408
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,041
WE'RE JUST AS AWESOME
AT MATH AS WE ARE SCIENCE.

409
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,708
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA
LOSE TO YOU IDIOTS, REGARDLESS.

410
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,041
- Both: SUMMON!

411
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,666
WHAT?  NO.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

412
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,833
THOSE TWO CRAZY PEOPLE
HURT OUR SCORES THIS MORNING.

413
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,625
- Both:
THEY PLANNED THE WHOLE THING!

414
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,708
- NO!

415
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,375
- STOP SCREWING AROUND!

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,625
- ( shouts )

417
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,291
- ( groans )

418
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,708
- IT'S TOO LATE TO STRUGGLE.

419
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,458
MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE IT UP.

420
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,041
- NEVER.

421
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,291
- Yuuji: IDIOTS ARE INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

422
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,375
WHEN THEY GET DESPERATE,

423
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,125
THEY EXHIBIT A DOWNRIGHT
MANIC ABILITY

424
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,541
TO COME THROUGH.

425
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,375
YOU MAY HAVE BETTER
GRADES THAN WE DO, 

426
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,208
BUT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT 
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT NUMBERS.

427
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,916
IT'S CALLED STRATEGY,
AND IT'S ABOUT TO KICK YOUR ASS.

428
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,083
- Tsunemura: WHY DON'T YOU
SHUT THE HELL UP?

429
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
GET ON WITH IT.
- ( Avatars shouting )

430
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,666
- Yuuji:
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

431
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,000
- Both: IT'S HIS HEAD!

432
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,291
- Yuuji: HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO LOSE TO A COUPLE OF LOSERS?

433
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,750
- ( both gasp )
- BUT HOW?

434
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,083
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

435
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,291
- Both: HOW DID WE LOSE
TO TWO IDIOTS?

436
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.  WE WON.

437
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,083
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO
FACE THE PENALTY.

438
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,458
- GREAT. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE US DO?

439
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,125
- YOU HAVE TO ASK?
IT'S OBVIOUS.

440
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,833
HIMEJI? ( gasps )
- YOSHII?

441
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,041
- HEY, SHOUKO.

442
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,416
- YOU'LL FIND MIZUKI
UP ON THE ROOFTOP.

443
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,125
GO TO HER NOW.
- ( chuckles )

444
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,333
ON MY WAY.
THANKS A LOT.

445
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,708
- THAT WAS MIGHTY
CONSIDERATE OF YOU.

446
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,708
- NO IT WASN'T.
I JUST HAVE A SOFT SPOT

447
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,083
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED
BUT STILL GO FOR IT ANYWAY.

448
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,666
- HMM?

449
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,583
- I LIKE IT A LOT.

450
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,041
- WELL, I SURE
DON'T GET SCARED.

451
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,500
AND I'M NOT A BIG "GO FOR
IT ANYWAY" KIND OF GUY.

452
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,125
- ( chuckles )

453
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,291
YOU'RE SO CUTE WHEN
YOU'RE IN DENIAL, YUUJI.

454
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,791
- HUH?

455
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,625
AKIHISA.

456
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,416
- HEY.  EVERYBODY'S
GONNA GO GET CREPES

457
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,166
TO CELEBRATE OUR WIN.
- DID YOU KNOW,

458
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,583
THOSE UPPER CLASSMEN CAME
UP HERE JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO

459
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,333
AND APOLOGIZED TO ME.

460
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,500
THEY DID THAT BECAUSE OF YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

461
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,416
THAT WAS SWEET.

462
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,916
I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SO DRAMATIC

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,750
AND ALWAYS
CAUSING YOU TROUBLE.

464
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,166
- YOU DON'T DO THAT.
( chuckles )

465
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,083
LISTEN, I REALIZE YOU'RE
NOT A PRINCESS, OKAY?

466
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,333
- HUH?

467
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,083
- A PRINCESS WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH

468
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,500
OR SMART ENOUGH TO STAND UP
TO THOSE GUYS LIKE YOU DID.

469
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,708
- OHH. THAT WASN'T
A BIG DEAL.

470
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,083
- THANKS, HIMEJI.

471
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,958
IT MADE ME REALLY HAPPY.

472
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,375
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU GOT YUUJI
AND ME TO FOCUS FOR ONCE.

473
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,791
- OH, THANK YOU, AKIHISA.

474
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,833
THAT'S SO NICE
OF YOU TO SAY.

475
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,708
- ( chuckles )

476
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,208
YOU WANT TO GET GOING NOW?

477
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,958
I'M PRETTY SURE
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.

478
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,458
- WAIT, NOT YET.
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO

479
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,458
ASK YOU ABOUT FIRST.
- SOMETHING LIKE WHAT?

480
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,375
- IT'S, UM... WELL...

481
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,958
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

482
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,875
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD 
START CALLING ME MIZUKI

483
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,625
INSTEAD OF HIMEJI
FROM NOW ON?

484
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,541
- WHAT?!
- IT'S JUST THAT YOU'VE BEEN

485
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,958
CALLING MINAMI BY HER
FIRST NAME FOR LIKE EVER.

486
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
BUT YOU AND I HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER

487
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,875
EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS,
AND YOU STILL

488
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,708
DON'T CALL ME BY MINE.
- YEAH, BUT THE THING IS

489
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,625
THERE'S A REALLY COMPLICATED
REASON FOR THAT THOUGH.

490
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,583
- BUT WHAT'S SO
COMPLICATED ABOUT IT?

491
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,791
- IT'S JUST THAT YOU AND I...

492
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,583
I MEAN, WE BOTH WENT TO THE SAME
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, RIGHT?

493
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,750
- WE DID.
- SO WHEN I TRY, YOU KNOW,

494
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,250
LIKE SAYING YOUR FIRST NAME,

495
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,166
IT JUST SOUNDS WEIRD IN THE
VOICE I HAVE NOW, THAT'S ALL.

496
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,083
- THAT'S A BIG LIE! SINCE WE
STARTED HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER

497
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,000
I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU EVEN ONCE
TRY TO CALL ME BY MY FIRST NAME.

498
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,000
- THAT'S, WELL, 'CAUSE--

499
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,583
DON'T LAUGH.
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T LAUGH.

500
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,708
- I PROMISE I WON'T.

501
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,708
- YOU SWEAR?
- I SWEAR IT.

502
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,250
- OKAY, WELL, HERE I GO THEN.
- YEAH?

503
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,625
- I PRACTICE IT AT HOME.
- WHAT?

504
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,416
- IT'S TRUE.

505
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,916
I PRACTICE SAYING
YOUR FIRST NAME. 

506
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,625
- OH.
( gasps )

507
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,583
- NO, I WAS JUST KIDDING.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

508
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,250
( gasps )

509
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,541
- ( giggles )

510
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,041
OKAY.  THEN I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD TELL YOU

511
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,416
A SECRET OF MINE TOO,
SHOULDN'T I?

512
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,750
HERE I GO.

513
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,291
I'VE ALREADY HAD
MY FIRST LOVE.

514
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,541
AND IT'S STILL
GOING STRONG. 

515
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,458
LET'S HURRY UP AND GO.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE, DO WE?

516
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,000
- ( gasps ) HOLD ON A SEC,
HIMEJI, WHAT-- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

517
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,291
- WHAT THE CRAP, AKI?

518
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,000
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU
WERE COMING UP HERE?

519
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,708
- MINAMI?
- YOU PROMISED ME

520
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,875
THAT YOU WOULD STAY BY
MY SIDE FOREVER, YOU JERK.

521
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,541
- ( screams )

522
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,041
- WAIT, WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

523
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,291
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
- Yuuji: OUT OF MY WAY!

524
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,458
MOVE, AKI!

525
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,166
- ACCORDING TO THE
CONTRACT YOU SIGNED,

526
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,750
IF WE DIDN'T REACH
THE GOAL TOGETHER,

527
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,208
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET
MARRIED IMMEDIATELY. 

528
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,666
- GET HER AWAY FROM ME!
- YUUJI, WAIT FOR ME!

529
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,666
- THERE IS NO ESCAPE. 
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

530
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,375
- YOU HAVE SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO!

531
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,500
- I GUESS IT'S NICE TO KNOW
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

532
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,500
- ( theme music playing )

533
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

534
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,541
- ( all shouting )

535
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,708
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS 
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

536
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,000
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S
NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAY?!

537
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,208
- ( chuckles )

538
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,250
- AND THERE THOSE
KIDS GO AGAIN.

539
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,416
WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.
