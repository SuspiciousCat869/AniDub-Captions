1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
- Akihisa: ON A NIGHT
ILLUMINATED BY COUNTLESS STARS

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,916
AND A FLEETING CRESCENT MOON,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,166
I WAS BEING PRESSURED BY

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,583
THE SUSPICIOUSLY SUPPORTIVE
GIRLS IN MY CLASS.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,750
- AKI, CAN WE DO IT?

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,375
- AKIHISA, PLEASE.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

7
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,125
PLEASE, CAN WE DO IT?

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,875
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,791
- BUT WHY?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,083
- YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T WANT TO?

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,000
- IT'S NOT THAT.
I JUST CAN'T.

12
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,958
- WELL, THEN IF THAT'S
 WHAT YOU REALLY WANT,

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,333
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO IT
WITH KOUTA INSTEAD.

14
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,333
- OKAY?  AKI?

15
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:00,041
- OKAY.  I'M COOL WITH THAT.

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,958
- AWESOME!  KOUTA, DID YOU
HEAR WHAT AKI JUST TOLD US?

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,125
YOU GET ONE MORE.
- AAH!

18
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,000
- Fukuhara:
THIS IS CALLED ISHI-DAKI.

19
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,416
IT'S A FORM OF TORTURE
USED IN THE EDO ERA.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,666
- ( boys groaning, screaming )

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,041
- AFFAIRS WILL NOT
BE PERMITTED.

22
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,208
- NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
FOR MORE, AKIHISA.

23
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,708
- Akihisa:
NO!

24
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,958
- ( dog barking )

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,083
- Fukuhara: WOW, THE GIRLS
 ARE KINDA BALLSY TONIGHT.

26
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,458
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

27
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,916
- Fukuhara:
EARLIER THAT MORNING...

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,750
THINGS GOT A BIT STRANGE.

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,458
IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE
THEIR ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP.

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,416
AKIHISA RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,333
WITHIN IT WAS A MESSAGE--

32
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,291
A MESSAGE THAT WOULD BLOW
OUR LITTLE ANTI-HERO'S MIND.

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,125
- ( Akihisa's voice )
"DEAR AKIHISA,

34
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,083
I KNOW YOUR SECRET"?

35
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,625
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS TO ME?

36
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,125
- WHAT'S WRONG, AKIHISA?

37
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,500
YOU SEEM KINDA BUMMED OUT
THIS MORNING.

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,916
- HUH?  WHAT?!
NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,583
- WHY ARE YOU ACTING WEIRD
THIS TIME?

40
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,791
AND WHAT'S BEHIND YOUR BACK?
- MY BACK?  WHAT?

41
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,291
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

42
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,041
- OKAY.  YOU MUST BE 
HIDING A LOVE LETTER.

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,500
YEAH?

44
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,291
- WHY WOULD YOU EVER
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

45
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,833
YOU KNOW HOW THESE GUYS GET.

46
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,208
- BESIDES THAT, WHO WOULD
GIVE YOU A LOVE LETTER?

47
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,916
TALK ABOUT RIDICULOUS.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,375
- TALK ABOUT YOUR FACE!

49
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,833
PEOPLE SEND ME LETTERS.
TAKE TODAY--

50
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,583
- NEXT TIME YOU'RE DEAD.

51
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,500
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
MISS MINAMI.

52
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,416
- NOW WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE?

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,083
- ALL RIGHT! I WAS HIDING
A LETTER FROM YOU.  IT WAS BL--

54
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
WAIT, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL PEOPLE

55
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,333
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING BLACKMAILED.

56
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,500
THE BAD GUYS ALWAYS SAY
NOT TO ON TV.

57
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,666
- "BLA--" WHAT?
- WHAT "BLA--" WHAT?

58
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,500
- Fukuhara:
WHEN HUMANS ARE IN STRESS MODE,

59
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,458
THEIR SYNAPSES FIRE RANDOMLY,

60
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,125
CAUSING A SCATTERED
THOUGHT PATTERN.

61
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,375
THIS IS CALLED
A KALEIDOSCOPE OF MEMORIES.

62
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,250
- YES!  UH, BLACK COMPETITIVE
SWIMWEAR SOCIETY INVITATION

63
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,583
WAS WHAT I WAS HIDING.
- WHAT?

64
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,416
- Fukuhara: AKIHISA HAD
WATCHED A DOCUMENTARY CALLED,

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,041
"COMPETITIVE SWIMMER: 24-HOUR
CLOSE-UP" THE NIGHT BEFORE.

66
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,041
- OKAY, SO ARE YOU GONNA GO?
- MAYBE!  YES.  I DON'T KNOW...

67
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,375
I THINK THEY'RE COOL.
- ( sighs ) JEEZ.

68
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,916
- OH, CRAP. I'M GETTING CLOSE TO
THAT POINT OF NO RETURN THING.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,875
- WHAT DO YOU FIND SO COOL 
ABOUT COMPETITIVE SWIMMERS?

70
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,875
- HUH?  UH...

71
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,375
THINK, AKI.
WHAT MAKES THEM COOL?

72
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,791
I LIKE WHAT THEY WEAR.

73
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,458
PERFECT!  NOW I SOUND
LIKE A TOTAL WEIRDO!

74
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,125
- MINAMI, EVERYTHING
HE JUST SAID WAS A LIE.

75
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,416
- WHAT? THAT STUPID STORY
SOUNDED SO REAL,

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,125
I ALMOST BELIEVED HIM.

77
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,875
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
THE TRUTH THIS TIME,

78
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,708
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.
SPIT IT OUT, JERKY!

79
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,416
- OKAY.  I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
A BLACKMAIL NOTE THIS MORNING.

80
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,458
- AH!  WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.

81
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,541
- WHAT DOES THIS
"MIGHT BE A BLACKMAIL NOTE" SAY?

82
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,583
- OH.  "STOP TRYING TO GET
CLOSER TO THE GIRLS

83
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,250
WHO ARE ALWAYS AROUND YOU
OR ELSE."  THAT'S ALL.

84
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,125
- WHOA.  IF YOU ASK ME,
IT SOUNDS LIKE

85
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,166
THE BLACKMAILER
IS JEALOUS OF YOU.

86
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,250
- AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

87
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,916
THERE ARE ONLY TWO GIRLS
IN THIS CLASS.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,125
HIMEJI AND HIDEYOSHI.

89
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,541
WHOEVER IT IS MUST NOT
LIKE ONE OF THEM.

90
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,458
- YOU DO REALIZE SHE
MOST LIKELY JUST LEFT

91
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,000
TO GO GET A METAL BAT, RIGHT?

92
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,708
- WHY?!  I THOUGHT THAT WAS
A GOOD GUESS.

93
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,291
- HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.

94
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,458
WHAT ARE YOU BEING
BLACKMAILED WITH ANYWAY?

95
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,750
- UH, I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

96
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,583
"IF YOU REFUSE
TO HEED MY WARNING,

97
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,541
I'LL RELEASE THESE PICTURES."

98
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,916
COOL, THERE'S PICTURES!

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,125
- HEY, THOSE ARE FROM THE LAST
 SCHOOL FESTIVAL, AREN'T THEY?

100
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,833
- BUT WHO TOOK THESE?

101
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,208
SURELY THEY WON'T HAVE
ANYTHING CRAZIER THAN THIS.

102
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,041
IT'S TRUNKS, SO IT'S OKAY.
IT'S TRUNKS, SO IT'S OKAY.

103
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,333
IT'S TRUNKS, SO IT'S OKAY.
JUST TRUNKS!

104
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,958
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
OVER THERE?

105
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,958
- YEAH, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
THAT BAD IN THESE PICTURES.

106
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:55,916
I THINK.

107
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,083
NO!

108
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
DON'T LOOK AT IT!
I'M HIDEOUS!

109
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,625
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO ASHAMED!

110
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,500
- DUDE, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

111
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,458
- IT CAN.

112
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,333
THAT KIND OF POWER
IS DANGEROUS.

113
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,583
WHAT EVIL VILLAIN
IS DOING THIS TO ME?

114
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,416
- YOU'RE JUST BEING DRAMATIC.

115
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,750
EVERYONE WEARS
A FRENCH MAID COSTUME

116
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,750
AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE.

117
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,375
- GOOD MORNING, YOU GUYS.

118
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,041
LOVELY DAY, HUH?
HOW IS IT GOING?

119
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,583
- YOU KNOW,
SAME OL', SAME OL'.

120
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,166
- PERFECT TIMING.
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW

121
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,000
THOSE PICTURES TO HIMEJI,
SO SHE CAN PROVE

122
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,250
THEY'RE NOT WORTH
FREAKING OUT ABOUT.

123
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,958
- SHOW ME WHAT PICTURES?

124
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,750
- OKAY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU SAW A PICTURE OF AKI

125
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,083
DRESSED UP IN A MAID COSTUME?

126
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,583
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

127
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,208
I WOULD PROBABLY BUY A SCANNER.

128
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,125
- HUH?
- THAT WAY, I WOULD BE ABLE

129
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,666
TO DOWNLOAD THE IMAGE.

130
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,041
AND THEN SHARE AKIHISA'S CHARM

131
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,583
WITH THE WORLD WIDE WEB.

132
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,458
- DON'T JUMP, MAN!
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

133
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,833
- LET GO OF ME! I HAVE
NO REASON TO LIVE ANYMORE.

134
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,625
- COME BACK INSIDE. LET'S GO
GET SOME ADVICE FROM KOUTA.

135
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,458
- OF COURSE!  THAT IS
AN AWESOME PLAN, HIDEYOSHI.

136
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,625
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS
FROM MY WIFE.

137
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,041
- I THINK YOU MEAN HUSBAND?
- I THINK THEY'RE BOTH WRONG

138
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,041
IN SO VERY MANY WAYS.

139
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
- ( laughing )

140
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,000
- Aki: OH, CRAP.

141
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,416
THERE YOU ARE.

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,833
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU, KOUTA.

143
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,250
- YEAH, WELL,
GET IN LINE, BUDDY.

144
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,208
I WAS HERE FIRST.
- YOU NEED ADVICE TOO?

145
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,375
- APPARENTLY, YUUJI
HAS A WEDDING SOON.

146
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,708
- YEAH, WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THAT.
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

147
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,750
I HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS.
PEOPLE ARE ABOUT TO THINK

148
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,416
I'M A SICKO FREAK WHO ENJOYS
DRESSING UP LIKE A GIRL!

149
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
- SO WHAT?!  PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW
YOU'RE A SICKO FREAK.

150
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,166
- SHUT UP AND GO BACK
TO YOUR WIFE.

151
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,750
GETTING MARRIED
HAS MADE YOU SUCK!

152
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,625
- LIKE THE WORDS OF A PERVERT
ARE GONNA HURT ME?

153
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,000
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO WEARING
YOUR BIG SISTER'S CLOTHES?

154
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,500
- ( both growling )

155
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,666
( crying )

156
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,125
- YOU GUYS ARE SO SENSITIVE.
YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE TRASH TALK.

157
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,291
- SO BACK TO ME... I MANAGED 
TO GET THIS AWAY FROM SHOUKO.

158
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,875
IF I WIN THE TOURNAMENT, 
I'M GONNA PROPOSE TO YOU.

159
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,625
I LOVE YOU, SHOUKO!
- HUH?

160
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,083
- Fukuhara: THESE ARE THE
WORDS AKIHISA AND HIDEYOSHI

161
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,333
FABRICATED AT THE FUMIZUKI
ACADEMY SCHOOL FESTIVAL.

162
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,916
- ( laughs nervously )

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,875
THAT SHOUKO CRACKS ME UP.

164
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,291
WHO WOULD HAVE FIGURED SHE'D
WANT THOSE WORDS RECORDED?

165
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,541
- I WOULD!
SHE'S GONNA PLAY IT FOR HER DAD

166
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,000
AS PROOF OF OUR ENGAGEMENT.

167
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,750
- OH.

168
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,458
- SHE COULDN'T DO THIS HERSELF.

169
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,250
SHE'S AN IDIOT WHEN IT COMES
TO TECHNICAL STUFF.

170
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,791
WHICH MEANS THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMEONE ELSE BEHIND THIS.

171
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,333
- WHAT DID YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT, AKI?

172
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,500
- I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY
TO SAY THIS.

173
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,583
AN UNDERWEAR PICTURE OF ME
IN A MAID'S COSTUME

174
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,666
IS ABOUT TO HIT THE INTERNET
BIG TIME!

175
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,583
- HMM?  HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

176
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,500
- WELL, IT'S KINDA LIKE THIS.

177
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,500
BLAH BLAH BLAH.
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

178
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,291
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

179
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,583
SO WHERE'S THE PICTURE?
- OH, YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

180
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,833
- NO!
- NO WHAT?!

181
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,625
- ( sighs )

182
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,958
THE ANGLE IN THAT PIC
IS BETTER THAN THE ONE I TOOK.

183
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,541
- AAH!
THERE'S A TRAITOR IN OUR MIDST.

184
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,750
- OH, STOP FREAKING OUT.

185
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,541
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GIVING 'EM
AWAY FOR FREE.

186
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,833
- SO WHAT?!
YOU MAKE MONEY OFF OF ME?

187
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,250
- I SEE.  IT APPEARS THAT
AKI'S IN THE SAME BOAT I AM.

188
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,916
- YES, YOU'RE BOTH VICTIMS
OF BLACKMAIL, WIRETAPPING,

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,666
AND SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS.
- KOUTA?

190
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,625
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO INVESTIGATE.

191
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,125
AS A REWARD, I'LL BRING
SOME DIRTY MAGAZINES

192
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,375
THAT YOU CAN BORROW.

193
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,125
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
- AND I'LL LET YOU HAVE

194
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,583
HALF OF MY NAUGHTY TREASURE
COLLECTION.

195
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,083
- THIS IS EXTREMELY
NOT A PROBLEM.

196
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,083
- ( bell tolls )

197
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
- SO THAT'S ABOUT
WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT

198
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,416
FROM ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP.
- COOL!

199
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,375
WE GET TO GO TO THE UZUKI
HIGHLANDS THIS YEAR.

200
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,125
- WOW, THAT'S KINDA SWANKY
FOR CAMP.

201
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT!

202
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,000
- AND FOR THE LAST TIME,
THERE ARE DIFFERENT

203
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
MEETING PLACES PER CLASS,
SO DON'T SCREW IT UP.

204
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,000
- CLASS "A" IS PROBABLY
GONNA GO BY A LIMOUSINE BUS

205
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,833
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- TOTALLY.

206
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,666
AND CLASS "F" WILL GET STUCK
WITH A MICRO-BUS.

207
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,416
- SPARE SEATS ARE STANDING UP.

208
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,416
NO, PROBABLY IN THE TRUNK
OR IN A BIKE RACK.

209
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,666
- CLASS "F" HAS THE DISTINCTION
 OF MEETING UP AT THE CAMPSITE.

210
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,541
- WHAT?!  WE DON'T EVEN
GET TRANSPORTATION?!

211
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,083
- Fukuhara:
LIFE JUST ISN'T FAIR.

212
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,416
- NUH-UH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- I SWEAR!

213
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,833
ARE WE THERE YET?

214
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,333
( snoring )

215
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,583
- I'M BORED.
- HUH?

216
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,416
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU READING,
MINAMI?

217
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,250
- JUST A PERSONALITY QUIZ.

218
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,250
- OOH, THAT SOUNDS WAY BETTER
THAN DOING NOTHING!

219
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,208
ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS.
- OH, WHY NOT?  LET'S SEE...

220
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,083
"AMONG FRIENDS
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX,

221
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,208
WHO DO ASSOCIATE WITH
THE FOLLOWING COLORS?

222
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,791
NUMBER ONE: GREEN;
NUMBER TWO: ORANGE;

223
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,833
NUMBER THREE: BLUE."

224
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,041
- WITH GREEN ORANGE
AND BLUE, OKAY.

225
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,083
UH, WELL,
ORANGE IS HIDEYOSHI,

226
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,625
BLUE IS HIMEJI.
GREEN CAN BE MINAMI.

227
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,083
- COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
WHY EXACTLY YOU ASSIGNED

228
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
GREEN TO ME
AND BLUE TO MIZUKI?

229
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,958
- UH.  IF I TELL HER
IT'S BECAUSE

230
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,666
I SAW HER WEARING
GREEN PANTIES BEFORE,

231
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,541
I'M GUESSING
SHE'S GONNA GET MAD.

232
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,666
- I'M NOT GONNA GET MAD.
SO YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH.

233
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,666
- BECAUSE I SAW YOU WEARING
GREEN PANTIES BEFORE.

234
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
- HEY, YUUJI, CAN YOU OPEN
THE WINDOW, PLEASE?

235
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,208
- SURE THING.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

236
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,583
ARE YOU GONNA THROW ME
OUT OF THE WINDOW?

237
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
- LET'S SEE.
GREEN IS YOUR FRIEND,

238
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,291
ORANGE IS YOUR ENERGY SOURCE
AND BLUE--

239
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,416
- EXCUSE ME!
THAT'S MY BOOK.

240
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,916
- HEY, AKI,

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,250
SHE WAS ASKING ABOUT FRIENDS
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX, RIGHT?

242
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,500
WHO WAS ORANGE AGAIN?

243
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,125
- ORANGE WAS YOU.

244
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,833
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
BECAUSE I'M KINDA FLATTERED.

245
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,416
- WOW, I WANNA KNOW TOO.
WHAT'S IT SUPPOSED TO MEAN

246
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,625
WHEN SOMEONE ASSOCIATES YOU
WITH THE COLOR BLUE?

247
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,750
- ( groans )

248
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,750
QUESTION TWO!

249
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,708
- LOOKS LIKE THAT'S 
YOUR ANSWER, HIMEJI.

250
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,583
- BETWEEN THE NUMERALS
ONE AND TEN,

251
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,375
STATE THE FIRST TWO NUMBERS
YOU THINK OF,

252
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,916
AND TELL ME IN THE SPECIFIC
ORDER YOU THOUGHT OF THEM. 

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,625
- HMM, FIVE AND SIX, I GUESS.

254
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,166
- I'M GOING WITH TWO AND SEVEN.

255
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,791
- I THINK IT'S ONE AND FOUR
FOR ME.

256
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,791
- I SUPPOSE I'LL SAY
THREE AND NINE.

257
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,625
- "THE FIRST NUMBER YOU STATED
MOST LIKELY INDICATES

258
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,166
THE WAY YOU NORMALLY PRESENT
YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE."

259
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,583
- YUUJI'S FIVE MEANS
HE'S COOL AND CYNICAL.

260
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,500
- HIDEYOSHI'S TWO MEANS
 CALM AND COMMON SENSE.

261
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,541
- AKI'S ONE MEANS
HE SHOULD DIE.

262
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,333
- MIZUKI'S THREE MEANS
SHE'S GENTLE AND CAREFUL.

263
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,916
- WAIT.  DID YOU JUST SAY
MINE MEANS I NEED TO DIE?

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,958
- "THE SECOND NUMBER YOU STATED
MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS

265
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,166
YOUR TRUE SELF THAT
YOU DON'T NORMALLY REVEAL

266
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,666
TO OTHER PEOPLE."

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,541
YUUJI'S SIX MEANS
FAIRNESS AND KINDNESS.

268
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,458
HIDEYOSHI'S SEVEN MEANS 
STRONG, FEMININE CHARMS.

269
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,458
AKI'S FOUR MEANS
HE SHOULD DIE TRAGICALLY.

270
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,291
MIZUKI'S NINE MEANS
A STRONG WILL.

271
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,875
- WAIT.  NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO DIE TRAGICALLY?

272
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,875
- ( groaning )

273
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,916
- HEY, KOUTA'S WAKING UP.
- FINALLY.

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,666
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.
- MY STOMACH IS EATING ITSELF.

275
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,666
- OH, YEAH,
I'M KINDA HUNGRY TOO.

276
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,375
- SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S LUNCHTIME, BABY.

277
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,541
- UM, ACTUALLY, YOU GUYS
ARE MORE THAN WELCOME

278
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,000
TO TRY SOME OF MY LUNCH.

279
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,916
I MADE IT ALL BY MYSELF.
- Boys: I'M GOOD!

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,541
- SORRY.
I MADE MY LUNCH TOO.

281
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,375
AND I DON'T WANT IT
TO GO TO WASTE.

282
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,125
- YEAH, I DID THE EXACT SAME
 THING THAT YUUJI JUST SAID.

283
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,541
- ME TOO.  WEIRD.

284
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,166
- NO WORRIES,
THOUGH, HIMEJI.

285
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,041
I'M SURE AKI'S
JUST DYING TO TRY SOME.

286
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,375
- YOU'D THINK,
BUT I BROUGHT MYSELF A SANDWICH.

287
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,375
- ( gobbles )

288
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,708
I'M SO SORRY, MAN.

289
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,666
MY HAND TOTALLY SLIPPED.

290
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,958
- ( laughs nervously )
BE CAREFUL THERE, YUUJI.

291
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,958
MY HAND CAN SLIP TOO!

292
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,541
- FOR YOUR SAKE THEN,
I'LL JUST KEEP

293
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,875
HOLDING IT LIKE THIS,
SO THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

294
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,333
- ( both growling )

295
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,250
- JEEZ, WHY ARE YOU GUYS
ACTING SO WEIRD?

296
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,666
SERIOUSLY.
AKI, YOU WANNA TRY THESE?

297
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,000
- YES!  THEY LOOK SUPER YUMMY!

298
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
HAVE AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

299
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,875
- YES, MINAMI,
YOU'RE THE BEST!

300
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,333
- OH, YEAH, AKI...

301
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,541
I SHOULD MENTION
SOMETHING FIRST.

302
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,166
I'M NOT SURE WHICH,
BUT A FEW OF THOSE...

303
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,958
ARE LOADED WITH HOT MUSTARD.

304
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,875
- AAH!  ARE YOU
A FRICKIN' IDIOT?!

305
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,333
MY MOUTH FEELS LIKE
IT'S ON FIRE.

306
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,916
- AKIHISA, THIS MIGHT BE
 THE BEST THING FOR YOU.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,583
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
- GOOD POINT.

308
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,125
I MIGHT BE OKAY SINCE MY TASTE
BUDS WERE JUST DESTROYED.

309
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,125
- HAVE SOME OF MINE.

310
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,375
COME ON,
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

311
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
- HECK YEAH.
GREAT, THANK YOU.

312
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,208
- Yuuji:
CHARGE TO 300-- CLEAR!

313
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,833
- ( electricity zapping )

314
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,250
- ( beeping )

315
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,916
- ( Aki murmuring )

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,458
HEY, WHERE ARE WE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

317
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
- YOU ALMOST DIED--
 AS IN, YOU STARTED

318
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,458
REPENTING SINS FROM
A FORMER LIFE ALMOST DIED.

319
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,583
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

320
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,583
WHILE YOU WERE HOVERING
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH,

321
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,625
WE FINALLY MADE IT TO
TRAINING CAMP.

322
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,833
- THIS IS OUR ROOM.

323
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,875
THEY ASSIGNED IT
TO ALL FOUR OF US.

324
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,500
- ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT
YOU'RE AWAKE,

325
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,291
IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.

326
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY BUSINESS?

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,458
- OPERATION: FIND THE CULPRIT,

328
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,708
A.K.A.,
PHOTOGRAPHER/WIRETAPPER.

329
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,958
- I'VE ALREADY MANAGED
 TO DIG UP SOME INTEL.

330
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,166
- WOW, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

331
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,083
- I FOUND REMNANTS OF DEVICES.

332
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,416
I BELIEVE THEY WERE USED
BY THE PERPETRATOR.

333
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,916
BASED ON THEIR M.O. AND
THE KIND OF EQUIPMENT THEY USED

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,916
IN THEIR SURVEILLANCE,
MY CONCLUSION IS THAT 

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,875
BOTH HEINOUS CRIMES WERE
COMMITTED BY THE SAME PERSON.

336
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,416
- AWESOME.
SO, WHO DID IT?

337
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,916
- I DON'T KNOW.

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,750
- YEAH, I GUESS NOT.
IT'D BE KINDA HARD

339
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
TO FIGURE OUT THAT FAST.
- ALL I'VE DISCOVERED

340
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,583
IS THAT THE CULPRIT
IS A FEMALE STUDENT

341
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,416
WHO HAS A BURN
ON HER BUTT.

342
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,333
- WHAT THE CRAP
DID YOU INVESTIGATE?

343
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,916
- I SET UP A SMALL CAMERA
ON THE SCHOOL GROUNDS.

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,291
THEN ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS WATCH.

345
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,833
- HEY, LOOK.

346
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,500
- THIS IS FROM INSIDE
THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

347
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,208
- WHY'S IT CENSORED?

348
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,750
- IF YOU WANNA SEE,
YOU GOTTA PAY.

349
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,291
- WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?

350
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,541
- WAIT A FREAKIN' MINUTE.
IT'S SHOUKO.

351
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,291
WHO IS SHE MESSAGING
ON HER PHONE?

352
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,708
- I'M NOT SURE.
LET'S BLOW IT UP.

353
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,875
- Hideyoshi:
 HERE WE GO.

354
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,875
IT'S AN ORDER FORM.

355
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,916
"I'D LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE
OF YUUJI'S MARRIAGE PROPOSALS."

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,083
SHE SENT IT.

357
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,541
- ( grumbles )
STUPID SHOUKO!

358
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,583
- ( cellphone rings )

359
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,541
- LOOK, SHE'S ALREADY
GOT A REPLY.

360
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,833
"THANK YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT

361
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,500
SINCE THIS IS
YOUR SECOND ORDER.

362
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,958
TRAINING CAMP STARTS TOMORROW,

363
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,625
SO I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
NEXT MONDAY."

364
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,291
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
I WAS SAVED BY TRAINING CAMP?

365
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,250
- CHECK IT OUT.
THERE'S OTHER ONES TOO.

366
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,208
CRAP.
- DUDE, YOU'RE IN THERE!

367
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,500
- I SHOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT THAT
WINDOW WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE!

368
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,916
- SO, I GUESS WE CAN CONFIRM

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
IT'S THE SAME CULPRIT
FOR REAL NOW.

370
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,958
- I THINK YOU'LL WANT
TO SEE THIS.

371
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,375
- Yuuji:
SHE'S WRITING BACK.

372
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,375
- "ALL YOUR PICTURES ARE
WONDERFUL,

373
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,791
BUT IT'LL BE A PROBLEM
IF THEY FIND OUT."

374
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,333
- ( cellphone rings )

375
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,041
- HOW CAN ANYONE
TYPE THAT FAST?!

376
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,458
- "DON'T TELL ANYONE,
BUT MY MOM TOTALLY FOUND OUT

377
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,875
WHAT I WAS DOING THE OTHER DAY
AND GOT ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

378
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,708
WHAT KIND OF MOM
USES MOXIBUSTION

379
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,625
AS A CLEANSING AND BURNS
HER DAUGHTER'S BUTT?

380
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,083
SHE SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH."

381
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,791
- AND THAT'S ALL THAT
I'VE GOT SO FAR.

382
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,208
- INTERESTING.
WE CAN ASSUME BY DAUGHTER,

383
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,166
THE CULPRIT MUST BE A GIRL
OR HIDEYOSHI.

384
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,875
- ( Hideyoshi sighs )

385
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,208
- SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A CHICK
WITH A BURNT BOOTY.

386
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,958
- WE CAN'T JUST FLIP UP
 ALL THE GIRLS' SKIRTS.

387
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,833
- EVEN IF WE HAD
AN INFRARED CAMERA,

388
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,375
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO MAKE OUT A BURN MARK.

389
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,375
- I KNOW!
IT'S ALMOST BATH TIME,

390
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,791
SO WE CAN JUST
HAVE HIDEYOSHI GO LOOK.

391
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,791
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I COULD GO LOOK.

392
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,875
I DON'T TAKE BATHS WITH GIRLS.
I'M A GUY.

393
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,541
- AKIHISA, READ
THE TRAINING CAMP GUIDEBOOK.

394
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,125
- HMM.

395
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,250
"THE BATHING TIMES FOR EACH
CLASS ARE AS FOLLOWS"...

396
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,916
AAH!

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,666
THEY'VE GIVEN HIDEYOSHI
A PRIVATE BATH TIME!

398
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,750
- WHY DO THEY ALWAYS DO THAT?

399
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,125
- DON'T MOVE, IDIOTS!

400
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,083
ALL OF YOU, PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD

401
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,666
AND LIE FACEDOWN
ON THE GROUND.

402
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

403
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,833
- WE SAID PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD

404
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,666
AND LIE FACEDOWN ON
THE GROUND!

405
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,208
- COME WITH ME.
WE DON'T HATE YOU.

406
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,500
- HEY!

407
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,375
- WHAT ARE YOU CHICKS
SO PISSED ABOUT?

408
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,833
- DON'T ACT ALL INNOCENT.
WE KNOW YOU'RE THE CULPRITS!

409
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,833
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?
- RECOGNIZE THIS?!

410
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,958
WE FOUND YOUR SECRET CAMERA

411
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,791
HIDDEN IN THE GIRLS'
CHANGING ROOM.

412
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,041
- SOMEONE PUT A HIDDEN CAMERA
IN THERE?

413
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,333
WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING?!

414
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,875
- YOU THREE WOULD DO
SUCH A THING.

415
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,500
YOU'RE THE CREEPIEST CREEPS
IN THE SCHOOL.

416
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,333
- NOT TRUE!  PEEKING
AND SETTING UP HIDDEN CAMERAS?

417
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,041
THEY WOULDN'T DARE!

418
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,291
'KAY, THEY MIGHT DARE.

419
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,333
- Both: WHAT?!

420
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,583
- SAY YOU DIDN'T DO IT, AKIHISA!

421
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,791
YOU WOULD NEVER EVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD YOU?

422
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,208
- THEY'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG,
DON'T THEY, AKI?

423
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,625
DON'T WORRY,
WE BELIEVE IN YOU.

424
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,333
- IF YOU BELIEVE IN ME...

425
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,083
THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE TORTURE
EQUIPMENT WITH YOU?

426
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO MEAN,
AKIHISA?

427
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,750
OF ALL THE TIMES
YOU COULD HAVE PEEKED ON ME,

428
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,583
YOU HAD TO GO AND DO IT
RIGHT AFTER I HAD A HUGE MEAL?

429
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,375
I-- I WAS BLOATED.

430
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,041
I'M NORMALLY WAY SKINNIER!

431
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,708
- THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT?!

432
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,333
- YEAH, AND FOR THE RECORD,

433
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,958
MY TA-TAS ARE NORMALLY BIGGER
THAN THEY ARE TODAY.

434
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,875
- LYING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING,
MINAMI.

435
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,000
- ( groans )
LADIES, ATTACK THEM AT WILL!

436
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,625
- ( girls grunting )

437
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,791
- I TAKE IT BACK.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I SWEAR!

438
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,083
MY SPLEEN.
HEY!

439
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,083
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!
OOH-HOO.

440
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:47,083
- BAD... BOY.

441
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,916
- ( groaning )
- OH, NO!

442
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
IT'S TOO LATE.
GUYS!

443
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,500
WE'RE ALL DEAD!

444
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,916
- IT'S TIME, AKIHISA.

445
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,416
- WE'RE GOING TO
TEACH YOU A LESSON.

446
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,875
- ( screams )

447
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,791
- WELL, THAT WASN'T THE NICEST
OF ACCUSATIONS, WAS IT?

448
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,833
I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY THEY TREATED ME

449
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,291
LIKE A VICTIM, THOUGH.

450
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,458
- THEY OVERREACTED TO
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

451
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,250
WE HADN'T EVEN
PEEKED ON THEM YET.

452
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,458
- THEIR CAMERA WASN'T
ONE OF MINE, BY THE WAY.

453
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
- SHE CRUSHED THAT THING
WITH HER BARE HAND.

454
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,250
- IF THEY'RE GONNA BE
LIKE THAT, THEN WHO CARES?

455
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,458
- YOUR WORDS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

456
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,875
- THEY'VE ALREADY MADE
US DO THE TIME,

457
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,333
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL
COMMIT THE CRIME.

458
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,250
- YOU DON'T MEAN--
- HELL YEAH!

459
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,041
I'M GONNA PEEK ON THE GIRLS
TAKING BATHS FOR REAL.

460
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,666
- YUUJI, IF YOU WANNA SEE
SHOUKO NAKED,

461
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,375
I'M SURE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK HER.

462
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,000
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

463
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,791
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
I DON'T WANNA SEE HER NAKED.

464
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,583
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT SHOUKO.
IT'S ABOUT FINDING

465
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,416
THE BOOTY BURN MARK CULPRIT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

466
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,458
AT FIRST I THOUGHT PEEKING ON
THEM WAS CROSSING THE LINE,

467
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,041
BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA
BE LIKE THAT,

468
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,958
THEN I SAY SCREW THE LINE!
I'M GONNA LOOK AT

469
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,041
EVERY GIRL'S BUTT UNTIL
I FIND ONE WITH A BURN ON IT!

470
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,250
- I RECOGNIZE THAT CAMERA
AND MICROPHONE.

471
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,166
THEY'RE THE SAME ONES
USED BY THE BLACKMAILER.

472
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,666
- GET OUTTA TOWN!

473
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,500
- SO THE BURNT BUTT GIRL WHO'S
BLACKMAILING YUUJI AND ME

474
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,708
IS THE SAME PERSON

475
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,708
WHO WAS PEEKING ON THE
GIRLS' CHANGING ROOM

476
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,958
EVEN THOUGH THEY
THOUGHT IT WAS US.

477
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,291
- THERE'S NO REASON TO HESITATE.
SHE SET US UP.

478
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,750
- OKAY, I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

479
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,791
- THEIR BATHING TIME
IS IN 30 MINUTES.

480
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,708
THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR.

481
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,125
- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
 LET'S GET IN THERE, BOYS!

482
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,833
- ( all shouting )

483
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,541
- STOP IMMEDIATELY!

484
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,083
NOW COME ON, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE, GUYS.

485
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,750
- ISN'T THAT
THE CHEMISTRY TEACHER?

486
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,500
- WHO CARES?
JUST KNOCK HIM DOWN.

487
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,250
- I'D REALLY RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

488
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,875
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR!
SUMMON!

489
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,708
- NO WAY!
- AH, TERRIFIC, THIS IS NEW.

490
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,708
- Fukuhara: LIKE PROBATIONARY
STUDENTS' AVATARS,

491
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,125
THE TEACHERS' AVATARS
ARE ALSO CAPABLE

492
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,416
OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE.

493
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,791
- WHATEVER, DUDE.

494
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,833
WE'RE GONNA CRUSH YOU RIGHT
ALONG WITH YOUR AVATAR.

495
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,041
- I'LL JUST KEEP RUNNING.
- NO, WAIT.

496
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,458
BEFORE YOU GO,

497
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,291
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHAT
YOUR CHEMISTRY SCORE WAS.

498
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,916
- IF I HAD JUST ONE MORE POINT
ON MY TEST,

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,083
JUST ONE MORE POINT...
- YEAH, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

500
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,666
- IT'D BE A TWO.

501
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,416
- GOOD TO KNOW.
KEEP RUNNING.

502
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
- IT'LL BE HARD TO WIN
IF YOU HAVE TO FIGHT HIM ALONE.

503
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,791
I'LL STAY AND HELP YOU OUT.
- YOU'RE THE MAN, HIDEYOSHI.

504
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,791
- Both: SUMMON!

505
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,666
- ( Avatars grunting )

506
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,291
- WELL, KOUTA, MY MAN,
LOOKS LIKE IT'S UP TO US--

507
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,250
HEY, HE'S ALREADY GONE!

508
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,791
- I DON'T THINK SO, KID.

509
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,250
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MR. OOSHIMA,

510
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,333
HEALTH AND P.E. TEACHER.

511
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,291
- GIVE IT UP ALREADY, TSUCHIYA.

512
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,791
- NO, YOU GIVE IT UP.

513
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,583
THIS ISN'T NORMAL PEEKING.
- SO WHAT IS IT?

514
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,916
- HEALTH AND P.E.
PRACTICAL TRAINING.

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,875
- SUMMON!

516
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,500
- SUMMON!

517
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,791
KEEP GOING, AKI.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE.

518
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,125
- GOOD LUCK, KOUTA.

519
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,000
NOW IT'S ALL UP TO ME!

520
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,333
I'LL MAKE IT.

521
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,500
FOR THE GUYS!

522
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,333
( gasps )

523
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,375
NO...

524
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,958
IT'S IRON MAN.

525
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,750
- PATHETIC.

526
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,041
ARE YOU BOYS EVER GONNA LEARN
HOW TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?

527
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,791
- PROBABLY NOT. BUT I DON'T
HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT!

528
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,583
SUMMON!
- ( grunting )

529
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,583
- WAIT, YOU DIDN'T SUMMON
YOUR AVATAR, MR. NISHIMURA.

530
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,208
- IT'S A LONG STORY, BUT I
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SCORE.

531
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,666
- WELL, ISN'T THAT FANCY.
ALL RIGHTY THEN...

532
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,666
GET READY!
DIE, IRON MAN!

533
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,083
- ( grunts )
- WHAT?!

534
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:25,333
- YOSHII, I SHOULD REVOKE
YOUR SUMMONING PRIVILEGES,

535
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,208
BUT I WON'T.

536
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,083
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
- MAYBE.

537
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,666
- I LIKE THAT YOU'RE
A PROBATIONARY STUDENT.

538
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,291
'CAUSE AS LONG AS
IT'S JUST AN AVATAR,

539
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,166
I DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT DOING THIS.

540
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,791
CLENCH YOUR TEETH, KIDDO!

541
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,375
- ( Avatar screams )

542
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,375
- ( both scream )

543
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,583
- PRESUMPTUOUS IDIOTS 
TAKE A REMEDIAL CLASS.

544
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,500
THAT'S YOU THREE, BY THE WAY.

545
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,583
- ( all groaning )

546
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,458
- THUS THE FIRST DAY OF
TRAINING CAMP COMES TO AN END.

547
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,916
AKIHISA AND HIS FRIENDS
HAVE YET TO BE CLEARED

548
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,416
OF THE ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST THEM.

549
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,875
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT? WILL THE
EVER FIND THE BLACKMAILER?

550
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,041
( flatly )
BUM BUM BUM.

551
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

552
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,625
- Yuuji:
BAKA AND TEST!

553
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,333
- I'M SO RELAXED.
I'M LIKE A PUDDLE.

554
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,291
- YEAH, I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THAT
AFTER A LONG BATH.

555
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,250
- ( beeps )

556
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,208
- Fukuhara:
QUESTION SIX--

557
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,208
"HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF."

558
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,208
PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE
OF THIS ADAGE.

559
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,208
- Hideyoshi:
REINCARNATION?

560
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,416
- YOU GONNA BE IN CLASS "F"
IN YOUR NEXT LIFE TOO?

561
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,833
- Akihisa: NEXT EPISODE: ME,
PEEKING AND GUYS' FRIENDSHIP!

562
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,125
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
