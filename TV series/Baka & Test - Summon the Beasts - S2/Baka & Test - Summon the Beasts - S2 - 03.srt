1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:18,500
- ( yawning )

2
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,208
HIDEYOSHI, I'VE GOT REMEDIAL--

3
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,333
HUH?

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,041
- UH.
- HMM...

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,916
- YOU OKAY?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,875
UH, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,833
- IT'S JUST THAT...

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,291
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,291
- WHAT?  THERE IS?
WEIRD.

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,416
I MEAN, I'M...
EXACTLY THE SAME AS ALWAYS.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,541
I'M THE SAME HEIGHT,
AREN'T I?

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,875
AND I'VE GOT THE SAME FACE.

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,666
SO WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
DUDE, MAN, BRO?

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,333
- I'M NOT SURE WHY,

15
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,541
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM AS GIRLISH
AND CUTE AS USUAL.

16
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,958
- AAH!
( growls )

17
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,958
- HMM?
- ( giggles )

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,291
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,833
- SO, TELL ME,
MS. TAKAHASHI.

20
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,916
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
SOME PROGRESS TO REPORT.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,541
- WELL, PRINCIPAL,

22
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,416
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
YUUKO KINOSHITA FROM CLASS "A"?

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,125
SHE'S ONE OF OUR
BRIGHTEST STUDENTS

24
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,250
AND QUITE OUTGOING.
- GO ON.

25
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,375
- HER TWIN BROTHER HIDEYOSHI
MANAGES THE LOCAL OPERA

26
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,416
FROM TIME TO TIME,

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,250
EVEN THOUGH HE'S A CLASS "F"
STUDENT.

28
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,958
SO IT'S PROBABLY SAFE
TO ASSUME

29
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,791
THAT YUUKO IS
A TALENTED SINGER AS WELL.

30
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,416
- GOOD.  IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,458
ONE GENUINELY MULTI-TALENTED
STUDENT AT THIS SCHOOL.

32
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,958
- INDEED. YOU COULD PRETTY
MUCH CREATE A CHECKLIST

33
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
FOR THE MODEL STUDENT
PATTERNED AFTER HER--

34
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,916
OUTGOING, COURTEOUS,
INTELLIGENT, GOOD-LOOKING,

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,291
TALENTED.

36
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,083
- ( sighs )
LIFE WOULD BE POINTLESS

37
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,958
WITHOUT HOT BOYS.

38
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,208
ESPECIALLY THE SCENE
WHERE YUUICHI PINS SHINJI

39
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,000
TO THE GROUND.

40
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,041
WAIT!
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS NOW!

41
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,083
- I'M HOME.

42
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,041
WHAT'S UP, SIS?

43
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,708
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

44
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,291
OR ARE YOU JUST
FINALLY SICK OF

45
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,291
YOUR FAVORITE GAY BOOK?

46
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,916
- ( growls )

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,041
WE'VE GOT LIKE THE SAME
GENETIC STRUCTURE, RIGHT?

48
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,875
SO HOW COME YOU CAN DO THINGS
THAT I CAN'T?

49
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,541
- WHAT THE CRAP
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,166
- TODAY IN CLASS,
MS. TAKAHASHI PICKED ME

51
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,208
OF ALL PEOPLE
TO PERFORM THE SCHOOL SONG

52
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,958
IN A NEW PROMOTIONAL VIDEO
FOR THE ACADEMY.

53
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,291
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

54
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,666
YOU'RE LIKE THE MOST
TONE-DEAF PERSON

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,083
I'VE EVER MET
IN MY LIFE!

56
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,166
AND YOU HAVE NO SENSE
OF RHYTHM AT ALL.

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,541
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? IT'S
LIKE YOU WANNA GET PUNCHED.

58
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,125
- IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT IT,

59
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,583
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL THEM NO?

60
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,791
- ABSOLUTELY NOT!

61
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,416
I HAVE TO PROTECT MY IMAGE

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,416
AS AN HONOR STUDENT
WHO ROCKS AT EVERYTHING.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,083
- THAT'S A PRETTY HARDCORE CASE
OF VANITY.

64
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,875
- ( cheers, applause )

65
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,708
- DON'T ACT LIKE IT
DOESN'T RUN IN THE FAMILY.

66
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,875
YOU JUST ACT OUT YOUR ROLES
ON THE STAGE.

67
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,458
WHILE I SPEND EVERY DAY
OF MY LIFE

68
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,083
ACTING OUT THE ROLE
OF A PERFECT STUDENT.

69
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,166
- HMM.  WELL,
WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT,

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,375
I GUESS WE AREN'T REALLY
ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

71
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,875
- OF COURSE WE AREN'T.

72
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,291
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING IT OUT LOUD,

73
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,666
BUT THE TWO OF US ARE...

74
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,750
IDENTICAL!

75
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,791
- UH...

76
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
- ( grunting )
- WHAT IS IT? 

77
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIS?

78
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,833
- I'M THINKING.

79
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,375
YOU'RE GOOD
AT IMPRESSIONS, CORRECT?

80
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,166
- IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO
MY SKILLS AS A THESPIAN,

81
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,208
THEN-- WAIT A MINUTE!

82
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,125
- COME ON, BROTHER.

83
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,708
DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR
SISTER OUT OF A BAD SITUATION?

84
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,250
AS A FAVOR?

85
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,875
- A FAVOR?!

86
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,541
HOW IS IT A FAVOR
IF YOU'RE THREATENING MY LIFE?!

87
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,750
I CANNOT BELIEVE I LET YOU TALK
ME INTO DOING THIS, YUUKO.

88
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,166
- I'M GOING TO
YOUR IDIOT CLASS FOR YOU,

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,916
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
GIRLY MAN?

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,750
- FOR ONE, WHAT IF THE PEOPLE IN
MY CLASS FIGURE IT OUT?

91
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,208
- WHO CARES IF THEY DO?

92
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,625
- UM, ME?
COME ON, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

93
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,791
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS ALREADY
CONVINCED I'M A GIRL.

94
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,625
- THEN IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE THEY'LL THINK

95
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,291
EVERYTHING
IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.

96
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,250
HERE.
PIN THIS ON YOUR SHIRT.

97
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,416
- WHY, WHAT IS THAT THING?

98
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,041
- IT'S JUST A HIDDEN MICROPHONE.

99
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,666
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
I CAN KEEP TABS

100
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,083
ON HOW EVERYTHING IS GOING.
- SERIOUSLY?

101
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,916
WHERE DID YOU EVEN GET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
- FROM SOMEONE IN YOUR CLASS.

103
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,000
- HELLO, NEW PICTURES.

104
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,583
- THIS DISASTER OF A ROOM

105
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,125
IS THE EQUIVALENT 
OF A SINKING SHIP.

106
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,541
- ( crashes )
- ( grunts )

107
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,375
- SUGAWA'S TRYING TO RUN!

108
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,625
- HE VIOLATED OUR CONTRACT BY
APPROACHING A FEMALE!

109
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,333
HE'S A TRAITOR!

110
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,666
- CAPTURE THE TRAITOR!

111
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,083
- OH--

112
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,750
- ( laughter )

113
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,208
- ( murmurs )

114
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,791
- OH, HIDEYOSHI.

115
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,666
I HEARD WE'RE
DOING WORKSHEETS TODAY.

116
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,500
- AH, YOU DON'T SAY.

117
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,250
- YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE JACKASS MOVE SUGAWA MADE?

118
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,666
- URGENT REPORT!
WE'VE GOT BREAKING NEWS!

119
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,083
WE HAVE NEW INFO ON THE GIRL
SUGAWA APPROACHED!

120
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,041
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN HIM!

121
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,625
IN FACT, ALL SHE WOULD SAY TO
HIM IS "TELL ME ABOUT AKI"!

122
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,208
I REPEAT: SHE ONLY WANTED TO
TALK ABOUT AKI!

123
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,333
- LATER!

124
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,291
- GRAB HIM!
- ( clamoring )

125
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,833
- THE FEMALE WAS INTERESTED
IN AKI!

126
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,416
- ( sighs )
IT'S LIKE A PLAGUE OF IDIOTS.

127
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,791
OH, YEAH.
THAT REMINDS ME,

128
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,291
I BETTER CHECK IN.

129
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,541
- ( static )

130
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,916
- THANKS, YUUKO.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,916
I APPRECIATE IT.
- WHO IS THAT?  KUBO?

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,916
- IT'S JUST GOOD TO KNOW
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,125
- Hideyoshi: AWW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO THANK ME.

134
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,250
- NOT THE ONLY ONE?
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

135
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,791
- WELL, I NEVER IMAGINED
I'D FIND A CLASSMATE

136
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,458
WHO SHARED
THE SAME FEELINGS.

137
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,958
AND I'M KINDA SURPRISED
IT'S YOU.

138
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,375
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED
IN HOMOSEXUALITY?

139
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,333
- ( gasps )

140
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,666
( pants )

141
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,666
- UH, HIDEYOSHI.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

142
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,333
- SIS, COME WITH ME!

143
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,166
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING.

144
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,541
- WHAT?!  HEY, SIS--
I MEAN, HIDEYOSHI!

145
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,750
- SO, HIDEYOSHI...

146
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,791
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TELLING ME EXACTLY WHAT

147
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,791
YOU AND KUBO WERE
TALKING ABOUT BACK THERE?

148
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,000
- IT WAS JUST
CASUAL SMALL TALK.

149
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,666
- HA!  SMALL TALK 
THAT MADE ME SOUND

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,625
LIKE AN AFICIONADO
OF ALL THINGS GAY!

151
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,791
- WELL, YEAH.
YOU READ ALL THOSE BOOKS--

152
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,791
- WHAT?!
HOW STUPID ARE YOU?!

153
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,833
THAT IS TOTALLY NOT
THE SAME THING!

154
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,833
WHAT YOU TOLD KUBO IN THERE
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE

155
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,541
I'VE GOT THE HOTS
FOR OTHER GIRLS, YOU IDIOT.

156
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,916
- NO, I SWEAR THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,250
- AND I SWEAR, IF YOU CAUSE ONE
MORE MISUNDERSTANDING...

158
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,375
- OKAY!
MESSAGE RECEIVED!

159
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,875
- MESSAGE RECEIVED, HUH?
WE'LL SEE.

160
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,041
- Shouko:
YUUKO, MAY WE SPEAK?

161
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,333
- Hideyoshi:
SURE, WHAT'S UP?

162
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,791
- SHOUKO?
ALL RIGHT, HIDEYOSHI.

163
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,375
YOUR LIFE IS ON THE LINE HERE.

164
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,208
- Shouko: YOUR SKIRT--
IT'S FLIPPED UP IN BACK.

165
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,791
- WHAT?  THAT MORON!

166
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,416
- THANKS FOR TELLING ME, SHOUKO.

167
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,625
IT'S COOL, NOT A BIG DEAL.

168
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,791
- BUT... YOUR SKIRT.

169
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,208
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

170
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,666
- IT IS?

171
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,083
- I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
SOMETHING ON

172
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,291
BENEATH IT TODAY,
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.

173
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,708
- WE NEED TO TALK, SIS!

174
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,250
'KAY...
NOW WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

175
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,916
- THAT CAME OUT ALL WRONG.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,125
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN
TO HER IS IT'S OKAY

177
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,666
BECAUSE I'M WEARING LEGGINGS.

178
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
- IS THAT SO?!

179
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,458
WELL, YOU MADE IT
OUT TO SOUND LIKE

180
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,708
I DON'T NORMALLY
WEAR PANTIES!

181
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,500
- WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,
SO CALM DOWN.

182
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,291
- THAT'S NO EXCUSE!
DON'T SAY DUMB THINGS

183
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,291
AND FIX YOUR SKIRT!

184
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,708
- I'LL TRY.

185
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,041
IT'S JUST THAT YOUR SKIRT IS
A LITTLE TOO BIG ON ME

186
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,500
AROUND THE WAIST.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,583
OKAY!  NO MORE MALFUNCTIONS

188
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,125
AND I WON'T SAY ANYTHING DUMB.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,916
- LAST CHANCE.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,666
- UM, HI, YUUKO.

191
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,666
- WHO'S THIS GUY?

192
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,875
- MY NAME IS KOUJI YOKOMIZO.

193
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,125
- KOUJI YOKOMIZO?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

194
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,916
- I-- I LOVE YOU!

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,916
WILL YOU PLEASE 
GO OUT WITH ME?!

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,333
- HE LOVES ME?!
WHAT DO I DO?

197
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,041
I MEAN, I'M FLATTERED,
BUT STILL--

198
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,375
- Hideyoshi:
THANK YOU, KOUJI.

199
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,166
BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT MY TYPE.

200
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,000
- GOOD JOB!
NICELY HANDLED.

201
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,375
- I'M NOT?

202
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,833
CAN I ASK WHAT YOUR TYPE
IS THEN?

203
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,500
- WELL, IF I HAD TO SAY,
I, UH...

204
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
- WHAT?
I WHAT?

205
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,791
- I GUESS,
IN TERMS OF ATTRACTION,

206
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,500
I'M FOND OF
VERY YOUNG BOYS.

207
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,625
- OH MY GOD!

208
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,916
I DON'T LIKE OTHER GIRLS!

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,208
I WEAR PANTIES EVERY DAY

210
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
AND I'M DEFINITELY
NOT A PEDOPHILE!

211
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,833
- HOW THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT

212
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,250
WITH THE TYPES OF
BOOKS YOU READ?

213
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,125
- THOSE ARE WORKS OF FICTION,
YOU MORON!

214
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,875
AND THE THINGS THAT I CHOOSE
TO READ AT HOME

215
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,875
ARE MEANT TO
STAY INSIDE OUR HOME!

216
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,458
- I GOT IT.  I PROMISE.

217
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,833
I'LL ACT EXACTLY LIKE YOU DO
FROM NOW ON.

218
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
- ( sighs )
- AH, HIDEYOSHI.

219
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,166
- OH, UH, HEY, AKIHISA.

220
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,791
SHOULDN'T YOU BE HIDING
SOMEWHERE FROM THOSE PEOPLE?

221
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,000
- NOPE.

222
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,416
THOSE GUYS FOUND OUT
THAT KOUJI

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,166
CONFESSED HIS LOVE
TO YOUR SISTER EARLIER,

224
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,666
SO THEY'RE TRYING
TO CAPTURE HIM NOW.

225
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,500
- OH, I SEE.

226
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,291
POOR KOUJI.

227
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,583
I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY HAVING
A WORSE DAY THAN I AM.

228
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,833
- THAT DUMBASS NEVER LEARNS,
DOES HE?

229
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,416
- HUH?

230
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'D ACTUALLY TRY TO GET

231
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,208
YOUR SISTER TO GO OUT WITH HIM

232
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,750
JUST BECAUSE YOU
TURNED HIM DOWN.

233
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,958
( laughing )
- I TAKE BACK MY SYMPATHY.

234
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,958
- OH, ON THE SUBJECT
OF YOUR SISTER...

235
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,000
- HUH?

236
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,750
- ( jazz tune playing )

237
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,166
- YUUKO'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE,
ISN'T SHE?

238
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,500
- WHAT?
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

239
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,541
- WELL, LOOK AT HER.

240
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,041
SHE'S SO CUTE.

241
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,041
AND SHE'S REALLY SMART TOO.

242
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,500
NOT TO MENTION
A STELLAR ATHLETE.

243
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,458
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF HER.

244
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,875
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

245
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,875
- YEAH, AND ON TOP OF THAT,

246
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,666
SHE'S PRETTY NO MATTER
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

247
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,041
- SHE'S PRETTY?
HUH.

248
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,583
- TALK ABOUT A MAJOR WASTE.
- ( gasps slightly )

249
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,416
- WORD IS SHE'S FREAKY-DEAKY.

250
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,250
I HEARD SHE'S A GIANT LESBO
AND SHE NEVER WEARS ANY PANTIES.

251
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,625
- WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT?!

252
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,583
- WHAT THE--?!
WHAT'S WRONG?!

253
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,083
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE,

254
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,500
BUT I SWEAR I CAN
FAINTLY FEEL THE SHAPE

255
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,583
OF SOME BREASTS RIGHT NOW!

256
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FAINTLY?!

257
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,875
THERE ARE DEFINITELY
BREASTS THERE!

258
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,416
- AAH!

259
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,083
- SO, FOR SOME STRANGE REASON,
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND

260
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,625
THAT MY BREASTS ARE DEFINITELY
BEGINNING TO DEVELOP.

261
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,041
- WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

262
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,833
BECAUSE THERE'S A RUMOR
GOING AROUND

263
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,041
THAT I'M INTO GIRLS,
YET ATTRACTED TO LITTLE BOYS,

264
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,250
AND THAT I WANDER AROUND
WITHOUT WEARING UNDERWEAR.

265
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,000
- IT SEEMS A LITTLE UNFAIR.

266
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,541
I MEAN, THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
STOP TREATING ME

267
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,125
LIKE A GIRL NOW, ARE THEY?

268
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,416
- YEAH, BUT THEY ALREADY
TREAT YOU LIKE THAT.

269
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
THEY'LL TREAT ME LIKE
A TRIPLE-THREAT PERVERT.

270
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,000
- THIS NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED

271
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,666
IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE ME SWITCH
PLACES WITH YOU!

272
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,583
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST KEEP
YOUR STUPID MOUTH SHUT?!

273
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,625
- ( both sigh )

274
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,625
- I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO
LIVE WITH IT.

275
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,041
- EXACTLY.

276
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,583
THERE'S NO POINT 
IN GETTING UPSET.

277
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
- Both: THERE ARE A MILLION
OTHER RUMORS AT OUR SCHOOL

278
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,375
TO DISTRACT PEOPLE, ANYWAY.

279
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,583
- Hideyoshi:
BAKA AND TEST.

280
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,291
- Fukuhara:
ONE YEAR IN THE PAST.

281
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,333
- EVERYBODY FREEZE!
- ( gasps )

282
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,541
- PUT ALL OF YOUR BAGS
ON THE DESKS AND OPEN 'EM UP

283
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,791
SO I CAN SEE INSIDE!

284
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,208
RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!

285
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,625
SAKAMOTO, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO HIDE IN YOUR POCKET?

286
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,958
- CRAP!

287
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,291
- I'LL BE CONFISCATING THIS.

288
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,375
- OH, COME ON!

289
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,375
THIS IS SO NOT FAIR!

290
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,208
- YOSHII!

291
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,791
CHANGE INTO YOUR GYM CLOTHES,
SO I CAN SEARCH YOUR CIVVIES.

292
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,125
- NO WAY!  THAT IS SOME
HARDCORE SUSPICION, MISTER!

293
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,583
I MEAN, COME ON.
CAN'T YOU EVEN TRY TO TRUST US?!

294
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,333
- OH, HEY, AKIHISA.

295
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,666
YOU DROPPED YOUR GAME CONSOLE.

296
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,666
- OH!  HEY, THANKS, YUUJI.

297
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,500
I AM NOT HIDING ANYTHING
AND I RESENT THIS INTERROGATION!

298
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,500
- YOU JUST SAVED ME A STEP, KID.

299
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,208
- Student:
SUMMONING MY AVATAR!  SUMMON!

300
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:26,333
- TODAY IS A FULL DAY OF AVATAR
TRAINING FOR YEAR ONE STUDENTS.

301
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,958
- OH, MAN, WE'VE HAD NOTHING
BUT BAD LUCK LATELY.

302
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,750
- CRAP.
I JUST BOUGHT THAT MP3 PLAYER.

303
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,000
- RIGHT?  HE CONFISCATED
MY PROPS AND COSTUMES TOO.

304
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,541
- YEAH, YOU GOT OFF EASY.

305
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,875
HE TOOK MY CELLPHONE, GAME
CONSOLE, VIDEO GAMES...

306
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,875
- WHAT IS THE POINT OF EVEN
BRINGING ALL OF THAT STUFF

307
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,083
WITH YOU TO SCHOOL?

308
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,541
- HEY, LOOKS LIKE IT'S
HIMEJI'S TURN NEXT.

309
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,791
- DUDE, ARE YOU PASSING UP
THE CHANCE

310
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,833
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF HER?

311
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,000
- MY CAMERA GOT CONFISCATED.

312
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,250
- AW, MAN, THAT SUCKS.

313
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,666
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO GET
ANOTHER PICTURE OF HER

314
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,666
IN HER GYM CLOTHES

315
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,833
SINCE SHE'S IN
A DIFFERENT CLASS.

316
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,000
- I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR!

317
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,333
SUMMON!
- ( grunts )

318
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,708
- HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LIKE
A GIRL THAT CUTE?

319
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,083
AND THAT SMART?

320
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,500
- DON'T YOU KNOW HER
OR SOMETHING?

321
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,083
COULD HAVE SWORN
YOU TOLD ME THAT ONE TIME.

322
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.

323
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,041
SHE AND I WERE IN THE SAME
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASS

324
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,208
TOGETHER WAY BACK WHEN.

325
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,583
BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED AT ALL
SINCE THEN.

326
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,666
- NEXT!
AKIHISA YOSHII!

327
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,875
- 'KAY.

328
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,125
- YOSHII WILL BE FIGHTING
SHIMADA!

329
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,666
SHIMADA!
SNAP OUT OF IT!

330
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,833
- OH!  YES, SIR!

331
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,875
AKI?

332
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,708
- YOU WERE IN KIND OF
A DAZE THERE.

333
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
YOU OKAY, SHIMADA?
YOU EATEN ANYTHING TODAY?

334
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,208
- HMM.  I DON'T NEED TO
STUFF MY FACE LIKE YOU.

335
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,916
- I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,333
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT FIGHTING
ME BECAUSE YOU WOUND UP

337
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,083
WITH A CRAPPY AVATAR,
DIDN'T YOU?

338
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,291
- I'M ACTUALLY GLAD
IT'S YOU I'M FIGHTING.

339
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,166
- HUH?
- KNOW WHY?

340
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,500
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
BEATING YOU UP

341
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,083
IS GONNA FEEL AWESOME.

342
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,625
- WAIT!  OUR AVATARS
ARE SUPPOSED BEAT EACH OTHER UP.

343
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,541
NOT US!
- THAT'S TRUE.

344
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,625
THE TWO OF US AREN'T GOING TO
BEAT EACH OTHER UP.

345
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,791
- ( exhales )
THANK YOU.

346
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,791
- AAH!
- GOOD TO HEAR.

347
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,791
- IT'S JUST ME.

348
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,375
NOT THE TWO OF US.

349
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,541
I'LL BE DOING
THE BEATING UP.

350
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,541
- ( whimpers )

351
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,916
- ( clears throat )

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,125
SHIMADA.
- SEE?  THERE!

353
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,666
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

354
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,250
- JUST THIS ONCE.

355
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,416
- SURE!
- FOR REAL?!

356
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,041
- ( giggles )

357
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,875
- ( chattering )

358
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,291
- ( sighs )
THIS IS SHAPING UP

359
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
TO BE THE WORST
SCHOOL YEAR IN HISTORY.

360
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,083
HUH?

361
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,041
WHOA!  IT'S HIMEJI.

362
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
- ( door closes )
- ALL RIGHT...

363
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,291
TIME TO ACT LIKE A MAN
AND TALK TO HER.

364
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,250
( groans )

365
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,750
AAH!  IT'S JUST TOO
SICKENINGLY CUTE!

366
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,625
I CAN'T TAKE IT!
RETREAT!

367
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,875
- PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU!
- HUH?

368
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,333
- I NEED THAT BEAR 
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

369
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,583
PLEASE HELP ME.

370
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,208
- I WISH I COULD, BUT...
- EXCUSE ME.

371
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

372
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,041
- WELL, THIS YOUNG LADY
IS PRETTY DESPERATE FOR ME

373
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,375
TO SELL HER THAT STUFFED TOY
IN THE WINDOW DISPLAY.

374
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,416
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY FOR IT.

375
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,875
- ( whimpering )

376
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,500
- SO, WHY'S IT SO IMPORTANT

377
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,333
FOR YOU TO HAVE THAT ONE?

378
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,833
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
MY OLDER SISTER

379
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,791
TO KEEP ON BEING SO SAD.

380
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,791
- YOUR OLDER SISTER?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

381
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,833
I HAVE TO GET IT FOR HER.

382
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,833
SHE TOLD ME ONE TIME THAT
SHE REALLY WANTED IT, SO...

383
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,625
- OH, I SEE.

384
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,083
YOU WERE THINKING IT MIGHT
CHEER HER UP

385
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,916
IF YOU GIVE HER A PRESENT, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,666
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN HAVING
A TOUGH TIME AT SCHOOL

387
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,791
SINCE WE JUST MOVED HERE.

388
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,250
BUT SHE-- SHE STILL DOES
ALL THE CHORES.

389
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
- HUH?
- SHE DOES ALL THE CLEANING

390
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,166
AND THE LAUNDRY AND SHE ALWAYS
MAKES TIME TO PLAY WITH ME.

391
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,416
( cries )
- OH, NO, PLEASE STOP CRYING!

392
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,416
MAYBE I COULD DO SOMETHING
TO HELP YOU.

393
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,458
- HUH?  YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

394
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,625
- MM-HMM.

395
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,000
- THAT'S SO NICE.

396
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,541
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

397
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,500
- UM, SIR, HOW MUCH IS
THE STUFFED TOY THAT SHE WANTS?

398
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,875
- 25,000 YEN.

399
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,416
- AAH!

400
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,666
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY DID WANNA HELP.

401
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,750
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

402
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,166
- AAH!

403
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,333
WAIT!  I FORGOT.

404
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,000
I'VE ALREADY GOT
10,000 YEN.

405
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,416
- IF I ADD MY ENTIRE FORTUNE
OF 1,000 YEN

406
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,166
TO HER 10,000 YEN,
WE'VE ONLY GOT 11,000.

407
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,666
WHICH MEANS WE'D STILL
HAVE TO FIND A WAY

408
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,125
TO COME UP WITH
THE OTHER HALF OF THE 25,000.

409
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,041
- YOU'RE NOT GOOD WITH MATH,
ARE YOU?

410
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,500
- IN THAT CASE, YOU COULD 
CUT THE TOY IN TWO PIECES.

411
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,416
AND THEN SELL US
ONE HALF OF IT.

412
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,833
- I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED

413
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,250
ABOUT THE STATE OF EDUCATION
THESE DAYS.

414
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,250
- YOU'RE A LITTLE STUPID, HUH?

415
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,291
- WELL, THAT SHOULD GIVE US

416
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,166
ENOUGH TIME TO COME UP
WITH THE REST.

417
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,375
- BUT THEN,
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T?

418
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,000
- IT COULD BE TOUGH.

419
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,375
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY
TO GATHER.

420
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,375
( gasps )
THAT'S ABOUT THE TOTAL WORTH

421
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,791
OF EVERYTHING THAT GOT
CONFISCATED FROM ME.

422
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,791
PERFECT!

423
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,166
- DID YOU HAVE AN IDEA?

424
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,708
- TELL YOU WHAT,
MEET ME IN THIS PARK

425
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,416
AT THE SAME TIME TOMORROW.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

426
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
- MEET HERE TOMORROW.

427
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,291
- MM-HMM.

428
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,666
- OKAY, I'LL BE HERE!
- AWESOME.

429
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,166
- ( giggles )

430
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,041
- Yuuji: YOU WANNA TAKE BACK
ALL OF OUR STUFF?

431
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,666
- YEAH.  BUT I'M GONNA NEED
YOU GUYS TO HELP ME PULL IT OFF.

432
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,333
- WE'VE GOTTA GET A HOLD OF
THE KEY

433
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,083
TO IRON MAN'S LOCKER 
IF WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

434
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,416
- BUT HE KEEPS THAT KEY
IN HIS JACKET POCKET.

435
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,583
- SO NOT A PROBLEM.

436
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,416
ALL WE'VE GOTTA DO IS DOUSE HIM
WITH A BIG OL' BUCKET OF WATER.

437
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,041
WE WAIT FOR HIM TO CHANGE HIS
CLOTHES, RIGHT?

438
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,875
AND THEN WE JUST
TAKE IT FROM HIS POCKET.

439
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,291
YOU CAN DO IT, AKIHISA.
JUST DON'T GET KILLED.

440
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,708
- ME?!
- TARGET APPROACHING!

441
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,541
- DON'T SCREW UP!
- GOOD LUCK!

442
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,750
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
 WERE GONNA HELP ME!

443
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,541
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

444
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,875
AAH!

445
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
MY FOOT SLIPPED!
ON ACCIDENT!

446
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,958
NO WAY!

447
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,000
YOU'RE NOT DODGING THIS ONE!

448
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,250
- ( groaning )

449
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,458
- ( sighs )

450
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,458
( chuckles )
WELL...

451
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,291
I'M SORRY.
I TRIPPED-- AAH!

452
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,708
- YOU SURE THAT'S THE STORY
YOU'RE STICKING WITH?

453
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,375
- ( whimpering )

454
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,208
I HAD A HELL OF A TIME,
BUT I GOT THE KEY.

455
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,041
- NICE.
LET'S OPEN THIS BAD BOY

456
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,541
AND GET OUR STUFF BACK
WHILE WE CAN.

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,416
- JACKPOT!

458
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,041
- OKAY, NOW MOVE OUT 
BEFORE WE GET CAUGHT.

459
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,583
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

460
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,916
HUH?  OLD BOOKS?

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
NO REASON TO WASTE THEM.

462
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,750
MAN, THAT WAS PRETTY CLOSE.

463
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,541
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
A FEW THOUSAND YEN SHORT

464
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,250
IF I HADN'T SOLD
THOSE OLD BOOKS.

465
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,375
- HEY!
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

466
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,958
- SORRY I'M LATE.
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

467
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,125
- WAIT, YOU GOT ONE?

468
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,791
- UH-HUH.

469
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,750
A REALLY NICE
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL SHOWED UP

470
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,416
AND GAVE IT TO ME
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

471
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
- A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL,
THAT'S FUNNY.

472
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,583
- YEAH!

473
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,875
SHE TOLD ME TO GIVE THE TOY
TO MY SISTER, BUT...

474
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,291
SHE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I COULD
KEEP IT FOR MYSELF

475
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
IF YOU BROUGHT THE BIG ONE
FOR HER INSTEAD.

476
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,958
WE'D BOTH HAVE ONE!

477
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,375
- UH, WELL, I GUESS THAT
MEANS THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

478
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,000
- IT IS?  REALLY?

479
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,833
- YEP.  AND THEN...

480
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,500
THIS ONE IS FOR YOUR SISTER.

481
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
- ( gasps )
YOU DID IT!

482
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,791
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, AND THIS
WILL CHEER HER UP FOR YOU.

483
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,708
- UM, CAN YOU, UH--

484
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,958
CAN YOU SQUAT
DOWN FOR A SECOND?

485
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,166
- HUH?
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

486
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,833
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME!

487
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,833
YOU'RE THE BEST!

488
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,208
- ( chuckles )
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

489
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,291
YOU MAY BE STUPID, BUT I LIKE
YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO NICE.

490
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,500
AND I'VE MADE UP MY MIND--

491
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,333
AS SOON AS I GET OLD ENOUGH,
I'M GONNA MARRY YOU!

492
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,666
- UH--

493
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,291
( chuckles nervously )

494
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
- LISTEN CLOSELY.

495
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,083
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT YESTERDAY.

496
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,666
SOMEONE STOLE ALL OF
THE CONFISCATED MATERIAL

497
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,291
AND MY OWN PERSONAL BOOKS
OUT OF MY LOCKER.

498
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,250
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS SO
SHAMELESS AND COCKY

499
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,666
THAT HE OPENLY PRESENTED
HIS STUDENT I.D.

500
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,541
WHEN HE PAWNED OFF MY OLD BOOKS
AND HIS VIDEO GAMES.

501
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,208
YOSHII, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT?

502
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,208
- YEAH, THAT IS A COCKY MOVE.
- INDEED IT IS.

503
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,208
- ( both laughing )

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,916
- YOSHII, PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR DOOM!

505
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,333
- I'M SORRY!
I HAD A GOOD REASON!

506
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,208
- YOU HAVE FINALLY EARNED
THE TITLE

507
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,208
THIS INSTITUTION
RESERVES FOR TRUE IDIOTS.

508
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,916
AKIHISA YOSHII...

509
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,500
FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE
A PROBATIONARY STUDENT!

510
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

511
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,708
- HERE, BIG SIS!  FOR YOU!
- WHAT?  HOW DID YOU--

512
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,666
- HOPEFULLY THIS'LL BE ENOUGH
TO CHEER YOU UP SOME.

513
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,250
- THANK YOU, HAZUKI.
THIS CHEERS ME UP A LOT.

514
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,083
- IT'S TOUGH MOVING
TO A NEW PLACE,

515
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,666
BUT THINGS
DON'T HAVE TO BE BAD.

516
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,666
- YEAH, WE PICKED UP 
THE LANGUAGE QUICKLY.

517
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,291
BESIDES...
- BESIDES?

518
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,375
- ...I'M KIND OF INTERESTED
IN SOMEONE.

519
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,750
THERE'S A BOY
THAT I THINK I LIKE.

520
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,250
- WHAT?!
TELL ME ABOUT HIM!

521
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,666
- ( giggles )

522
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,541
WELL, WE'RE IN
THE SAME CLASS TOGETHER.

523
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,666
AND HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF
THE STUPIDEST PEOPLE I'VE MET.

524
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,666
( giggles )

525
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,333
- Fukuhara: QUESTION FOUR:
WHEN YOU ADD ALL OF THE NUMBERS

526
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,541
OF THE 52 PLAYING CARDS
IN A DECK, WHAT'S THE TOTAL?

527
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,166
- Akihisa: ONE PLUS TWO PLUS
THREE PLUS, UM...

528
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,333
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE.

529
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,375
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME:

530
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,166
ME, TRUE COLORS
AND A MAN'S DIGNITY!

531
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,083
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
