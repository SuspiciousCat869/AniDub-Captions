1
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,666
AAH!

2
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,166
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

3
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,791
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

4
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,125
- Fukuhara: A STRANGE PHENOMENON
STRUCK OUT OF THE BLUE.

5
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,541
- THIS ARMOR'S PRETTY FANCY
 FOR AKIHISA'S LAME AVATAR.

6
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,958
- I KNOW.
HE PRACTICALLY LIFE-SIZE.

7
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,000
- MM-HMM.

8
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,500
- GUYS, EXCUSE ME!

9
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,166
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED
THIS THING AT ALL?!

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,250
- YOU MEAN ITS NASTY HEAD?
YEAH, WE HAVE.

11
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,083
NOW GET IT OUT OF MY FACE.
IT'S CREEPY.

12
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,708
- I GUESS THAT THING'S NOT GONNA
RUN ERRANDS FOR ME, IS IT?

13
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,875
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORRIED
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE HERE?!

14
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,333
- HEY, LOSERS!
- HOW IS EVERYONE THIS MORNING?

15
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,250
- HEY, WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

16
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,250
AND HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

17
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,541
- AAH!

18
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,958
- ( laughs )
- I'M SORRY.

19
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,291
SEEING YOU LIKE THAT
FREAKED US OUT.

20
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,125
- OH, NO,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

21
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,375
I'M SORRY I SCARED YOU.
- GOOD.

22
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,958
I MEAN, IT IS YOUR FAULT.
SO THANKS FOR THE APOLOGY.

23
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,416
- THINK IT'S JUST HIM?

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,375
I WONDER IF THE REST OF OUR
AVATARS HAVE CHANGED TOO.

25
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,125
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

26
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,375
- MM-HMM.

27
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,583
- All: SUMMON!

28
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,500
- ( hisses )

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,125
- WELL, THAT'S RATHER ODD.

30
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,875
- THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
TURNING INTO MONSTERS,

31
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,291
BUT I THINK
THEY SOMEHOW REPRESENT

32
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
WHAT OUR TRUE NATURES ARE.

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,541
- THAT'S AWESOME.

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,458
I WONDER WHAT MY REAL NATURE IS.

35
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,666
I BET HE SYMBOLIZES
MY CHIVALROUS SPIRIT.

36
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,125
- AKIHISA, DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

37
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,791
- OR MAYBE IT MEANS I'M STRONG

38
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,666
OR EVEN THAT I HAVE A BIG
SWINGING SWORD,

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,000
'CAUSE I'M SO MANLY.
- DOUBTFUL.

40
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,333
HE DOESN'T HAVE A HEAD.

41
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,875
THAT PROBABLY JUST MEANS
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

42
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,083
- WHY?!

43
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,500
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO BE SO CRUEL?

44
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,916
YOU CAN'T DROP
AN HONESTY BOMB ON ME.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,333
THE SHRAPNEL HURTS!

46
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,666
- Fukuhara: 
TRUTH CAN BE

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,791
THE MOST PAINFUL
OF SHRAPNEL.

48
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,416
- YUUJI'S AVATAR
DOESN'T REALLY LOOK

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
ALL THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN HE DOES.

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,458
- IT'S A DOPPELGANGER.

51
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,041
- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU SAYING?!

52
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,208
THIS IS THE NASTY MAN-BEAST
KNOWN AS YUUJI SAKAMOTO!

53
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,166
HE'S ALMOST AS MEAN AND VICIOUS
AS HE IS UGLY.

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,541
- WORLD CUP IN YOUR FACE, SUCKA!

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,250
- YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL, YUUJI.

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,916
YOU KICKED MY AVATAR'S HEAD
LIKE IT WAS A SOCCER BALL--

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,750
WHAT KIND OF PIECE OF CRAP
FRIEND DOES THAT?

58
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,541
- SERIOUSLY, AKI,
DON'T BE SUCH A GIRL.

59
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,750
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE SAYING?
YOU KNOW THE ONE.

60
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,083
"MY FRIEND IS A BALL."

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,916
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE: "THE
BALL IS MY FRIEND"!

62
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,833
- ( growls )

63
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,000
- ( all screaming )

64
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,166
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.
- HE'S A WEREWOLF.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,666
- WAIT, DOESN'T HE
NEED A FULL MOON

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,958
TO DO THAT WHOLE
TRANSFORMING INTO

67
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,333
A MURDEROUS BEAST THING?

68
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,833
- MAYBE JUST SAW SOMETHING
THAT WAS ROUND.

69
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,458
- ( roaring )

70
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,416
- MY FRIEND REALLY IS A BALL.

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,416
- ARE YOU TWO GONNA 
SUMMON YOUR AVATARS?

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,416
- OH, SURE, I GUESS WE CAN.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,416
'KAY.

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,958
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR!

75
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,666
SUMMON!

76
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,583
- ( giggles )

77
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,791
- PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT HER!
AVERT YOUR EYES!

78
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,916
SHE'S HIDEOUS!
HIDEOUS!

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,875
- DON'T WORRY. EVERYONE ALREADY
KNEW WHAT YOUR TRUE NATURE WAS.

80
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,416
- NO!  I-- IT MAY BE TRUE
THAT I'M A BIG GIRL,

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,791
BUT THEY'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH
TO BE MY CALLING CARD.

82
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,416
- STOP!  DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,125
IF YOU DO, A CERTAIN SOMEONE
IS GOING TO GET HURT,

84
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,375
AND THEN HURT ME
IN THE PROCESS

85
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,541
OF MY WRIST GETTING
SNAPPED OFF!

86
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,583
- YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
YOU WANNA SAY,

87
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,666
GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.

88
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,375
- NO!
- RIDICULOUS.

89
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,791
MIZUKI, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

90
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,791
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR HAVING SUCH A NAUGHTY BODY.

91
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,291
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
THAT'S SO MEAN.

92
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,916
- WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I SAID
NOT TO TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,166
FOR ONCE, I DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT MINE.

94
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,000
SHE'LL BE UBER CUTE.
SUMMON!

95
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,833
( grunts )

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,333
- Aki: I CAN'T LAUGH.
IF I DO, I'M A GONER.

97
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,375
- AKI? 
- YEAH?  WHAT IS IT, MINAMI?

98
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,250
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
 ABOUT THIS AVATAR?

99
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,375
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

100
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,791
WHAT IT'S TRYING
TO SAY ABOUT ME?

101
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,375
- UH, I'M NOT SURE.

102
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,333
OH!

103
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,375
DAMN IT!  OKAY...

104
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,000
WHAT CAN I SAY OTHER THAN
SHE'S TOTALLY FLAT?

105
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,208
I GOT IT.

106
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,750
I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE
IN COMMON.

107
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,750
YOU'RE BOTH--
WELL, YOU'RE REALLY...

108
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,625
HARD.
- I'M HARD?!

109
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,416
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,791
- Fukuhara: IT'S A FACT.
THE TRUTH HURTS.

111
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:14,000
- YOU BETTER GET AWAY FROM MY
SUGAR PIE NOW, YOU FILTHY PIG!

112
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,416
- OH, WOW, SHE IS CRAZY.

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,583
- WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, TOUCHING HER LIKE THAT?

114
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,750
YOU ARE DISGUSTING!

115
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,625
TAKE THIS, CREEPER.

116
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,500
- SHUT UP,
YOU BASTARDS ARE TOO LOUD!

117
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,500
- HEY, I KNOW YOU...

118
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,916
( stammers )

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,416
WAIT, WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

120
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,958
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
 TRYING TO MOCK US!

121
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,375
- WE ARE TSUNEMURA
AND NATSUKAWA,

122
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,583
YEAR THREE, CLASS "A."

123
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,583
- OH, YEAH,
THE TSUNEKAWA DUO, SURE.

124
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,583
- I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

125
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,375
THE TSUNEKAWA DUO.
- QUIT DOING THAT TO OUR NAME!

126
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,125
- Fukuhara:
DURING THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL,

127
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,333
THE TSUNEKAWA DUO...

128
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,291
BLAH BLAH BLAH...
THEY'RE JERKS.

129
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,791
- YOU GUYS NEED TO
KEEP IT DOWN.

130
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,333
WE CAN HEAR YOUR RACKET
ALL THE WAY

131
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,208
FROM THE YEAR THREE CLASSROOM,
AND CAN'T STUDY.

132
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,500
- OUTRAGEOUS. AND A LIE.
- WHAT?

133
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,875
- THIS IS CLASS "F" ON
THE THIRD FLOOR, MORONS.

134
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,541
YEAR THREE, CLASS "A" IS IN
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUILDING

135
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,916
AND ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR.
- INDEED, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,166
WE WERE BEING THAT LOUD.

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,166
- YOU PROBABLY GOT BORED
OF STUDYING,

138
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,583
AND WERE WANDERING AROUND
WHEN YOU HEARD

139
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,666
AKIHISA'S STUPID,
SILLY VOICE.

140
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,083
SO YOU DECIDED TO TAKE IT OUT
ON ALL OF US, RIGHT?

141
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,625
- DID YOU JUST RANDOMLY
BLAME ME FOR THEM BEING HERE?

142
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,500
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!
GAH!

143
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,750
THE FACT STILL REMAINS YOU GUYS
ARE ALL ANNOYING AS HELL.

144
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,083
- WE GOT YOUR NUMBER.

145
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,500
YOU'RE THE TOOLBAGS WHO
GOT SUSPENDED FOR STARTING

146
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,791
A PEEKING REBELLION.

147
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,250
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO IF THAT MESSES UP

148
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,500
THE SCHOOL'S REPUTATION,

149
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,250
AND OUR COLLEGE ENTRANCE
EXAMS IN THE PROCESS?!

150
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,791
- WHAT DO THEY WANT YOU TO DO,
SAY YOU'RE SORRY?

151
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,958
- I DON'T THINK SO.

152
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,250
THEY PROBABLY WANNA
HEAR THAT FROM YOU.

153
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,000
- Both: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE BOTH OF YOU!

154
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,458
- Aki and Yuuji: OKAY, YOU'RE
KIDDING US NOW, RIGHT?

155
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,083
- IT'S TIME WE TAUGHT
YOU MISERABLE IDIOTS

156
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,458
A LESSON ABOUT RESPECT.

157
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,750
YEAH, AND THE MATH TEACHER'S
HERE. PERFECT TIMING!

158
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,125
- Both: SUMMON!
( grunt )

159
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,125
AAH!

160
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,333
- NO WAY!
- WHAT THE--?!

161
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,666
- I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST ONE
TO TAKE THAT JERK DOWN.

162
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,208
SO DON'T GET IN MY WAY,
OR I'LL TAKE BOTH OF YOU OUT!

163
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,000
- I DON'T CARE IF
YOU'RE OLDER THAN ME OR NOT.

164
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,916
I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO ATTACK AKIHISA.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,375
NOT ON MY WATCH.

166
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,666
- MIHARU?
AND WHAT'S KUBO DOING HERE?

167
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,083
- THEY'RE LIKE,
THE SAME CREATURE.

168
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,416
- LOST GODS.

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,666
MONSTERS LOST
ON THE PATH OF HUMANS

170
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,500
WHO TRY TO GET YOU
TO BECOME ONE OF THEM.

171
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,625
- SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

172
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,916
- ( grunting )

173
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,625
- AAH!

174
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,625
- NO!

175
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,000
- THE TIME HAS COME.
LET'S FINISH THEM OFF!

176
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,250
- STOP RIGHT THERE!

177
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,416
- All: IT'S THE PRINCIPAL!
- Yuuji: IT'S THE CRAZY OLD HAG!

178
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,166
UH-- OH.

179
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,000
- YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT
TO SAVE YOUR REMAINING SCORES

180
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,000
FOR THE EVENT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE PART OF.

181
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,291
- WHAT EVENT?

182
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,375
- WAIT, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING THAT YOU NEED TO

183
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,583
TURN OUR AVATARS
BACK TO NORMAL FIRST?

184
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,583
- YEAH, LIKE THIS, THE BEST
EVENT WE COULD COME UP WITH

185
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,500
IS A HAUNTED HOUSE.

186
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,916
- WELL DONE.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,458
YOU SEEM TO HAVE PRETTY
GOOD INTUITION FOR AN IDIOT.

188
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,458
WE'RE HOLDING THE FIRST EVER
COURAGE CONTEST

189
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,625
BETWEEN GRADES,
USING OUR AVATARS!

190
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,625
- All:
WHAT'S A COURAGE CONTEST?!

191
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,458
- BASICALLY, YOU SCREWED UP
THE SYSTEM AGAIN

192
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,458
ON THAT LAST TUNE-UP, RIGHT?

193
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,000
- THIS WILL BE FUN.

194
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,291
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE YOU GENTS
MANAGE THE EVENT.

195
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,291
NOW THEN,
YEAR TWO AND YEAR THREE...

196
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,708
WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO BE
THE GHOSTS AND GOBLINS?

197
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,083
- WE'LL DO IT, BECAUSE
WE'RE OLDER, AND SCARIER!

198
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,708
- PLUS, THERE'S STILL
THAT LESSON IN RESPECT

199
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,208
THEY HAVE TO LEARN.

200
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,041
- THE YEAR THREE STUDENTS
WILL BE THE GHOSTS AND GOBLINS.

201
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,125
AND YEAR TWO STUDENTS
WILL HAVE TO FIND A WAY

202
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,875
TO BRAVE THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

203
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,291
- Fukuhara: RULES FOR THE
COURAGE CONTEST BETWEEN GRADES.

204
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,791
OOH...

205
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,625
CHALLENGERS WILL BRAVE THE
HAUNTED HOUSE IN GROUPS OF TWO.

206
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,041
WHEN THE CHALLENGERS SCREAM
OR MAKE NOISES

207
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,916
LOUDER THAN
A SET SOUND VOLUME

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,458
WHILE TRAVERSING
THE HAUNTED HOUSE,

209
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,291
THEY SHALL BE DISQUALIFIED
IMMEDIATELY.

210
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,666
CHALLENGERS WILL FIGHT
AVATAR BATTLES

211
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,375
WITH HAUNTED HOUSE INHABITANTS
AT FOUR SEPARATE CHECKPOINTS.

212
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,125
IF THEY WIN, THEY WILL CLEAR
THAT CHECKPOINT

213
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,125
AND CONTINUE TO THE NEXT.

214
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,166
IF THEY CLEAR ALL
FOUR CHECKPOINTS,

215
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,083
THE CHALLENGERS WIN.

216
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,166
HOWEVER, IF ALL THE
CHALLENGERS ARE DEFEATED,

217
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,833
THE HAUNTED HOUSE INHABITANTS
WILL BE THE VICTORS.

218
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,125
- HA, YOU KNOW,

219
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,083
I DON'T THINK JUST COMPETING
IS ENOUGH, DO YOU?

220
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,333
- MAYBE WE OUGHTA DECIDE ON A
PENALTY GAME FOR WHEN THEY LOSE.

221
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,791
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
SHUT UP.

222
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,458
I NEVER SAID YOU COULD MAKE UP
YOUR OWN RULES.

223
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,875
THIS IS AN ACADEMY EVENT.

224
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,083
- YEAH, BUT--
BUT WE ALWAYS DO THAT.

225
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,583
- ALWAYS DO WHAT?
 CRY LIKE A GIRL?

226
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,000
AS LONG AS YOU TWO POSEURS
ARE AT ONE OF THOSE CHECKPOINTS,

227
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,458
YOU'LL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE
TO FIGHT US ONE ON ONE.

228
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,458
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

229
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,583
- VERY GOOD POINT.

230
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,208
- WE'LL BEAT YOU DOWN
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

231
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,708
- HUH?  HUH?

232
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,083
WHY ME?
WHAT DID I DO?

233
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,750
- Tsunekawa Duo:
BAKA AND TEST!

234
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,375
- ( students chattering )

235
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,666
- ( dance music playing )

236
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,875
- EVERYONE LISTEN UP.

237
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,875
WE ENTER THE HAUNTED
HOUSE IN GROUPS OF TWO.

238
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,375
AND I'M THINKING WE NEED TO
HAVE GUYS PAIRED UP WITH GIRLS

239
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,833
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

240
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,541
- BUT IF THE GIRL GETS SCARED
AND SCREAMS,

241
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,250
WON'T THEY GUY END UP
BEING DISQUALIFIED AS WELL?

242
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,916
- NOT AS LONG AS
HE DOESN'T SCREAM.

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
PLUS, THIS SHOULD MAKE THINGS
MORE EXCITING ANYWAY.

244
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,083
ALL RIGHT!
GO AHEAD AND FIND A PARTNER.

245
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,083
- BRO, WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

246
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,625
- AS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY
 KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

247
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,291
HER NAME STARTS WITH AN "S"
AND ENDS WITH AN "OKO."

248
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,166
- YOU SHOULD PAIR UP
WITH ME, YUUJI, OR ELSE...

249
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,875
WE GET MARRIED NOW.
- ( murmurs )

250
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,750
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MIZUKI?

251
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,833
- I, UH-- IT'S JUST--
- IT'S JUST WHAT?

252
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,291
- I'VE ALWAYS REALLY
HATED GHOSTS

253
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,208
AND SCARY STUFF LIKE THAT.

254
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,375
SO I'M AFRAID
THAT I MIGHT SCREAM.

255
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,500
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE

256
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,875
WHO MESSES UP OUR
CHANCES OF WINNING.

257
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,666
- Both: UH...

258
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,958
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.
IF YOU'RE TOO SCARED,

259
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,125
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PUSH IT AT ALL.

260
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,958
- YEAH!  IT'S COOL.

261
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,958
SO, LIKE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

262
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,750
WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING
WE'RE SCARED OF.

263
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,291
EVEN ME, SO-- SO YEAH.

264
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,916
- WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO KEEP YOU FROM GOING IN THERE.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,166
THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE AFRAID, OKAY?

266
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,791
- HUH?

267
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,875
OKAY.

268
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,041
- HOW DARE YOU,
AKIHISA YOSHII?

269
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,125
MARK MY WORDS-- YOUR DAYS OF
BEING A FILTHY PIG ARE NUMBERED.

270
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,541
- HEY, MIHARU?

271
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,583
- WHOA!  WHAT?!
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

272
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,875
- CALM DOWN.
PARTNER UP WITH ME.

273
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,083
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

274
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:23,458
- AND SO, THE COURAGE CONTEST
 BETWEEN GRADES GOT UNDERWAY.

275
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,541
- THEY WORKED REALLY HARD
ON THIS.  FREAKY.

276
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,791
- YEAH.  BUT ALL OF THIS STUFF
IS STILL SUPER FAKE.

277
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,250
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT SCARY.

278
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,958
- ( both gasp )

279
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,541
( screaming )

280
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,375
- ( both screaming )

281
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
- DISQUALIFIED.

282
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,750
- ( both screaming )

283
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,833
( screaming continues )

284
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,166
- THOSE YEAR THREE STUDENTS
DON'T MESS AROUND.

285
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,166
- LOOKS LIKE THEY
MIGHT BE TOUGHER

286
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,666
THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

287
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
- DAMN IT.

288
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,666
WHY'D I GET STUCK PAIRING UP
WITH A DUDE?

289
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,500
- DON'T HATE ON ME BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT POPULAR WITH GIRLS.

290
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,500
- EXCUSE ME? 
AREN'T YOU THE ONE

291
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,041
WHO ASKED TWENTY GIRLS OUT

292
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,416
AND GOT REJECTED BY
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM?

293
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,791
- SHUT UP!

294
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,208
ALL THOSE GIRLS
DIDN'T REJECT ME, OKAY?

295
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,541
MOST OF IT WAS BAD TIMING.

296
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,416
- YEAH, I'VE HAD
BAD TIMING TOO, ASS!

297
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,708
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT POPULAR!

298
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,333
- YEAH, NO JOKE.

299
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,000
- DON'T BE A JERK!

300
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,875
- WHY DON'T YOU SHUT THE HELL UP
AND QUIT COMPLAINING?!

301
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,291
- DISQUALIFIED.

302
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,375
- YOU LOOK TOTALLY AWESOME.

303
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,666
THEY'RE GONNA FREAK OUT FOR SURE
WHEN THEY SEE YOU LIKE THIS.

304
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,583
- FABULOUS.

305
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,083
ALL RIGHT.

306
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,208
I'M OFF TO GO GIVE THOSE
PATHETIC DELINQUENTS

307
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,416
THE SCARE OF A LIFETIME.

308
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,583
- AAH.
- UH--

309
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
MIKAMI, ARE YOU HURT?

310
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,166
LET ME HELP YOU BACK UP.

311
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,000
- YEAH, OKAY.
THANK YOU.

312
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,166
- HEY, DID YOU SEE SOMETHING
WEIRD ON THE SCREEN JUST NOW?

313
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,625
- WHAT?  WEIRD LIKE WHAT?

314
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,583
- ( gasps )

315
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,375
- ( groans )

316
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,166
- I'M RIGHT HERE, MIKAMI.

317
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,333
THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY,
MY DEAR, I'LL PROTECT YOU.

318
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,500
- ( groans loudly )

319
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,916
- EVERYTHING IN HERE IS
SO OBVIOUS ANYWAY.

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,458
- ( both scream )

321
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,041
- ( all screaming )

322
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,708
- DAMN!  THAT LITTLE BASTARD
HAS GONE TOO FAR!

323
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,541
- NO!  THEIR WAY OF WINNING'S
AS DIRTY AND DISGUSTING

324
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,416
AS THAT DIRTY, DISGUSTING FACE
ON THE SCREEN!

325
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,416
- THAT'S SCARIER THAN A GHOST!

326
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,333
- I'M GONNA HAVE NIGHTMARES NOW!

327
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,708
- ( screaming )

328
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,125
- HOLD ME!

329
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,500
- ( screaming continues )

330
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,083
- ALL STRIKE UNITS
DISQUALIFIED.

331
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,541
- AH, DAMN IT ALL!

332
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,000
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

333
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,541
HOW CAN ANYONE GET PAST
THAT DISGUSTING FACE?

334
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,833
- LEAVE IT TO ME, GUYS.

335
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,083
- Aki and Hideyoshi:
KOUTA, NO!

336
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:09,208
- YOU NEED A PARTNER FIRST.
I DON'T MIND GOING IN.

337
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
- LET'S DO THIS THEN.

338
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,500
I'LL SHOW HIM A THING OR TWO
ABOUT TERROR.

339
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,583
VICTIMS...

340
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,625
HERE I COME.

341
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,833
( cackling )

342
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,291
HEY!

343
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,458
( gags )

344
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,083
- All: YEAH!

345
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,958
( cheering )

346
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,750
- THAT WAS A DIRTY TRICK!

347
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,333
- SMILE FOR THE CAMERA!

348
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,166
DON'T YOU WANNA LOOK
YOUR BEST?

349
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,666
- WE'RE GOING TO PUT 
THESE PICS UP ONLINE.

350
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,833
- NO!  YOU'LL--
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

351
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,500
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!

352
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,416
- BYE, BYE!
SO LONG!  LOSER.

353
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,333
- ( bell rings )

354
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,041
- WELL, LOOK WHO
FINALLY MADE IT.

355
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,083
- I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS OVER WITH.

356
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,291
- Both: SUMMON!

357
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,125
- CHECK THEIR AVATARS.

358
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,833
THEY LOOK AWFULLY BIG
AND STRONG, DON'T THEY?

359
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,666
IT'S ADORABLE.
- I SEE THAT. 

360
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,791
LET'S ROLL.

361
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,750
- SUMMON!
( giggles )

362
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,708
- SUMMON!

363
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,708
THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR US.

364
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,125
- All: WHOA!

365
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,250
- HECK YEAH!

366
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,791
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID IT!

367
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,750
- HEY, YUUJI, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

368
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,375
- WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT
I WOULD CONSIDER A CLEAR VIEW.

369
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,416
BUT I THINK THE FACELESS
ONE TOOK A SPLIT SECOND

370
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,875
TO GET TOTALLY NAKED.

371
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,041
BEAT UP ALL HER OPPONENTS,
AND PUT HER CLOTHES BACK ON.

372
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,083
- WHY DID SHE HAVE TO TAKE OFF
HER CLOTHES?

373
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,083
- WITHIN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF
TIME, KOUTA'S NOSE BLED,

374
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,250
HE STOPPED THE BLEEDING

375
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,000
AND PERFORMED HIS OWN
BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

376
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,708
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

377
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,125
AT THIS RATE, THEY MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE ABLE

378
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,458
TO CLEAR ALL THE CHECKPOINTS.

379
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,416
- YEAH.
I DOUBT IT.

380
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,291
IT'S ABOUT TO GET ROUGH
IN THERE.

381
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,125
- THE NEXT CHECKPOINT SHOULD BE
COMING UP PRETTY SOON, RIGHT?

382
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,833
- I THINK SO.
( gasps )

383
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,625
- KOUTA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

384
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,041
- WELCOME.
MY NAME IS AOI KOGURE.

385
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,291
AND I'M IN YEAR THREE,
CLASS "A."

386
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,041
I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF
THE TEA CEREMONY CLUB.

387
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,083
- HUH?

388
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,583
- NO.

389
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,791
- FOCUS, KOUTA,
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN HER!

390
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,208
- RIGHT.

391
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,916
- ( giggles )
OF COURSE YOU ARE, SILLY.

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,833
SURPRISE, THOUGH.

393
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,333
I'M WEARING AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT UNIFORM

394
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,416
UNDER THIS ONE.

395
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,833
- YOU SNEAKY LADY!

396
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,291
- PERHAPS.
REGARDLESS...

397
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,000
I BELONG TO ANOTHER GROUP TOO!

398
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,208
THE RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS CLUB!

399
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,000
- ( murmuring, screaming )

400
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,541
- YOU'RE BLEEDING EVERYWHERE!

401
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,458
SOMEBODY HELP US!
HE'S GONNA BLEED OUT!

402
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,875
- Boys:
WE'LL SAVE YOU, KOUTA!

403
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,500
RHYTHM GYMNASTICS!
RHYTHM GYMNASTICS!

404
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,000
RHYTHM GYMNASTICS!
RHYTHM GYMNASTICS!

405
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,833
- THIS IS BAD NEWS, YUUJI.

406
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,333
WE BETTER GRAB A CAMERA
AND HEAD IN THERE IMMEDIATELY!

407
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,333
( screams )
- I'M SORRY, AKI...

408
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,916
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

409
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,791
- I THINK SOMEONE HAS HAD
 FAR TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT.

410
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,208
- I DID GET THE GIST
OF THE SITUATION, THOUGH.

411
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,000
AND LUCKILY
I HAVE ANOTHER PLAN.

412
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,541
- I DO NOT LIKE THIS.
I HATE HAUNTED HOUSES

413
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,416
AND ALL THE STUPID
THINGS THEY STAND FOR.

414
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
- WHO'S THERE?

415
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,291
OH, IT'S JUST
A COUPLE OF GIRLS.

416
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,333
- GOOD CALL, MAN, DIRTY CHICK
TRICKS WON'T WORK ON THOSE TWO.

417
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,083
- YEP.  AND DON'T FORGET,
 YUUKO IS FROM CLASS "A."

418
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,291
- ( chuckles )
AREN'T THEY CUTE?

419
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,708
OBVIOUSLY,
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

420
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,833
TILL NEXT TIME.

421
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,500
I'LL LEAVE THEM TO YOU BOYS!

422
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,291
- ON IT!  SUMMON!

423
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,125
- LET'S IGNORE HOW IT LOOKS.

424
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,500
HIS SCORE'S NOT THAT HIGH.

425
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,666
- SUMMON!

426
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,625
- SUMMON!

427
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,500
HOW COME YOU GET TO BE
A SEXY CAT GIRL,

428
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,291
AND I'M JUST A PLAIN OLD CAT?!

429
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,708
- MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOU ALWAYS PLAYING COY.

430
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,541
- WHAT?!  WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- ( device trilling )

431
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,208
- OH, NO, HE'S GOT HER!

432
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,541
- THANKS FOR THE CONCERN,
BUT I'M GONNA BE FINE.

433
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,500
I'M NOT THAT WEAK, YOU KNOW.

434
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,125
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY...

435
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,500
I DETEST BUGS.

436
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,500
- ( cheering )

437
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,125
- Yuuko:
THAT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.

438
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,166
SHALL WE MOVE ON?
- Hideyoshi: ABSOLUTELY.

439
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
- ONE SEC, MY DEAR HIDEYOSHI.

440
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,166
- Both: HUH?

441
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,458
- CRAPOLA.

442
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,291
- I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
SPARE A WORD.

443
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,125
I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME
FOR THIS MOMENT.

444
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,750
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

445
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,375
AND I DON'T WANT TO.
JUST MAKE IT QUICK, OKAY?

446
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,041
- I'LL GET STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.

447
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,500
- TO WHAT POINT? 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

448
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,833
- HIDEYOSHI KINOSHITA...

449
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:12,333
I, UH-- WELL--

450
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,750
SEE, THE THING IS...

451
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,958
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!

452
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,333
- ( gasps )

453
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,750
- ( all murmuring )

454
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,958
- Aki: THAT DAY...

455
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,125
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

456
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,708
I HEARD HIDEYOSHI SCREAM.

457
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

458
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,708
- Kids: EVERYONE'S SONG!

459
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,708
- Tsunemura:
"SUN AND SUNFLOWER."

460
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,916
WHENEVER I NOTICE, MY EYES
ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWING YOU.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,333
AND NOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

462
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,333
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR YOUR SMILE.

463
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,541
I DON'T KNOW THE WORDS TO
DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS,

464
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,208
BUT I STILL WANT TO TELL YOU.

465
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,041
I LOVE YOU, HIDEYOSHI.

00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,958
I'M SERIOUSLY
MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

467
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,375
- GUYS, I'M SORRY.

468
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SCREAMED SO
LOUD AND FOR SO LONG LIKE THAT.

469
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,375
- COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE.

470
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,125
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, REALLY.

471
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,708
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO
WOULDN'T SCREAM

472
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:45,708
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

473
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,916
- Hideyoshi: THANKS.

474
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,333
I NEVER THOUGHT--

475
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,208
I MEAN, WHO KNEW
HE'D START READING

476
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,083
A POEM HE WROTE FOR ME?

477
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,291
- I THREW UP IN MY MOUTH,
IF THAT HELPS.

478
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,041
- All: MM-HMM.

479
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,333

484
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,958
- ARE YOU TOO SCARED OF US?

485
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,875
IS THAT WHY YOU HAVEN'T
COME IN HERE YET?

486
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,250
HEY HEY, YO, IT'S YOUR TURN
TO SAY SOMETHING NOW.

487
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:19,166
- HA, YEAH!

488
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,125
