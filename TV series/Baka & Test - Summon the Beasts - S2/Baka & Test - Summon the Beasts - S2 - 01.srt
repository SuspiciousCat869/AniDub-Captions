1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,458
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL, AKI?

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,541
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE GOING ON THIS TRIP?

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,125
- Fukuhara:
WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,333
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS AKIHISA YOSHI CORNERED.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,833
- OH, YOU WANT A NUMBER?

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,500
I GUESS MAYBE NINE,
INCLUDING YOU.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,958
- THAT'S FINE.
IF WE RENT A VAN,

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,291
IT SHOULDN'T 
BE A PROBLEM.

9
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,541
SO YOU INVITED SEVEN
OTHER PEOPLE?

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,875
WHO ELSE IS COMING?
- WELL, LET ME SEE.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,125
I INVITED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THAT I KNOW YOU LOVE.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,125
YUUJI FOR EXAMPLE.

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,083
AND HIDEYOSHI OF COURSE.

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,833
KOUTA SAID
HE WANTED TO GO.

15
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,041
- GREAT, WHO ELSE?

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,416
- RIGHT,
THAT'S ONLY THREE.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,458
UM...

18
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,791
THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER

19
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,000
IF SHE WASN'T
SO WEIRD ABOUT ME

20
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:56,958
BEING FRIENDS
WITH GIRLS.

21
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,166
I CAN PROBABLY GET AWAY
WITH TELLING HER

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,791
ABOUT SHOUKO
IF I PASS HER OFF

23
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,208
AS YUUJI'S FIANCE.

24
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,250
BUT THEN THERE'S HIMEJI.

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,708
AND WHAT ABOUT MINAMI?

26
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,250
( gasps )

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,250
AND AIKO!  I CAN'T
TELL HER ABOUT THEM.

28
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,833
SHE'LL CUT MY FACE OFF.

29
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,541
- WELL, WHO ELSE IS COMING?

30
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,208
- UM, OH, SURE, RIGHT.

31
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,125
LET'S SEE. 
- GO AHEAD.

32
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,500
YOU LEFT OFF AT HIDEYOSHI.

33
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,666
- IT'S A SECRET.

34
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,333
SEE? SHH.

35
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,625
- NO, IT'S NOT.

36
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,958
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME
THREE OF THEM.

37
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,041
THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS JUST JOKING.

38
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,083
- IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

39
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,333
DO AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A REWARD RIGHT ON YOUR LIPS.

40
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,750
- THE REST OF THEM
ARE ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE.

41
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,708
- VERY GOOD.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

42
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,333
- NO! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

43
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,708
I JUST LIED TO YOU.
I'M NOT WORTHY.

44
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,416
- DON'T BE MODEST.
ALL PEOPLE ARE

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,125
FROM OUTER SPACE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

46
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,333
- DID I SAY OUTER SPACE?
I MEAN, HORSES!

47
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,291
I'M INVITING
A BUNCH OF ANIMALS!

48
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,166
- ( sobs )

49
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,291
SUCH CRUEL REJECTION.

50
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,458
I'M YOUR SISTER.
DON'T YOU LOVE ME?

51
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,083
( cries )
- I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST THAT

52
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,166
THE WHOLE BROTHER-SISTER
KISSING THING IS A LITTLE--

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,708
- KINKY AND SEXY, RIGHT?

54
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,291
- PERVERT ALERT!

55
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,541
THERE IS A PERVERT
STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!

56
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,000
- YOU'LL FALL FOR ANYTHING,

57
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,458
WON'T YOU?
I WAS LIKE 30% JOKING.

58
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,916
- 30% MEANS SHE WAS
ALMOST ALL PERCENT SERIOUS.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,125
- YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
I DON'T KNOW BY NOW

60
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,166
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE LYING TO ME?

61
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,291
WHY WON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

62
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,833
I'M YOUR SISTER.
- I'LL TELL YOU 

63
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,041
IF YOU WON'T GET MAD.

64
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,666
- I WON'T.
I PROMISE 

65
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,250
I'M TOTALLY COOL
WITH THE WHOLE THING

66
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,583
AS LONG AS
THEY'RE NOT GIRLS.

67
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,416
IN WHICH CASE,
I MIGHT HAVE TO CUT YOU.

68
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,375
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

69
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,083
YOU GOT A DATE?
- I'M SORRY.

70
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,750
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME
OR GROW FANGS

71
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,500
OR GET THOSE WEIRD SWIRLY
THINGS AROUND YOUR HEAD. 

72
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,500
- I THINK I'LL BE SICK.
I CAN'T BELIEVE

73
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,958
YOU INVITED OTHER WOMEN.

74
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,291
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

75
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,583
IT'S JUST, UM...

76
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,375
( sighs )

77
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,458
I HAD A LOT OF HOMEWORK

78
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,000
AND THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT USUALLY TUTOR ME.

79
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,833
BESIDES, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

80
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,541
WE ALWAYS HANG OUT
AS A GROUP TOGETHER.

81
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,250
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS GONNA BE

82
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,458
AN OVERNIGHT THING.
- AND I'M JUST SUPPOSED

83
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,208
TO BELIEVE
ALL THAT TWADDLE, AM I?

84
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,625
I SUPPOSE I DO.

85
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,000
- REALLY?
THAT'S AWESOME!

86
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,791
- YES, I KNOW. 
YOU'RE WELCOME.

87
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,916
HOWEVER, IF I CATCH
YOU HOLDING HANDS, 

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,291
MAKING OUT, OR PLAYING
"HIDE THE SAUSAGE..."

89
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,833
- ( gulps )

90
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,500
- I WON'T HESITATE TO
KILL YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

91
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,916
- UH, THAT KINDA
INCLUDES YOU, AKIRA.

92
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

93
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,958
- Fukuhara: THE DAY OF THE
TRIP HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

94
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,541
YIPPEE.
- THIS IS PERFECT

95
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,291
BEACH WEATHER.
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

96
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,916
- YUP, I'M ALL ABOUT
THE BIKINIS THAT GO WITH IT.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,750
- I COULDN'T SLEEP,
I WAS SO EXCITED.

98
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,750
I DREAMT THAT
I WAS A MERMAID.

99
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,500
- YOU ARE SUCH A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
SOMETIMES. IT'S ADORABLE.

100
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,291
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO SEE
THE NEW SWIMSUIT

101
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,958
I BOUGHT FOR TODAY.
- WHAT? YOU JUST

102
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,375
BOUGHT A NEW SWIMSUIT
LAST WEEK.

103
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,875
- YEAH, BUT IT
DIDN'T EXACTLY FIT.

104
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,791
- NOTHING PERSONAL,
BUT DID YOU MAYBE

105
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,083
GAIN WEIGHT?

106
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,291
- IT'S NOT THAT
NOTICEABLE, IS IT?

107
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,250
I SWEAR IT'S NOT THAT MUCH.
JUST A LITTLE OR MAYBE A LOT,

108
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,166
I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

109
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,125
- ( growls ) IT'S COMPLICATED,
OKAY? I'M NOT FAT.

110
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,416
I JUST WEIGH
A TINY BIT MORE

111
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,125
BECAUSE MY HAIR GREW
AND GOT THICKER.

112
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,583
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
HAIR DOESN'T WEIGH THAT MUCH.

113
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,291
YOUR BOOBS GOT BIGGER
AND I ACTUALLY LOST WEIGHT.

114
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,541
- WHY ARE YOU RUBBING
THAT IN MY FACE?

115
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,250
YOU KNOW HOW HARD
THIS IS FOR ME.

116
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,125
- SORRY, IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL BETTER,

117
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,541
MY BOOBS SHRANK.

118
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,208
- I THINK MAYBE BOTH OF YOU
ARE BEING A LITTLE

119
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,833
OVERDRAMATIC
ABOUT ALL THIS.

120
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,833
YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME
AS YOU DID LAST YEAR.

121
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,416
- NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

122
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,583
BUT JUST BECAUSE MY BREASTS
GROW SLOWER THAN YOURS,

123
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,333
DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T GROW.
- HEY, I'M A GUY.

124
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,916
I DON'T HAVE BREASTS
THAT GROW AT ALL.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,833
- OH, WHATEVER, I KNOW
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

126
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,833
IT'S A FRICKIN'
MILKSHAKE FACTORY IN THERE

127
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,958
AND MY GIRLS ARE SHRIVELING UP
AND FALLING OFF.

128
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,375
- IT'S NICE THAT
YOU WERE BORN CURVY,

129
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,291
BUT YOU NEED TO BE 
WAY MORE SENSITIVE.

130
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,500
- REMEMBER THAT TIME
I TOLD YOU I WAS A GUY?

131
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,583
WELL, IT'S STILL TRUE.
SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE HECK

132
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,166
IS WRONG WITH
THE TWO OF YOU TODAY?

133
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,833
- Both: SHE'S WHAT'S WRONG.

134
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,083
- I JUST WANT
A SLICE OF HER BOOBS.

135
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,416
- HOW LONG DO I HAVE
TO STARVE TO BE THAT THIN?

136
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,166
- IT'S TRUE, SHE COULD
PROVE TO BE THE ENEMY.

137
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,208
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON YUUJI.

138
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
- SHE'S PRETTY HOT.
I WOULDN'T BLAME HIM.

139
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,833
IF I LOOKED LIKE HER,
I'D WALK AROUND

140
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,916
IN MY BIKINI ALL DAY
AND WAIT FOR MY TOP TO DROP

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,458
SO I COULD CHECK ME OUT.

142
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,833
- OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG, KOUTA?
ARE YOU CATCHING A COLD?

143
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,333
- NO, I JUST GET CARSICK.
- THAT'S STRANGE.

144
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,125
I DIDN'T KNOW NOSEBLEEDS
WERE A SYMPTOM.

145
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR THAT IN MY BAG.

146
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,208
AKI, CAN YOU HAND ME
THAT BLUE BOTTLE?

147
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,458
- YOU BETCHA.

148
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,208
WHAT THE CRAP?
THE ZIPPER'S NOT WORKING.

149
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,125
COME ON!
( grunts )

150
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,458
AND THAT'S HOW 
A STUD DOES IT.

151
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,250
- Fukuhara: I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHAT YEAR

152
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,000
THAT SCHOOL
SWIMSUIT IS FROM?

153
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,875
- Akihisa: WHERE DID YOU
EVEN FIND ONE OF THESE?!

154
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,208
- DAMN, WHAT WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT.

155
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,875
- DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

156
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,166
SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY
IS BEACHWEAR DELUSIONAL.

157
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,000
- YEAH, I THINK IT MIGHT
BE THE MEMBER WHO'S CLUTCHING

158
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,833
THE SWIMSUIT AND
QUIVERING LIKE A LETCH.

159
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,958
- THIS IS MY SISTER'S
SWIMSUIT, FYI.

160
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,208
- THAT IS BAD THEN.

161
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,500
YOU HAVE A SICK
AND TWISTED THING

162
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,791
FOR YOUR SISTER'S
TIGHT CLOTHING.

163
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,375
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY WHACK.

164
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,791
- SHUT UP! YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

165
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,875
- LOOK, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO FREAK OUT ON ME.

166
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,500
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
YOU'D BE EMBARRASSED

167
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,916
IF I WORE SOMETHING
TOO SKIMPY.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,583
SO I BROUGHT MY
OLD SWIM TEAM SUIT.

169
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,208
- JUMPING JACK CRACK! I FORGOT
HOW HORRIBLE IT WOULD BE

170
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,083
TO WALK AROUND WITH
YOU WEARING THAT THING.

171
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,333
I CHANGED MY MIND.  I'D RATHER
YOU SKANK OUT ON THE BEACH

172
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,375
THAN WEAR THAT.
I TAKE IT BACK!

173
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,166
YOU'RE MY SISTER AND
I WILL PROTECT US BOTH

174
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,458
FROM ALL THINGS GRANNY!
- IT'S OKAY TO ADMIT

175
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,375
YOU'D RATHER HAVE ME
SHOW MORE SKIN.

176
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WANT YOU NOW.

177
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,875
- I NEVER REALIZED I WAS FRIENDS
WITH SUCH A PERV-A-TRON.

178
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,458
- COMING FROM THE MOST
CREEP-TASTIC PERV

179
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,750
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE!

180
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,958
- YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

181
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,750
SOMETIMES, AS A JOKE, FRIENDS
CALL EACH OTHER NAMES.

182
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,208
- WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING
TO ME LIKE YOU KNOW THINGS?

183
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,750
- I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR

184
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,250
THE NEW STRING BIKINI
I BOUGHT.

185
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,083
OH, WELL, THAT OTHER ONE
WAS TOO TIGHT.

186
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,416
MY GIRLS KEPT POPPING OUT.

187
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,541
- ( Akihisa screams )

188
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,625
- Akihisa: YES, NOW THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

189
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,041
- IT FEELS GREAT OUT HERE.
- WE PICKED A GOOD SPOT.

190
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,500
- YEAH, WE DID.
C'MON, LET'S GO CHANGE

191
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,125
SO WE CAN SWIM.
- OKAY.

192
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,375
- THIS IS IT.
THE DAY I SHOW EVERYONE

193
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,750
ONCE AND FOR ALL
THAT I AM 100% DUDE.

194
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,750
I PICKED THE RIGHT 
SWIMSUIT THIS TIME.

195
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,041
BOTTOMS, NO TOP.
NO WAY THEY'LL QUESTION ME.

196
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,208
- THIS DAY'S GONNA RULE.

197
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,833
CHECK ME OUT. I JUST
NINJA-CHANGED IN THE CAR.

198
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,791
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
THE AWKWARD TAN LINES.

199
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,958
I'M HOPING THIS SUIT
WILL HELP THEM BLEND IN.

200
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,416
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK, KOUTA?
AM I DEAD SEXY?

201
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,041
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?
I'M GONNA LET YOU

202
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,750
TAKE PICTURES OF ME TODAY,
AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

203
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,833
- THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.
MY MEMORY IS FULL.

204
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,666
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE,

205
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,875
BUT I DON'T
LIKE THAT OUTFIT.

206
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,166
IT'S HOT OUTSIDE.
MY NOSE IS DRY.

207
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,208
- 28 SECONDS.
I'M IMPRESSED, BRO.

208
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,625
THAT'S LIKE
A RECORD FOR YOU.

209
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,375
- THAT'S A LOT LONGER
THAN LAST TIME.

210
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,958
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
- AWW, POOR THING.

211
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,583
LET ME HELP YOU
CLEAN THAT UP. 

212
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,125
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO STAY OVER THERE.

213
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,041
- IT'S HOT!
IT'S SO HOT.

214
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,791
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- THIS ISN'T THE END.

215
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,625
I'M GOING TO COME BACK
AS A LITTLE BIRD.

216
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,041
YOU'LL SEE.
- STOP THAT.  IT'S NOT FUNNY.

217
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,250
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

218
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,791
- I'LL STILL BE WITH YOU.

219
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,708
BUT NOW I'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE DOWN YOUR SHIRT

220
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,000
FROM THE SKY AND FLY INTO
THE GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM.

221
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,125
- Fukuhara: AND SO HE WOULD
CONTINUE IN DEATH

222
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
AS HE DID IN LIFE,

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,375
FLYING AND CRASHING.

224
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,125
- Akihisa:
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY.

225
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,958
LIME GOES REALLY
GOOD WITH COCONUT.

226
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,291
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

227
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,208
I'M SO SORRY.  I DIDN'T MEAN
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

228
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,666
- I CERTAINLY DID.

229
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,000
- HOW IS HE? 
ANY PROGRESS OR...

230
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,083
- HE'S ABOUT
THE SAME I'D SAY.

231
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,625
- I THINK YOU NEED TO STOP
TOUCHING HIM. THAT DOESN'T HELP.

232
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,750
- AWW, I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

233
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,541
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP
HIM KEEP COOL.  SEE?

234
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,000
- MAYBE IT'S YOU.

235
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,625
YOU LOOK SO GOOD
IN YOUR SWIMSUIT

236
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,791
THAT KOUTA GOT EXCITED
ALL OVER AGAIN.

237
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,750
- ( shivers )
I HEARD THAT.

238
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,000
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO WAY TO PROVE IT.

239
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,500
- ( giggles )

240
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,000
- EXCITED HOW?
- WELL, THE SAME WAY

241
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
ANY GUY WOULD GET EXCITED,
I GUESS.

242
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,041
- GOTCHA.

243
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,333
SCISSORS.
- ( Yuuji screams )

244
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,125
WHAT THE HECK
WAS THAT FOR?

245
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,833
- MUCH BETTER.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCITED

246
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,958
ABOUT SEEING ME
IN A SWIMSUIT, YUUJI.

247
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,708
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO THAT FAR.

248
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,291
YOU TWO ARE ALWAYS HOT
SO IT'S NO BIG DEAL FOR US.

249
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,333
- THAT'S SO NICE.
SORRY I'M BLUSHING,

250
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
BUT I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU CALL ME HOT.

251
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,625
- YES, THAT WAS VERY 
SWEET OF YOU, THANKS.

252
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,625
- AND I GUESS I'M JUST
A TWIG WALKING AROUND

253
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,458
IN A PAPER SAC, HMM?
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.  I MEAN,

254
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,708
YOU'RE PRETTY SCRAWNY
OVERALL, BUT SOME AREAS ARE

255
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,375
A LITTLE THICKER THAN OTHERS.
 - YOU JERK-FACE,

256
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,416
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
COME OUT AND SAY IT?

257
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,750
YOU THINK I'M FAT, DON'T YOU?
- WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FAT?

258
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,416
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING,
YOU GUYS!

259
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,333
I'M FINALLY DONE CHANGING.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

260
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

261
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,000
GET BACK IN THERE.
- ARE YOU GUYS CLOSING?

262
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,583
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING
A TOP WITH THAT?

263
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,541
- BECAUSE THIS IS
A GUY'S SWIMSUIT.

264
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,416
IT DOESN'T COME WITH A TOP.
- WELL, GIRLS SHOULDN'T BE 

265
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,916
WEARING GUY'S
SWIMSUITS OUT HERE.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,833
- I AGREE WITH YOU,
BUT I'M NOT A GIRL.

267
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,375
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME WITH ME.

268
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,375
- PUT ME DOWN!
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

269
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,750
I PROMISE I'M A GUY!
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU!

270
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,375
- I'M SORRY, MINAMI.

271
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
IS MY BROTHER BEING
A TURD AGAIN?

272
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,250
DO YOU WANT ME TO PLOW HIM?

273
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,583
- ( cries )
- OH, GOODNESS.

274
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,250
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

275
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,916
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,458
LIVE MY ENTIRE LIFE
BEING INADEQUATE.

277
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,708
- I'M SO SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

278
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,875
THOSE ARE AMAZING.

279
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,083
- DON'T HATE ME.
I'VE JUST ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS.

280
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,125
IT'S A CRUEL,
CRUEL SUMMER, ISN'T IT?

281
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,666
- NO, THE WORLD
JUST HATES US.

282
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,375
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, YOU GUYS.
TALK ABOUT RIDICULOUS.

283
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HIDEYOSHI?
YOU LOOK UPSET?

284
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,208
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
ABOUT EARLIER?

285
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,250
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
LET'S MOVE ON.

286
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
- Fukuhara: THE SUMMER IS
VERY CRUEL,

287
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,875
ESPECIALLY WHEN BEACHES
ARE INVOLVED.

288
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,708
- BAKA AND TEST.

289
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,041
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE TO YOUR RIGHT,

290
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,750
AKIHISA.
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

291
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,708
JUST TRY GOING LEFT.
- KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

292
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,375
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

293
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,833
- THAT HELPS.
WHO'S TELLING THE TRUTH?

294
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,958
- IT'S PRECISELY 32 DEGREES LEFT
OF WHERE YOU'RE FACING NOW.

295
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,291
AND THEN FORWARD AT 4.7 METERS.

296
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,708
- IT'S TOTALLY
THE OTHER WAY, BRO.

297
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,541
- EVERYONE'S GIVING ME
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

298
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,541
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WAIT, WHERE'S YUUJI?

299
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,166
- YUUJI, HOW'S MY SUIT?

300
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,666
- LOOKS THE SAME
AS IT DID EARLIER.

301
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,625
NOTHING'S DIFFERENT.
- THAT'S BECAUSE

302
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,583
YOU'RE STILL STANDING
IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE.

303
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,333
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT UP CLOSE.
- NO! I DON'T WANT

304
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,250
YOU TO TOUCH ME.
I MEAN, IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE,

305
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,250
IT'LL JUST LOOK BLURRY.

306
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,041
- MELON CRUSHER!

307
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,791
WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!
- ( screams )

308
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,708
- DUDE, THAT WAS CLOSE!

309
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541
- DAMN, I MISSED.

310
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,500
WOW, I'M REALLY SORRY.

311
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,291
I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THE MELON
WAS HERE SOMEWHERE.

312
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,041
- HUH, THAT'S FUNNY.
NOBODY TOLD YOU

313
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,416
TO HEAD IN THAT DIRECTION.
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

314
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,333
THAT I AIMED AT YUUJI
ON PURPOSE?  I AM INSULTED.

315
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,958
- HIDEYOSHI, BACK OFF,
ALL RIGHT, MAN?

316
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,291
DON'T TRY TO GET IN THE WAY

317
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,791
OF A DUDE'S
WATERMELON-BASHING TIME.

318
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,791
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
NOW STEP ASIDE

319
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,041
WHILE THE PRO 
TAKES A SWING.

320
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,958
- ( both strain )

321
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,625
- AWW, WHAT'S WRONG, BRO?
DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME THE WOOD?

322
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,083
- IF I RECALL, YOU ALREADY HAD
YOUR TURN AND TOTALLY FAILED.

323
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,625
- THAT WAS JUST ROUND ONE.
I SAY IT'S TIME FOR ROUND TWO.

324
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,375
AND IN ROUND TWO, I GO FIRST.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

325
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SWITCH UP THE ORDER.

326
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,458
- HEY, GUYS, I WAS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

327
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,500
TO EATING THE WATERMELONS.
DO YOU THINK WE COULD JUST

328
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
DROP THE GAME
ALL TOGETHER, PLEASE?

329
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,916
- Both: OH, DON'T WORRY.
NOBODY'S GONNA

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,250
BE AIMING AT THE WATERMELON.

331
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,125
- Hideyoshi:
UH, I THINK THIS GAME

332
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,708
IS TAKING A TURN.

333
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,083
- AH, I'M BEAT.

334
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,833
- I HAVEN'T EVEN
GONE SWIMMING YET.

335
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,875
WHY AM I SO
EXHAUSTED ALREADY?

336
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,333
- CHASING EACH OTHER
WITH A BAT WILL DO THAT.

337
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,833
- WE HAVE RETURNED!
- HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

338
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,125
WE BROUGHT YOU LUNCH.
- SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG,

339
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,708
YOU GUYS.
- WAS IT CROWDED?

340
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,291
- NO, NOT EXACTLY.
- YEAH,

341
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,458
BUT WE STILL
TOTALLY GOT HIT ON.

342
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
- WHICH IS AWESOME IF YOU'RE
INTO THAT SORT OF THING.

343
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,958
- IT MAKES ME ILL.

344
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,041
- YEAH, MAN,
IT MUST SUCK TO BE HOT.

345
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,208
- YOU KNOW, DUDES'LL LEAVE YOU
ALONE IF YOU JUST LAUGH AT 'EM.

346
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,916
- TRUE STORY.

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,916
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,958
- DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER
EVER TEACH YOU ANY MANNERS?

349
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,000
- MANNERS?
- ( sighs )

350
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,583
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A GIRL.

351
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,416
- HEY, YOU NEED TO FEEL A LITTLE
MORE THREATENED BY THIS, YUUJI.

352
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,041
- ( chuckles )
BY WHAT?

353
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,708
MY BRAIN IS PULSING!

354
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,125
- YOU KNOW,
I WISH WE COULD GET

355
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,958
AKIHISA TO FEEL A LITTLE
JEALOUS OVER US.

356
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,750
WOULDN'T THAT
MAKE HIM EVEN CUTER?

357
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,666
- GOOD PLAN.  LET'S SEE IF
WE CAN MAKE HIM WORRY A LITTLE.

358
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,916
- YEAH, LET'S.

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,333
- SO ANNOYING.

360
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,500
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT A PAIN.
RIGHT, MIZUKI?

361
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,458
- ABSOLUTELY.
ALWAYS BOTHERING US

362
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,375
WITH THEIR SEXY TALK.

363
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,208
- SO WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING YOU TWO
GET HIT ON A WHOLE BUNCH.

364
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,916
- YEAH, ALL THE TIME
AND BY GUYS.

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,791
- THEY JUST WANT A PIECE
OF THIS SWEET ACTION.

366
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,541
- THAT SO? THEN WHY'D
YOU GUYS ACT

367
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,333
LIKE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
IT EVER HAPPENED?

368
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,791
- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT.
IT'S JUST SO DISGUSTING,

369
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,541
IT ALWAYS FEELS
LIKE THE FIRST TIME.

370
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,416
- STRAIGHT UP.
IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOU

371
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,041
SINCE YOU'RE ALL ANDROID WHEN
IT COMES TO FLIRTING AND STUFF.

372
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,291
- THAT'S RUDE.  WHEN IT
COMES TO HITTING ON GIRLS,

373
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,916
I CAN TOTALLY--
- YOU CAN WHAT TOTALLY?

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,625
- YES, TELL US, PLEASE?

375
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,958
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

376
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,208
I BET YOU THINK 
HITTING ON GIRLS

377
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,666
HAS SOMETHING TO
DO WITH BRUISES.

378
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,125
- SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING

379
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,625
THAT COMES NATURALLY TO YOU.

380
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,541
SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING CUTE AND CHARMING,

381
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,458
WELL, YOU'RE
JUST BEING AWKWARD.

382
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,958
- YOU CAN'T FATHOM THE DEPTHS
OF A FEMALE HEART, YUUJI.

383
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,041
THAT'S WHY YOU SUCK.

384
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,375
- OH YEAH?! TRY SAYING
THAT TO MY FACE.

385
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,166
- EVERYBODY HAS HIS OR HER
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. 

386
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,750
YOU BOYS JUST AREN'T GOOD
AT FLIRTING WITH GIRLS.

387
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,333
- ( growls )

388
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,708
- CRAP, THAT WAS
TEN KINDS OF BALLS.

389
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,583
- IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THEY
WERE ALL GANGING UP ON US.

390
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,375
- WHERE DO THEY GET OFF
THINKING THEY KNOW HOW 

391
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,666
OTHER GIRLS SEE US?
- RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

392
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,875
IF I WANTED TO, I COULD HIT ON
ANY GIRL I SAW.

393
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,750
NO PROBLEMO.
( gasps, grunts )

394
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,208
- WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

395
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,875
- I THINK I MIGHT 
BE LOSING MY MIND.

396
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,208
I SAW GIRLS AROUND HIM.
- HUH?

397
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,625
- AROUND KOUTA,
HE'S BEING

398
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,916
HIT ON BY
A BUNCH OF GIRLS.

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,708
- YEAH, YOU ARE LOSING
YOUR MIND.

400
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,083
I KEEP TELLING YOU TO CUT IT
WITH THE CRAZY TALK.

401
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,083
- WOW, I BET YOU'RE
REALLY GOOD WITH A CAMERA.

402
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,583
- I JUST TAKE PICTURES
FOR FUN, MOSTLY.

403
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,000
- HE'S SO SHY.
THAT'S ADORABLE AND HOT.

404
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,166
- ( gags )

405
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,875
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

406
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,708
GIRLS DON'T GO
AFTER THAT GUY.

407
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,000
- YUUJI.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

408
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,041
- HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING HERE,

409
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,916
DO YOU THINK IT
COULD REALLY BE TRUE?

410
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,833
ARE WE THE ONLY
UNPOPULAR ONES?

411
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,208
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

412
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,083
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT CAN BE RIGHT!

413
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,083
- YEAH, WE'RE
THE EPITOME OF AWESOMENESS.

414
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,291
- ( both laugh )

415
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,875
- KOUTA IS JUST
PLAYING OFF THE FACT

416
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,500
THAT HE LOOKS LIKE
A HOMELESS LITTLE ORPHAN KID.

417
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,375
THAT'S ALL.
- AND THAT'S NOT OUR STYLE

418
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,500
'CAUSE WE'RE MEN, RIGHT?
- WE'RE MEN AND A HALF, YO.

419
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,916
LET 'EM TRY
TO CALL US UNPOPULAR.

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,375
- WAIT TILL THEY SEE
ME MACKING ON GIRLS 

421
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,750
LIKE I JUST GOT
OUT OF PRISON.

422
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,125
I'LL HIT ON EVERYTHING
THAT MOVES.

423
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,708
- TRY TO KEEP THE CREEPY
STUFF TO YOURSELF.

424
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,208
AND NEVER SAY
THAT OUT LOUD AGAIN.

425
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,083
BUT I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU!
- ROCK ON!

426
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,500
THINKING BACK ON IT,

427
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:17,625
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH US.

428
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,041
YOU KNOW, WE STILL
DON'T HAVE A PLAN 

429
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,500
ON HOW TO
DO THIS WHOLE THING.

430
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,750
- I THINK WE GOT TO
TAKE A PAGE FROM KOUTA.

431
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,958
THE DUDE DOES SCORE, MAN.

432
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
- SO WE JUST LOOK FOR CHICKS

433
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,708
WHO WANT TO GET
THEIR PICTURES TAKEN?

434
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,791
- YEAH, FIRST ONE OF US
WILL GO UP TO A GIRL

435
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,666
AND OPEN IT UP BY
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE

436
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,375
"YO, DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE YOUR PICTURE?"

437
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,416
- OKAY, IT'S DIRECT.
- THEN THE OTHER ONE

438
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,958
TRIES TO STRIKE UP
A CONVERSATION

439
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,250
WHILE WE'RE SETTING UP
THE SHOT.

440
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,416
AFTER THAT, IT SHOULD BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

441
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,708
- SO HOW DO WE GET
A CONVERSATION GOING?

442
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,500
- THAT'S TOTALLY UP
TO THE SECOND PERSON,

443
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,875
HOWEVER THEY WANT TO DO IT.

444
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,541
- IF THE WHOLE THING
FAILS THEN,

445
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,708
IT'D BE
THE SECOND PERSON'S FAULT.

446
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,000
- ( both scream )

447
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,583
- DON'T BE AN ASS, AKIHISA.

448
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,666
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING LIKE
A MANIAC ALL OF A SUDDEN?

449
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,208
- WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
LIKE A COKED UP CHEETAH?

450
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,291
- JUST LET ME SET
THIS UP FOR YOU!

451
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,000
- NO, I'LL SET IT UP.

452
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,250
AND THEN YOU CAN
TAKE THE PICS.

453
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,958
- YOU JUST WANT
TO GET THERE FIRST

454
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,500
AND WEDGE ME OUT 
OF IT COMPLETELY.

455
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,875
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

456
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,375
- ( both scream )

457
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,250
- OKAY, IT'S READY.
EVERYBODY SMILE BIG.

458
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,458
- ( panting )

459
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,208
- OH, HEY THERE.
YOU'RE A GIRL.

460
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,500
AND I LIKE THE GIRLS.
YOU'RE REALLY SPECIAL LOOKING.

461
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,416
- I KNOW YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU ALL HOT

462
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,791
IN YOUR TEENY BIKINI.

463
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,583
- ( dialing )

464
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,625
( phone rings )

465
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,916
- I NEVER FIGURED
THEY'D CALL THE POLICE.

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,708
- SO I GUESS WE SHOULD GIVE UP
THE WHOLE PHOTOGRAPHY ANGLE.

467
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,625
- YEAH.  KOUTA'S A FRAUD.

468
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,208
HE MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY,
BUT IT'S A FLIPPIN' BEATING.

469
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,500
- OKAY THEN.
TIME FOR A NEW PLAN.

470
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,291
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

471
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,000
- JUST STICK TO WHAT WE KNOW.
GIVE THEM SOME PHONY COMPLIMENTS

472
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,916
AND THEN INVITE THEM
BACK TO OUR CAMP SITE.

473
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,708
- YEAH, WOMEN ALWAYS
LIKE TO BE COMPLIMENTED.

474
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,333
BUT WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO THEM?

475
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,291
- UH, YOU KNOW,
JUST A BUNCH OF LIES,

476
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,750
LIKE TELLING THEM 
THEY LOOK PRETTIER

477
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,583
THAN AN AIRBRUSHED MODEL
ON A MAGAZINE COVER

478
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,500
OR THAT THEY SHOULD
BE IN MOVIES.

479
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,875
THEN ONCE THEY'RE DISTRACTED BY
THEIR DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR... 

480
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,791
- Both: THEY'LL BE 
PUTTY IN OUR HANDS.

481
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,250
- OH, THANKS.

482
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,791
- NO PROB.  ANYTHING
FOR A PRETTY LADY.

483
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
- AWW, THAT'S VERY SWEET.

484
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,333
- YEAH, AND THAT'S
A RIGHTEOUSLY HOT BOD

485
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,041
YOU'RE SPORTING THERE.
- I THINK SO TOO.

486
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,250
YOU MUST WORKOUT A LOT.
- OH, STOP.

487
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,375
YOU GUYS ARE EMBARRASSING ME. 
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE

488
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,125
EMBARRASSED BY THE TRUTH, MISS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

489
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,583
WE'RE JUST TELLING IT
LIKE IT IS.

490
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,000
THAT'S ALL, MA'AM.
- HECK YEAH.

491
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,666
YOUR CURVES ARE UNSTOPPABLE.

492
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,250
YOU'RE LIKE...
- YEAH, YOU'RE JUST LIKE A...

493
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,750
- Both: LIKE A HIGH-BUDGET
PORNO ACTRESS.

494
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,875
- MAN, SHE HAD A SERIOUS
RIGHT HOOK ON HER.

495
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,375
- SHE PUNCHED ME
IN THE HEAD SO HARD

496
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,125
IT MADE THE BOTTOMS
OF MY FEET HURT.

497
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,583
I MEAN, HOW DOES 
THAT EVEN HAPPEN?

498
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,166
- THERE THEY ARE.

499
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,791
WE MISSED YOU.
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN DOING?

500
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,500
- YOUR FACES ARE SWOLLEN.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

501
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,166
- NOTHING REALLY 
HAPPENED AS SUCH.

502
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,083
RIGHT, YUUJI?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, BRO.

503
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,416
WE JUST FELL AND HIT
OUR FACE ON ROCKS, DIDN'T WE?

504
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,375
- I ALMOST FORGOT
THE SWIMMING COMPETITION.

505
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,958
HURRY UP!
- OH, YEAH!

506
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,583
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE THIS TIME.

507
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,500
- WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

508
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,125
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO BRING UP
A PORNO FLICK?

509
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,166
- YOU SAID IT TOO,
OR DID YOU FORGET THAT?

510
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,500
- HEY, DON'T YOU GO TRYING TO
PIN THIS ON ME ALL OF A SUDDEN.

511
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,291
- ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANOTHER
SKULL-CRACKING?

512
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,416
( sighs )
LET'S STOP.

513
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,000
THIS ISN'T GETTING
US ANYWHERE.

514
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,541
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

515
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,458
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

516
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
WE KEEP SCREWING 
THINGS UP BECAUSE

517
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
WE'RE NOT REALLY 
INTO THESE GIRLS.

518
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,916
I MEAN, SINCE THEY'RE
NOT OUR TYPES,

519
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,083
I THINK WE MIGHT
BE UNCONSCIOUSLY

520
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,541
HOLDING OURSELVES
BACK FROM THEM.

521
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,708
- OF COURSE,
IF WE REALLY WANTED THEM,

522
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,708
WE COULD TOTALLY
BE UP IN THERE. 

523
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,583
- YEAH, NO, WE'RE DORKS.

524
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,250
- ( laughs ) OH, HELL, YEAH.
ALMOST HAD ME THOUGH.

525
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,250
NOW WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

526
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,250
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE TRY ONE LAST TIME

527
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,291
WITH THEM.
- YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

528
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,625
UM, PARDON ME.

529
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,500
- UH, SO THIS IS
A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSING,

530
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,291
BUT WE'RE KIND OF LOST
AT THE MOMENT.

531
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,166
- THAT'S RIGHT, WE WERE LOOKING
FOR THE PUBLIC BEACH,

532
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,666
BUT WE COULDN'T SEEM
TO FIND IT ANYWHERE.

533
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,416
COULD YOU HELP US OUT?
- OH MY GOD.

534
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,458
WE'RE STANDING ON
THE PUBLIC BEACH, YOU IDIOT.

535
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,125
- SHUT UP.  YOU SAID WE GOT LOST
SO I WAS JUST ROLLING WITH IT.

536
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,625
- ( theme music plays )

537
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,625
( music winds down )

538
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,500
- HOLD ON, HER HAIR
LOOKS DIFFERENT.

539
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,541
IT CHANGED COLOR!

540
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,875
- IT'S THE SAME COLOR
THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

541
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,833
- WOW, IT LOOKS GREAT.

542
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,333
- DANGER!

543
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,500
- Kouta: I'M SORRY, AKIHISA.

544
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,000
- NO FREAKIN' WAY.
YOU WOULD BETRAY US?

545
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,375
- I HAD TO DO IT, MAN.

546
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,958
OTHERWISE, THEY WERE
GOING TO KILL ME.

547
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,541
- SO I GUESS THEY KNEW
WE WERE TALKING TO GIRLS.

548
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,458
- THEY SAID IT WOULD
JUST BE THE RIGHT ARM.

549
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,833
- AN ARM IS AN ARM, MAN.

550
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,458
AND I NEED MY ARM.

551
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,041
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
GO BACK THERE, PLEASE.

552
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,208
- NO, THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING
TO BREAK EVERYTHING ELSE

553
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,291
AND LEAVE YOU WITH 
JUST THE RIGHT ARM.

554
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:09,166
- Mizuki: AKIHISA, HELLO?
PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

555
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,500
- Minami: YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET

556
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,458
A FULL DAY'S LESSON
IN ARM TWISTING.

557
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,166
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.
- Akira: CAN YOU HEAR ME?

558
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,833
THIS IS YOUR SISTER.
COME BACK TO ME, LITTLE BROTHER.

559
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,708
- Hideyoshi: RUN, AKIHISA!
- Aiko: THESE LADIES

560
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,125
ARE READY TO THROW DOWN.

561
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,875
- ( girls grunt )
- ( static )

562
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:25,500
- GOOD-BYE, AKIHISA.
WE HAD A GOOD TIME, DIDN'T WE?

563
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,333
- ( screams )

564
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,541
- YUUJI.

565
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,666
- YEAH?

566
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,500
- SIT DOWN.
- WHAT?

567
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,666
BUT I CAN'T.
- SIT DOWN!

568
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,083
- UH, BUT WE'RE KINDA
IN AN OCEAN.

569
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,375
- ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ME
SAY IT AGAIN?

570
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,041
GOOD BOY.

571
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,500
- Fukuhara: QUESTION TWO:

572
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,083
ASIDE FROM WATER, WHAT IS THE
PRIMARY COMPONENT OF SEA WATER?

573
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,916
- Akihisa:
TEARS OF REGRET AND PENITENCE.

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,708
- STOP WHINING.
- NEXT EPISODE,

575
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,583
"ME, YUKATA,
AND FESTIVITIES."

576
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,666
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
