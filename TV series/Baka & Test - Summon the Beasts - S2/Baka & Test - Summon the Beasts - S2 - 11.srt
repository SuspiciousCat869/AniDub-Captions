1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,166
- I WONDER...
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,958
- I WONDER...
WHEN DID EVERYTHING CHANGE?

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,250
- IF I COULD DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN,

4
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,125
IF I WAS ONLY
GIVEN THE CHANCE.

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,708
- Shouko: EVER SINCE THE MOMENT
I SAW HIS SHOULDERS TREMBLING. 

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,791
THAT DAY, THAT PLACE.

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,291
- I WANT TO SET HER FREE.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,000
SHE SHOULDN'T BE
HELD CAPTIVE BY THIS ANYMORE.

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:48,291
- NO, HE'S WRONG.

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,625
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S
MORE TO IT THAN THAT. 

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,041
IN THE END,

12
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,583
I FOUND SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT.

13
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,666
- Both: I REMEMBER.

14
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,708
- ( theme music playing )

15
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,708
- DID YOU HEAR THERE'S A WHIZ
KID IN MINAZUKI ELEMENTARY?

17
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,291
THAT RUMOR SNAKED ITS WAY
THROUGH THE SCHOOL

18
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,166
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

19
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,208
THE WHIZ KID IN QUESTION
WAS INDEED SOMEWHAT SMARTER

20
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,458
THAN THE OTHER STUDENTS.

21
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,416
ON TOP OF THAT,
HE WAS UNUSUALLY FOCUSED

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,833
AND A DILIGENT HARD WORKER.

23
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,291
ALL THE ADULTS
SANG HIS PRAISES

24
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,833
AND HAD UNDERSTANDABLY
HIGH HOPES FOR HIM.

25
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,625
THEN ONE DAY...

26
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,750
- YOU ARE AMAZING, YUUJI.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,750
- THE TEACHER KEPT
BRAGGING ABOUT YOUR SCORES

28
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,250
ON THE PREP TEST.
SHE CALLED YOU A BOY WONDER.

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,833
- YOU SAY THAT LIKE
I SHOULD CARE OR SOMETHING.

30
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,500
- DIDN'T YOU GET
EVEN BETTER SCORES

31
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,166
THAN THE KIDS FROM
JUNIOR HIGH?

32
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,166
- YEAH, I GUESS.
- SEE, THAT'S AMAZING.

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,250
THOSE SIXTH GRADERS
WHO TOOK THE TEST WITH YOU

34
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,833
WERE NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT EITHER.

35
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,458
- I MADE A MISTAKE
ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCE TEST.

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,083
OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN NUMBER ONE.

37
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,041
- Yuuji: BACK THEN, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE THE BEST.

38
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,375
I NEEDED IT.

39
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,041
- Young Shouko: I HEARD
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ADMITTED

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
TO THE BEST
JUNIOR HIGH AROUND

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,875
ON A RECOMMENDATION ALONE.

42
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,125
- YEAH, EASY ENOUGH FOR ME.

43
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,291
THOUGH, MOST OTHER KIDS
WON'T STAND A CHANCE.

44
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,958
- Yuuji: UNFORTUNATELY,
I HAD AN EGO

45
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,250
THAT WAS COMPLETELY INTERTWINED
WITH A SUPERIORITY COMPLEX.

46
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,541
- WILL YOU PLEASE
KEEP WORKING, SHOUKO?

47
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,750
I WANT TO FINISH THIS
SO I CAN GO HOME.

48
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,291
- ( sighs )

49
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,958
BUT I WAS HOPING
WE COULD STAY HERE

50
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,458
AND TALK FOR AWHILE.

51
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,875
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

52
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,583
- BUT I WANT TO TALK.
- I DON'T.

53
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,833
- YES.
- I SAID NO.

54
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,666
- YES.
- NO! 

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,708
- YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,916
I THINK MY BOOBS ARE
GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,916
EVERY DAY.
- ( grunts )

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,750
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
YUUJI?

59
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,666
- SERIOUSLY? WHERE IN THE
HELL DID THAT COME FROM?

60
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,916
- YOU WERE ATTEMPTING
TO IGNORE ME,

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
SO I DECIDED TO
BRING UP SOMETHING

62
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
A BOY WOULD FIND
INTERESTING.

63
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,333
- NICE TRY,
BUT I STILL DON'T CARE.

64
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,875
- Yuuji: THAT MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY TRUE.

65
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,333
- WILL YOU PLEASE JUST
GET BACK TO WORK?

66
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,833
- I DON'T MIND WORKING.

67
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,916
BUT I WANT TO TALK
WITH YOU TOO.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,916
- DON'T YOU EVER
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
- YES.  THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO NOW.

70
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,958
- YEAH, LUCKY ME.

71
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,541
- Yuuji:
SHOUKO DIDN'T QUITE FIT IN

72
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,958
WITH THE REST OF THE SCHOOL.

73
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,791
SHE CAME FROM
A WELL-KNOWN FAMILY,

74
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,291
WAS AT THE TOP OF HER CLASS,

75
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,958
HAD INCREDIBLE
ATHLETIC TALENT,

76
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,541
AND OF COURSE,
WAS BEAUTIFUL.

77
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,208
SHE WAS THE LUCKY ONE,

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,583
AND EVERYONE
RESENTED HER FOR IT.

79
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,000
- GOOD MORNING.
MY NAME IS SHOUKO.

80
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,708
- ( kids murmuring )

81
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,041
- HMM.

82
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,208
- DUDE, YOU SHOULD
GO TALK TO HER.

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,583
- WHY? YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTS TO, YOU BUTT HEAD.

84
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,791
- YEAH. I THINK YOU WANT HER TO
BE YOUR VERY FIRST GIRLFRIEND.

85
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,500
- NO I DON'T.

86
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,000
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

87
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,000
IS THAT KIRISHIMA GIRL 
TRYING TO ACT TOO CUTE?

88
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,583
- HER FAMILY'S RICH.
I BET SHE'S A SPOILED PRINCESS.

89
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,125
- SHE'S NOT EASY TO TALK TO,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

90
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,166
- Students: I KNOW, RIGHT?

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,916
- Yuuji: WITH THE WAY ALL
THOSE KIDS BEHAVED TOWARDS HER,

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
IT'S NO WONDER SHOUKO
ENDED UP GETTING ATTACHED TO ME.

93
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,583
AFTER ALL,
I TREATED EVERYONE THE SAME,

94
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,833
NO MATTER WHAT.

95
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,875
- SO IT'S ALREADY
BEEN TWO YEARS

96
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,833
SINCE YOU TRANSFERRED
TO THIS SCHOOL, HASN'T IT?

97
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,791
- YEAH.  I HAVE MORE FRIENDS
NOW THAN I DID BACK THEN.

98
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,583
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT,

99
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,750
BUT SCHOOL'S MORE FUN
THAN IT USED TO BE.

100
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,666
- WAIT.  YOU THINK
SCHOOL IS FUN?

101
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,041
- WELL, WHEN I'M AT HOME,
NO ONE PLAYS WITH ME

102
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
OR EVEN TALKS TO ME
FOR THE MOST PART. 

103
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,041
AND THE HOUSE IS SO BIG,
I GET LONELY.

104
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,083
SO, YEAH.
SCHOOL IS FUN IN COMPARISON.

105
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,708
- JEEZ.
CRY ME A RIVER.

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,291
I WISH I COULD FEEL
LONELY AND SAD

107
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,875
IN A BIG HOUSE LIKE THAT.

108
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,333
- YOU CAN COME HANG OUT
AT MY HOUSE IF YOU WANT TO.

109
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,375
- I DON'T. IT'S LIKE 100
TIMES MORE FUN READING

110
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,000
THAN HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

111
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,666
- Shouko: THAT WAS MEAN.
- JUST BEING HONEST.

112
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,500
- Shouko: STICK IN THE MUD.
- SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY.

113
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,083
- Shouko: PIG-HEADED.

114
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,291
- KEEP IT UP.

115
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,375
- OH, YUUJI?
- HMM?

116
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,541
- I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
A LITTLE CRUSH ON ME.

117
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,416
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU'RE TOO
NERVOUS TO HANG OUT AT MY HOME.

118
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
- WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO TO YOUR HOUSE 

119
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,083
SO BADLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

120
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,666
- WELL...

121
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,000
- WELL, WHAT?
SPIT IT OUT.

122
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,583
- MY GRANDFATHER
TALKS ABOUT SENDING ME

123
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,083
TO AN ALL-GIRLS'
ACADEMY A LOT.

124
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,666
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT
FAMOUS RICHY SCHOOL FOR CHICKS?

125
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,083
ARE YOU GONNA
CHANGE SCHOOLS AGAIN?

126
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,666
- PROBABLY.

127
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,166
HE SEEMS TO THINK
I GET PICKED ON

128
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
MORE THAN MOST KIDS
AT SCHOOL DO.

129
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,750
- SO YOU WANT TO SHOW OFF
YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR FAMILY

130
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,458
SO THEY WON'T THINK
YOU'RE LONELY AND MISERABLE?

131
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,916
- I DON'T--

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,625
I DON'T WANT TO
CHANGE SCHOOLS.

133
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,750
I ACTUALLY HAVE MADE SOME
FRIENDS BESIDES YOU,

134
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,916
SO YOU KNOW.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
- THEN TAKE THOSE WEIRDOES
TO YOUR HOUSE.

136
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,750
- WE'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH
FOR THAT YET.

137
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,500
- OH.

138
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,375
WELL, EITHER WAY, THAT'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

139
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,375
- Yuuji: I TREATED EVERYONE
THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT.

140
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,125
I WAS EQUALLY UNINTERESTED
IN ALL OF THEM.

141
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,166
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD MYSELF.

142
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,500
- THAT WAS MEAN, YUUJI.

143
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,041
- NO, IT WASN'T.
- WAS TOO.

144
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,541
- WAS NOT.
- WAS TOO.

145
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,541
- WAS NOT.

146
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,791
- YUUJI.
- HMM.

147
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,291
- IN OUR ENTIRE CLASS,

148
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,958
I'VE GOT THE BIGGEST
OF THE BOOBIES.

149
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,125
- ( Young Yuuji grunts )

150
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,708
SHOUKO!
- Yuuji: EVEN SO,

151
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,875
THE ATTENTION I GAVE
SEEMED TO BE ENOUGH 

152
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,833
FOR A GIRL WHO HAPPENED
TO BE VERY LONELY.

153
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,458
- WHAT'S UP, SAKAMOTO?

154
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,583
- ( sighs )

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,500
- ( boys panting )

156
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,083
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, FREAK?

157
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,083
- WE GOT SOMETHING
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

158
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,125
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

159
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,166
- ( sighs )

160
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
AND THIS IS WHY I WANTED
TO HEAD HOME EARLIER.

161
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,166
- WHAT?
CAN'T HEAR YOU, TURD.

162
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
- TURD, REALLY?

163
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,833
WHAT DO YOU ALL WANT?

164
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,750
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WASTE ON A BUNCH OF LOSERS.

165
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,166
- SHUT UP! TRY AND HAVE A LITTLE
RESPECT FOR YOUR ELDERS.

166
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,166
- SURE ARE A SMART ASS 
FOR A FIFTH GRADE BABY.

167
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,000
- ( sighs )

168
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,000
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
SINCE I BEAT YOUR SCORES

169
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,666
ON THAT TEST, HAVEN'T YOU?

170
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO,

171
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,875
LIKE FRIENDS
TO HANG OUT WITH?

172
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,208
OR MAYBE YOU GUYS
ARE TOO PATHETIC 

173
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,125
TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
- ( boys gasp )

174
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,375
- UH, NO.  YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

175
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,916
- DON'T THINK YOU'RE
BETTER THAN US,

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT
A FEW GOOD TEST SCORES.

177
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,791
- WE'RE IN THE SIXTH GRADE,
KID.

178
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,750
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
- WATCH MY MOUTH?

179
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,208
ARE YOU GUYS STUPID
OR WHAT?

180
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,208
THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE
CENSOR WHAT THEY SAY

181
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,625
IS TO BE RESPECTFUL.

182
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,166
AND WHY THE HELL WOULD I
EVER WANT TO RESPECT

183
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,833
A GROUP OF IDIOTS LIKE YOU?

184
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,166
- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
WE'RE OLDER THAN YOU.

185
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,041
- TRUE. YEAH, YOU'RE A
WHOLE YEAR OLDER THAN ME,

186
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,625
HOWEVER, I'M THE ONE
WHO DID BETTER ON THAT TEST.

187
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,791
YOU GUYS ARE HILARIOUS.

188
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,833
YOU SHOULD SHOW A LITTLE MORE
RESPECT TO ME.

189
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,250
- ( grunts )

190
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,166
- SAY THAT AGAIN,
I DARE YOU.

191
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,791
- YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME,

192
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,625
THE TEACHERS WILL
DEFINITELY FIND OUT.

193
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,375
I MEAN, I AM THE BOY WONDER,
AFTER ALL.

194
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,666
GET LOST.

195
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,166
- ( kids groan )
- ALSO, I DON'T EVER

196
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,625
WANT TO SEE YOU JERKS AGAIN.

197
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,666
- THAT KIDS LIKE
TOTALLY PISSES ME OFF.

198
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,250
- I THINK WE SHOULD
TEACH HIM A LESSON,

199
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,833
- SPECIFICALLY?
- WELL, IF WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM,

200
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,833
WE CAN AT LEAST MESS WITH
HIS LOCKER OR SOMETHING. 

201
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,666
- YEAH, THEN HE CAN'T
RAT US OUT.

202
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,166
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

203
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,958
LET'S TEACH THAT
LITTLE PUNK SOME MANNERS.

204
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,791
- ( kids chuckle )

205
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,125
- I'M HOME.

206
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,500
- OH, YAY.
MY BABY BOY IS BACK.

207
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,458
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE TODAY,
AREN'T YOU?

208
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,250
- YEAH, I HAD TO FINISH UP
SOME CLASS REP STUFF AT SCHOOL.

209
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,583
- OH, WELL, I GUESS THAT 
DOES MAKE THE MOST SENSE,

210
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,333
BUT FOR SOME REASON
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPENDING

211
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,791
A LITTLE QUALITY TIME WITH 
YOUR LOVELY FRIEND, SHOUKO.

212
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,875
- WHY THE CRAP WOULD I WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH SHOUKO?

213
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,000
DON'T BE STUPID.

214
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,291
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU
TWO WERE FRIENDS.

215
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,041
- YOU THOUGHT WRONG.
- YOU SHOULD BE.

216
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,041
THAT GIRL IS GOING TO BE
INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS

217
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
WHEN SHE GETS
A LITTLE OLDER.

218
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,125
ALTHOUGH BY THAT TIME,
IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE

219
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,875
AND ALL YOU'LL BE LEFT WITH
IS REGRET.

220
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,416
ACCEPT IT, SHE'LL BE
AS CUTE AS ME SOME DAY.

221
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,708
- LET IT GO, MOM. BESIDES,
YOU'RE NOT THAT PRETTY ANYWAY.

222
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,833
- YUUJI, THAT'S MEAN.

223
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,291
- I'LL BE LATE AGAIN TOMORROW.

224
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,291
- OH?  MORE WORK FOR
YOUR CLASS AGAIN?

225
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,375
- NO. I HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING

226
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,625
I NEED TO TEACH
SOME SIXTH GRADERS.

227
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,666
- SIXTH GRADERS?
- LONG STORY.

228
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,458
- OHH.

229
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,041
- WHAT'S WITH THE APRON?

230
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,583
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT MAKING DINNER?

231
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,708
- ( chuckles )

232
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,041
I'M MAKING MEAT AND POTATO STEW.

233
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,583
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE.

234
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,250
I'VE BEEN PEELING
THE SWEET POTATOES--

235
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,000
- MOM, YOU CAN'T PUT
SWEET POTATOES IN A STEW!

236
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,916
- BUT WHY NOT? I THOUGHT
THEY WERE BETTER FOR YOU

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,333
THAN REGULAR POTATOES.

238
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,916
AND THEY DON'T
GET AS SOFT EITHER.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,250
- THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET SOFT,
AND I DON'T CARE

240
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,833
IF THEY'RE BETTER
FOR ME OR NOT.

241
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,875
( sighs ) AT LEAST IT
MIGHT BE EDIBLE THIS TIME.

242
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,000
- OH. I FORGOT TO BUY
MEAT AT THE STORE,

243
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,333
SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
WE'RE HAVING MEATLESS

244
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,250
MEAT AND POTATO STEW.
- ARE YOU SAYING

245
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,000
WE'RE JUST HAVING
STEAMED SWEET POTATOES?

246
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,500
- Yuuji:
SINCE THEY COULDN'T BEAT ME UP,

247
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,916
I KNEW THEY'D TRY TO
DO SOMETHING TO MY STUFF.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,458
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I PROVOKED
THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

249
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,083
- ( chuckles )
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

250
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
I GRABBED THE THINGS I DON'T
WANT THEM TO MESS WITH

251
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,333
FROM MY LOCKER AND
KEPT THEM WITH ME.

252
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,583
- Yuuji:
I THOUGHT I'D KILL TIME

253
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,125
UNTIL THE SIXTH GRADERS
MADE THEIR MOVE.

254
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,708
ONCE THEY STARTED IN
ON MY LOCKER,

255
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,041
I PLANNED ON GOING
TO GET A TEACHER.

256
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,958
- OKAY.

257
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,000
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL START READING ANOTHER BOOK.

258
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,791
- Yuuji: AT THAT TIME,
I BELIEVED I WAS A HERO.

259
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,291
MOSTLY BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVED
I WAS BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

260
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,458
- WEIRD.
WHERE'S SHOUKO BEEN ALL DAY?

261
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,750
SHE HASN'T FOLLOWED ME
AROUND LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES.

262
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,333
Young Yuuji:
BAKA AND TEST.

263
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,208
- Shouko: BACK THEN,
I SPENT AS MUCH TIME

264
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,625
AS YUUJI WOULD LET ME
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

265
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,000
I DIDN'T EVEN CARE
THAT HE WASN'T ALWAYS

266
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,000
VERY NICE TO ME.

267
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,333
HE TREATED ME JUST LIKE
HE TREATED EVERYONE ELSE,

268
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,750
AND I LIKED THAT.

269
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,666
- ( gasps )

270
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
I WONDER IF
YUUJI IS STILL HERE.

271
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,958
HMM?

272
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,000
- Shouko: I ENJOYED
BEING AROUND HIM.

273
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,458
I SIMPLY COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

274
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,166
- DAMN IT.
NOT HERE EITHER.

275
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,708
- THAT GUY'S SUCH A PUNK.

276
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,541
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDED

277
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,000
THEY WANTED TO
HIDE HIS SHOES TOO,

278
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,166
SO THEY JUST BEAT US
TO THE PUNCH.

279
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,666
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,000
THAT NERD DOESN'T HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.

281
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,750
HE GETS PICKED ON
ALL THE TIME.

282
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,333
- THERE'S PLENTY OF
OTHER STUFF WE CAN MESS WITH.

283
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,208
WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK WE SHOULD WRITE?

284
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,291
- HOW ABOUT "I LIKE TO 
CHEAT ON ALL MY TESTS"?

285
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,958
SOUND GOOD?
- Both: HELL YEAH!

286
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,541
- STOP THAT NOW!
- ( boys gasp ) 

287
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,041
- THOSE ARE--
THEY'RE NOT YOURS.

288
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,875
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- UM, WELL...

289
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,458
IT'S JUST THAT
THOSE ARE YUUJI'S.

290
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,208
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE
MESSING WITH THEM.

291
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,208
- WHAT?!
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

292
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,708
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

293
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:39,041
- I CAN'T DO THAT. 
YUUJI IS MY FRIEND.

294
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,541
- IF YUUJI FINDS OUT
WHAT I'M DOING,

295
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,791
HE'S GOING TO BE
SO MAD AT ME.

296
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,000
SO I THOUGHT...

297
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,333
NONETHELESS.

298
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,041
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.
STOP!

299
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,500
- I DIDN'T THINK
HE HAD ANY FRIENDS.

300
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,750
- I KNOW.
AND SHE'S A GIRL.

301
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,333
- COME ON, GUYS.
WHO CARES ABOUT HER?

302
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,916
LET'S JUST DO WHAT 
WE CAME HERE TO DO.

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,166
- GOOD POINT.
- THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

304
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,500
- STOP IT!
- HEY, LET GO OF ME.

305
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,500
- I THOUGHT YUUJI
WOULD GET MAD.

306
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,166
AND I WAS AFRAID
HE'D TELL THOSE BOYS

307
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,291
I WASN'T REALLY HIS FRIEND.

308
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,333
- ( grunts )
- PLEASE STOP IT!

309
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,750
- ENOUGH ALREADY!
GO AWAY.

310
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,166
- ( gasps )

311
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,083
- SHE'S CRAZY.
- FOR REAL. WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

312
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,208
- STOP!

313
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,250
- YOU'RE ASKING FOR
IT, YOU KNOW THAT?

314
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,333
- BUT I DIDN'T CARE
WHAT THEY SAID.

315
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,291
- LET GO!

316
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,625
- ( straining )
- NO! ( gasps )

317
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,458
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- ( gasps )

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,458
- AAH.  LOOK AT WHAT
YOU DID TO MY NEW SHIRT,

319
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,000
YOU STUPID BRAT.

320
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,375
NOW I'M PISSED.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
- PLEASE DON'T. I'M SORRY.
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR SORRY.

322
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,291
- ( gasps )

323
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,208
- WELL, I WONDER IF THEY'VE
FALLEN INTO MY TRAP YET.

324
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,666
ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE DOING IT.

325
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,583
- ( boys chattering )
- NOT FUNNY!

326
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,000
- ( gasps )

327
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,625
THE HELL'S GOING ON?
WHY'S SHOUKO IN THERE?

328
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,708
DON'T TELL ME.

329
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,708
- IT WAS OBVIOUS WHY
SHOUKO HAD BEEN DRAGGED INTO IT.

330
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,708
EITHER WAY, SHE NEEDED
SOMEONE TO HELP HER OUT.

331
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,333
- I HAVE TO SAVE HER.

332
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,583
- YES.  LIKE THE HERO
THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE.

333
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,833
PLUS THOSE GUYS WERE
ALL PRACTICALLY IDIOTS.

334
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,333
IT WAS ME THAT WAS THE OVERLY
INTELLIGENT SPECIAL ONE.

335
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,833
NOT TO MENTION, WE WERE
IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEAGUES,

336
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,666
SO WHY HESITATE?

337
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,166
- I'LL BE FINE. 
DON'T BE SCARED.

338
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,583
GUYS LIKE THEM...
THEY'RE NO BIG DEAL.

339
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,500
- DON'T KID YOURSELF, BUDDY.
THERE ARE THREE OF THEM.

340
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,291
- HEY, I KNOW.
I'LL GO GET A TEACHER.

341
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,416
BUT WHAT ABOUT SHOUKO?

342
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,291
- THE TEACHER'S GONNA
TELL HER PARENTS,

343
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,666
AND THEN THEY'LL
THINK THEIR LITTLE GIRL

344
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,000
GETS PICKED ON ALL THE TIME.

345
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,708
- THEY'LL MAKE SHOUKO
CHANGE SCHOOLS FOR SURE.

346
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,625
( grunts ) WHATEVER. WHAT
ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

347
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,750
IT'S NOT LIKE IT HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME ANYWAY.

348
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,708
- WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

349
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,500
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU CAN DO, YUUJI.

350
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,375
- ( grunts )
MAN, THIS SUCKS!

351
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,875
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE THEM PAY

352
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
FOR BEING SO MEAN TO ME!
- OKAY, THEN PRETEND

353
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,375
YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS
AND WALK AWAY.

354
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,333
- YOU KNOW THERE'S
NO WAY I CAN DO THAT.

355
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,875
- NO MATTER WHAT
CHOICE YOU MAKE,

356
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,541
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

357
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,041
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
YOU'LL BE THE ONE WHO PAYS.

358
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,791
THAT BEING SAID, YOU'VE GOTTA
DO WHAT YOU'VE GOTTA DO.

359
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,208
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THREE SIXTH GRADERS HERE.

360
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,666
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
NO WAY I CAN BEAT THOSE GUYS.

361
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,458
- HOW DO YOU THINK
SHOUKO FEELS ABOUT IT?

362
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,250
- YEAH, BUT STILL...

363
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,916
- I KNOW. GETTING BEAT UP 
IS PRETTY SCARY, ISN'T IT?

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,916
- OF COURSE, DUH!
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HERO.

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,083
- BUT A TRUE HERO WOULDN'T
EXACTLY HESITATE, RIGHT?

366
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,250
EVEN IF HE WAS TOTALLY 
SURE HE WAS GONNA LOSE.

367
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,875
YEAH, HE'D DO IT.
- SHUT UP!

368
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,666
THAT STUFF ONLY HAPPENS
IN THE MOVIES, ASS!

369
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,333
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S 
BEEN ACTING BETTER THAN

370
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,250
THOSE GUYS IN THE FIRST PLACE,
RIGHT?

371
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,250
- WELL, YEAH, BUT THEIR SCORES--
- IT'S NOT EASY BEING SMART,

372
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,416
IS IT?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

373
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,250
BUT QUIT MAKING
ASININE EXCUSES

374
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,166
AND TRYING TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF THIS.

375
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,416
- SO WHAT, ARE YOU TELLING ME
IT'S BETTER TO BE AN IDIOT?

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
- ( chuckles )
I GUESS SO.

377
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,833
AN IDIOT WHO'D JUMP IN THERE

378
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,083
TO SAVE HER WITHOUT EVEN
STOPPING TO THINK?

379
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
YEAH, HE'D BE A HELL OF
A LOT COOLER THAN YOU ARE.

380
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,750
- I DON'T GET IT.

381
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,166
I DON'T GET WHY ALL THIS
IS HAPPENING TO ME.

382
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,000
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
SO WHY AM I THE ONE

383
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,541
WHO HAS TO SUFFER?

384
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,708
THIS ISN'T MY FAULT AT ALL.

385
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,791
IF ANYONE'S TO BLAME,
IT'S THOSE GUYS FOR BEING

386
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,458
INSECURE JERKS,
AND SHOUKO FOR BUTTING IN.

387
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,083
IT'S THEIR FAULT.

388
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,291
SO WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?!

389
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,250
( exhales )

390
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,458
WHAT'S MORE...

391
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,583
SHOUKO SHOULD BE SCREAMING
FOR HELP RIGHT NOW.

392
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,291
ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS ASK.
SAY IT, SHOUKO.

393
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,291
JUST SAY "SOMEBODY HELP ME"
ALREADY,

394
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,125
AND THEN EVEN IF
THE TEACHERS FIND OUT

395
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,708
AND HER PARENTS MAKE HER
CHANGE SCHOOLS,

396
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,708
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF HER,
NOT ME.

397
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,333
IT'S STILL NOT MY FAULT.

398
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,083
YEAH.  THAT WORKS.

399
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,958
COME ON, SHOUKO.

400
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,750
- Young Shouko: STOP.
- SAY IT.  ASK FOR HELP.

401
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,500
CHANGING SCHOOLS IS BETTER
THAN BEING PICKED ON, RIGHT?

402
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,750
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK.

403
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,750
JUST SAY THE WORDS.

404
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,333
ASK FOR HELP.

405
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,666
SAY IT.  SAY IT.

406
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,916
SAY IT!

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,916
- I WON'T.
I WON'T SAY IT.

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,250
THEY'LL MAKE ME
CHANGE SCHOOLS AGAIN.

409
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,250
- ( gasps )

410
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,166
WHY?

411
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,291
WHY?

412
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,708
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE
A BUNCH OF JERKS!

413
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,166
- ( boys gasp )
- ( gasps )

414
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,208
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING? 

415
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,375
- YOU'RE HERE.

416
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,791
- DON'T YOU ASSHOLES REALIZE
HOW CRAZY PATHETIC YOU ALL ARE?

417
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,541
WHAT KIND OF GUY
BEATS UP ON A GIRL?

418
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,458
- SAKAMOTO?
- LOOK WHO DECIDED TO SHOW UP.

419
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,000
- COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME, SHOUKO.

420
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,375
- WAIT.  SORRY, BRO.
NOT SO FAST.

421
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,958
YOU TWO AREN'T 
GOING ANYWHERE.

422
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,416
- ( sighs )
- YUUJI.

423
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,916
- SHOUKO IS GOING HOME.
- BUT--

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,541
- NOW.
- ( gasps )

425
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,208
I'LL GO GET A TEACHER.
- NO, DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

426
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,208
JUST GO HOME.
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE

427
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,333
GETTING IN MY WAY.
- ( gasps )

428
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,125
( gasps )

429
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,375
YEAH, OKAY THEN.

430
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,166
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

431
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,833
- ( shouting )

432
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,833
- Yuuji:
THAT WAS THE DAY I REALIZED

433
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,250
HOW IMMATURE 
I REALLY WAS.

434
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,875
I'D NEVER FELT SO MISERABLE,
PITIFUL, AND EMBARRASSED.

435
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,833
- ( boys grunting )

436
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,708
- Shouko: AFTER SEEING YUUJI'S
SHOULDERS TREMBLING LIKE THAT,

437
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,750
I WAS SO MAD AT MYSELF
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HELP.

438
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,416
- Yuuji: I CREATED A REASON FOR
SHOUKO TO GET THE WRONG IDEA.

439
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,083
IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE.

440
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,416
IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY
AND I HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

441
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,541
- ( shouts )

442
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,291
- IT WASN'T.
YOU'RE WRONG, YUUJI.

443
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,958
THERE'S MORE TO OUR STORY.

444
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,666
YOU JUST NEVER KNEW.

445
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,333
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S BACK HOME.
HEY THERE.

446
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,291
I GOT A CALL FROM
THE SCHOOL EARLIER.

447
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,708
ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

448
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,125
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
- OH, NO, HONEY.

449
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,875
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS NOT TRUE.

450
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,916
THEY TOLD ME THAT
YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT TODAY.

451
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,041
- WHAT CAN I SAY? A COUPLE
OF GUYS PISSED ME OFF.

452
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,833
- YUUJI, ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT?

453
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,041
- YEAH, THAT'S ALL.
THEY PISSED ME OFF,

454
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,500
SO I PUNCHED THEM.
WILL YOU PLEASE

455
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,958
GET OFF MY BACK ALREADY?

456
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:53,125
- THEY MADE YOU MAD,
RIGHT.

457
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,041
- I'M SORRY.

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
IT'S MY FAULT.

459
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,583
HE WAS ONLY
TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

460
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,916
I'M SORRY.

461
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,333
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

462
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,166
YOU'VE ALREADY
TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED,

463
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,000
AND I PROMISE YOU, EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

464
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,333
- HOW CAN IT BE? HE'S GONNA
BE KNOWN AS A BAD KID.

465
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,666
AND HE WON'T GET THAT
RECOMMENDATION

466
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,416
FOR JUNIOR HIGH NOW.

467
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,083
- ( chuckles )
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THAT.

468
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,333
OH, SHOUKO, LISTEN.

469
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,250
YUUJI FOUND OUT
THERE'S MORE TO HIM

470
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,833
THAN JUST BEING A SMART KID.

471
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,000
WITHOUT YOU, HE NEVER COULD
HAVE REALIZED THAT.

472
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,833
SO I'M ACTUALLY
VERY GRATEFUL. 

473
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,291
- ( gasps )
HMM.

474
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,375
- ( chuckles )
- MRS. SAKAMOTO?

475
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,375
- WHAT IS IT, SHOUKO?
I'M ALL EARS.

476
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,375
- UM, WHEN I GROW UP...

477
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,625
WELL, I'M GOING
TO MARRY YUUJI.

478
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,291
- ARE YOU POSITIVE?
IT IS A BIG DECISION.

479
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,791
- I PROMISE I'LL
MAKE HIM HAPPY. 

480
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,041
- ( chuckles )

481
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,625
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH, DEAR,

482
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,208
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING
HE SHOULD SAY TO YOU.

483
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,541
- ( sighs )

484
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,750
I WON'T DISAGREE.

485
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,291
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

486
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,208
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO MAKE SURE HE SAYS

487
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,208
THE VERY SAME LINE
TO YOU ONE DAY.

488
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,958
- REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

489
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,458
NOW THAT IS OF COURSE
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T 

490
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,958
STOP LIKING HIM
SO MUCH BY THEN, 'KAY?

491
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,583
- OH, I WON'T.

492
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,833
I PROMISE.

493
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,958
I WILL LIKE YUUJI FOREVER.

494
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,791
- ( theme music playing )

495
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

496
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,416
- Fukuhara: QUESTION 12,
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT WHEN

497
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
A MYSTERIOUS GROUP
STAKES CLAIM

498
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,166
TO A SPECIFIC PLACE
FOR NO REASON?

499
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,333
- DUDES WHO ARE POPULAR WITH
CHICKS ARE OUR SWORN ENEMIES.

500
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,000
- Fukuhara: I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOU, BY THE WAY. 

501
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,250
- Akihisa: NEXT EPISODE,
IDIOTS, CLOWNERY, AND REQUIEM.

502
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,208
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
