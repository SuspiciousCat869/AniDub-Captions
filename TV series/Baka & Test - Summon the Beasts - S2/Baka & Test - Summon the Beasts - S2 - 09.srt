1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,791
- THIS IS FOR REAL.

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,375
OKAY, I'LL SEE 
YOU LATER, BYE.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:23,708
- Mizuki: I KNEW IT.

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,166
MINAMI HAS A THING
FOR AKIHISA.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,208
- ( screams )

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,375
- THIS IS FOR REAL.

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,458
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,541
TAKE THE FUGITIVE AWAY.

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,833
- ( grumbling )
- SHE LIKES HIM.

10
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:38,041
SHE, LIKE,
LIKE-LIKES HIM.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,250
- Fukuhara: A WEEK
AFTER TRAINING CAMP,

13
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,375
THE YEAR-TWO BOY'S SUSPENSION
IS FINALLY OVER.

14
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,208
- YUUJI.
- YEAH?

15
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,625
WHAT IS IT?
( screams )

16
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
- YOU DODGED ME.

17
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,166
- YOU WERE ABOUT
TO HEAD BUTT ME.

18
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,541
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
SIT THERE AND TAKE IT.

19
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,833
- I WAS ONLY
TRYING TO KISS YOU.

20
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,666
- YOU WERE WHAT?
OKAY, NOW STAY RIGHT THERE.

21
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,208
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD
AND EXPLAIN SLOWLY.

22
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,375
- A KISS, MOUTH TO MOUTH,
LIP TO LIP.

23
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,250
IT'S ONLY NATURAL CONSIDERING
WE'RE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED. 

24
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,083
- WHAT? NO.
I KNOW WHAT A KISS IS.

25
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,666
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ASK YOU
IS WHY YOU--

26
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,416
( groans )
- WHEN, WHERE, AND WITH WHOM

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,333
DID YOU KISS?
- I JUST KNOW WHAT IT IS.

28
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,583
I NEVER SAID
I ACTUALLY KISSED ANYONE.

29
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,750
- OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,541
- YOU'RE KILLING ME.  WHAT'S ALL
THIS HEAD-BUTT-KISSING CRAP

31
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,458
ABOUT IN THE FIRST PLACE?
- THOSE TWO.

32
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,375
THEY WERE KISSING
A MOMENT AGO.

33
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,083
- SERIOUSLY?
WHAT'S HE THINKING?

34
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
HE KNEW THOSE GUYS
WOULD KILL HIM FOR THAT.

35
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,791
IT'S LIKE HE'S ACTUALLY
GETTING STUPIDER

36
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,583
BY THE FLIPPING MINUTE.
- I APOLOGIZE.

37
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,250
- WHAT?
- WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING,

38
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,458
I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING.
- AHA!

39
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,291
- LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
ANOTHER HERETIC OVER HERE.

40
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,625
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE HIM IN.

41
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,375
- AH! HEY, STOP IT.

42
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,708
I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING!

43
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,083
LET ME GO!
- I'M A NAUGHTY GIRL.

44
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,625
ALTHOUGH, ALL I DID
WAS KISS HIM ON THE CHEEK.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,250
- MEN, TELL THEM
WHERE WE ARE.

46
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,125
- THE COURT FOR PASSING
VIOLENT JUDGMENT.

47
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,291
- WHAT HAPPENS TO TRAITORS?

48
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,250
- THE DEATH PENALTY AWAITS.

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,833
- WONDERFUL! AND NOW,
LET THE INQUISITION BEGIN.

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,041
- HEY, YUUJI, WHY DID
THEY BRING YOU HERE? 

51
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,416
- BECAUSE OF YOU, YOU JERK!

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,333
- READ THE CHARGES, PLEASE.
- THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

53
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,375
AKIHISA YOSHI
SHALL BE KNOWN AS "A."

54
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,041
MINAMI SHIMADA SHALL
BE KNOWN AS "FLAT CHEST."

55
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,041
"A" IS CHARGED WITH AN ACT OF
DISLOYALTY TO OUR DOCTRINE.

56
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,916
EARLIER THIS MORNING,
"A" WAS CAUGHT WITH "FLAT CHEST"

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,333
AS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
HER ON THE MOUTH.

58
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,000
OUR FELLOW MEMBERS DUTIFULLY
CAPTURED HIM AT THAT TIME.

59
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,375
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
"A" AND "FLAT CHEST"

60
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,958
CALLS FOR A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION.

61
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,125
"A" SHOULD SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES 

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,833
AND "FLAT CHEST" SHOULD HAVE
A WATCHFUL EYE KEPT ON HER

63
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,166
IN THE FUTURE.

64
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,750
- JUST STATE THE CONCLUSION!

65
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,375
- WE'RE JEALOUS OF HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS KISSING A GIRL!

66
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,875
- DEATH PENALTY IT IS.

67
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,666
- AKI, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON?

68
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,333
- NO, I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,958
- DOESN'T SOMETHING SEEM WEIRD
TO YOU ABOUT ALL THIS?

70
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,583
- HMM.
- DO YOU REMEMBER

71
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,291
THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW MINAMI?

72
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,541
- I THINK IT WAS THAT LAST NIGHT
AT THE TRAINING CAMP.

73
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,666
- OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED?

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,416
- WELL, AFTER EVERYONE
FELL ASLEEP,

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,791
SHE, LIKE, RANDOMLY
CAME UP TO ME.

76
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
- SERIOUSLY? AND YOU DIDN'T
THINK THAT WAS STRANGE AT ALL?

77
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,583
- I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
SHE JUST WANTED TO KILL ME.

78
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,125
- SO THINK.  BEFORE THAT,
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HER?

79
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,666
- LET ME THINK.

80
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,416
THERE WAS THAT ONE THING.

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,958
( gasps )

82
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,000
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY, DUDE?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

83
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,833
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU
TALK TO HER ABOUT?

84
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,875
- A KIND OF
LOVE-CONFESSION THING.

85
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,666
- WAIT, SHE CONFESSED TO YOU?
- NO, I DID THE CONFESSING.

86
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,916
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,333
- THAT DIDN'T SEEM
A LITTLE WEIRD TO YOU?

88
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,500
- HERETIC AKIHISA YOSHI,
WILL YOU REPENT YOUR SIN

89
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,791
AND ACCEPT THE RULING
PLACED AGAINST YOU?

90
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,208
- DEPENDS ON THE RULING.
- YOUR SENTENCE

91
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,208
IS A SPECIAL BUNGEE JUMP.

92
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,500
- CAN YOU TELL ME,
LIKE, WHAT KIND

93
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,000
OF SPECIAL BUNGEE JUMP?
- I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE

94
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,750
UNNECESSARY CONCERN,
BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A HINT.

95
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,458
THINK SKYDIVING
WITHOUT A PARACHUTE.

96
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,208
- ( screams )
THAT'S NOT A HINT.

97
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,000
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU WANT ME TO BUNGEE JUMP

98
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,583
WITHOUT A CHORD?!

99
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,625
LOOK, IT'S HIMEJI!
OVER HERE!

100
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,833
- I HAD A SNEAKING SUSPICION
MINAMI LIKED AKIHISA.

101
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,208
I GUESS I WAS RIGHT.

102
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,208
- WHY ARE YOU STILL
ACTING LIKE THAT?!

103
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,458
- THEY JUST EXCHANGED WORDS
WITH THEIR EYES!

104
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,041
- NOW I'LL NEVER HAVE
A CHANCE WITH "FLAT CHEST."

105
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,791
- JUST LIKE
HIMEJI AND HIDEYOSHI,

106
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,333
MINAMI HAS FALLEN
UNDER HIS SPELL. 

107
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,791
BEWARE THE DEVIL
KNOWN AS AKI!

108
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,125
- HEY, AKI, HOW ARE YOU?

109
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,500
- OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- WOULD YOU MIND--

110
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,750
I MEAN, IS IT OKAY IF I SIT
AT YOUR TABLE WITH YOU?

111
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,333
- HUH?
- MINE IS BROKEN, SO...

112
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,916
- OH, YEAH, THAT SUCKS.
SURE.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,208
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

114
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,916
ARE YOU SICK?
'CAUSE YOU'RE SWEATING.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
- NO, JUST FEELING
CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

116
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,750
- WELL, THE TABLE
IS KIND OF SMALL.

117
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,500
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

118
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,625
- SO, UM, I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT WE COULD MAYBE--

119
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,125
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD, YOU KNOW,

120
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,375
HAVE OUR LUNCH TOGETHER?

121
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,958
I MADE SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR YOU TODAY.

122
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,833
- DARLING, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,291
- ELBOW IN MY FACE!

124
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,333
- YOU SHOULDN'T SIT SO CLOSE
TO THIS FILTHY TRASH.

125
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,291
HE'S GROSS!
- WELL MY TABLE'S BROKEN.

126
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,958
AND IT ISN'T LIKE
I HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

127
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,333
- SO WHAT? THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO SIT

128
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,541
NEXT TO SUCH
A WASTE OF SPACE.

129
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,250
- MINAMI LIKES AKIHISA.

130
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,500
MINAMI LIKES AKIHISA.

131
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,958
- I DIDN'T WANT 
TO BOTHER MIZUKI

132
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,375
BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY STUDIES.

133
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,000
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT RUDE, RIGHT?
AKIHISA'S DIFFERENT.

134
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,250
EVERYONE KNOWS HE'S GONNA
GET BAD GRADES ANYWAY.

135
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,916
- I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE NOT COMPLIMENTING ME.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,125
- NO WAY! I CANNOT ALLOW

137
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,125
THIS DISGUSTING PIG TO THINK
YOU MADE LUNCH FOR HIM!

138
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,375
FRIED CHICKEN WITH YOUR
HOMEMADE SPECIAL SAUCE

139
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,166
THAT YOU MADE THIS MORNING.
AND NOT TO MENTION

140
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,958
THE SUPER EXPENSIVE
GROUND BEEF HAMBURGERS.

141
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,333
AND THEN THERE'S
THE ORGANIC POTATO SALAD.

142
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,500
- YOU'RE SUCH A STALKER.

143
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,791
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

144
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,500
- OH, GUESS WHAT'S 
ON TOP OF THE RICE.

145
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,041
A DAMN HEART!
- MIHARU, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

146
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,208
( sighs )

147
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,625
LISTEN TO ME.
I'VE BEEN PATIENT WITH YOU

148
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,083
UP UNTIL NOW,
BUT I REALLY NEED YOU

149
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
TO STOP DOING
THIS KIND OF STUFF,

150
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,625
BECAUSE-- WELL, BECAUSE
AKI AND I HAVE STARTED DATING.

151
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,916
- DEFLECTIVE MAP FLIP!

152
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,291
- ( growling )

153
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,583
- THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

154
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,750
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.
- I DON'T! YOU AND I ARE

155
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,208
GONNA GET MARRIED
AND NAME OUR DAUGHTER MIRAI

156
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,375
SO THE FIRST PART
OF HER NAME

157
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,583
SOUNDS LIKE THE FIRST PART
OF YOURS BECAUSE

158
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,416
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

159
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,583
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

160
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,041
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA NAME IT
IF IT'S A BOY?

161
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,125
- I'M THINKING STEVEN
SHOULD WORK OKAY.

162
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,666
- YOU'RE MISSING
SOMETHING IMPORTANT!

163
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,041
THE TWO OF US
CAN'T MAKE A BABY!

164
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,416
- CLASS IS STARTING.

165
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

166
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,083
GO BACK TO YOUR
CLASSROOM, SHIMIZU.

167
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,583
- YOU NEED TO TURN AROUND
AND WALK AWAY, NISHIMURA.

168
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
I'M DEALING WITH A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

169
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,291
- LIFE AND DEATH?
- YES!

170
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,000
LIFE AND DEATH IN THAT
I'M GONNA ANNIHILATE

171
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,458
EVERY SLEAZY DIRTBAG IN HERE.

172
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,833
- YOU ARE FORBIDDEN
FROM ENTERING

173
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,583
THIS CLASSROOM AGAIN, MISSY.

174
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,375
- WHY I OUGHTA!

175
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,583
- YOU ALWAYS GET INTO
STUFF LIKE THIS.

176
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,333
- AT LEAST YOU GET
SOME GOOD STORIES.

177
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,375
- LEAVE ME ALONE.  THIS TIME
IT ISN'T EVEN MY FAULT.

178
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,125
- YOU CAN DENY IT ALL YOU WANT,
BUT WE'RE ABOUT

179
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,250
TO GET IN TROUBLE
BIG TIME BECAUSE OF YOU.

180
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,708
APPARENTLY, CLASS D's DECIDED

181
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,041
THEY NEED TO CHALLENGE SOMEONE
TO A SUMMONER TEST WAR.

182
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,000
- SO WHAT DO WE CARE IF THEY
WANT TO FIGHT ANOTHER CLASS?

183
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,583
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH US.

184
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,750
DUDE, THERE IS NO WAY
YOU CAN PIN THAT ON ME.

185
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,708
- YES, I CAN, IF THE CLASS
THEY WANT TO FIGHT IS OURS.

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,958
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

187
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,375
WE HAVE THE WORST EQUIPMENT
IN THE SCHOOL.

188
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,041
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO FIGHT US
OVER A BUNCH OF STUFF

189
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,666
THAT'S CRAPPY? UNLESS...

190
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,416
- YOU GUESSED IT.
THIS IS ALL MIHARU.

191
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
- SHE'S TRYING TO
SWITCH OUR TABLES

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,333
BACK TO CARDBOARD BOXES,
JUST TO KEEP YOU AND MINAMI

193
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,625
FROM SITTING
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

194
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,541
- BUT HOW COULD SHE GET
EVERYONE IN CLASS D

195
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,333
TO GO ALONG WITH HER?
THEY KNOW SHE'S CRAY-CRAY.

196
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,208
- WELL, WE ARE THE RINGLEADERS
OF THE PEEKING INCIDENT.

197
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,750
NO WONDER THE GIRLS
ALREADY BELIEVE OUR CLASS

198
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,875
IS THEIR SWORN ENEMY.
- AND THEIR CLASS REP HIRAGA

199
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,041
WON'T TRY TO
FIGHT THEM ON IT.

200
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,041
MIHARU IS
RIDICULOUSLY JEALOUS

201
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,833
AND THE GIRLS ARE
RIDICULOUSLY PISSED.

202
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,541
SO WHAT COULD HE DO?
- BALLS.

203
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,583
- WITH THAT DAMN SUSPENSION,
THE GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

204
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,958
TO RECOVER THEIR
SCORES YET EITHER.

205
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,416
EVEN HAVING
HIMEJI ON OUR TEAM

206
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,916
ISN'T GONNA HELP US
AT THIS POINT.

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,666
- THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY OUT, GUYS.

208
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,791
AVOID THE WAR.

209
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,416
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

210
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,250
- I THINK IT'S UP TO
YOU AND MINAMI NOW. 

211
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,083
BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
THERE'S ONE THING

212
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,625
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT.
- WHAT'S THAT?

213
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,291
- ARE YOU AND MINAMI DATING?
LIKE FOR REAL DATING-DATING?

214
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,791
- AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT,

215
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,708
BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE A GOOD REASON
TO THINK WE ARE

216
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,291
BECAUSE OF A TEXT MESSAGE
I SORT OF ACCIDENTALLY SENT HER.

217
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,666
- AN ACCIDENTAL TEXT?

218
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,208
- ( gasps )
- ( gasps )

219
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,541
- ( sighs )
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

220
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,583
WHAT AKI DID WAS BAD ENOUGH,
BUT THEN YUUJI

221
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,500
HAD TO COME IN WITH
SOME SUPER BAD TIMING

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,791
AND MAKE THINGS EVEN WORSE.
- THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON.

223
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,375
SORRY, AKI, I KNOW IT MUST SUCK,
BUT LISTEN TO ME.

224
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,166
YOU HAVE REALLY 
GOT TO FIX THIS.

225
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,250
CLEAR THINGS UP
WITH MINAMI LIKE ASAP.

226
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
MAYBE THEN MIHARU
WILL CHILL OUT.

227
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,583
- OKAY.

228
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,083
- WHAT'S THE STORY, KOUTA?

229
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,208
DID YOU SEE MIHARU
PLANT A WIRETAP DEVICE HERE?

230
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,458
- YEAH, BUT
I MADE IT LOOK LIKE

231
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,708
IT WAS BROKEN
AND REMOVED IT.

232
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,375
- WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

233
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,833
- WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT EMAIL I SENT YOU

234
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,291
WHILE WE WERE STILL
AT TRAINING CAMP?

235
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,583
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

236
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,291
THAT YOU KIND OF
GOT THE WRONG IDEA.

237
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,458
- WHAT?
- YEAH, I'M AN IDIOT.

238
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,791
I MEANT TO SEND THAT EMAIL
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

239
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,291
- WHO?
- I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS SUGAWA.

240
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,666
- WHAT?! ARE YOU TELLING ME

241
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,375
YOU WERE GONNA CONFESS
YOUR LOVE TO SUGAWA?! 

242
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,916
- I HAD A FEELING 
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,333
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU NEVER GAVE ME
A REASON TO THINK OTHERWISE,

244
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,083
BUT I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU LIKED GIRLS.

245
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,708
- YOU WHAT?
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

246
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,375
- THAT IS JUST WRONG
IN SO MANY WAYS.

247
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,791
- I KNOW.  I'M SORRY.

248
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,625
THE POINT IS
I SENT IT ON ACCIDENT.

249
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,583
- TALK ABOUT A RELIEF.
I ALWAYS SUSPECTED,

250
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,041
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS YOU.

251
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,000
I TOTES GET IT.
- ( laughs )

252
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,875
YEAH, YOU JUST KIND OF
ROLLED WITH IT, HUH?

253
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,541
- OH, PLEASE, THIS
IS COMING FROM THE GUY

254
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,791
WHO SENT A SUGGESTIVE EMAIL
TO THE WRONG PERSON.

255
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,666
- ( all laugh )

256
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,416
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT MY FIRST KISS?!

257
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,541
YOU SCREWED THAT UP FOR ME!
- I'M SORRY.

258
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,791
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT,
I SWEAR.

259
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,291
- SORRY DOESN'T QUITE CUT IT,
YOU JERK.

260
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,208
- YEAH, BUT--
- WHAT?

261
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,708
- WELL...

262
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,083
IT WAS MY FIRST KISS TOO.
WE'RE EVEN.

263
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,000
- YEAH, RIGHT.
SHE IS SO NOT GONNA GO FOR THAT.

264
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,125
- I DIDN'T KNOW.
SO, YEAH, I GUESS SO.

265
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,708
SURE, WE CAN CALL IT EVEN.
- Yuuji: NO FREAKIN' WAY! 

266
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,416
- HEY, SO I'M GONNA
ASK YOU SOMETHING,

267
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,333
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU 
TO GET ALL MAD AT ME.

268
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,916
- WHAT IS IT?
- WELL, IT'S JUST--

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,416
YOU TOLD MIHARU
THAT WE WERE DATING,

270
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,208
SO DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU, YOU KNOW,

271
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,041
MAYBE YOU MIGHT HAVE--
YOU KNOW, UH...

272
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,541
- NO! LIKE, NO.

273
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,875
SHE WASN'T GONNA
GIVE UP LIKE EVER.

274
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,791
SO IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
THE LOGICAL THING TO SAY.

275
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,958
I DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.

276
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,666
IT WAS JUST SOME GOOD TIMING.

277
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,583
- DENIAL.COM.
- SHE'S LYING TO HERSELF.

278
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,541
- OH, I WISH YOU
WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

279
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,708
I THOUGHT YOU, LIKE,
LIKE-LIKED ME.

280
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,916
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,125
- YEAH, LIKE THAT EVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

282
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,875
- YEAH, RIGHT.
I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

283
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,833
YOU WERE ACTING LIKE
SUCH A GIRL INSTEAD OF YOURSELF.

284
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,083
I FELT LIKE YOU WERE
DISLOCATING MY ARM!

285
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,666
- WELL, AT LEAST THE MAIN
CONFUSION HAS BEEN CLEARED UP.

286
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,083
- NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
TELL CRAZY FACE ABOUT ALL THIS.

287
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,375
AND HOPEFULLY, THAT'LL WORK.

288
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,625
- Fukuhara:
SO THE WAR WITH CLASS D

289
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,291
WAS SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED.

290
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
HOWEVER...

291
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,958
- BAKA AND TEST.

292
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,416
- YOU GUYS REALLY
NEED TO LISTEN TO THIS.

293
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,833
BAD NEWS THE SITUATION
IS EVEN WORSE NOW

294
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,791
THAN IT WAS THIS MORNING.
- Um, is it really true

295
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
That you have pictures
of Akihisa

296
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,500
in a sailor school uniform?
- $100 each.

297
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,416
Redistribution is prohibited.
- Yes, I'll take everything!

298
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,625
- OOPS, THAT WASN'T IT.

299
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,416
- HEY, WHAT THE CRAP!
YOU'RE RIGHT!

300
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,125
THE SITUATION HAS GOTTEN
TOTALLY WORSE.

301
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,416
- CALM DOWN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO

302
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,666
MAKE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

303
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,083
- SOMEONE IS SELLING
PICTURES OF ME

304
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,583
LIKE I WAS HIDE-FREAKIN'-YOSHI.
THIS IS SO NOT NOTHING!

305
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,458
- WHAT? SOMEONE'S SELLING
PICTURES OF ME?!

306
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,708
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

307
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,666
WHY IS MY SITUATION
GETTING WORSE?

308
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,083
- HERE'S THE REAL ONE.

309
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,125
- How are things holding up
with Class F?

310
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,375
- Very good, sir.

311
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,833
They're not aware
of our plans at all.

312
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,166
- Perfect, we'll recover our
scores in the mean time.

313
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,791
If they notice
what we're up to,

314
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,625
we'll declare war immediately.
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

315
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,833
I THOUGHT CLASS D SAID

316
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,250
THEY WEREN'T GOING
TO ATTACK US ANYMORE.

317
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,041
- NO, THAT ISN'T "D."
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM, KOUTA?

318
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,708
- I RECORDED IT
IN CLASS "B."

319
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,875
- DAMN, THAT NEMOTO GUY
PLAYS ALMOST AS DIRTY AS SHOUKO.

320
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,208
- BUT WHY THE HELL
WOULD CLASS B

321
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,666
WANT TO DECLARE WAR ON US?

322
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,541
- HE LOST A LOT OF RESPECT
AFTER THAT LAST S.T. WAR.

323
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,708
- ON TOP OF THAT,
HE GOT THEM TO AGREE

324
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,416
TO PARTICIPATE IN
THE PEEKING OPERATION,

325
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,583
WHICH FAILED MISERABLY.

326
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,333
- WITH ALL THAT DRAMA,
HE PROBABLY LOST

327
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,208
THE CONTROL HE HAD
OVER HIS OWN CLASSROOM.

328
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,916
I'M GUESSING THIS
IS ALL A PLOY

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,083
TO CALM DOWN THE CLASS,
SO HE CAN TAKE OVER AGAIN.

330
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,375
HE MUST BE PLANNING
TO CREATE A NEW ENEMY FOR THEM

331
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,833
BY DIRECTING
THEIR ANGST AT US.

332
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,291
MAYBE THEN, THEY WON'T
BE PISSED AT HIM

333
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,541
FOR BEING SUCH A FAILURE.

334
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,750
- IF HE CAN PULL IT OFF,

335
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,250
IT'LL MOST LIKELY
HELP HIM REGAIN

336
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,875
SOME OF THE GROUND HE LOST.
- NO.

337
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,250
WE HAVEN'T RECOVERED
OUR SCORES YET.

338
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,791
IF CLASS B
DECIDES TO ATTACK US,

339
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,708
THERE'S NO FRICKIN' WAY
WE CAN BEAT THEM.

340
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,291
- I REALIZE THAT, SO NOW WE
HAVE TO CREATE A SITUATION 

341
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,416
WHERE CLASS B WON'T BE ABLE
TO DECLARE WAR ON US.

342
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,333
- SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

343
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,500
- THAT'S EASY.  ALL WE NEED
IS FOR ANOTHER CLASSROOM

344
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,750
TO DECLARE WAR ON US
BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO.

345
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,708
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- NO, I'M NOT.

346
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,583
WE NEED TO ENTER INTO 
BATTLE WITH CLASS "D."

347
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,208
- OH MY GOD! WE JUST WENT
THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE 

348
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,208
TO KEEP D FROM
STARTING A WAR WITH US.

349
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,041
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO WE GO UP AGAINST.

350
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,000
IF WE'RE FIGHT AN S.T. WAR,
WE'LL BE GIVEN TIME

351
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
TO RECOUP OUR SCORES
WITH THE RECOVERY TESTS.

352
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,625
IT MAKES MORE SENSE
FOR US TO DO THAT

353
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,583
AFTER LOSING TO CLASS D
INSTEAD OF "B."

354
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,750
- I THINK I GET IT.
IF WE TAKE THE REMEDIAL CLASS

355
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,958
AND GET OUR SCORES UP,
CLASS B IS LESS LIKELY

356
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,166
TO WANT TO ATTACK US, RIGHT?
- BUT, YUUJI,

357
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,916
WITH OUR CURRENT SCORES,
WE CAN'T EVEN DEFEAT CLASS "D."

358
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,958
- I KNOW, BUT DON'T WORRY.

359
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
I THINK I'VE GOT
A SOLUTION FOR THAT.

360
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,208
FIRST THINGS FIRST, THOUGH.
SOMEHOW, WE NEED

361
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,416
TO GET CLASS D TO DECLARE
WAR ON US LIKE PRONTO.

362
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,708
- OKAY, HOW?

363
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,666
- WE CAN USE WHAT
HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

364
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,375
YOU AND MINAMI
JUST GET ALL COZY

365
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,250
AND PISS OFF MIHARU.
- WHAT?

366
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,083
- I DON'T THINK SO.
NO WAY.

367
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,416
- Yuuji: CAN'T YOU RECONSIDER?

368
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
- NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.

369
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,375
PLUS, NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE

370
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,375
I WOULD BE THE GIRLFRIEND
OF SUCH A STUPID IDIOT.

371
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,166
- COME ON.  YOU KNOW
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE 

372
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,875
WHO CAN DO THIS, MINAMI.
IF CLASS B ATTACKS US NOW,

373
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,041
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK
TO USING CARDBOARD BOXES.

374
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,041
DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT?
- YEAH, AND NOT TO MENTION

375
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,750
HIMEJI'S PARENTS MIGHT GET
SUPER WORRIED ABOUT HER AGAIN.

376
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,666
DO YOU REALLY WANT THEM TO
TRANSFER HER TO ANOTHER SCHOOL?

377
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,708
- OH, AND WE COULD USE
YOUR HELP TOO, HIMEJI.

378
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,083
- BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

379
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,625
- WE DON'T THINK MINAMI
ACTING THIS ALL BY HERSELF

380
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,041
WILL BE CONVINCING ENOUGH.

381
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,333
WO WE WERE HOPING
YOU COULD PRETEND

382
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,916
THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS 
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

383
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU CAN MANAGE THAT,

384
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,833
CAN'T YOU?

385
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,041
- I, UM-- LOOK,
MINAMI AND AKIHISA,

386
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,208
I UNDERSTAND YOU
MAY NOT WANT TO DO THIS,

387
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,625
BUT YOU HAVE TO.

388
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,708
- MIZUKI.

389
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,041
- I'M SORRY.

390
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,083
I KNOW I'M BEING SELFISH,
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT.

391
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,750
I JUST REALLY DON'T
WANT MY PARENTS

392
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,750
TO MAKE ME CHANGE SCHOOLS.
PLEASE DO THIS.

393
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,416
- WELL, I GUESS SINCE
I'LL JUST BE FAKING IT,

394
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
IT'S NOT THAT 
BIG OF A DEAL.

395
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,125
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, MINAMI.

396
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,875
- LOVELY, NOW
LET'S GET STARTED.

397
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,916
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THIS?
LIKE A SCRIPT?

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,750
- "SORRY FOR ASKING YOU
TO COME SEE ME LIKE THIS,

399
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,041
BUT I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU."

400
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,791
- "I HAVE A CONFESSION
FOR YOU TOO.

401
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,083
I FEEL THE SAME WA--"
OH NO, NO, NO, NO.

402
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,041
- I AM SO NOT
SAYING ANY OF THAT!

403
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
- I KNOW IT'S JUST PRETEND,
BUT THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

404
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,125
- WATCH ME DO IT.
YOU'RE NOT

405
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,333
GETTING INTO YOUR CHARACTERS.

406
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,791
- Aki: WHAT?

407
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,750
- Fukuhara: WOW.

408
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,750
- I'M SORRY FOR ASKING YOU
TO COME SEE ME LIKE THIS. 

409
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,333
BUT I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

410
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,625
- WHAT?
- EVER SINCE I FIRST MET YOU,

411
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,416
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU.
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME

412
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,416
TO BE NO MORE THAN A FRIEND
TO YOU THIS WHOLE TIME.

413
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,750
THE TRUTH IS I CAN'T BEAR
TO BE JUST FRIENDS

414
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,000
WITH YOU ANY LONGER.

415
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,083
AKI, I KNOW THIS
MUST BE WEIRD TO HEAR

416
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,666
AFTER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU EARLIER,

417
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,708
BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

418
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,666
I AM MADLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

419
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,916
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE MY BOYFRIEND?

420
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,291
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

421
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,166
- WOW, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

422
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,333
- MY HEART IS STILL RACING.

423
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,083
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, DUDE?

424
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,041
- I JUST NEED A MOMENT.
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR

425
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
AND LEAVE ME ALONE
FOR A LITTLE BIT? 

426
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,958
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP
FROM THIS DREAM, NOT YET.

427
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,708
- ( sighs )
YOU'RE UP, KOUTA.

428
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,750
THINK YOU CAN PUT
MIHARU'S WIRETAP DEVICE

429
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,583
BACK UP ON THE ROOFTOP?
- I CAN DO THAT.

430
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,833
- I WANT THE THREE OF YOU TO
HEAD UP THERE AND PUT ON A SHOW,

431
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,625
SO MIHARU THAT WILL HEAR IT
THROUGH THE MICROPHONE

432
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,291
AND GET THE WRONG IDEA.

433
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,500
- THE SETUP IS THAT AKIHISA
AND MINAMI ARE MEETING SECRETLY.

434
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,666
OKAY, NOW LINK
YOUR ARMS TOGETHER.

435
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,416
- UH... HOW COME?
- OUR ARMS?

436
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,166
- WE GOT TO MAKE THIS
LOOK AUTHENTIC,

437
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,833
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,
SO DO IT.

438
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,833
- I'M IN.  GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

439
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
- IF YOU TRY TO TOUCH ME
ANYWHERE ELSE, I'LL KILL YOU.

440
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,041
- ( students chatter )

441
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,375
- ( nervous laughs )

442
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,958
WHEN YOU GRAB AHOLD
OF ME THAT TIGHT,

443
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,166
IT'S HARD TO WALK.
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DATING,

444
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,250
YOU DUMMY.
THIS IS CALLED NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

445
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,083
- I GET THAT, BUT
YOUR YOU-KNOW-WHATS

446
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,166
ARE DIGGING INTO MY ELBOW.

447
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,958
- ( gasps )
YOU'RE DIRTY.

448
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,291
- IT'S YOUR RIBS.

449
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,041
( screams )
OH, CRAP.

450
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,208
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ACTING.

451
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,333
UM...

452
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,541
- YES, DEAR?

453
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,500
- WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
YOU LIKE ABOUT ME?

454
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,208
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING?
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

455
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,583
EVERYTHING FROM
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD TO--

456
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,708
- TO WHAT?
- YOUR EYEBROWS.

457
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,166
- MY FOREHEAD?
I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

458
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,375
- I HAVE TO ASK.

459
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,833
WHY ARE YOUR ARMS 
CROSSED LIKE THAT?

460
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,000
- MIZUKI?
- YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.

461
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,333
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE-- LIKE...

462
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,333
LIKE THE TWO OF YOU MIGHT
BE DATING OR SOMETHING.

463
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,875
- WAIT, WAS THAT LINE
IN THE SCRIPT?

464
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,875
OH, SHE'S IMPROVISING.

465
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,500
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MIZUKI.

466
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,291
AKIHISA AND I
ARE INDEED TOGETHER.

467
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,666
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

468
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,416
- I'M SORRY, I SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING EARLIER.

469
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,041
- SO I WAS RIGHT.

470
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,750
YOU REALLY HAD A THING
FOR AKIHISA THIS WHOLE TIME.

471
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
- YES, AND I'M SORRY
FOR KEEPING THAT FROM YOU.

472
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,666
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I KNEW HOW YOU FELT.

473
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,083
I REALLY AM SORRY.

474
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,833
PLEASE SAY YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME.

475
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,166
- YOU KNOW, I SORT OF
ALREADY KNEW YOU LIKED HIM,

476
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,916
BUT I DO FEEL BETTER NOW
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HONEST WITH ME.

477
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,250
I UNDERSTAND.

478
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,791
YOU WERE IN
AN AWFUL POSITION.

479
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,750
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
HAVE SAID ANYTHING EITHER.

480
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,291
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE GONNA FORGIVE ME?

481
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,666
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT I'LL FORGIVE YOU.

482
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,166
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE THE FREEDOM

483
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,916
TO LIKE WHOMEVER 
YOU WANT TO LIKE.

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,250
AND I CAN'T FAULT
YOU FOR THAT, MINAMI,

485
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,208
ANY MORE THAN
I COULD FAULT MYSELF.

486
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,166
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

487
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
BUT STILL I--

488
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,791
I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU FOR
KISSING HIM THIS MORNING.

489
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,250
YOU WENT TOO FAR!
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

490
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,250
YOU STOLE THE VERY FIRST KISS
HE WILL EVER HAVE.

491
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,583
- BUT WE ALREADY
EXPLAINED THAT WAS

492
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,083
BECAUSE OF
THE EMAIL AND STUFF.

493
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,750
- DON'T YOU "AND STUFF" ME.

494
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,375
GOD, MAY BE ABLE
TO LET THAT ONE GO,

495
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,958
BUT I WILL NEVER FORGIVE
EITHER ONE OF YOU.

496
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,875
- ( gasps )
NO, IT'S A WIRETAP THINGY.

497
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,375
- YOU GUYS ARE STUPID.  STUPID!

498
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,875
- IF HIMEJI SPILLS THE BEANS
WITHOUT NOTICING IT,

499
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,416
MIHARU COULD FIGURE
OUT THE TRUTH.

500
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,083
- HIMEJI, WAIT!
- HEY, HOLD UP!

501
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

502
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,041
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO AFTER HER,

503
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
PICK HER OVER ME.

504
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,458
- I'M SORRY, MINAMI.

505
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,125
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

506
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,458
- NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

507
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,375
AKI, PLEASE, I HAVE
SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU.

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,041
I THINK I'M
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

509
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:06,083
FINALLY, I SAID IT.

510
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
- WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

511
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,333
THERE'S A SCRIPT, YOU KNOW?

512
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,458
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M DONE ACTING.

513
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,458
EVERYONE KNOWS
AKI LIKES GIRLY-GIRLS.

514
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,291
SO THIS HAS JUST
BEEN A WASTE OF TIME.

515
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,500
- Aki: HIMEJI.

516
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,166
- OH, HI, AKIHISA.

517
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,500
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THING WAS THERE.

518
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,916
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR SAVING ME AGAIN.

519
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,958
- ARE YOU FEELING OKAY, HIMEJI?

520
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,958
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU MIGHT
BE A LITTLE BUMMED.

521
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,458
- OH, NO, DO
I LOOK THAT BAD?

522
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,833
- WELL, NOT BAD,
MAYBE A LITTLE LONELY.

523
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,125
- I WONDER WHAT 
THAT LOOKS LIKE.

524
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,000
IF I DO LOOK LONELY,

525
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,958
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
I'M A LITTLE SAD.

526
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,500
EVEN IF IT WAS
ONLY FOR SHOW,

527
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,208
I STILL FEEL LIKE
THE PERSON I LIKE

528
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,083
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

529
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
DON'T YOU?

530
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,125
- OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN.

531
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,458
YOU WERE JUST GETTING
INTO CHARACTER.

532
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,083
- I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.

533
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,000
IT'S LIKE HIDEYOSHI SAID.

534
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,083
- I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE JEALOUS TOO.

535
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,291
- WHAT?

536
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,958
- IF YOU AND MINAMI LIKED
THE SAME GUY,

537
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,125
IT WOULD BUG ME, EVEN IF
YOU WERE PRETENDING.

538
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,458
- JUST FOR FUNSIES,
LET'S SAY

539
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,166
YOU WERE IN THAT
EXACT SITUATION.

540
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,208
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
ABOUT IT, AKIHISA?

541
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,041
- WELL, LET ME SEE.

542
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,291
I GUESS I WOULD MOST LIKELY
THINK REALLY HARD ABOUT IT.

543
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,208
- WAIT, YOU WOULD MOST LIKELY
THINK ABOUT IT?

544
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,250
- YEAH, I'D THINK REALLY HARD
ABOUT IT IN MY OWN WAY.

545
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,833
AND THEN BE LIKE WAY HONEST
WITH EVERYTHING.

546
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,750
- BUT I WANTED YOU
TO TELL ME

547
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,916
WHICH ONE OF US
YOU WOULD PICK.

548
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WHAT? OH NO,
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

549
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,208
- I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED THOUGH.
- YOU WERE? ABOUT WHAT?

550
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,125
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT THE WAY
YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER,

551
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,500
DIDN'T MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE YOU WERE ACTING.

552
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,166
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT-- YOU KNOW.

553
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,208
DID YOU USE TO PERFORM
IN PLAYS OR SOMETHING?

554
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,791
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

555
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,500
- IDIOT.

556
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,583
- DUMMY.

557
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,166
- ( theme music plays )

558
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

559
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,208
- Fukuhara: QUESTION 10:

560
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,125
"NAME THE NUTRIENTS MISO LACKS

561
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,708
AS WELL AS SUITABLE INGREDIENTS

562
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,791
THAT COULD MAKE UP
FOR THE LACKING NUTRIENTS."

563
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,458
- Mizuki: VITAMIN C, ORANGE,
AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID.

564
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,416
- THAT IS NOT ACCURATE.
- Aki: NEXT EPISODE,

565
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,541
"ME, ROMANCE,
AND LOVE SKILLS."

566
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,333
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
