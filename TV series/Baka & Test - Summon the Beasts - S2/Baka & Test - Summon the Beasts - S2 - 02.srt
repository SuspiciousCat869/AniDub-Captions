1
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,916
- OKAY, THIS IS WEIRD.
WHERE AM I?

2
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,583
"THE RIVER STYX"?
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE FUN.

3
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,875
- COME ON, AKIHISA.
COME TO OUR SIDE OF THE RIVER.

4
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,208
- IT'S NICER THAN IT LOOKS.
I PROMISE.

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,916
- EVERYTHING IS
BETTER OVER HERE.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,916
- TRUST ME, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO BE SCARED, MAN.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,875
THIS SIDE JUST TAKES
A LITTLE GETTING USED TO.

8
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,666
NO BIG DEAL.
- YUUJI?

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,083
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING OVER THERE?

10
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,000
- I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M HERE.

11
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,666
IT'S ALL GOOD.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,333
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO BE SCARED, I PROMISE.

13
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,125
COME ON OVER.  DON'T BE AFRAID.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

14
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,625
- ( screams )

15
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,458
- ( shivers )

17
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,958
- HEY, WHERE ARE WE?
- I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY.

18
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,083
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE WENT
THROUGH HELL TO GET HERE.

19
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,666
- YOU HAD TO KNOW
THE GIRLS WOULD FIND OUT

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,458
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO.
I MEAN, IF YOU ASK ME,

21
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,458
YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY
TO BE BREATHING.

22
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

23
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,833
WE SHOULD BE
GONERS FOR SURE.

24
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,041
- Fukuhara: AKIHISA AND YUUJI
MADE A CONTEST

25
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,041
OUT OF HITTING ON
CHICKS YESTERDAY.

26
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,750
THE GIRLS FOUND OUT AND
PUNISHED THEM SOMEWHAT SEVERELY.

27
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,250
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMEONE PUNISHED

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,875
AS GRUESOMELY AS YOU WERE.

29
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,500
I CAN HARDLY BEAR 
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

30
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,375
IT WAS JUST SO
HORRIBLY SADISTIC.

31
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,750
- YEAH, I'M GLAD
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT.

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,208
- ME TOO, ALTHOUGH I GUESS
WE DESERVED WHATEVER IT WAS.

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,875
WE WERE BEING JERKS.
- I'M JUST SAYING,

34
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,583
THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE WITH GIRLS,

35
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,708
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY AVOID
FLIRTING WITH OTHER GIRLS.

36
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,000
- YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

37
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN OFF
A LITTLE EASY.

38
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,083
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D EXACTLY CALL

39
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,166
A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE
"GETTING OFF EASY."

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,958
- NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER,
BUT I THINK I GET

41
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,375
WHERE AKI'S COMING FROM.

42
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,125
THERE MIGHT BE MORE
PUNISHMENT TO COME.

43
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,750
- SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD DO? RUN?

44
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,958
- Minami: SOMEONE SAY "RUN"?

45
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,041
- WE'RE TOO LATE.

46
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,375
- Girls: TA DA!

47
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,875
- HEY, GIRLS.  YOU LOOK NICE,
BUT WHY ARE YOU WEARING YUKATA?

48
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,875
- BECAUSE THEY'RE HOLDING 
A FESTIVAL IN TOWN, SILLY.

49
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,208
- SO, AKIHISA,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,583
- UM, THEY'RE GOOD.
YOU GUYS LOOK SO NICE.

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,291
- REALLY? THIS IS KINDA
MY FIRST TIME WEARING ONE.

52
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,208
- OH, YEAH, YOU
GREW UP IN GERMANY.

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,708
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I KEEP FORGETTING THAT.

54
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,666
- WHAT? WILL YOU QUIT STARING?

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,250
- ( gasps ) OH.

56
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,291
I WAS JUST ZONING OUT.
- OR MAYBE

57
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,166
YOU JUST COULDN'T
KEEP YOUR EYES OFF HER.

58
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
MINAMI SURE DOES
LOOK PRETTY, DOESN'T SHE?

59
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

60
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,166
- KIMONOS ARE SUPER GREAT
BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD

61
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,958
EVEN IF YOU'VE
GOT SMALL BOOBS.

62
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,125
- I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

63
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,416
- OH, WELL, THEN I SUPPOSE
I BETTER SHOW YOU, HUH?

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,458
PAY ATTENTION.
( kisses )

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,791
UH-OH.
- HMM? ( screams )

66
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
- YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

67
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,416
HE LOST IT WAY FASTER
THAN USUAL.

68
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,166
- ( gasps )

69
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,333
- LISTEN, KOUTA,
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
STAY WITH ME NOW.
- ( groans )

71
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,833
I KNOW.  IT LOOKS
A LOT WORSE THAN IT IS.

72
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,666
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

73
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,458
- YUUJI.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,333
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY YUKATA?
TELL THE TRUTH.

75
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,791
- IT'S FINE AND I ALWAYS
TELL THE TRUTH, DON'T I?

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,291
- THANK YOU.
IN THAT CASE THEN,

77
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,958
WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO GET MARRIED?

78
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,541
- NO FREAKING WAY.
- ALL RIGHT, THAN WOULD YOU

79
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,583
RATHER MOVE FORWARD
BY GETTING ENGAGED FIRST?

80
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,416
- NOT EVEN A LITTLE.
- THEN LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

81
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
- NO MEANS NO.

82
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,833
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KEEP BREATHING?

83
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,083
- YEAH, OKAY FINE!

84
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,708
YOU LOOK GREAT, SHOUKO.
VERY PRETTY.

85
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,333
- THAT'S SO SWEET
OF YOU TO SAY, YUUJI.

86
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,916
- LIKE YOU GAVE ME A CHOICE.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,583
- MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,791
TO KEEP MY MAN.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,083
- THIS IS WEIRD. I THOUGHT
THEY WERE ALL MAD AT US.

90
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,041
I DON'T TRUST THIS,
LIKE NOT AT ALL.

91
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,625
- OKAY, EVERYONE.
ARE WE ALL SET?

92
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,833
IT'S TIME FOR US TO HEAD 
OVER TO THE FESTIVAL NOW.

93
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,916
- AKIRA'S RIGHT.
LET'S GO GUYS.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,916
HURRY UP, WE DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE, DO WE?

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,916
- I'M SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,416
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND JAPANESE
FESTIVAL I'VE BEEN TO.

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,833
- I DON'T WANT
TO MISS ANY OF IT.

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,875
- GET A MOVE ON, BOYS.

99
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,250
- Both: YEAH, OKAY.

100
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,833
- WOW, EVERYTHING
IS SO SPARKLY.

101
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,333
- I KNOW, FOR REAL.
I LOVE IT.

102
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,791
- YUMMY, SOMEONE HAS
DONER KABOBS HERE.

103
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,541
- THEY LOOK GOOD TOO.
- WELL, WE SHOULD TRY THEM.

104
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,250
IF THEY LOOK GOOD,
WHY NOT, RIGHT?

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,708
- ( screams )
- YUP, MORE PUNISHMENT.

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,125
I WANT YOU TO GO
BUY SOME FOR ME.

107
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,916
- ( screams )

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,666
- WHY DID I HAVE
TO AGREE WITH HER?

109
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,583
- I'M GOING TO ASSUME
YOU WANT SOME TOO.

110
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,250
I DON'T MIND PAYING FOR THEM.
- IT'S FINE.

111
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,375
I WON'T ARGUE WITH YOU.
HOLD ON.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?

112
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,875
YOU'RE GONNA BUY THEM?
- WHAT'S WRONG?

113
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,666
DID YOU WANT TO PAY INSTEAD?
- NO, NO, AS YOU WERE.

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,500
I WONDER.

115
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,875
MAYBE SHE REALLY
DID FORGIVE ME. 

116
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,750
- HERE IT IS.

117
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,291
I GOT US ONE ORDER TO SPLIT
IF THAT'S OKAY.

118
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,166
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS HERE
I WANT TO TRY.

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,833
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO FILL UP TOO SOON.

120
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,333
- YEAH, GOOD PLAN.
I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT.

121
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,500
SO HOW DOES IT TASTE?
- OH, I CAN'T EAT AND WALK.

122
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,541
I'M NOT SURE YET.

123
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,333
I GUESS THEY DON'T
USE LAMB IN JAPAN,

124
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,458
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY YUMMY.
YOU TRY.

125
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,083
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE IT
BETTER THIS WAY.

126
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,041
- OH WOW, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

127
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,166
- OH, AKI, YOUR FACE.

128
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,250
YOU'VE GOT SOME SAUCE ON IT.

129
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,541
- THANKS, THAT WAS NICE
AND AWKWARD.

130
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,708
- AKIHISA, I JUST BOUGHT
SOME OCTOPUS DUMPLINGS. 

131
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,208
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY SOME?

132
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,666
- WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE I WOULD.
THANKS, HIMEJI.

133
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,666
ONE DUMPLING PLEASE.

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,375
- HERE YOU GO.
SAY AAH.

135
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,416
WHAT'S WRONG?
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ONE.

136
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,708
DOES IT NOT LOOK GOOD?

137
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,166
- IT LOOKS FINE.
IT'S NOT THAT.

138
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,500
- WELL, THEN.  AAH.

139
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,208
- AAH.

140
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,916
MHMM, YUM.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,583
THE PANCAKE PART
IS HOT AND CREAMY

142
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,458
AND THE OCTOPUS
IS NICE AND CHEWY.

143
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,333
( gasps )
NO WAIT, AKIRA!

144
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,250
PLEASE! I KNOW
THAT SOUNDED SEXUAL,

145
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,791
BUT IT WASN'T AT ALL.
I SWEAR.

146
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,250
- "THE OCTOPUS IS CHEWY,"
THAT'S SEXUAL?

147
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,791
- IT'S NOT?
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY

148
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,041
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT?
- NO.

149
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,958
- WHAT'D YOU SCREW UP, AKI,
THIS TIME?

150
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,041
QUIT FREAKING OUT.
IT'S JUST A FESTIVAL.

151
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,958
YOU CAN BE SUCH
A BABY SOMETIMES.

152
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,708
- WHO'S FREAKING OUT?
YOU'RE THE ONE

153
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,916
SHELLING OUT
AT EVERY BOOTH.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,333
- HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW.

155
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,125
THESE COULD HAVE BEEN
TOTALLY FREE, GOD.

156
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,916
- THIS IS ONLY YOUR
SECOND FESTIVAL HERE.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,666
IT'S OKAY IF YOU COULDN'T
HELP YOURSELF.

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,000
- THANK YOU.  COTTON CANDY
IS LIKE WAY DELICIOUS.

159
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,208
DO YOU WANT TO TRY SOME, AKI?

160
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,750
- WHAT?

161
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,666
SURE, I LOVE THAT STUFF.

162
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,041
- YEAH, YOU DO.
SAY AHH.

163
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,333
- AAH.
- IT'S GOOD, AM I RIGHT?

164
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,916
- YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
THANKS, MINAMI.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,625
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

166
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,375
- YUUJI, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME OF MY NOODLES?

167
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,000
- YEAH, SURE. I GUESS I'LL
HAVE SOME IF YOU DON'T MIND.

168
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,708
- I HAVE OKONOMIYAKI TOO.

169
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,708
- THANKS, THAT'S 
VERY NICE OF YOU.

170
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,458
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SODA?

171
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,250
- YES, MUCH APPRECIATED.

172
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,333
- NICE, YUUJI LOOKS LIKE
HE GOT OFF THE HOOK TOO.

173
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,916
I MEAN, THIS IS A FESTIVAL.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,333
WHY WOULD THEY WANT
TO BE PISSED THE WHOLE TIME?

175
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,708
TODAY ROCKS!

176
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,208
- AKIHISA,
THEY HAVE BABY CHICKENS

177
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,916
IN DIFFERENT COLORS OVER THERE.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,541
THERE'S LIKE GREEN ONES,
AND BLUE ONES, AND EVERYTHING.

179
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,458
- YEAH, THEY JUST HIRE SOMEONE
TO PAINT THE BABIES.

180
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,541
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR BREED

181
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,791
OR SOMETHING NATURAL LIKE THAT.
- ( laughs )

182
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,083
YOU TWO ARE LIKE
BEYOND STUPID.

183
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,958
KOUTA, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ALL THIS?

184
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,291
- ( screeches )

185
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,250
- ( evil chuckle )

186
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,708
I'LL COLOR YOU 
HOWEVER I LIKE!

187
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,291
- WELL, PAINTING MAKES
A SICK KIND OF SENSE. 

188
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,041
- SO TELL ME, AKI, ARE YOU
HAVING A GOOD TIME YET?

189
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,291
- YUP.

190
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,458
- AND, YUUJI, ARE
YOU HAVING FUN?

191
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,208
- YUP, SURE AM.

192
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,916
- HEY, LOOK, AKIHISA.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,291
IT TURNS OUT THE FESTIVAL
IS THROWING A SPECIAL EVENT

194
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,000
LATER ON TODAY.
- "ENTER TO WIN

195
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,541
OUR FIRST EVER SUMMER
MISS YUKATA BEAUTY PAGEANT."

196
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,166
NICE.
- BEAUTY PAGEANT?

197
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,708
- WE SHOULD TOTALLY
GO WATCH THAT.

198
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
- MY CAMERA AND I
ARE UP FOR IT.

199
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,291
- ALL RIGHTY THEN.
HOW ABOUT WE ALL GO.

200
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,625
- BETTER YET,
WHY DON'T WE HAVE EVERYONE

201
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,583
JUST COMPETE IN THE THING.

202
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,125
WELL, I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY.

203
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,166
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE A NICE MEMORY

204
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,958
OF THE DAY AND STUFF.
THAT'S ALL.

205
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,333
- GREAT IDEA.
- WHAT? REALLY?

206
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,583
- YES, OF COURSE, WE SHOULD
ALL DO THIS TOGETHER.

207
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,500
- SOMETHING WE ARE SURE
TO NEVER FORGET.

208
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,625
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S
COMPETE IN THE PAGEANT.

209
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,083
LET'S HAVE
EVERYONE HERE COMPETE.

210
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,750
- Both: RUN!

211
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,416
- ( screams )

212
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,833
- WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
IN SUCH A HURRY? YOU SCARED?

213
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,250
- WE'RE GOING TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE BEAUTY PAGEANT.

214
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,375
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, YUUJI?

215
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,916
- WHAT? DON'T TAKE
THIS PERSONALLY,

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,208
BUT YOU GUYS AREN'T
MAKING ANY SENSE LIKE AT ALL.

217
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,000
- FOR REAL.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

218
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,875
- HITTING ON GIRLS EARLIER.
- SURELY YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE

219
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,583
WE WERE FINISHED
WITH YOU BOYS YET.

220
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,375
- YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW
THAT WE WOULD MAKE YOU PAY

221
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
SEVERELY FOR WHAT YOU DID.

222
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,583
- ( laughs )
HEY, BOYS, DON'T WORRY.

223
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,541
I TOTALLY BROUGHT
MY MAKEUP KIT WITH ME TONIGHT.

224
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,083
- ( both gasp )
- NO WAY!

225
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,291
I'M SUPER TALL.
I'D NEVER PASS AS A WOMAN.

226
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
I THINK MAKING AKIHISA
DRESS UP AS A CHICK

227
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,916
IS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
- WHAT?! DON'T YOU USE ME
TO TRY TO GET OUT THIS.

229
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,416
IF ANYONE'S DRESSING UP,
IT'S YOU.

230
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,708
- PLEASE STOP FIGHTING.

231
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,333
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
IS GOING TO WIN.

232
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,958
- YOU GUYS SHOULD
FOLLOW KOUTA'S LEAD.

233
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,041
HE'S TAKING HIS
CROSS-DRESSING LIKE A MAN.

234
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,708
- ( sighs )

235
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,791
- I THINK THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN
BY "CRUEL AND UNUSUAL."

236
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,625
- I'M SORRY.  I HAVE SUCH
A FLARE FOR THE DRAMATIC.

237
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,500
I PROBABLY OVERDID IT
WITH THE MAKEUP,

238
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,666
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

239
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,625
- I JUST WISH HE WEREN'T
SO EXCITED ABOUT DOING IT.

240
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,916
- I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,333
WHERE'D THEY COME UP
WITH KOUMI? I HATE IT.

242
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,291
- OH PLEASE.  WHAT ARE
YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT?

243
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,000
ON TOP OF LOOKING LIKE
A TOTAL FREAK,

244
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,791
I'M SUPPOSED TO ACT
LIKE A DAMN FOREIGNER.

245
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,750
- WELL, THE ONLY WAY
ANYONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE

246
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,625
SOMEONE AS BIG AS YOU WAS
A CHICK IS IF YOU TELL THEM

247
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,208
YOU'RE AN INTERNATIONAL ATHLETE.

248
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,750
- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
LOOKS JUST ADORABLE.

249
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.  ONE OF YOU
COULD TOTALLY WIN THIS.

250
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,000
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME

251
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,500
TO SEE MY LITTLE BROTHER GROW UP
TO BE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL.

252
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,958
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW NOT HAPPY

253
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,208
IT MAKES ME
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

254
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,291
- YOU NEED TO WORK ON
YOUR SEX APPEAL, YUUJI.

255
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,541
- I DO NOT.
I'M SEXY AS HELL.

256
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,833
- HEY, I HAVE A QUESTION.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

257
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,750
WHY DO I HAVE TO
COMPETE IN THE PAGEANT?

258
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,500
- Fukuhara: BECAUSE THAT'S
THE PLOT IN THIS EPISODE.

259
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,916
ROLL WITH IT.

260
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,625
- Mizuki: BAKA AND TEST.

261
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,000
- Announcer: AND NOW,
IT'S TIME TO START

262
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,208
OUR FIRST EVER SUMMER
MISS YUKATA BEAUTY CONTEST.

263
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,750
- ( cheers )

264
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,958
- AS A COMMENTATOR,
WE HAVE MR. OBATA, 

265
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,833
WHO'S WEARING
HIS YUKATA TODAY.

266
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,791
HE IS ALSO OUR
SPONSOR AND JUDGE.

267
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,041
- I AM EXCITED TO BE,
BUT I'M EVEN MORE EXCITED

268
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,750
TO SEE ALL THE PRETTY LADIES.

269
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
- YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
I JUST KNOW IT.

270
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,041
- STOP STRESSING.  NO ONE
WILL FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

271
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,666
- YUUJI, IF YOU BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, YOU CAN WIN.

272
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,666
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

273
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,583
- I'LL RECORD THE WHOLE THING.

274
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,250
THIS TIME YOU'RE
THE ONE ON CAMERA.

275
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,958
- I HATE YOU.

276
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,208
- Aki: DUDE, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO?

277
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,875
- Yuuji: WE MAKE SURE
WE LOSE THIS THING FAST.

278
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,958
THEN WE ROLL.
- I GOT IT!

279
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,208
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL THEM WE'RE GUYS?

280
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,416
- WE CAN'T DO THAT.

281
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,125
- YEAH, LIKE ABSOLUTELY CAN'T.

282
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,041
WHAT IF SOMEONE WE KNOW,
LIKE SOMEONE FROM SCHOOL

283
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,833
IS IN THE AUDIENCE?
- THINK ABOUT IT

284
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,625
FOR JUST A SECOND.
IMAGINE OUR CLASS 

285
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,250
FOUND OUT WE WERE
DRESSED UP LIKE CHICKS.

286
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,458
AND NOT ONLY WERE WE DOLLED UP
FROM HEAD TO TOE,

287
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
BUT WE WERE SO CONFIDENT
IN OUR HOTNESS

288
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,875
WE ACTUALLY ENTERED
A CONTEST TO PROVE IT.

289
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,208
- NO, THAT'S SOCIAL SUICIDE!
I FINALLY GOT POPULAR!

290
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,666
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO BEING A NOBODY.

291
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,958
- YOU'RE IDEA OF
POPULAR AND MINE

292
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,416
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
- FOCUS!

293
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,708
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
WE'RE GONNA

294
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,458
GET OUT OF THIS
MASSIVE BALL OF SUCK.

295
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,666
WE CAN'T ALLOW OURSELVES
TO MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST ROUND.

296
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,291
AND NO ONE CAN FIND OUT
WE'RE GUYS.

297
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,416
OUR TIME HAS COME.
THIS IS OUR BATTLE FOR MANHOOD.

298
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,458
- FIRST UP TONIGHT, WE HAVE
LOVELY CONTESTANT NUMBER ONE.

299
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,666
PLEASE TAKE THE STAGE.

300
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,791
- ( cheers )

301
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,166
- OKAY, WHAT DO I DO NOW?

302
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,000
- WELL, SWEETIE, WANT
TO TELL US YOUR NAME?

303
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,958
- I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE FLOOR
AND BE AS QUIET AS I CAN.

304
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,041
( high-pitch )
UM, HELLO.

305
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,708
MY NAME IS AKIKO YOSHII.

306
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,833
- PERFECT.  NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU MIGHT BE

307
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,458
A LITTLE BIT SHY, MISS AKIKO.

308
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,000
- SHYNESS USUALLY MEANS
A GIRL IS PURE AND INNOCENT.

309
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,625
I'M GOING TO GIVE
HER A HIGH SCORE.

310
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,625
- WHY?

311
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,250
- DO YOU HAVE ANY
SPECIAL TALENTS?

312
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,000
- I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THIS.

313
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,416
WHAT IF THEY START ASKING ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TALENT? 

314
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,458
( high pitch )
I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY COOKING.

315
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,416
I'M GOOD AT PAELLA AND
SPAGHETTI CARBONARA TOO.

316
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,166
- SO DO YOU MOSTLY
COOK AT HOME?

317
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,791
- UH-HUH, I COOK ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

318
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,250
- A LOOKER AND A COOKER.

319
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,208
DON'T SEE THAT MUCH
THESE DAYS.

320
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,708
NOW TELL US, DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

321
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,041
- NO! NO BOYFRIEND!

322
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,416
- ( cheers )
- WELL, THAT IS GOOD NEWS

323
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,250
FOR ALL THE GUYS
IN THE AUDIENCE.

324
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,666
MR. OBATA, WHAT'S
YOUR OPINION ON THAT?

325
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,708
- IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR PHONE
NUMBER AND LET ME CALL YOU,

326
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,958
I PROMISE TO GIVE YOU MONEY
TO SPEND ON WHATEVER YOU WANT.

327
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,375
- SO YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE
TO PUNCH HIM FOR SAYING THAT,

328
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,458
BUT HE IS OUR SPONSOR.
NOW, MISS AKIKO,

329
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
WHAT DO YOU LIKE MOST

330
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,833
ABOUT THE YUKATA YOU'RE
WEARING FOR US TODAY?

331
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,250
- LIKE ABOUT IT?
WELL, IT'S VERY MODEST.

332
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,500
SO IT HIDES MY BODY.
- INTERESTING.

333
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,083
SO THEN, MR. OBATA,
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 

334
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,541
ABOUT HER MANNER
OF WEARING YUKATA?

335
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,708
- YES, I DO.  I WANT TO KNOW
IF SHE'S WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.

336
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,833
- UNDERWEAR? LIKE PANTIES?

337
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,875
( high pitch ) NO FREAKIN' WAY!
I DON'T WEAR THAT STUFF!

338
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,416
- ( cheering )

339
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,666
- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT
WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION.

340
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,166
YOU CAN LEAVE THE STAGE NOW.

341
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,500
- NICE SCORE, MAN.
THEY LIKE YOU.

342
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
- I HATE YOU.

343
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,625
- PLEASE TELL US YOUR NAME.

344
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,166
- YEAH, OKAY.
I AM KOUMI TSUCHIYA.

345
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,958
- AND DID YOU COME HERE
TO SWIM TODAY?

346
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,375
- I DID.
- GREAT, NEXT QUESTION.

347
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,583
DO YOU OFTEN WEAR YUKATA?
- I DON'T.

348
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,083
- DID YOU COME HERE ALONE
OR ARE YOU HERE WITH FRIENDS?

349
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,625
- WITH FRIENDS.
- SO ARE THEY CHEERING YOU ON

350
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,500
IN THE AUDIENCE?
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

351
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,541
- HMM.

352
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,916
OKAY, BESIDES YUKATA, WHAT ARE
YOUR FAVORITE KINDS OF CLOTHING?

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,875
- SILK CHINESE DRESSES, KIMONOS,
AN OUTFIT FOR RACECAR GIRLS,

354
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,416
CHEERLEADERS, NURSES,
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS,

355
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,333
WAITRESSES AT OLD-SCHOOL DINERS,
AND POLICE WOMEN.

356
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,416
ALSO, ANY KIND OF LEOTARD,
CHICK POWER SUITS,

357
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,708
AND SCHOOL GIRL UNIFORM,
SHRINE MAIDEN OUTFITS,

358
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,416
MAID UNIFORMS,
AND TENNIS OUTFITS.

359
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,000
UH, I MEAN, NOTHING MUCH.
- ( cheering )

360
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,500
- WELL, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

361
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,083
APPARENTLY THE SHORT-ANSWER
SWEETHEART

362
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,916
ENJOYS COSTUMES ALMOST AS MUCH

363
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,708
AS THE AUDIENCE ENJOYS HER.
- NO, FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

364
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,875
- ( cheers )

365
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,166
- PLEASE CALM DOWN.

366
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,750
- THIS IS QUITE A REACTION.

367
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,916
THIS CUTIE'S DEFINITELY 
MAKING IT TO THE FINALS.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,416
- PLEASE STOP.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEER FOR ME.

369
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,833
- ( cheers )

370
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,000
- ( sighs )

371
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,041
- YOUR PLAN BACKFIRE
ON YOU, KOUMI?

372
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,583
- I HATE YOU AND
I HATE THIS PLACE.

373
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,125
- ( with accent ) 
I'M HONG XIONG LI.

374
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,000
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.

375
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,875
- WE MIGHT HAVE A REAL-LIFE
AMAZONIAN WOMAN ON OUR HANDS.

376
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,458
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MR. OBATA?
- I LOVE THE TALL ONES.

377
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,333
I'M ENTRANCED.
SOME MIGHT CALL IT A FETISH,

378
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,166
BUT IT'S SIMPLY A RESPECT
FOR STRONG WOMEN.

379
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,291
- WHAT?!

380
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,583
- SHE HAS THE HIGHEST SCORE

381
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,250
OF ALL OF OUR
CONTESTANTS SO FAR.

382
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,708
NOW THEN, DO YOU HAVE ANY--
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

383
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,000
- WE'LL BE MARRIED IN THE SPRING

384
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,541
AND SPEND OUR HONEYMOON
IN CAMBODIA.

385
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,125
- WE'RE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES.

386
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,375
OUR FAMILIES WOULD
NEVER APPROVE.

387
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,166
- THE FORBIDDEN ASPECT
OF OUR LOVE

388
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,708
ONLY MAKES IT STRONGER.
DO YOU NOT AGREE, DEAR?

389
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,708
- WHAT LOVE? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

390
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,125
- YOU'LL FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO
SOMEDAY.  JUST HAVE FAITH.

391
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,583
- ( normal ) THE ONLY THING
I HAVE FAITH IN

392
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,083
IS THAT I'M ABOUT
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

393
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,625
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE AFRAID, DARLING!

394
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,291
WE CAN START OFF AS FRIENDS.

395
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,750
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

396
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,500
YOU'LL WANT FOR NOTHING!
- ENOUGH!

397
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,041
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.
YOU ASKED FOR IT!

398
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,083
- ASKED FOR IT?
I'M PRACTICALLY BEGGING FOR IT.

399
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,208
YOU COULD DO
ANYTHING YOU WANT?

400
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,625
- AFFAIRS WILL
NOT BE PERMITTED.

401
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,125
- SHOUKO, NO!

402
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,750
WHAT ABOUT ANY OF THIS
IS AN AFFAIR?!

403
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,083
( cries )

404
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,041
- I THINK I'M GONNA
NEED THERAPY NOW.

405
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,541
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
YOU COULD SAY WE HAD 

406
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER.

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
- YEAH, EXCEPT
I WANT TO FORGET IT.

408
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,208
- IT WAS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST
THE CONTEST GOT CANCELLED.

409
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,958
- I DON'T THINK THAT
CREEPY SPONSOR GUY

410
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,166
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.

411
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,166
- HUH, MAYBE WE WENT
A TEENSY BIT OVERBOARD.

412
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,125
- WHAT DO YOU THINK? SHOULD
WE LET THEM OFF THE HOOK NOW?

413
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,916
- PERHAPS.
I'M NOT OPPOSED TO IT.

414
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
- THEY ALL LOOK PRETTY SORRY
IF YOU ASK ME.

415
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,333
WHY DON'T WE
MAKE AN EXCEPTION

416
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,625
AND FORGIVE THEM
THIS TIME, OKAY?

417
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,291
- ( sighing )

418
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,541
- YOU KNOW, I WONDER WHO WOULD
HAVE WON THE PAGEANT

419
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,416
IF IT DIDN'T GET ALL EXPLODED.
DON'T YOU?

420
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,583
- I DON'T KNOW.  HIDEYOSHI SEEMS
THE MOST APPROPRIATE CHOICE.

421
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,166
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  WHY AM I
THE MOST APPROPRIATE CHOICE?

422
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,416
I'M A GUY TOO.
AND YOU HAD THE HIGHEST SCORE.

423
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,375
- MY HEART DID A LITTLE
FLUTTER-THING WHEN I SAW

424
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,958
KOUTA DRESSED UP
LIKE A GIRL.

425
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,416
WHAT ABOUT YOU, AKIRA?
- IT WAS FUN.

426
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,791
I MEAN, I'M USED TO AKI
WEARING GIRL'S CLOTHES,

427
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,416
BUT IT WAS STILL NICE
TO SEE THE OTHER TWO 

428
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,041
EMBRACE THEIR
CROSS-DRESSING SELVES.

429
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,708
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, CRAZY?!

430
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,458
I DON'T EVER
WEAR CHICK CLOTHING!

431
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,958
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
AKI, MY DARLING.

432
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,500
YOU WORE A SKIRT AGAIN
LAST NIGHT.

433
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,500
I SWEAR YOU HAVE 
THE WORST MEMORY.

434
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,166
OF COURSE, YOU WERE
ASLEEP AT THE TIME.

435
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,041
- YOU'RE MY SISTER!
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME

436
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,250
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING?!
- AKI, CALM DOWN.

437
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,500
I AM HALFWAY LYING
ABOUT THIS.

438
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,375
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN, YOU SCHIZO?!

439
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,291
TELL THE TRUTH.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!

440
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,291
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I COULDN'T GET IT UP

441
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,416
PAST YOUR KNEES.
- SO YOU LEFT IT HALFWAY ON?!

442
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,791
- IF YOU'D RATHER, WE CAN SAY
IT WAS HALFWAY OFF INSTEAD.

443
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,208
- ( cries )
- Yuuji: OKAY, GUYS.

444
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,916
THE FOOD'S READY.

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,041
- All: YEAH, I'M STARVING.

446
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,416
- THIS LOOKS SO DELICIOUS.

447
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,875
- SERIOUSLY, SAKAMOTO
IS REALLY GOOD AT GRILLING.

448
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,916
- MY FUTURE HUSBAND,
I'M SO PROUD.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,208
- I WANTED TO COOK TOO, BUT
AKIHISA WOULDN'T LET ME HELP.

450
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,708
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS GONNA
ACCIDENTLY KILL SOMEONE

451
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,458
WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE.

452
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,583
- THAT WASN'T WHAT
WE WERE AFRAID OF, HIMEJI.

453
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,583
THE PROBLEM WAS
YOU COULD STILL HAVE KILLED US

454
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,333
WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING A KNIFE.

455
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,375
- IF SHE COOKS, WE'RE DEAD.

456
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,625
- MY TONGUE JUST CURLED
BACK IN MY THROAT.

457
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,000
- THE WOMAN CANNOT BE
ALLOWED NEAR A KITCHEN.

458
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,916
- I HAVE AN IDEA.  WHY DON'T
WE HAVE A COOKING COMPETITION

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,166
BETWEEN ALL THE GIRLS.
AND THE GUYS CAN JUDGE IT.

460
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,375
- Boys: THAT'S
THE WORST IDEA EVER.

461
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,875
- OOH, I LIKE IT,
BUT COOKING'S SO SUBJECTIVE.

462
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,041
HOW DO WE DECIDE
WHO THE WINNER IS?

463
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,291
- IF THEY'RE GOING
FOR A K.O,

464
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,833
I'D KNOW WHO'D WIN.

465
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,958
- ( groans ) 
- GOOD GRIEF.

466
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,708
WE SURE DID STUFF OUR FACES,
DIDN'T WE?

467
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,083
- WE DID, YEAH.
CALL ME CRAZY, THOUGH.

468
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,583
I'M STILL HUNGRY.
- TOO BAD.

469
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,750
THERE'S NO FOOD
LEFT TO COOK.

470
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,416
- SURE THERE IS, MAN.

471
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,833
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
- ALL I SEE IS UGLY.

472
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,750
- IT'S CALLED THE OCEAN,
YOU NIMROD.

473
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,166
FRESH CLAMS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF
THIS WORLD WHEN THEY'RE GRILLED.

474
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,375
- OH YEAH.

475
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,833
- Mizuki: YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT...

476
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,333
- ( gasps )

477
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,833
- I BAKED SOME
MADELEINES AT HOME.

478
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,500
SO WE COULD EAT
THOSE IF YOU WANTED.

479
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,791
- COME ON, YUUJI.
LET'S GO FIND US SOME CLAMS.

480
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,291
- YEAH, CLAMS! 
CLAMS ARE GOOD.

481
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,666
WE SHOULD FIND SOME. 
WE SHOULD GET SO MANY

482
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,250
THAT WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO EAT THEM ALL.

483
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,125
- HEY, SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN ME ON THE BEACH, KOUTA?

484
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,916
WE CAN HELP THEM.
- YES, I LOVE CLAMS.

485
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,708
- WEIRD, I WONDER
WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT.

486
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,708
- THERE'S NO TELLING.
- THEY'RE GUYS.

487
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,500
SO WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THOSE MADELEINES?

488
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,833
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
I DID BAKE A DOZEN OF THEM.

489
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,541
BUT I FORGOT THAT
I FORGOT TO BRING THEM.

490
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,458
THEY'RE STILL SITTING AT HOME.
- BUMMER,

491
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,416
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO SOMETHING SWEET.

492
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,625
- Hideyoshi: WE CAN DO
THIS, GUYS. WE HAVE TO.

493
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,916
- I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

494
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

495
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,583
- Minami: LOOK AT THEM.  THEY'RE
SLEEPING LIKE LITTLE BABIES.

496
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,250
- WELL, CONSIDERING
WHO THEY ARE,

497
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,500
THAT SEEMS FAIRLY APPROPRIATE.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

498
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,083
WHO KNEW THEY COULD
LOOK SO INNOCENT, THOUGH?

499
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,416
- I KNOW, THEY LOOK SO ADORABLE.

500
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,416
- THEY MUST BE TIRED
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

501
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,333
IT WAS CRAZY.  I'M GLAD EVERYONE
HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME, THOUGH.

502
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,583
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

503
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,583
THEY FELL ASLEEP
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

504
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,958
- THEY WERE
STUMBLING AROUND

505
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,291
BEFORE THEY COULD
EVEN GET IN THE CAR.

506
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,708
- WHEN THEY WERE 
EATING BREAKFAST,

507
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,125
THEY HAD LOTS OF ENERGY,
BUT, LIKE

508
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,750
THE NEXT SECOND,
THEY WERE ALL FALLING OVER.

509
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,250
- THEY WERE JUST REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT EATING, I GUESS.

510
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,083
- YEAH, SERIOUSLY,
BUT THAT DIDN'T MEAN

511
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,833
THEY HAD TO EAT
ALL OF OUR FOOD TOO.

512
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,250
- IT KIND OF SUCKS
WE DON'T GET

513
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,916
TO CHAT WITH THEM
ON THE WAY BACK. 

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,583
- I AGREE.

515
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,000
- ( groans )
- THEY FELL ASLEEP SO FAST,

516
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,041
I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO ASK
HOW THEY LIKED BREAKFAST.

517
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,833
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE IT.

518
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,083
- Boys: COME ON OVER
TO THIS SIDE.

519
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,458
IT'S NICER THAN IT LOOKS.

520
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,416
YES, THERE'S NO
NEED TO BE SCARED.

521
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,083
IT JUST TAKES
A LITTLE GETTING USED TO.

522
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,208
- Fukuhara: QUESTION THREE:

523
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,875
"WHAT ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED
TO BRING TO SCHOOL?"

524
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,125
- Aki: SNACKS?  BUT I DON'T
THINK BANANAS SHOULD COUNT.

525
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,458
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE BANANAS.
GET IT? "BANANAS."

526
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,583
- NEXT EPISODE, "ME, THAT GIRL,
AND A STUFFED TOY."

527
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,291
- THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
