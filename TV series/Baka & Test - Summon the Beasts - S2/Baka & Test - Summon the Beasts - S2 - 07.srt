1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:17,666
- ( Avatars yelling )
- ( grunts )

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,333
- ( all grunt )

3
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:24,166
- ( gasps )
- ( female Avatars shout )

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,708
- I'LL KEEP THEM
TIED UP HERE.

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,750
- YOU GUYS GO ON 
AHEAD WITHOUT ME.

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,125
- ( gasps )

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,500
- ( siren blares )

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,583
- THEY MUST HAVE CHANGED
THE PASSWORD.

9
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,708
- HOW DID THEY KNOW?

10
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,333
- THESE PEOPLE
ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,000
HOW CAN YOU BETRAY THEM
SO EASILY?

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,250
- ( chuckles )

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,333
WHO NEEDS THEM
WHEN I HAVE YOU?

14
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,500
- ( grunts, gasps )

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,916
YOU SHOULD RUN
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,875
- I'LL LET GO.
- NO.

17
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,041
SOMEONE DRAINED ALL
THE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.

18
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,625
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,833
THAT MEANS WE CAN'T HIDE
BEHIND THE BUBBLES NOW. 

20
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,583
- IT'S TIME, MS. TOUDOU.

21
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,500
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO ESCAPE.

22
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:19,291
- ( groans )
DAMN THAT PROBATIONARY STUDENT!

23
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,708
- ( all scream )

24
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,375
- NO WAY. SHE'S GOT THE WEIRD
BURN MARK ON HER BUTT.

25
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,875
- SHE MUST BE THE SCUMBAG
THAT WAS TRYING TO BLACKMAIL US.

26
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,791
- SO, AKIHISA DIDN'T SET UP 
THE HIDDEN CAMERA AFTER ALL?

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,375
OH, THAT'S SUCH A RELIEF.

28
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,041
- I'M REALLY SORRY, AKI.
WE WERE WRONG.

29
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,708
- IT'S OKAY.  AS LONG AS YOU
FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

30
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,458
- WELL, YOU WIN.

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,708
I'VE DECIDED TO LET YOU
SPY ON THE GIRLS ALL YOU WANT.

32
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,791
- All: YEAH!

33
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,916
PARADISE, HERE WE COME!

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,958
- ( gasps )

35
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,250
- Fukuhara: THE WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A DREAM.

36
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,250
THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD NIGHT
OF ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP.

37
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,541
- DAMN.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

38
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,250
WHY DID MS. TAKAHASHI
HAVE TO BUTT INTO OUR BUSINESS?

39
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,125
- SHE'S TOO STRONG.
IT'S CHEATING.

40
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,083
- HOW ARE YOU
GONNA HANDLE IT?

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,333
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING

42
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,750
IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER

43
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,916
THE BLACKMAILER'S CONTROL.
- I KNOW.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,166
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP YET.

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,833
- YEAH, BUT TOMORROW IS

46
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,916
THE LAST NIGHT TO CATCH THEM.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,791
- I'VE ALREADY GOT ANOTHER PLAN.

48
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,833
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T THINK
THE GUYS FROM D, E, AND F

49
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,250
ARE GONNA BE ENOUGH. WE'LL STILL
NEED A LOT MORE BACK-UP.

50
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,791
ARE YOU WITH ME, KOUTA?
- I'LL HANDLE THE PHOTOGRAPHY.

51
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,875
- AKIHISA, YOUR JOB'S TO LURE
THE GIRLS TO OUR ROOM.

52
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,500
- BUT WHY?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

53
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,833
- IF WE CAN JUST GET
A COUPLE OF PICTURES OF THEM,

54
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,500
THEN WE CAN USE THOSE
PICTURES AS BAIT

55
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,333
TO REQUEST HELP FROM
THE OTHER CLASSES.

56
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,416
- YEAH, I GET IT.
WE'LL CONVINCE THE OTHER GUYS

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,708
TO HELP US BY APPEALING
TO THEIR ANIMAL DESIRES

58
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,875
WITH THE PICTURES.

59
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,875
- AND HERE IS A YUKATA
FOR YOUR PICTURE.

60
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,208
- NO, WE'RE TAKING
PICTURES OF THE GIRLS.

61
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,291
- I'LL SEND HIMEJI
AND MINAMI A TEXT MESSAGE.

62
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,625
"I'VE GOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

63
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,333
CAN YOU COME TO MY ROOM
ASAP?"  AND SEND.

64
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,333
- ( phone beeps )

65
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,458
- HIMEJI NEVER
LEAVES ME WAITING.

66
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,458
- "I'LL LEAVE IN
A FEW MINUTES.

67
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,875
I'VE JUST GOT TO PACK UP A FEW
SNACKS FOR US FIRST, 'KAY?"

68
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,291
- OH, COOL.
MINAMI REPLIED TOO.

69
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,708
- "YEAH, I GUESS I CAN.
BUT WHY THIS LATE?

70
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,291
CAN'T IT WAIT
TILL TOMORROW?"

71
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,041
- SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S
PLAYING IT SAFE.

72
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,291
HOW SHOULD I RESPOND?
- ( phone beeps )

73
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,458
- HUH, ANOTHER ONE?
AND IT'S FROM SUGAWA.

74
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,791
- "HEY, I WAS WONDERING,
WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO DESPERATE

75
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,458
TO SPY ON THE NAKED GIRLS?"

76
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,666
- REALLY?
OH, COME ON.

77
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,666
THAT QUESTION PRACTICALLY
ANSWERS ITSELF.

78
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,083
"YOU KNOW WHY.
IT MAY BE DESPERATE,

79
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,333
BUT THE HEART WANTS
WHAT THE HEART WANTS."

80
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,000
HMM?  HMM?

81
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,708
AAH!

82
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,333
CALM DOWN, AKIHISA, BUDDY.

83
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,708
LET'S PLAY THIS BACK
STEP BY STEP.

84
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,875
AAH!

85
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,500
- HEY, IS SOMETHING WRONG,
AKIHISA?

86
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,208
( grunts )

87
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,833
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

88
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,083
YOU LOOK KIND OF DOWN.

89
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,500
- COULD YOU MAYBE
GO BACK IN TIME

90
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,875
AND <i>NOT</i> BREAK MY PHONE?

91
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,375
- QUIT WORRYING.
I GOT IT.

92
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,916
I'LL HAVE THIS THING
FIXED UP IN NO TIME.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,125
- LET ME BORROW YOUR CELL.
NOW, DAMN IT!

94
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,750
- SURE, MAN.

95
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,541
- I NEED TO EXPLAIN 
THAT TEXT TO MINAMI.

96
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,458
YOUR CONTACTS ARE EMPTY.

97
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,541
YOU KNOW YOU'VE ONLY GOT
SHOUKO'S CONTACT INFO IN HERE?

98
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,375
- WHAT?!  DAMN IT.

99
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,375
I'VE GOTTA FIND A NEW PLACE
TO HIDE MY PHONE.

100
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,958
I WISH SHE WOULD
STOP DOING THAT.

101
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,625
- YEAH,
THAT'S KIND OF MESSED UP.

102
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
MINAMI'S NUMBER, DO YOU?

103
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,041
- OH YEAH, SURE.  THE SAME WAY
YOU KNOW SHOUKO'S NUMBER.

104
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,958
- WELL, I GUESS IT WAS
WORTH ASKING.

105
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,125
- HOLD ON.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SEND?

106
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,500
AAH!

107
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,375
YOU JUST TOOK A GIANT DUMP
ON MY LIFE, YOU MORON!

108
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,583
- NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

109
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,791
AND YOU CAUSED THAT
FEELING, YOU JERK!

110
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
- SHUT THE HELL UP!

111
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,000
- ( boys gasp )
YES, SIR.

112
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,166
- THIS IS BAD.
I'VE GOTTA FIX IT.

113
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
I NEED YOUR CELL
TO CALL SHOUKO. 

114
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,750
- I DROPPED MINE IN THE TOILET
AND CAN'T AFFORD A NEW ONE.

115
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,625
- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT
CAN TRACK YOU WITH THOSE THINGS.

116
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,708
- IT'S OVER.
MY LIFE IS COMPLETELY OVER.

117
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,916
- ( knocks on door )
- IT'S OPEN.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS?
- HEY, HIMEJI.

119
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,166
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. 
BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE IT?

120
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,833
DIDN'T IRON MAN 
TRY TO STOP YOU?

121
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,666
- I GAVE HIM A COUPLE OF SNACKS
AND HE LET ME THROUGH.

122
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,125
- MAY FLIGHTS OF ANGELS
SING HIM TO HIS REST.

123
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,750
- WELL, I'M HERE, AKIHISA.

124
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,250
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT?

125
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,416
- Akihisa: OH, YEAH.
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,541
- ( camera shutter clicks )

127
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,000
- Fukuhara:
WITH THE PICTURES TAKEN

128
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,416
AND THEIR GOAL COMPLETED,

129
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,583
THE NIGHT COULDN'T GET
ANY BETTER.

130
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,375
HOWEVER...

131
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,166
- HEY, AKI.  AKI.

132
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,041
YOU ASLEEP?

133
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,583
HEY.  WAKE UP, JERKWAD.

134
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,041
- HMM?

135
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,000
- I CAME TO YOUR ROOM
LIKE YOU SAID.

136
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,583
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.
NOW GO AND WAKE UP.

137
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,208
- ( bones crack )
- ( screams )

138
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,625
- SHH!

139
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,625
SHUT UP, AKI.
YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD.

140
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,458
-  ( muffled screams )

141
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,458
( groans )

142
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,500
- WELL, DON'T JUST
GO BACK TO SLEEP! 

143
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,875
- MINAMI, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

144
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,041
( gasps ) I THINK I MIGHT
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

145
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,041
ONE, I SENT MINAMI
A WEIRD-ASS TEXT. 

146
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,916
- ( groans )
- TWO, KNOWING HER,

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,791
SHE'S PROBABLY PISSED OFF.

148
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,083
THREE, SHE'S LOOMING OVER
MY SLEEPING BODY.

149
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,333
FOUR, HER BODY'S A WEAPON.
- AAH!

150
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,166
- THERE YOU HAVE IT.

151
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,250
JUST PLEASE TRY TO MAKE IT
QUICK AND PAINLESS, OKAY. 

152
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,791
- TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT
SURE I WANT TO KNOW

153
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,333
WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN.

154
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,583
- WHAT?
YOU MEAN I'M SAFE?

155
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,333
- I DON'T GET YOU.
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS EASY

156
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,666
FOR ME TO COME OVER HERE,
YOU KNOW.

157
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,791
- ( gasps )
- SO THEN... I...

158
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,250
I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME IN PERSON,

159
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,666
NOT BY TEXT,

160
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,708
BEFORE I LET THIS THING
GO ANY FURTHER.

161
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:46,083
- THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO COME UP WITH MY FINAL WORDS.

162
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,500
( gasps )

163
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,541
I COULD USE
SOME HELP RIGHT NOW.

164
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,833
HIDEYOSHI LOOKS TOO CUTE
TO WAKE UP.

165
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,666
KOUTA'S WRAPPED UP
TAKING PICTURES, OF COURSE.

166
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,291
YUUJI'S BEING TIED UP
AND MOLESTED BY SHOUKO.

167
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,125
-  ( muffled scream )
- DAMN IT.

168
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,875
DON'T MY FRIENDS REALIZE
I NEED THEM?

169
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,333
- ( muffled screams )

170
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,708
- I'VE COME TO RESCUE YOU,
MY DARLING LOVE.

171
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,333
AAH!
- THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND YOU!

172
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,125
- MIHARU, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? 

173
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,291
- I CREPT INTO YOUR BED
TO SURPRISE YOU

174
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,750
ONLY TO FIND THAT
IT WAS EMPTY.

175
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,416
AND WHERE ELSE
COULD YOU HAVE GONE?

176
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,958
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
YESTERDAY,

177
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
YOU LITTLE LUNATIC!
- HUH?

178
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,958
YOU TRIED THIS YESTERDAY TOO?

179
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,291
- COME ON, BABY.
LET'S GO TO OUR ROOM

180
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,375
AND COIL OUR
NAKED BODIES TOGETHER.

181
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,708
DON'T GO THINKING
YOU'LL BE GETTING

182
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
ANY SLEEP TONIGHT THOUGH.

183
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,125
NOW FOLLOW ME.  COME ON.
- ( screams )

184
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,375
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
TRY TO RESIST ME.

185
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,208
- GET COMFORTABLE.
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING EITHER.

186
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,166
- ( gasps )

187
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,166
- WHY IS EVERYBODY SCREAMING?

188
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,083
- SHUT UP, GUYS.
KEEP IT DOWN.

189
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,666
IF YOU ALL GET ANY LOUDER,
THEN--

190
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,458
- Nishimura: HEY!
- ( gasps )

191
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,583
- WHAT THE HELL IS
ALL THIS RUCKUS?

192
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,750
- MAN, WE ARE IN
DEEP CRAP HERE. 

193
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,833
- HE'S GONNA KILL US WHEN HE
SEES FOUR HALF-NAKED GIRLS

194
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,500
IN OUR ROOM.
- THERE'S ONLY THREE,

195
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,166
OR AM I MISSING ONE?

196
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,583
- YUUJI AND I ARE GONNA
TRY TO DISTRACT HIM.

197
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,000
YOU GIRLS MAKE A RUN FOR IT
WHILE WE DO.

198
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,333
LET'S GO.
- YEAH.

199
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,250
- ( panting, squeals )

200
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,666
- I HOPE YOU'RE PREPARED
FOR YOUR DESTRUCTION, YOSHII.

201
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,583
- ( grunts )
I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

202
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,583
- THEN PREPARE TO
GET PREPARED!

203
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,666
- HE'S ON OUR ASS.
OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO HIDE

204
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,625
SOMEPLACE HE CAN'T GO.
- AND WHERE IS THAT?

205
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,625
- THE GIRL'S ROOM.
- I GET YOU.

206
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,375
IRON MAN CAN'T GO INTO
THE GIRL'S ROOM

207
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,291
'CAUSE HE'S A GUY
AND HE'LL GET FIRED.

208
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,375
BUT IF I GO IN THERE WEARING
NOTHING BUT MY UNDERWEAR,

209
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,291
THEN I'LL MOST LIKELY
GET SENT TO PRISON.

210
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,125
- LET'S RISK IT.
- NO FREAKING WAY.

211
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,958
- IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT LIKE
SUCH A GIRL ABOUT IT,

212
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,666
PUT THIS ON AND SHUT UP.
- THANK YOU.

213
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,125
-  ( screams )
- OKAY, THERE IT IS.

214
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,291
WE'RE ALMOST IN THE CLEAR.
- HOLD ON.

215
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,416
I'D BE BETTER OFF GOING IN THERE
BUCK NAKED THAN WEARING THIS.

216
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,625
- YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT POINT,
BUDDY.

217
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,958
GOOD LUCK.
- GET BACK HERE.

218
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,250
- LOOK, I'D RATHER
NOT GET BUSTED

219
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,791
WITH A CROSS-DRESSER, OKAY?

220
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,750
- THEN I GUESS YOU'D BETTERd
GIVE ME YOUR YUKATA.

221
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,291
- GET OFF ME, YOU FREAK.
- DO IT.

222
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,625
NOW!  TAKE IT OFF.
- STOP!

223
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,958
- GIVE IT TO ME, JERKFACE.
- HELP.

224
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,500
- WHAT THE HELL?
- ( both gasp ) 

225
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

226
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,583
I KNOW YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
MUCH LUCK WITH THE LADIES,

227
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,833
BUT SAVE THIS KIND OF THING FOR
THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN ROOM.

228
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,833
- Both: THIS ISN'T WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE, WE SWEAR.

229
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,666
- Fukuhara: A PERFECT INCIDENT
FOR SUCH A HOT NIGHT.

230
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,833
WHOO-HOO.

231
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,375
- ( yawns )
SO SLEEPY. 

232
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,083
- YOU GUYS SURE YOU'RE
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT TODAY?

233
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,500
'CAUSE WE'VE STILL
GOT A LOT OF

234
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,666
TESTS AHEAD OF US
TO RECOVER OUR SCORES.

235
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,166
- WE'VE GOT COUNSELING WITH IRON
MAN FOR THREE DAYS IN A ROW.

236
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,291
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT DID LOOK PRETTY BAD.

237
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,500
- AT LEAST SOMETHING GOOD
CAME OUT OF IT.

238
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,333
- WHOA!
YOU ARE FREAKING AMAZING, DUDE.

239
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,416
- OKAY, GUYS.
IT'S TIME.

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,416
LET'S GO FIND SOME
RECRUITS TO HELP US.

241
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,875
- Fukuhara: THE FOURTH DAY
OF ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP,

242
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,875
A DAY DESTINED TO GO
DOWN IN HISTORY

243
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,208
AS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN.

244
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,291
- I'VE GATHERED SOME
USEFUL DATA FROM THE LAST TIME.

245
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,375
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE 

246
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,833
FROM THE UNITS
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

247
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
- THOSE WERE THE CLASS 'C'
GIRLS, RIGHT?

248
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,875
THIS WAS THEIR SCIENCE
AND HUMANITIES SCRIMMAGE.

249
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
- THE TROUBLE HERE,
THE TEACHERS' AVATARS

250
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
ARE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THEM.

251
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,958
THERE'S NO WAY TO
GET PAST THAT.

252
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,750
- WHOA!  THERE GOES
TAKENAKA'S TOUPEE. 

253
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,666
- NOW WATCH THIS CLOSELY.

254
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,291
- THE TEACHER FIELD
JUST VANISHED.

255
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,875
- IF THE FIELDS OF TEACHERS
FROM DIFFERENT SUBJECTS COLLIDE,

256
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,375
THEY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

257
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,333
- I SEE.
I GUESS IT MUST CAUSE

258
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,000
TOO MUCH TECHNICAL
INTERFERENCE.

259
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,500
- THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE.

260
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,833
THEY'LL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

261
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,583
TO CREATE AN UNBREAKABLE
LINE OF DEFENSE.

262
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,500
WHILE AVOIDING THE INTERFERENCE,

263
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,750
THEY'RE GOING TO STAGGER
THEIR MAIN FORCES

264
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,916
BY THE LEVEL OF THEIR STRENGTH.

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,833
THIS IS THEIR
EXPECTED FORMATION.

266
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,416
- OUR ROOM IS HERE 
ON THE THIRD FLOOR,

267
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,750
WHILE OUR GOAL LIES
DEEP IN THE BASEMENT.

268
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,083
- MS. TAKAHASHI,
MR. OOSHIMA, AND IRON MAN

269
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,750
WILL PROBABLY BE
DEFENDING THE BASEMENT,

270
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,416
WHILE ON THE OFFENSIVE FRONT,

271
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,291
WE'VE GOT THE GUYS
FROM D, E, AND F. 

272
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
- AND THE REST, FINGERS CROSSED
ON THE GUYS FROM A, B, AND C.

273
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,458
- IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH FIGHT,
NO MATTER WHAT.

274
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,666
- YOU GUYS CAN LET ME HANDLE
LITTLE MISS TAKAHASHI.

275
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,750
KOUTA, WE'LL LEAVE OOSHIMA,
THE GYM TEACHER,

276
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,750
FOR YOU TO HANDLE.
BEST OF LUCK.

277
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,625
- ( grunts )

278
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,958
- AND AKIHISA,
YOU'LL TAKE IRON MAN.

279
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,958
- WHY ME?

280
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,541
- BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE HERE

281
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,083
THAT HAS A PHYSICALLY ENHANCED 
AVATAR THAT CAN BRING HIM DOWN.

282
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,750
- OKAY.

283
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,750
- IF YOU DO THIS,

284
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,041
WE'RE GONNA WATCH YOUR BACK
AT ALL COSTS.

285
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:22,875
AND I GUARANTEE YOU, WE WILL
GET YOU TO IRON MAN UNSCATHED.

286
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,791
AND WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO SACRIFICE OURSELVES.

287
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,541
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

288
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,583
NO ONE EVEN TOUCHES YOU
BEFORE YOU'RE ABLE TO REACH HIM.

289
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,125
- YOU MEAN IT?

290
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,583
- WILL YOU PLEASE
DO THIS FOR US, AKIHISA?

291
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,208
- FINE.

292
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,958
- ( alarm rings, stops )

293
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,708
- IT'S TIME TO LAUNCH
THE MISSION, GENTLEMEN.

294
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,958
- RIGHT.
SO LET'S DO IT.

295
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,541
ARE YOU GUYS
FIRED UP OR WHAT?

296
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,958
- All: YEAH.

297
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,083
- THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE.
- HUDDLE UP.

298
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,583
- WE ACCEPT NOTHING LESS
THAN TOTAL VICTORY,

299
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,708
AND NOTHING WILL STOP US
FROM ACHIEVING IT.

300
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,541
- All: YEAH.

301
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,833
- I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
GIRLS OR TEACHERS IN THERE.

302
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,208
OUR EYES WILL FEAST UPON
A WET AND BUBBLY SKIN BUFFET.

303
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,250
ON THE FOURTH NIGHT OF 
ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP,

304
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,500
WE SHALL OVERCOME!
LET'S GO.

305
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,083
- ( Avatars grunting )
- THEY'RE HERE.

306
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
THE FOUR PERVY MASTERMINDS.

307
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,583
- THEY WON'T GET PAST US.

308
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,000
- Both:
I'M SUMMONING MY AVATAR.

309
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,916
SUMMON!

310
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
- ( Avatars shout )
- SUMMON!

311
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,166
- ( grunts )

312
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
- DON'T KID YOURSELF,
CLASS F.

313
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,416
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HIT THE BOOKS BEFORE YOU TALK.

314
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,958
- ( grunts )
- ( both scream )

315
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,083
- NO TIME TO WASTE 
ON THE SMALL FRIES.

316
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,500
- THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.
NOW GIVE IT UP, YUUJI.

317
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,458
- ( panting )
- AAH!

318
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,958
- ( grunts )
- ( chuckles )

319
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,458
- ( gasps )
- IT'S HIRAGA FROM CLASS D!

320
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,291
THEY SHOWED!
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

321
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,458
WE'LL HOLD THEM BACK.
KEEP MOVING.

322
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,375
- ( Avatars shout )

323
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,791
- THANKS A LOT, COMRADE.

324
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,833
WE'LL SEE YOU IN VALHALLA.

325
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,625
- ( moans )

326
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,125
- THERE'S SO MUCH DEDICATION.

327
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,708
- THAT'S 'CAUSE OUR
HEARTS ARE UNITED

328
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,041
BEHIND ONE PURPOSE.

329
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,875
- BUT OUR REAL BATTLE
STARTS HERE.

330
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,916
- WE'RE SCREWED IF WE DON'T
HAVE ANY BACKUP THOUGH.

331
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,333
- YOU BOYS NEVER LEARN!

332
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,000
- ( Avatars grunt )

333
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,083
- I'M SORRY, MR. FUSE.
THIS ISN'T PERSONAL.

334
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,958
- NO, NOT YOU TOO.
TELL ME WHY.

335
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,791
- IT'S KUROSAKI
FROM CLASS C!

336
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,333
- KOUTA'S PICTURES HAD
A PROFOUND EFFECT ON ME.

337
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,833
IN FACT, I'VE NEVER
CARED SO MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING

338
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,500
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

339
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,666
AND I PROMISE TO FIGHT
UNTIL THE BITTER END

340
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,166
TO SEE SUCH BEAUTY
WITH MY OWN EYES. 

341
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,125
- ( boys grunt )

342
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,083
- WE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
THIS FAR WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

343
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,833
YOU GUYS WATCH OUR BACKS,
AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST

344
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,583
TO CLEAR THE PATH.
- THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME

345
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,250
A REASON TO DREAM AGAIN!

346
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,750
MEN OF CLASS C, LET'S GIVE THEM
EVERY BIT OF THE SUPPORT

347
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,750
THEY NEED.
THE GLORIOUS PATH TO VICTORY

348
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,916
LIES STRAIGHT AHEAD.
- ( Class C boys cheer )

349
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,708
- ( panting )

350
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,416
- IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE
WE'VE GOT BACKUP

351
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,083
FROM EVERY GUY 
IN EVERY CLASS.

352
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,000
- TOO BAD CLASS A IS STILL
KIND OF A WILD CARD.

353
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,416
- WE ALREADY KNOW THOSE PICTURES
WON'T WORK WITH KUBO.

354
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,708
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
DON'T TELL ME HE HAS

355
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,625
A BETTER COLLECTION
OF PICTURES THAN THOSE.

356
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,041
- ( all sigh )

357
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,708
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

358
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,625
- LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT
CLASS B TOO.

359
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,791
- HIYAH!
- ( grunts )

360
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,750
- ( gasps )
- ( Avatars groan )

361
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,125
- YUUJI,
IT IS TIME TO GIVE UP.

362
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,125
- SHOUKO.
- HIMEJI.

363
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,875
- WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU
GET PAST THIS POINT, AKIHISA.

364
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,541
- THAT'S IT.
WE'RE FINISHED.

365
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,541
WE CAN'T DEFEAT THEM.

366
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,666
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

367
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,208
- NEMOTO.
- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN TRIED.

368
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,958
IT'S A LOST CAUSE.

369
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,375
- AND IS IT EVEN WORTH IT
IF HIMEJI AND SHOUKO

370
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,125
AREN'T THERE ANYWAY?

371
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,958
- OF COURSE IT'S WORTH IT, GUYS.

372
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,958
SURE, THEY MAY NOT BE
TAKING A BATH,

373
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,833
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER NAKED GIRLS?

374
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,750
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THEM?

375
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,166
- EACH AND EVERY NAKED GIRL IN
THIS WORLD IS WORTH SPYING ON.

376
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,750
NOW GET UP!
GET UP FOR BOOBIES!

377
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,250
- LOOK, AKIHISA,

378
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,166
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
WIN AT THIS POINT,

379
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,625
SO WHY ARE YOU SO INSANELY
DETERMINED TO FINISH THIS?

380
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,916
EVEN IF YOU MANAGE
TO GET THE PICTURES BACK,

381
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,208
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE
YOUR REPUTATION.

382
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,000
- IT ISN'T THAT, HIDEYOSHI.
I ADMIT,

383
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,166
THAT WAS THE ONLY THING
I REALLY CARED ABOUT AT FIRST.

384
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,791
CAPTURING THE REAL CULPRIT

385
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,916
AND CLEARING MY NAME OF
ANY GUILT IN THE PROCESS.

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,333
BUT AS WE PASSED
THROUGH THIS BATTLE

387
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,041
AND WITNESSED GOOD MEN 
SACRIFICING THEMSELVES,

388
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
WELL, I CAME TO
REALIZE SOMETHING.

389
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,583
- AND WHAT WAS THAT?
- EVEN THOUGH IT'S CONSIDERED

390
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,583
THE WRONG THING TO DO,

391
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,041
I'M NOT GONNA LIE 
ABOUT MY FEELINGS.

392
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,875
SO I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

393
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,291
AND THE TRUTH IS, THE ONLY
REASON THAT I'M DOING THIS

394
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,208
IS I WANT TO SEE
THE GIRLS NAKED!

395
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,791
- ( chuckles ) YOUR STUPIDITY
IS SOMEHOW ADMIRABLE.

396
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,375
- ARE YOU REALLY SAYING
THAT YOU WOULD RATHER

397
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,625
PEEK ON MINAMI IN THE BATH

398
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,125
INSTEAD OF SPYING ON ME?

399
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,625
THAT'S THE LAST STRAW, AKI.
NO MORE.

400
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,916
YOUR PEEKING DAYS
ARE OFFICIALLY OVER!

401
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,125
- GO AHEAD AND LET
SOCIETY JUDGE ME FOR IT.

402
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,458
I DON'T CARE!
I HAVE TO STAY TRUE

403
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,666
TO THE FEELINGS IN MY HEART!

404
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,416
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE,
AKIHISA.

405
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,416
- HEY, WHO SAID THAT?
- ( gasps )

406
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,041
- I'M SORRY IT
TOOK US SO LONG,

407
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,541
BUT NOW THAT I'VE
HEARD HOW YOU FEEL,

408
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,458
I KNOW THAT I'VE MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

409
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,500
- HEY, KUBO.
YOU MADE IT.

410
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,333
- I WAS A LITTLE
HESITANT AT FIRST,

411
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,916
BUT I AM NOW A TRUE
BELIEVER IN YOUR CAUSE.

412
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,083
THE GUYS OF CLASS A
STAND 24 STRONG,

413
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOU HAVE OUR COMPLETE

414
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,250
AND UNDYING ASSISTANCE.

415
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,250
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
GIVE HIM THE COVER HE NEEDS.

416
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,833
- Class A Boys: YEAH!

417
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,458
- THANK YOU, KUBO.
I OWE YOU ONE.

418
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,916
- I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD
BE THANKING YOU.

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,416
YOU WERE RIGHT
EARLIER ON.

420
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I CAN'T LIE ABOUT
MY FEELINGS EITHER.

421
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,583
AND WHILE SOCIETY MAY
LOOK DOWN UPON ME,

422
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,916
THE HEART WANTS
WHAT THE HEART WANTS!

423
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,666
- THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND AKIHISA.

424
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,250
NOW BUTT OUT!
- SUMMON!

425
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,791
- AAH!

426
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,166
- I'VE MADE A PERSONAL VOW

427
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,750
TO PROTECT AKIHISA,

428
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,791
AND I WON'T LET YOU
STAND IN HIS WAY.

429
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,666
- ( Avatars grunting )

430
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,541
- COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S MOVE OUT!

431
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,375
- I'M SURPRISED.

432
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,208
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU MANAGED

433
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,291
TO TALK CLASS A
INTO HELPING YOU,

434
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,125
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER,
DOES IT?

435
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,458
THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE
FOR ALL OF YOU.

436
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
SUMMON!

437
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,833
- NO WAY.
WE'RE WALKING RIGHT THROUGH.!

438
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
- ( gasps )

439
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,708
( gasps )

440
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,541
- UH--
- GO! 

441
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,875
YOU CAN DO IT!

442
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,250
- ( panting )

443
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,708
- SUMMON!

444
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,875
- ( grunts )

445
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,458
- AAH!

446
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,916
- ( gasps )
- NOTHING'S GONNA STOP HIM NOW.

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,083
- ( gasps )

448
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,833
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I WAS STARTING TO THINK 

449
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,916
YOU WEREN'T GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT, KOUTA.

450
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,916
- THEY WERE EXPECTING YOU.

451
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,833
- THERE'S NO CHANGE
IN OUR GAME PLAN.

452
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,833
KEEP GOING, AKI.
- I CAN'T.

453
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,333
- SURE, GO.
- ( gasps )

454
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,500
- I'LL LET YOU PASS,
BUT ONLY IF KOUTA

455
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,625
STAYS AND FACES ME.
- OH, FINE.

456
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,708
- ALL RIGHT.

457
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,000
GOOD LUCK NOT DYING,
MY BROTHER.

458
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,583
- I AM BEYOND DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, KID.

459
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,250
DON'T TELL ME
YOU HONESTLY THINK

460
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,583
A STUDENT CAN
BEAT A TEACHER.

461
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,583
- WHO SAYS?

462
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,333
- WHAT?

463
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,250
- WHO SAYS THAT
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

464
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,666
FOR A STUDENT TO
DEFEAT A TEACHER?!

465
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,750
- VERY WELL.
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

466
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,166
- All: SUMMON!

467
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,333
- ( grunts )

468
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,625
- 774?!

469
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,541
NOBODY'S EVER
SCORED THAT HIGH.

470
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,666
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

471
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,375
- HAVING FAITH RENDERS
ANYTHING POSSIBLE.

472
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,125
- BUT HOW?  AND WHEN DID YOU
GAIN THAT MUCH STRENGTH?

473
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,791
- OUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

474
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,625
SO COME AT ME TOGETHER 
IF YOU'RE GONNA ATTACK.

475
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,500
- ( both grunt )

476
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333
- ( grunts )
AAH!

477
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,541
- I'M KIND OF SHOCKED
YOU ACTUALLY EXPECTED ME

478
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,791
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR.
- I MAKE A POINT

479
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,958
OF NEVER UNDERESTIMATING
MY OPPONENT.

480
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,458
AND WHILE YOU'RE AN IDIOT,

481
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,875
YOUR TENACITY IS
EXTRAORDINARY.

482
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,416
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

483
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
LET MET TAKE
THIS CHANCE TO THANK YOU!

484
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,541
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD TOO.

485
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,208
- AAH!

486
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,083
( grunts )

487
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,750
- ( gasps )
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME, YOU TWERP.

488
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,666
- AAH!
- ( screams )

489
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,583
( grunts )

490
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,250
- DON'T PISS ME OFF, KID.

491
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,000
I'M A LOT STRONGER
THAN THIS.

492
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,625
- PROVE IT.

493
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,083
GO ON AND GET UPSET.
LET'S DO THIS FOR REAL.

494
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,875
- YA!
- ( grunts )

495
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,583
YOU KNOW...

496
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,666
YOU'RE GONNA GET SUSPENDED
IF YOU WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

497
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,250
- I'M NOT TOO
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

498
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,000
THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY
OF US TO CATCH.

499
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,666
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO TO SUSPEND.

500
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,083
- REALLY?  YOU CAN'T
HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT.

501
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,458
- ( gasps )
- DON'T DROP YOUR GUARD!

502
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,416
( grunts )
- NO!

503
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,125
- IF THERE'S THAT MANY OF YOU,

504
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,708
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
KICK YOUR ASSES

505
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,750
AND TAKE OUR TIME
IDENTIFYING YOU! 

506
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,041
- ( both gasp )

507
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,541
- AAH!

508
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,583
- ( both grunting )

509
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,333
- AND NOW WE'RE DONE.
SO GIVE UP.

510
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
- WHAT CAN I DO?

511
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,000
I'VE GOT TO BEAT THIS GUY.

512
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:54,291
- YOU SIMPLY LACK THE FOCUS TO
EXECUTE SUCH A COMPLICATED PLAN.

513
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,291
- I TRIED SO HARD,
BUT I DON'T KNOW. 

514
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,458
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

515
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,583
I SIMPLY LACK--
THAT'S IT!

516
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,041
YEAH.  FOCUS.

517
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,625
IF I NARROW THE AIM,

518
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,041
IF I FIGHT ALONGSIDE MY AVATAR,

519
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,333
WE CAN CONCENTRATE OUR ATTACKS
TO A SINGLE SPOT ON YOUR BODY.

520
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,750
WE'LL FOCUS OUR ATTACKS
ON YOUR BALLS!

521
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,333
- WHAT?!  THAT IS
A GENUINELY DISTURBING IDEA

522
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,833
FOR YOU TO EVEN THINK OF.

523
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,208
- PASS OUT AND SAVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE PAIN!

524
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,208
- AAH!
- KISS YOUR BALLS GOOD-BYE!

525
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,916
- ( gasps )
- I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

526
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
- ( bones crack )
- ( chuckles )

527
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,083
- ( gasps )

528
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,375
- SUCKER.
( gasps )

529
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,833
- AH!
- ( gasps )

530
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,083
- I REFUSE TO LET YOU
DEFLOWER MY LOVE.

531
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,166
- MIHARU?
- CALL IT QUITS,

532
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,541
OR OTHERWISE I'LL SPREAD THIS
PICTURE AROUND LIKE THE PLAGUE

533
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,291
AND YOU WILL NEVER
EVER BE POPULAR.

534
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,958
- YOU'VE GOT MY PICTURE?
I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE.

535
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,000
DO YOU HAVE A BURN MARK
ON YOUR BUTT?

536
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,958
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

537
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,541
- SO YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE
BLACKMAILING ME THIS WHOLE TIME?

538
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,916
WHICH MEANS THAT
THE HIDDEN CAMERA

539
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,541
IN THE LOCKER ROOM IS YOURS.

540
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,541
- GOOD JOB FIGURING IT OUT,
BUT NOW I HAVE TO KILL YOU.

541
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,333
WAY TO GO, SMART GUY.

542
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,000
- YOU DID IT, MAN.
VERY NICE.

543
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,041
- AWESOME.  YOU GUYS ALL
MADE IT OUT ALIVE.

544
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,375
- OF COURSE.
- IF WE STORM THE BATHING ROOM

545
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,458
WITH THIS MANY PEOPLE,
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE

546
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
TO CATCH ALL OF US.
- EXACTLY.

547
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,541
THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN
PUNISH US

548
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,541
IF WE ALL RUSH IN TOGETHER.
LET'S GO.

549
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,208
- All: YEAH!

550
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,125
- Fukuhara: A DIFFICULT
AND PAINFUL BATTLE

551
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,250
FROM WHICH THEY
ARISE VICTORIOUS.

552
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,750
WITH NO ONE LEFT TO
STAND IN THEIR WAY,

553
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,125
THE MEN MARCH FORWARD
WITH PRIDE IN THEIR HEARTS.

554
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,500
- ( all gasp )

555
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,583
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU BOYS
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

556
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,291
- Boys: ( gasping )
IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING?!

557
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,666
- Fukuhara:
"ALL YEAR TWO MALE STUDENTS

558
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,250
IN FUMIZUKI ACADEMY,
A TOTAL OF 149,

559
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,666
ARE TO BE SUSPENDED
FROM SCHOOL FOR A WEEK."

560
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,791
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

561
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,458
- Fukuhara: BAKA AND TEST.

562
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,166
- Mizuki: AKIHISA!

563
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,000
- HEY.  LONG TIME, NO SEE,
HIMEJI.

564
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,916
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
- I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

565
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,375
I'M REALLY SORRY.
- WHAT, BUT WHY? 

566
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,125
- I FEEL SO TERRIBLE FOR
TREATING YOU LIKE A PEEPING TOM

567
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,791
ON THE FIRST DAY OF
ACADEMIC TRAINING CAMP.

568
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,875
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
- WELL, TO BE FAIR,

569
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,541
ALL YOU DID WAS CALL IT
BEFORE IT HAPPENED,

570
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,208
SO NO BIG DEAL.
- AKI!

571
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,833
- HEY, MINAMI.
WHAT'S UP?

572
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,875
- Fukuhara: QUESTION EIGHT.

573
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,625
WHAT WERE YOUR ASPIRATIONS
WHEN YOU ENTERED THE ACADEMY?

574
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,291
- Akihisa: I BELIEVED
THAT I WAS SPECIAL,

575
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,083
AND THAT ONE DAY OTHERS WOULD
REALIZE MY TRUE TALENTS.

576
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,666
- Fukuhara: GET REAL, KID.

577
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,125
- Akihisa: NEXT TIME,
ME, JAPAN, AND UNKNOWN WORDS!

578
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,083
- Fukuhara:
THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST.
