1
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:18,386
Enyaba, there's something
I'd like to ask you.

2
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:20,979
What does it mean to live?

3
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,031
It's to obtain all that one desires.

4
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:28,797
If you were to distill life into
its essence, that is what it would be.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,068
A lust for riches, a desire
for fame, food, love, and lovers,

6
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:35,958
that is life's goal.

7
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:40,139
But one must always fight to get what one wants.

8
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,792
Isn't that correct, Enyaba?

9
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:44,956
Indeed.

10
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:50,955
And if the battle is lost and one
fails to obtain what one desires most,

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,721
the result is frustration, pain, and a sense of failure.

12
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:59,461
One carries the wound into the
future, into the next fearful battle.

13
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:04,873
I believe conquering that fear once
and for all is what it means to live.

14
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:10,028
The one who stands at the
pinnacle is the one who has no fear.

15
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,207
Do you understand, Enyaba?

16
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:18,498
I was the one who told you about the
existence of your stand and how to use it.

17
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:21,049
Also you have an immortal body.

18
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,839
Is there anything you could possibly fear?

19
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,453
Perhaps, old woman.

20
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:28,561
Hmm. What burdens you, my lord?

21
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,093
The Joestar bloodline.

22
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,594
Hmm? Joestar? They worry you?

23
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,610
Those worms are mere trash.

24
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,432
Your enemies are no match for your stand.

25
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,663
Yes, but I must believe it's destiny

26
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,984
when the lives of those worms are
so thoroughly entangled with mine.

27
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,675
It is a fate that has been written
for us all from the very beginning.

28
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,064
Let me be clear.

29
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:53,881
It is not the Joestars that I fear,

30
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:57,241
but the fact that I can never
underestimate their bloodline.

31
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,800
In order to obliterate all fear,

32
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,831
I have decided that I must remove
the Joestars from the cogs of fate.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,066
You want to go and eliminate them yourself, simply
because you feel that they cannot be underestimated?

34
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,100
Yes.

35
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,347
Foolishness!

36
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,792
You should never engage in such trivial
matters! They are beneath someone of your stature!

37
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,275
I have sent seven stand users to command...

38
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:25,847
The empress, the wheel of fortune, the hanged
man and temperance, the emperor, and the devil...

39
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:29,190
All of them on the move and
ready to strike whenever you.

40
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:34,355
Thanks to these allies, you need
not take any action yourself, lord Dio.

41
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,520
A freighter.

42
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:22,845
I didn't see it at all.

43
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:27,058
Jotaro, something's bothering you, isn't it?

44
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,401
Are you worried there might be
another stand user on this freighter?

45
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,438
It's not ideal, but we could handle it.

46
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,551
Not quite. Strange they lowered the stairs,

47
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:39,070
but there's not a single soul
to be seen around here anywhere.

48
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:39,487
Eh?

49
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,996
This ship came all this way to rescue us.

50
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,442
There has to be some sort of crew on board.

51
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,576
Even if they're all stand users, I'm getting on this boat.

52
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,379
I'm done drifting in circles.

53
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,086
Hmm?

54
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,847
Take my hand, kid. I'll help you get up.

55
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:08,126
Um...

56
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:14,814
Blehh!

57
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,659
Good grief.

58
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,092
Hey, what's with this ship?

59
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,323
There's no captain in the control room,
there's no engineer in the radio room.

60
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:50,296
There's no one anywhere. And yet, look at this.

61
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,811
All the gauges and machinery are
working properly, just like normal.

62
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:57,356
Maybe they're just all in the
bathroom with a bad case of the runs.

63
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,510
Hey! Isn't anyone around?!

64
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,612
You have to see this. Come here! Quick!

65
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:02,232
Eh?

66
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,326
An ape. There's an ape inside that cage.

67
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,916
It's an orangutan.

68
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,335
Who the hell cares about a friggin' ape?!

69
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:20,296
Let's split up and find whoever's been feeding this thing.

70
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,270
Well?

71
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:39,850
Hmm.

72
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,386
It doesn't appear to be broken, but...

73
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,654
Uh...

74
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:45,863
Eh?

75
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:50,743
Avdol!

76
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,354
That sailor! Watch out!

77
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,463
Oh, good grief.

78
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:03,274
That isn't any way to greet a lady
you've never met before, now, is it?

79
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,112
But no one was touching the controls.

80
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,014
I saw that crane move,

81
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:11,806
even though there was no one operating it.

82
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,016
I don't believe in ghosts, but what the hell?

83
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:17,853
I saw it, too. That crane impaled him all on its own.

84
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:22,126
Keep your guard up. There's someone hostile here.

85
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,962
Hey, don't touch the machinery. You got that?

86
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:28,572
If it moves or runs on electricity,
don't lay a finger on it.

87
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,463
If you want to live, then you'll
do exactly as I tell you. Understand?

88
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:36,423
Get into the cabin below, and stay
there until I tell you otherwise.

89
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,588
Did any one of you see even a glimpse of a stand just now?

90
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,614
I didn't.

91
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:49,629
My apologies. I was the closest to
the crane, and yet I felt nothing.

92
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:51,360
I should have been able to sense something.

93
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,981
All right. I'll send Hierophant
Green to take a look around the ship.

94
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:05,609
I have no idea what's going on,

95
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,738
but scary things keep happening
whenever you guys are around.

96
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,656
Could you guys be jinxed?

97
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:13,823
I've heard about people who cause
disasters that endanger everyone.

98
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,433
If that's what you are, I'd better stay away.

99
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,230
I have just one bit of truth for you, so listen closely.

100
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,635
Whatever happens, we're on your side.

101
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,429
Uh... huh.

102
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,600
Stay safe. Make sure you stay with the others. Got it?

103
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:39,435
Mm-hmm.

104
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:15,817
Do you want me to open the cage for you?

105
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,405
But I can't. I have no idea where the key is,

106
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,857
and you're too big to let out.

107
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,855
You're giving me an apple?

108
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,399
But it doesn't make any sense.

109
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:31,320
This apple's been cut with a knife,
and the color hasn't really changed yet.

110
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:34,907
It looks totally fresh, like it was cut a second ago,

111
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:39,839
so I guess there really must be
someone hiding somewhere on this boat.

112
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,688
Where is the person who feeds you?
Has he gone off and left you here?

113
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:44,291
Huh?

114
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:46,505
Mmm.

115
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,093
Whoa. You're a pretty smart
monkey. Who trained you to do that?

116
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,981
No way. A monkey like you is actually into looking at...

117
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,705
Pinups of girls?

118
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:18,646
Hey, kid, be careful there.

119
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:23,241
They say an orangutan has five
times the strength of a normal human,

120
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,343
so it could easily rip off your arm.

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,794
Come on. Stay with us in the room on the other side.

122
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,713
Don't go off by yourself.

123
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:32,173
Oh, okay.

124
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:46,430
It's inconceivable.

125
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:51,734
I've had Hierophant Green search every inch of this
ship, but I can't find a single sign of human life aboard.

126
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:55,360
We've searched every pipe and
crevice, but still came up empty-handed.

127
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:58,407
Anything?

128
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,826
It's no use. I can't get a connection.

129
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,710
Well, try again, damn it.

130
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:10,628
Ehh, gross. I feel sticky from the salt water.

131
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,558
Huh? Hmm.

132
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:58,870
Huh?

133
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:58,652
Hey.

134
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,156
JoJo!

135
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,161
Take your lock, you stinking ape.

136
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:11,707
Seems that this ape...

137
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:13,855
Isn't your run-of-the-mill monkey.

138
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,790
Could it be that he's the one?

139
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,006
Ora!

140
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:27,196
Wait.

141
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,349
Who the hell ripped out that fan?

142
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:30,342
Had to be him.

143
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:33,395
So this ape's a stand user, but where's the stand?

144
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:36,190
I should be able to see the damn thing, but I can't.

145
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,712
Doesn't make any sense.

146
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:39,547
What the...

147
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:42,437
The steel propeller bent on its own, like it's alive.

148
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,986
JoJo.

149
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,175
Hey, what's going on here?

150
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,538
Son of a bitch.

151
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:54,458
There's no stand in sight, and somehow the window broke?

152
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:55,918
Star Platinum!

153
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:12,392
What's with this thing?

154
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,062
The ape just sank into the wall and disappeared.

155
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,940
Hey, you saw that, right?

156
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:21,485
Stay close to me. Something bad is going down.

157
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,113
The ape vanished into the wall,

158
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:27,908
but that orangutan has to be the stand user.

159
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:31,578
When I touched it earlier, I felt
a stand's energy coming from it.

160
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,759
I have no doubt that he's the one we're looking for.

161
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,375
Doesn't make any sense.

162
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,961
Why can't I see the stand, like I always do?

163
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:41,839
Wait.

164
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,774
What if I'm seeing it already?

165
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,327
What's happening?

166
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,181
Whoa. What's going on?

167
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,105
This isn't good.

168
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,222
It's swallowing us.

169
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:59,760
Is the freighter trying to... is
it possible the ship itself is...

170
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,818
So the stand is actually the freighter.

171
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,235
Damn. You son of a...

172
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,827
All of it,

173
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,956
this ship itself and everything
on it, is a gigantic stand!

174
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,458
The entire ship?

175
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:22,016
So there are stands that non-stand users,
like that girl and the crew members, can see?

176
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:25,052
The only possible explanation
for that is that its immense energy

177
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:27,593
is making it possible to be seen with the naked eye.

178
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:33,727
But all this must demand a tremendous amount
of energy to operate a stand as huge as this.

179
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,977
Kakyoin, send Hierophant Green to Jotaro.

180
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,663
He can help get us out of this.

181
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,606
I... can't do that.

182
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:43,415
It's got a firm hold on my stand, and I'm stuck.

183
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,797
This is what it means to face
death. We fell for this trap,

184
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,977
and now we're hopelessly
ensnared with no way to escape.

185
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:53,869
The pressure keeps increasing.

186
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,945
At this rate, our bodies are going to be pulverized.

187
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,691
We... will be...

188
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,542
Damn. We were careless.

189
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,044
We've got to...

190
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,015
The word that the was pointing to was "strength."

191
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:18,551
It means force, energy, power, or aid,

192
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:22,314
and it is the eighth card of the tarot deck.

193
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,486
It suggests challenge, a strong will, and hidden powers.

194
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,546
Damn ape. Thinks he's won already, huh?

195
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:50,634
"This entire ship is my stand, and you've lost.

196
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,442
"You're totally outmatched and
helpless, and there's nothing you can do."

197
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,114
Jotaro needed no explanation.

198
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:02,771
He knew exactly what the ape was saying.

199
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,829
Over here, monkey.

200
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:33,885
That button's not part of your stand.

201
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,759
Are you angry?

202
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,592
I guess it wounded your pride, since
you thought you'd already beaten us.

203
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,813
No, it's not hurt at all, is it?

204
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,858
Because apes like you don't have any pride.

205
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:56,538
That's exactly what makes you an ape and not a
man. What's going to hurt now... is your head!

206
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,577
Good grief.

207
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:24,811
I've heard that, when frightened, animals show
their stomachs to signal their submission to the enemy.

208
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,535
So you're asking me to forgive you?

209
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:34,279
I'm afraid your actions have already
gone beyond the rules of the jungle,

210
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,449
so I don't think so.

211
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,996
Ora!

212
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:53,965
What the... the pipes and walls are
distorting. The whole ship is twisting up.

213
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:56,430
Hey, be surprised about it later.

214
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,380
This ship is about to sink.

215
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,723
It's time to leave. Get back to the lifeboats.

216
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,232
Wow, I can't believe it.

217
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:14,486
The ship's shape is changing. It's
turning into a shabby little boat.

218
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,948
If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't believe it.

219
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,787
That ape was traveling the sea on his own stand.

220
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:25,960
What terrifying power. That was the
first time I've encountered such energy.

221
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:28,986
Hate to say it, but we were
completely overwhelmed this round.

222
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:32,838
If Jotaro hadn't figured it
out, we would have been done for.

223
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:38,051
Are we going to encounter even more
stands with crazy, unknown powers from now on?

224
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,262
We'll have to be ready for anything.

225
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,098
Hey, you want some gum?

226
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:46,101
So we're going to be drifting again.

227
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,482
Good grief. My cigarettes are soaked.

228
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,849
There'll be plenty of sun and
time for them to get dry, JoJo.

229
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:57,237
We'll have to pray that we get rescued
and reach Singapore safely and soon.

230
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,491
It's been four days since we left Japan.

231
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:05,078
There are 46 days until time runs out for the Joestars.

232
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:18,508
My lord, it would appear that Strength has been defeated.

233
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:25,716
But have no fear. The remaining six stand users
are all very powerful and each deadlier than the last,

234
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:30,303
and one of them is my son. His
right arm shall crush our enemies.

235
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,940
The Joestars will not pose a
threat when he's finished with them.

236
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,779
You are a strange old woman.

237
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,364
What is it that you desire the most?

238
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:46,828
Oh, but I've told you many times. My
only wish is to stay by your side, my lord.

239
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,998
Your guardian spirit has unbelievable power.

240
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:54,495
Your ability to escape trouble and
your strange life are the result of that.

241
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:02,219
I would like to see your life
unfold. It's the only thing I want.

242
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:11,112
Once upon a time, there was a prince from the land
of Sumatra who traveled the seas seeking new lands.

243
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:17,817
Eventually he happened upon an island inhabited by
lions called Singas, an island he named Singapura.

244
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,989
Today, its straits bustle with ships
and tankers from around the world.

245
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:28,787
This nation that shares both western and eastern
heritage, thanks to free trade, is tropical Singapore.

246
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,665
Good grief. We finally made it to dry land.

247
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:36,753
We'll clean up and get some rest at a hotel. Once
we've recharged, we'll figure out our route to Egypt.

248
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,327
All right, let's stay at that one.

249
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,670
All the old paintings on the tomb

250
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:17,838
They do the sand dance, don't you know

251
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:19,182
If they move too quick

252
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,318
Oh, whey, oh

253
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,636
They're falling down like a domino

254
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:25,004
All the bazaar men by the Nile

255
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,259
They got the money on a bet

256
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,705
Gold crocodiles

257
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,621
Oh, whey, oh

258
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:31,900
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

259
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:34,175
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

260
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,558
Whey, oh, whey, oh

261
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,095
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

262
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:43,708
Walk like an Egyptian.

263
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,721
The blond waitresses take their trays

264
00:22:57,746 --> 00:22:59,817
They spin around, and they cross the floor

265
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,091
They've got the moves

266
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:02,084
Oh, whey, oh

267
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:03,118
You drop your drink

268
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,619
Then they bring you more

269
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,889
All the school kids so sick of books

270
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:09,099
They like the punk and the metal band

271
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:10,526
When the buzzer rings

272
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:11,577
Oh, whey, oh

273
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,837
They're walking like an Egyptian

274
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,964
All the kids in the marketplace say

275
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,199
Whey, oh, whey, oh

276
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:23,004
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

277
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,781
Walk like an Egyptian
