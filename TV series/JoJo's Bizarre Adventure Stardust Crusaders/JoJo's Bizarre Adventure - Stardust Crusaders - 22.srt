1
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:10,577
I'm sure it's quite the traumatic
experience being eaten alive by your own sister.

2
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:16,843
Then again, when a man uncovers his deepest
desires, all of his weaknesses are laid bare.

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,614
You gave nary a thought to the depraved nature of
bringing someone back to the world of the living.

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,500
Everyone desperately wants to believe that
their loved ones are still alive somewhere.

5
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,525
More than anything else, your
hope is that, by some miracle,

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,968
they'll suddenly pop in tomorrow and say, "good morning."

7
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,951
Oh, before I forget,

8
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:44,146
I believe you said something about a third wish,
but, if I'm not mistaken, you've already made said wish.

9
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,058
You mean...

10
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:49,751
You wished for Avdol to come back to life!

11
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,507
Hail 2 U!

12
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,530
No. He's...

13
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,055
Avdol, it's me!

14
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,371
Av-Avdol, why?

15
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:12,537
My fingers, they've crumbled to pieces.

16
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,232
On your feet, Polnareff!

17
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,043
I blame you for all of this.

18
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,348
Because of your idiotic bumbling, I...

19
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:26,329
Polnareff, because of you, I ended up like this!

20
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,114
Avdol, you're right.

21
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,118
The person to blame for this...

22
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,866
is me!

23
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,839
Mark my words. You'll pay for this, Polnareff,

24
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,865
and you'll do it with your flesh!

25
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,391
I'll get better if I eat, right?

26
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,164
Well, am I right? Huh, big brother?!

27
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,935
What's the matter, brother?

28
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,936
S-Stay away! Stay away from me!

29
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,104
Both of you!

30
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,232
Please go back to your graves!

31
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:24,267
But why? You're the one who brought us back, aren't you?

32
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,637
The time has come for you to enter your grave!

33
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,644
I-I'm so panicked that I forgot to summon Chariot.

34
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:40,049
How could I have been so caught up in
my wish that I neglected to use my stand?

35
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:42,773
Leave me alone!

36
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:44,251
Get away from me!

37
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,562
Please, just stay away!

38
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,813
What the...

39
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:54,118
"Please"? Oh, no, no, no!

40
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:57,247
You don't have any wishes left, remember?!

41
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:04,206
I've already granted your three wishes.

42
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,942
And I'm sorry to say you don't get any more!

43
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,612
Stop it! Get off!

44
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,492
Hail 2 U!

45
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:26,880
Go ahead. Writhe and scream to
your pathetic heart's content.

46
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:31,045
Since you're in the middle of nowhere,
your friends by the shore won't hear you.

47
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,015
No one can save you now!

48
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:40,897
It's no use.

49
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:42,924
This is the end.

50
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,893
I'm going to die. I'm finished.

51
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,263
Sherry, Avdol...

52
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,442
I suppose you're giving me what I deserved.

53
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,150
It's only fitting.

54
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,534
It's like you said.

55
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:02,141
You died because of my actions...

56
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,544
And so I've accepted my fate.

57
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:18,024
Huh?

58
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,114
What? My vision must be going.

59
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,670
I'm seeing double.

60
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,935
It looks like there are two Avdols.

61
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:30,111
Huh?

62
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:34,552
Of course there's not another one.

63
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:37,309
If I'm starting to see things,

64
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,859
guess it means the end is near.

65
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,038
The blood loss is taking its toll.

66
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,279
I'm hallucinating.

67
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:48,424
All right, this is it.

68
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:50,974
I'll have to tap out early.

69
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,581
Goodbye, Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, Jotaro.

70
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,163
I pray for your victory.

71
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,285
As for you, Avdol,

72
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,633
I'll atone in the next world.

73
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:06,879
Hmm?

74
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,203
What? Impossible!

75
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,933
Huh? I was right!

76
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,023
I just knew I saw another Avdol!

77
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,866
My eyes weren't playing tricks!

78
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:26,031
Besides the dirt and dust version
Cameo made, there's another Avdol!

79
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,953
Magician's red!

80
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,352
But how?! He's supposed to be dead!

81
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:45,236
It's impossible! He was stabbed
by the Hanged Man, Centerfold!

82
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:47,524
How the hell is he alive?!

83
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:54,757
Tsk, tsk.

84
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,274
Are you really Mohammed Avdol?!

85
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:00,188
Yes, you had better believe I am!

86
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,233
Is it really you?

87
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,731
Tsk, tsk.

88
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:07,968
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

89
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,401
I-Is it the real you, I mean?

90
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,840
Polnareff, you haven't changed in the slightest.

91
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:22,798
You still lose all common sense when it comes to
your sister and never stop to think of the consequences.

92
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:27,334
I simply refuse to accept this! Mohammad Avdol is dead!

93
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:32,248
I was told Hol Horse put a bullet between your
eyes after Hanged Man sunk his blade into your back

94
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:33,803
and you died on the spot!

95
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,140
You're correct about me being shot,

96
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,832
right in the forehead.

97
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:44,774
That said, because I was stabbed in the
back, for a moment, my face was looking up,

98
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,984
and the bullet only grazed me.

99
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:52,132
I suppose this is what one
would call a blessing in disguise.

100
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:56,152
Hol Horse didn't realize it, but his
bullet never made contact with my brain,

101
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,076
so he didn't inflict a mortal wound.

102
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:02,276
He was only able to scratch my skin and bruise my skull.

103
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,478
Although I did completely lose consciousness.

104
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,151
So you call yourself Cameo of the judgment card.

105
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,226
Hell is near, so prepare...

106
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,103
For hell 2 U!

107
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:25,784
I know it was only the third wish, but still...

108
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,678
It's really him.

109
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,937
It came true!

110
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:44,441
Mohammed Avdol is indeed alive and well.

111
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,779
I would call this bad news.

112
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,905
That being the case, shouldn't you scurry away to inform

113
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,298
Dio and your fellow stand user
compatriots about my return?

114
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,899
Well, shouldn't you, Cameo?

115
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,116
That's right!

116
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,557
I have to tell them!

117
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:06,380
I have to let Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin,
and Jotaro know! Avdol's back!

118
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:12,661
This is very surprising news, to be sure,
but the way I see it, I can spin it this way.

119
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:16,357
Not only did judgment's Cameo slay the idiot Polnareff,

120
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,075
but also succeeded in eliminating
Avdol, who was actually alive!

121
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,563
Oh, I can't wait to tell them the splendid news!

122
00:10:25,813 --> 00:10:27,359
Magician's red!

123
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:31,984
Whoa, there.

124
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:38,846
Avdol!

125
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:42,743
This stand...

126
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,118
It's far more powerful than I expected.

127
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,233
Be careful. It's not just his power.

128
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,485
This guy's got incredible speed, too.

129
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:54,444
Come now, Avdol. Is that the extent of your abilities?

130
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,592
If so, then sharing my good news
will be even easier than expected.

131
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,094
May fortune...

132
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,497
Be with you both!

133
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:10,874
What now?!

134
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,472
Hail 2 U!

135
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,442
Big brother...

136
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,866
No, stop this charade. You're not the real Sherry.

137
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:30,163
My Sherry is gone, dead!

138
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,021
You're nothing but...

139
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,430
A hunk of dirt!

140
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,852
But, brother...

141
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,117
Polnareff.

142
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:58,471
Apologies. I would like to take back
what I said about you not changing.

143
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,210
No, you were right about me all along.

144
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,246
I'm the one who should apologize.

145
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,445
This battle has already been decided.

146
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,451
Tell you what, Avdol.

147
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,468
Before you head off for that magic lamp in the sky,

148
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,753
I'd like to hear your three wishes.

149
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,021
I'll grant them before I put you to rest for good.

150
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,938
Go ahead. You may as well give it a shot.

151
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,999
As I said, you get three wishes.

152
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:39,794
Quel salaud. He's making fools of us!

153
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,336
Just ignore him, Avdol.

154
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,377
You don't have to make any wishes!

155
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:46,588
Avdol, are you listening to me?

156
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,772
No good.

157
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,811
I want four wishes!

158
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:55,693
Huh?!

159
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:56,924
What?

160
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,577
My wishes. Can't you hear?

161
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,606
I'm asking you to grant my wishes,
only I want four instead of three.

162
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,085
Tsk, tsk.

163
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,756
Avdol, you can't be serious.

164
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,464
Are you denying my wish?!

165
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:15,492
Cameo, you're the one who offered to grant them!

166
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:18,219
I'm going to make sure you keep your promise!

167
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,165
You still insist upon this futile contest of power?

168
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,954
Your kicks are nothing!

169
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:29,331
What?!

170
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,639
That's the way! Super!

171
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,929
Tsk, tsk.

172
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:42,631
You should probably know that my first
wish was to make you cry out in agony,

173
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,920
and it came true.

174
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:46,946
This is madness.

175
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,860
How can you be so much stronger than before?

176
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:54,905
The wound left behind after I was stabbed by
the Hanged Man hasn't completely healed yet.

177
00:13:55,612 --> 00:14:00,673
Because I was so focused on guarding my wound
from an assault, I had to hold myself back a little.

178
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:01,666
What?

179
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,764
It was only three days ago that
I was finally able to stand again.

180
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,490
But since I took a plane here
from India, the trip was very easy.

181
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,556
That's Avdol, still the best.

182
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,663
And now for my second wish!

183
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,691
I wish for you to scream out in utter terror.

184
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,105
And while you're at it, grant my third wish!

185
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:28,090
Cry in regret!

186
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,502
That bastard!

187
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:36,893
He's running away!

188
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,324
Wait, damn it! Get back here!

189
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,127
Shh. Polnareff, quiet.

190
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,570
With that kind of power and speed,

191
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,065
given the rule of stands, the user must be hiding
somewhere nearby, supplying his stand with energy.

192
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,356
Is he here?

193
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,667
Yes, he should be hiding out very close to us.

194
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,608
Hey, could that be...

195
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:13,528
Shh.

196
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,531
Shh.

197
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:42,350
Has this user really resorted to hiding underground?

198
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:43,415
Damn coward.

199
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,465
How dare you use my sister like some pawn in a game?

200
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,504
For what you've done, I think I'll show you hell.

201
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,492
Hell 2 U.

202
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,321
Connard.

203
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:00,401
I can think of a few things to drop down this tube,

204
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,371
like dirt and sand...

205
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,263
A spider...

206
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:06,503
Ants, too...

207
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,672
And a match.

208
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,588
Bastard. I hope you're ready,
because your suffering has barely begun.

209
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,375
Hey, Polnareff.

210
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:25,340
I do believe it's time for me to drain the snake.

211
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:25,930
Huh?

212
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,614
How about it, my friend?

213
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,901
Shall we engage in the timeless ritual of male bonding?

214
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:32,744
Hmm. Tsk, tsk.

215
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,373
Huh?

216
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:35,532
Oh.

217
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:41,405
Somehow I made it out of that mess alive.

218
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,172
Huh?

219
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,351
Come on, Polnareff. Let me hear you laugh!

220
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,111
Uh...

221
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:54,588
I want to hear the heartiest laugh that you can muster!

222
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:01,802
Avdol, I might be wrong about this, but
it seems like you're the one who's changed.

223
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,521
Before the incident, you would have never
thought of doing something quite so perverse.

224
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:07,183
This...

225
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,644
This isn't a result of you being shot in the head, is it?

226
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,082
That's it! Aim that thing!

227
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:19,384
Right!

228
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:25,870
Huh?

229
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:27,122
What the...

230
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:32,882
Please I beg you, forgive me!

231
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:33,583
Huh?

232
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:40,612
Last, but not least, my fourth wish is to not
grant you a single one of your pitiful wishes.

233
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,474
My magician's red forgives no one, especially not you.

234
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:52,507
Ba-dum-tss!

235
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,841
Hey! You guys'll never believe it!

236
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,992
Guess who I ran into while out and about?!

237
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:07,010
Polnareff, we were worried about you.

238
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,843
Where did those injuries come from?

239
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,511
Some kind of enemy?

240
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,934
My wounds are nothing compared to my news!

241
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,674
Now listen up, and don't be too shocked, Jotaro!

242
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,799
And you're gonna have to promise you won't
throw your back out in surprise, Kakyoin.

243
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,498
Who do you think I met out there, Mr. Joestar?

244
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:23,133
Huh?

245
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,422
Now prepare to be blown away!

246
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,661
Tum-ta-da-da!

247
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,909
Here he is!

248
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:35,745
That sly bastard Avdol was still alive! Isn't that great?!

249
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,077
Well, we should probably get going.

250
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,533
Here. Allow me to help you carry your luggage.

251
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,184
Avdol, how you been doing?

252
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,782
It's been a while. How goes it?

253
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,857
So, Avdol, is the wound on your back healing up all right?

254
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,824
It's fine, though my joints
do get a little stiff sometimes.

255
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,471
Hey!

256
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,555
Has it really been two weeks since we last saw each other?

257
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,087
Hey!

258
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,787
We're lucky to all be alive.

259
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,099
Jotaro, you're still wearing your uniform?

260
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:03,284
Don't you ever get hot?

261
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,754
Hey, just hold on a second, guys!

262
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:12,626
Didn't you hear me?! I told you
to hold on a second, you assholes!

263
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,161
What's the deal with those laissez-faire attitudes?!

264
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,964
A man we thought was dead just waltzed onto the beach!

265
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,500
How the hell can you just brush it
off and act like nothing has changed?!

266
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,097
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that, Polnareff.

267
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:28,018
When I told you I'd taken it
upon myself to bury Avdol in India,

268
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,748
I may have lied.

269
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,995
Wh-wh-what the hell?!

270
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:36,643
Mr. Joestar and Jotaro were
the ones who tended to the wounds

271
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:40,001
on my head back in India
after I was shot by Hol Horse.

272
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:45,310
You assholes have known Avdol was alive the entire time,

273
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:48,813
and never once did it cross any of
your deceitful minds to let me know?!

274
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,854
I'm most surprised at you, Kakyoin!

275
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,413
I only found out the day after it all happened.

276
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,147
But it was imperative to not let the enemy know,
and since you have such a big mouth, I suggested...

277
00:19:58,576 --> 00:19:58,979
Pardon.

278
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:04,536
What I meant to say was since it's not easy for you to
lie on command, I suggested we keep it a secret from you.

279
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:08,111
If you'd let the secret slip,

280
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:11,090
Avdol wouldn't have been able to recuperate in peace.

281
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:14,370
We were planning to let you know the
very moment we knew that he was safe,

282
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,936
but we didn't think you'd run into him first.

283
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:21,274
Oh, yeah. Avdol, we found your
dad living in a hut on this island!

284
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,856
Come on. Let's let him know you're here!

285
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:25,366
Oh, that was just me in disguise.

286
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:28,250
Say what?!

287
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,898
Then you were in on it from the very start?

288
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,488
Everything that happened was a ruse you created?

289
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:38,848
Don't talk to me! No one ever comes to
visit when they have good news to report!

290
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,375
Just shut up!

291
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,530
Don't go there. Avdol's death wasn't your fault.

292
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:46,532
You didn't have to go that far!

293
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,464
How dare you leave me out of the loop?!

294
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:51,287
I think that's the cruelest thing you've ever done to me!

295
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:54,313
Now, now, chin up. There's no reason for you to cry.

296
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,799
I'm sorry, Polnareff. I truly
didn't think you'd be this hurt.

297
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,611
I apologize as well,

298
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:04,499
but I had a very good reason for
coming to this island in disguise.

299
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:05,602
Yeah? What is it?

300
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,987
It was partially so the enemy wouldn't find out,

301
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:11,781
but I also had Avdol do some
shopping for me while he was laying low.

302
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,561
What kind of shopping?

303
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,326
Since it was a very conspicuous acquisition,

304
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:19,567
I disguised myself as a wealthy Arab gentlemen.

305
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,506
All right, everyone, let's climb aboard and head out!

306
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,870
Come on, Polnareff. For the love of
everything that's sacred, cheer up already.

307
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:28,419
Huh?

308
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:30,000
It's almost here. Look.

309
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:32,160
I don't understand. What's almost here?

310
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,599
I don't see anything!

311
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:36,784
What?!

312
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:45,046
Whoa! A submarine?!

313
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,979
That's right.

314
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:49,853
From here on out, we're riding to Egypt in this.

315
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:52,252
Y-You've gotta be kidding!

316
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,001
How did you afford this?!

317
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,480
All the old paintings on the tomb

318
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,648
They do the sand dance, don't you know

319
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:18,992
If they move too quick

320
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,128
Oh, whey, oh

321
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,446
They're falling down like a domino

322
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:24,814
All the bazaar men by the Nile

323
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,069
They got the money on a bet

324
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:28,515
Gold crocodiles

325
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,431
Oh, whey, oh

326
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:31,710
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

327
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:33,985
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

328
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,368
Whey, oh, whey, oh

329
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:39,905
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

330
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,518
Walk like an Egyptian.

331
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,531
The blond waitresses take their trays

332
00:22:57,556 --> 00:22:59,627
They spin around, and they cross the floor

333
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:00,901
They've got the moves

334
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:01,894
Oh, whey, oh

335
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:02,928
You drop your drink

336
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,429
Then they bring you more

337
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:06,699
All the school kids so sick of books

338
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,909
They like the punk and the metal band

339
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,336
When the buzzer rings

340
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,387
Oh, whey, oh

341
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:13,647
They're walking like an Egyptian

342
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,774
All the kids in the marketplace say

343
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,009
Whey, oh, whey, oh

344
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:22,814
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

345
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,591
Walk like an Egyptian
