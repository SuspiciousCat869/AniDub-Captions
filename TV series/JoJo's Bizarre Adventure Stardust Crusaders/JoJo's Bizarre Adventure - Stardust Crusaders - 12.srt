1
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:14,238
My son, my precious boy has been murdered!

2
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:22,723
I can sense the misfortune that has befallen my son.

3
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:26,083
The bond between mother and son has spoken!

4
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:48,352
My precious, beautiful boy, you died
covered with wounds like this? Those bastards.

5
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:54,010
I can feel it. I suffer the same pain you felt!

6
00:00:54,852 --> 00:01:00,460
You were utterly magnificent as you
fought for lord Dio, my dear Centerfold.

7
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,497
How? How did they do it?

8
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:07,236
To kill such a noble and pure soul like you,

9
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:12,284
they must have done something underhanded!

10
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,855
Damn them!

11
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:20,587
The bastards!

12
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:24,536
I will make sure they pay a
terrifying price with the empress card!

13
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,754
They'll regret the day they were born!

14
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:30,042
Move!

15
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,444
I won't stand idle.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,312
This is the time for action, a time for
vengeance with the stand that brings a slow death!

17
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:46,405
Oh, the anguish, the pain!

18
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,858
I shall kill them all!

19
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,964
JoJo and crew head to the sacred city, Varanasi.

20
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,213
Listen up.

21
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,516
I don't usually get on a soapbox like this,

22
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,773
but stupid people are just that.

23
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,285
You could repeat something a million
times over, and they still won't listen.

24
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:44,827
You know the type, don't you?

25
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:47,226
There's just no helping the poor souls.

26
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:51,785
But you know, uh... hold on. I never got your name, did I?

27
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:53,510
Nena.

28
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,361
Nena! That's a great name.

29
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:59,842
Daughter of a wealthy family in the sacred
city Varanasi that we're passing through, right?

30
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,822
You're good-looking, and you've got
an equally good head on your shoulders.

31
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,625
I have an eye for people...

32
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,675
which leads me to my point.

33
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,941
Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard, understand?

34
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,610
He was manipulating you.

35
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,542
Think how your parents would feel.

36
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:17,480
You hear me?

37
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:21,690
You can't end up like this, okay? I
know it's easy when you're in love,

38
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,098
but you can't afford to see
the world with such a narrow view.

39
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:28,022
Take a step back, and look at the whole picture.

40
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:28,722
Hey.

41
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:29,051
Eh?

42
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,456
We're almost there...

43
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,125
The city of Varanasi.

44
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,147
The sacred river, the Ganges...

45
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:44,462
A place for holy men, the old and the sick,

46
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:51,723
where domestic animals and food for human consumption
lie alongside human waste and corpses for cremation.

47
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:55,401
The river embraces all.

48
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,432
From birth unto death, its holy
waters form a microcosm of life.

49
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:10,521
It is said that visitors of the sacred city of
Varanasi remain transfixed, never wanting to leave.

50
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,890
Perhaps the landscape that is this sacred land

51
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,789
is a mirror unto the soul.

52
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:30,711
Hmm?

53
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:32,497
Man...

54
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,633
This thing isn't getting any better.

55
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,899
What's wrong, old man?

56
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,321
You don't look well.

57
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:43,545
Uh-uh.

58
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:46,325
Looks like my bug bite just got a lot worse.

59
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,994
This thing must be infected.

60
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,926
It's definitely swollen.

61
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,453
It would be best to have a doctor
look at it before it gets worse.

62
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:57,161
Hey, doesn't that sort of look like a person's face?

63
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,087
Stop kidding around, Polnareff. That's creepy.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,977
Sorry about that.

65
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:03,797
Want me to go to the hospital with you?

66
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,449
No! Stop treating me like an old man.

67
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,206
Hmm.

68
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,684
I'll just lance this.

69
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,677
Huh? What did you say?

70
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,686
It's definitely infected now.

71
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,182
It'll get worse if we don't drain the fluid.

72
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:26,168
Hey, hey, hey. Can't we just put medicine
and a bandage on it and call it a day?

73
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:27,686
Don't worry, my friend.

74
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,086
We'll numb the area so it won't hurt.

75
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:33,732
No problem. No problem at all.

76
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,664
Come, now. Lie down.

77
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,645
Sir, I studied medicine in England.

78
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,093
I can do appendectomies, too.

79
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,716
Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.

80
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:46,382
Eh?

81
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:47,876
Well, that's no problem.

82
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:52,516
All right.

83
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,009
Let's slice it open.

84
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:58,092
Eh, come on. I don't wanna watch
it being cut open. Have a heart.

85
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,633
It'll be fine.

86
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,054
Hey, are you done yet?

87
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,008
Can I open my eyes now?

88
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:13,819
Huh?

89
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,316
What the...

90
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:23,442
Hey, doctor...

91
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,921
Trying to cut me off?

92
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:29,164
That's a pretty stupid move, you old fart.

93
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:39,070
Chu-mi-min!

94
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:41,165
What the... what the hell is this?!

95
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:48,695
I am the Empress, as in the empress card, old
man Joseph, and now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!

96
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,344
When did you get on me, damn it?!

97
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,601
No way! This thing's got teeth?!

98
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:58,709
Damn thing's strong.

99
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,937
No! It grabbed the scalpel!

100
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,349
Oh, no!

101
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:09,217
Thank goodness that was my artificial hand.

102
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,864
Bastard! Think you can just cut me?

103
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:15,215
I'm a part of your body now, old man Joseph.

104
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:19,427
You can't get away from me,
honey, no matter how hard you try.

105
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,768
You know, I bet I can tell you what's
going through that thick skull of yours.

106
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:28,372
You're probably thinking something
like, "Only a stand can beat another stand.

107
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:32,731
"My stand, Hermit Purple, has the
power of clairvoyance and remote viewing,

108
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,399
but how am I supposed to fight
something like this with those powers?"

109
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:40,593
"How can I destroy something
that's growing out of my own arm?"

110
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,493
So, honey, was that spot on?

111
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:44,981
Where's the user?!

112
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:47,213
How in the hell could you have infected me?!

113
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,159
You moron, I won't tell.

114
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,068
Disgusting freak.

115
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:57,469
Running off to your friends?

116
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,668
We'll see how that goes, won't we?

117
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,545
Doctor, your next patient is waiting for you.

118
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,617
Doctor!

119
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,512
Uh, hey, don't get the wrong idea. I didn't...

120
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:14,771
I killed him!

121
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:20,173
I'm Joseph Joestar, an American.
I'm staying at hotel Clarks.

122
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:20,722
What?

123
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,573
And by the way, girlie,

124
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,399
I have a thing for hot young nurses like
yourself. I think I should give you an exam.

125
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,089
What?!

126
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,330
M-Murderer!

127
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,024
Wait! It's not true!

128
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:34,905
Oh, no.

129
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,309
Now you can't go back to the hotel.

130
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:55,319
You're all alone now, honey.

131
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:58,010
I can kill you without anyone interfering.

132
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,125
You little...

133
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,243
you're pissing me off!

134
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,528
I'll crush you to tiny bits!

135
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:05,435
What?

136
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:08,222
Hey, this is your own arm.

137
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:11,081
Take care of it, you shitty old man.

138
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,929
It grew arms.

139
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,918
How much more could it grow?

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,553
Eh?

141
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:20,906
What the hell?

142
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:24,107
Let go of it! I mean it, freak, now!

143
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,410
Not a chance.

144
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:29,525
Hey, officer, the murderer's over here!

145
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,821
He's right here!

146
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,435
It's been a while since it's come to this.

147
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:37,986
Hey, what are you doing?

148
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,351
Overdrive!

149
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:47,919
Eh?

150
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,047
Moron!

151
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,820
It's your arm, remember?

152
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,718
You think your hamon would work against your own body?

153
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,665
Hands up! Don't move!

154
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,937
Then how about Hermit Purple?!

155
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,042
Y-You're crushing me.

156
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:08,574
I can use it this way, too, so how does it feel, ugly?

157
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,592
I told you not to move. Now freeze!

158
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:14,079
Stop, criminal!

159
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:16,215
Damn it.

160
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:18,035
What are you doing? I can't see.

161
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,330
Shit. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

162
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,074
Do you get what I'm telling you, Nena?

163
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:41,704
Real men don't have to talk a big
game like your six-shooting boyfriend.

164
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,763
That's how you figure out who's a
liar and who's the genuine article.

165
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,467
Damn cops have run me in the wrong direction.

166
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:52,477
I'm nowhere near the hotel now.

167
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:56,402
If I had known this would happen, I
would have taken Polnareff with me.

168
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,301
Instead of a petty guy like Hol Horse,

169
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,296
why not be with me? Am I not your type?

170
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,044
Hmm.

171
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,182
Come on.

172
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,240
I don't dwell on the past like some.

173
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,862
I don't care who you were dating before, even Hol Horse.

174
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,816
What's important is the future.

175
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,572
We just need to understand each other, right?

176
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,623
Oh, look over there, Polnareff.

177
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,354
Hmm.

178
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,233
That place is a hotel run by a
nice Japanese woman named Kumiko.

179
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:23,090
Huh?

180
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,276
She manages it with her Indian husband.

181
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:27,141
We can probably get a cheap room.

182
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:29,122
Oh, really? Huh.

183
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,814
Tell me more about this hotel.

184
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,419
Huh?

185
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,051
Wha...

186
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,761
What the hell are you doing?!

187
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:54,327
Huh?

188
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,830
Chu-mi-min!

189
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,269
I'm eating, Joestar.

190
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:00,526
A growing girl needs her food.

191
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,855
You stole those at the market, you quick little bastard.

192
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:06,390
Ahh!

193
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,686
Eh? Why, you...

194
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,144
Chu-mi-min.

195
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,225
Look how big I've gotten.

196
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:21,668
It's tough having another mouth to feed, isn't it, daddy?

197
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:22,828
Chu-mi-min.

198
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:25,273
You disgusting little cow!

199
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:32,489
I'll show you that nobody has the experience or
the smarts to take down the great Joseph Joestar.

200
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,777
You don't stand a chance, you bastard.

201
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,906
Now how the hell am I gonna do that? Damn it.

202
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,433
Here goes nothing.

203
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:40,978
Hermit Purple!

204
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,586
Oh, daddy dearest, you've done
a wonderful job of raising me.

205
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:55,712
But you know, you shouldn't tie your children
down, or they won't grow. It only smothers them.

206
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,786
You should raise them to be
free. If not, they might rebel.

207
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,471
Oh, no!

208
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,478
It's no use.

209
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:13,270
If I had a camera, I could use Hermit Purple
to get a picture of the stand user's location.

210
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,471
Damn it all!

211
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,901
Come on, think, Joseph. Think.

212
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,554
At this rate, it won't just be my arm.

213
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:23,057
She'll take over my whole body.

214
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:25,122
Huh?

215
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:28,636
Huh?

216
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:33,489
I've already grown enough that I
could easily end your pathetic life.

217
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:37,294
See? My hand can reach your throat now, old man.

218
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:42,720
I just have to bust your carotid artery, and
you'll crumple over like a sack of potatoes.

219
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:54,405
Oh, no!

220
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,817
What's he doing?

221
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:07,823
Bastard!

222
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,588
He's lost his mind.

223
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,478
Look at that.

224
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:13,925
Some very strange man has a strange growth on his arm.

225
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,176
Damn it!

226
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:19,487
Where the hell's the stand user?

227
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,001
I have to tell you something.

228
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:27,566
Huh?

229
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,792
I need a reliable man, a good
man like you to take care of me,

230
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:34,437
and I... I love you, Polnareff.

231
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,092
Such a kindhearted, trustworthy man you are.

232
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,974
Uh, really? But it's all so sudden.

233
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,828
This is happening. I have
finally found one. Eeh! Lucky. Eeh!

234
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:50,219
Huh?

235
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,202
Hey, Joseph Joestar,

236
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:26,437
you idiot, you keep getting farther
and farther from Jotaro and the others.

237
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,006
Do you really think I'm just running around town randomly?

238
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:33,199
I'm not doing this just to wear myself out, you know.

239
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:33,899
Wha?

240
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,473
I'm running so I can kill you!

241
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,428
This is the end of the line!

242
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:40,842
See that?

243
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,836
You're going in! Have a nice soak!

244
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:45,853
Hah!

245
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,251
You senile, old fool!

246
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:58,760
A nail?

247
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:04,542
Yeah, I picked it up earlier when you were
rolling around on the ground like an idiot.

248
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:09,867
Now I can shove it right in your carotid,
and you'll bleed out like a stuck pig.

249
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:14,831
Did you actually believe I'd suffocate
if you stuck me in here, you fool?

250
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,524
Die!

251
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,087
I may be made of your flesh, but I'm nothing like you.

252
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:25,240
Forget the rules already, chump?

253
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,974
Only a stand can hope to defeat another stand.

254
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:34,162
Oh, yeah, didn't you say you were gonna
show me all that fighting experience you have?

255
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:37,546
Was I supposed to be impressed? Some plan.

256
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:42,320
You're just a helpless geezer who's
gotten too old to help anyone, even himself.

257
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:47,525
My prosthetic hand, it was on the
verge of breaking from her attack earlier,

258
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,924
and now I can't get any strength into it.

259
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,157
Just one more push.

260
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:55,638
Your life as an invalid is about
to come to an end. Chu-mi-min.

261
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,443
There's not a single way you can defeat me.

262
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,691
You might as well surrender.

263
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:01,564
Eh?

264
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:06,878
What the hell is this?

265
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:15,183
Huh?

266
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,000
I might as well what now?

267
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,418
I'm sorry. My hearing isn't exactly what it once was.

268
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,057
Run that by me one more time, will you?

269
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,662
It's coal tar!

270
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,704
That was your plan all along.

271
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,579
It wasn't to suffocate me.

272
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,123
You were trying to keep me from moving!

273
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,726
But how?

274
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:39,959
How did you know there was coal tar in there?

275
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,926
With my stand's power. Hermit Purple told me everything.

276
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,163
H-Hey, everyone, look.

277
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:50,145
What is this?

278
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,863
The ashes that foreigner spilled
everywhere when he wrecked the place.

279
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,559
They've formed into a perfect map of the city.

280
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:02,602
You drew a map with Hermit Purple?

281
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:07,378
That's how you found the tar, a map out of incense ashes?

282
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:08,921
Yeah.

283
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:14,068
Now I think even a glorified pimple like you
should see the difference in our fighting experience.

284
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:18,334
When your opponent starts boasting, he's already lost.

285
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:21,683
That, shrew, is a line from my wilder days.

286
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:25,094
Like a fine wine, I guess I just get better with age.

287
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,263
And now...

288
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,155
A stand will defeat another stand.

289
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,342
Next you'll say, "please stop it. I beg you."

290
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:35,588
Please, just stop it. I beg you!

291
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,999
This will hurt me as much as it hurts you,

292
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:44,605
but children can't depend on their parents forever.

293
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:50,986
Once you've grown up, you've
gotta learn to live on your own!

294
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:00,703
Now then...

295
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,808
I wonder where that thing's stand user is hiding.

296
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:13,549
Uh, so what do you say, Nena, darling?

297
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:17,791
Shall we seal our new love with a sweet kiss?

298
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,501
What the hell is this?! It's nasty! Ugh!

299
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:27,328
What's wrong, Nena?

300
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:43,205
So she was the empress's stand user all along.

301
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:43,697
Huh?

302
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,700
She was an ugly old troll.

303
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:50,829
She attached her stand to me as a tumor with a human face

304
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,418
and camouflaged herself as a beautiful woman.

305
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,112
You were careless.

306
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:58,094
She played you like a damn fiddle, Polnareff.

307
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:21,850
And here I thought we'd finally
be able to sleep in a bed for once.

308
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:25,956
If the old man hadn't screwed up, we
wouldn't be out here hiding from the cops.

309
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,720
I took care of things.

310
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:30,023
We can take this car.

311
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,635
Polnareff, you do the driving.

312
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,521
What?

313
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,609
Don't tell me you're still in shock.

314
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:39,874
I was the one who was attacked by the stand.

315
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:43,282
Sure, but I think I'd rather have gone through that.

316
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:15,585
All the old paintings on the tomb

317
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,753
They do the sand dance, don't you know

318
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,097
If they move too quick

319
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:20,233
Oh, whey, oh

320
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:22,551
They're falling down like a domino

321
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,919
All the bazaar men by the Nile

322
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,174
They got the money on a bet

323
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,620
Gold crocodiles

324
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:29,536
Oh, whey, oh

325
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,815
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

326
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,090
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

327
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,473
Whey, oh, whey, oh

328
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:40,010
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

329
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,623
Walk like an Egyptian.

330
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:57,636
The blond waitresses take their trays

331
00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:59,732
They spin around, and they cross the floor

332
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,006
They've got the moves

333
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:01,999
Oh, whey, oh

334
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,033
You drop your drink

335
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,534
Then they bring you more

336
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,804
All the school kids so sick of books

337
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:09,014
They like the punk and the metal band

338
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,441
When the buzzer rings

339
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:11,492
Oh, whey, oh

340
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,752
They're walking like an Egyptian

341
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,879
All the kids in the marketplace say

342
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:18,114
Whey, oh, whey, oh

343
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,919
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

344
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,696
Walk like an Egyptian
