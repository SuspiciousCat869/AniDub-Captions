1
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:25,861
No way! We got it. That treasure's been at
the bottom of the ocean for a hundred years,

2
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,688
and now whatever's in it is ours.

3
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:28,911
Hey, stay calm.

4
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:31,168
We gotta get it on the boat before we start celebrating.

5
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:32,851
Yeah, I know. I know.

6
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,232
Up we go.

7
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:37,253
That thing looks too long and
narrow to be a treasure chest.

8
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,834
Just do your job! You're lifting it too high.

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,400
Okay, on three.

10
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:45,163
One, two, three.

11
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:46,866
All right.

12
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,320
Come on. Crack it open already.

13
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,295
Hold on. Wait. This is bizarre.

14
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:53,500
It seems like this thing was locked from the inside.

15
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:55,766
Who the hell cares? Just bust it open.

16
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,212
Just give me a sec. Something's written on it.

17
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,464
D-I-O, "Dio."

18
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,449
Is that someone's name?

19
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:04,624
I don't care!

20
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:06,361
Just freakin' open it up!

21
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:10,212
The sun's about to go down, and don't
wanna be countin' treasure in the dark.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,872
Okay, I hear you.

23
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,394
I'm gonna go get the blowtorch.

24
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,903
And then we can start dividin' up our loot.

25
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:24,609
On a day like any other, a motorboat
was found adrift and abandoned.

26
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:28,798
The craft was largely undamaged
and showed no signs of struggle.

27
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:33,976
In the galley, three cups of coffee sat half full,

28
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:40,521
and on deck, an iron chest, its
lock melted away, lay open and empty.

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,062
But the chest's unusual shelter-like chambers

30
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:46,932
baffled discoverers,

31
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:50,698
who believed it to have once contained a vast treasure.

32
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:56,109
But interest waned, and before
long, the chest was forgotten.

33
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,280
Jotaro Kujo, 17 years old and 195 centimeters tall.

34
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:11,580
His father is a Japanese jazz musician, currently on tour.

35
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:15,461
His mother is an American of British decent.

36
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:19,410
Yes, all of that is correct,
and Jotaro is definitely my son.

37
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:21,549
It seems like all his friends call him JoJo.

38
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:26,067
Guess they decided to take the Jo from his first
name and the Jo from his last name and combine 'em.

39
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,230
Ah, man, that's really lame.

40
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,243
I... I need to know.

41
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,488
Exactly how many people did Jotaro kill?!

42
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:35,315
No! I take it back! I don't want to know!

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,180
Settle down. Nobody said
anything about him killin' people.

44
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,978
He got into a fight. That's all.

45
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:44,244
The truth is, the thugs he tangled with
were all armed with nunchuks and knives.

46
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:50,789
He fought four punks, one being an ex-boxer, and he
broke 15 of their bones, and he busted their balls.

47
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:52,311
Sorry if that was crude.

48
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:54,051
He put all of them in the hospital.

49
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:57,608
Things could have gone a lot worse. He's
gotta be shown the severity of his actions.

50
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,681
Okay.

51
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,406
The real issue is what happened afterward.

52
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,704
Copy this, and pass it around.

53
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,370
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:06,364
I gotta tell you, that son of yours is a strange one.

55
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,193
Huh?

56
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,236
Okay, follow me. I'll show you the way.

57
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,462
Thank you for everything.

58
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,113
Look, you can thank me by takin' your kid home.

59
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:17,354
So then, does that mean you're releasing him?

60
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,824
Well, we can't keep him in here forever.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,443
Okay.

62
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:24,421
By the way, ma'am, I have to tell
you your Japanese is really quite good.

63
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,647
Just how long have you been livin' in Japan?

64
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:28,101
For 20 years now.

65
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,722
Well, that explains it, then.

66
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:30,781
Good work, men.

67
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:32,988
This place has been overrun lately.

68
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,271
We got an entire backlog of criminals
that we aren't even able to find cells for.

69
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,891
We're almost there, ma'am. Your son's just up ahead.

70
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,418
Jotaro!

71
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:45,739
Jotaro, throw the ball to mom.

72
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,703
That's it. Good boy.

73
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,944
Do your best at that track meet tomorrow.

74
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:52,715
I will.

75
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,461
Jotaro.

76
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,673
You did it. Let's go out to eat and celebrate.

77
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,778
Nothing's as good as your cooking, mom.

78
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,239
Jotaro.

79
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:02,916
Jotaro.

80
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,386
Jotaro.

81
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,974
Jotaro!

82
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,165
Jotaro!

83
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,866
Shut up!

84
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,305
Get out of my face, you bitch!

85
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,361
Okay!

86
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,499
I promise you he's a very sweet boy.

87
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,317
He's just not capable of doing something so appalling.

88
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,314
Hey, on your feet, Kujo!

89
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,205
You're being released. What part
of "go home" don't you understand?

90
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:40,687
Hmph.

91
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,387
Listen, mom, you can leave.

92
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,676
I'll be stayin' here for a while.

93
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:47,351
Huh?

94
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,170
Seems I've been possessed by an evil spirit,

95
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,878
and I've no idea what he'll make me do next.

96
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,923
During that fight, it took all I had just to stop it,

97
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,268
so do everyone a favor, and leave me in this cage.

98
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:04,772
Jeez. For crying out loud. Do
you see what I'm talking about?

99
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:07,599
We're trying to release him, but he refuses to go.

100
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,788
I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but are you
sure everything's all right with your boy upstairs?

101
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,600
This isn't a hotel, you know, ma'am.

102
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:17,588
Come on! Let us change cells! Please!

103
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,972
He's not lying about the evil spirit thing.

104
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:25,358
All right, all right! That's enough! All of you, shut up!

105
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,004
Is he... seriously?

106
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,926
What are you doin' with a beer in a jail
cell?! How did you even get that in there?!

107
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:45,005
I told you. I've got an evil spirit,

108
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,509
and sometimes it likes to bring me things.

109
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,447
They're still in, still in.

110
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:53,030
What the hell?! He's reading "Shonen
Jump" while listening to a radio!

111
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,096
Sir, I... I mean, how is this even possible?

112
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,444
We have a major problem here!

113
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,535
Hold it.

114
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:02,309
This might not be enough to make
you guys keep me locked up in here,

115
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:04,930
but I'll show you how evil this spirit is anyway.

116
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,641
Maybe then you'll see why
lettin' me outta here is a bad idea.

117
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,153
That's my gun he has in his hand. But how'd he...

118
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,431
That's really bad.

119
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,389
You didn't see it just now?

120
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:32,644
Well, if you guys didn't see
my evil spirit, then watch this.

121
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:36,919
No! Jotaro!

122
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,060
It's like there's someone behind me.

123
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,728
It bound itself to me not long ago.

124
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,265
Jotaro's grandfather Joseph has strange powers...

125
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:02,681
But what's happening to my son?

126
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:15,985
Papa!

127
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,447
Hmm?

128
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:18,518
Over here, papa! Over here.

129
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:20,301
Holly! Outta my way.

130
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,294
Oh, I can't believe you're here.

131
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,560
Thank you for coming.

132
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:29,588
Hey, you're my one and only daughter, and
if you tell me you need me to be somewhere,

133
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,217
then just give me a day, and I'll cross the globe.

134
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:34,436
Did mom come?

135
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,921
She didn't like me leavin',

136
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:40,924
but I just told Suzie that it was official
Joestar corporation business and I had to go.

137
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:43,729
Thanks, papa.

138
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,399
Holly, hey.

139
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,148
The greeting's over. Let go of me already.

140
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:51,881
No. I don't wanna.

141
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:54,295
It's been forever since you've held me.

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,433
Look at yourself.

143
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:59,254
Come on. You're a 45-year-old woman. Let go.

144
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,819
Oh, now you've done it.

145
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,868
I'm gonna tickle you. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

146
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,002
Hey, stop that!

147
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:04,291
No!

148
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,458
Goochie-goochie goo.

149
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:06,907
Hmm?

150
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,767
Hey, what are you clowns staring at?

151
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,793
Mommy.

152
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:11,457
Don't look.

153
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,713
I'll take your bag.

154
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:14,818
By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...

155
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,411
You sure he used the word "evil spirit"?

156
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,688
Oh, my poor little boy.

157
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,435
Yes. The policemen said they couldn't see
it, but I saw it. It's like he had a third arm,

158
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:31,419
and then he reached out and grabbed the gun.

159
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:35,061
And when this arm came out, no
one else there could see it but you?

160
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,022
That's right.

161
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:39,747
And aside from Jotaro saying that
he's been possessed, you're okay?

162
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:41,214
Did anything happen to you?

163
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:44,645
I feel totally fine, but what do I do about Jotaro?

164
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,641
He says he won't leave that cell
until he finds the cause of all this.

165
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,016
What am I gonna do, papa?

166
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,859
There, there, my darling daughter.

167
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,354
You've got Joseph Joestar with you now.

168
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,585
No need to worry.

169
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,585
Thank you.

170
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,120
Now let's go see my grandson.

171
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,536
Jotaro can explain this himself.

172
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:17,942
It's gettin' spookier.

173
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,961
He's got more stuff in his cell now,

174
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,381
and he's violent.

175
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,765
If something is possessing him,
it's definitely not something nice.

176
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:29,905
If word of this gets out to my superiors,
I'll lose my job in a heartbeat for sure.

177
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,867
He's no longer your problem.

178
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,215
I'll be taking my grandson home now.

179
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,429
Your grandson?

180
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,192
Hold it. That's far enough.

181
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,916
You're better off just staying where you are.

182
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,424
It's dangerous. Convince him to leave
from where you're standing, or I can't...

183
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:42,711
I'll take my chances.

184
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:44,168
Now step aside, and leave him to me.

185
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:44,821
We won't be held responsible.

186
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:45,782
Move it!

187
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,990
Jotaro, this is your grandfather.

188
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,690
Whatever's happened, he'll be able to help you.

189
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,820
Please come out and talk to him.

190
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,598
Come out. It's time to go home.

191
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,956
Get lost.

192
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,784
I didn't ask you to come here.

193
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,142
You really think you can help me,

194
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:14,533
an old man like yourself?

195
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:19,924
Sorry you came all the way from New
York, but nobody can help me, gramps.

196
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:21,892
Huh?

197
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:23,455
Wait.

198
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,538
That's the pinkie from my prosthetic left hand.

199
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,547
When was he able to take it?

200
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,501
So did you see it or even feel it?

201
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,718
That's the evil spirit.

202
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:39,288
Stay away from me, or you'll
lose what's left of your life.

203
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,566
I've never seen anything like this.

204
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,196
He was able to deceive me right off the bat.

205
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,594
That's unbelievable.

206
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,517
I'm afraid I know exactly what Jotaro's evil spirit is,

207
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,265
but I don't think explaining it to him will do any good.

208
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,602
He'll understand his situation much
better if he sees it with his own eyes.

209
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,289
Actually, in order for him to
truly know the danger he faces,

210
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:04,029
he needs to experience it physically.

211
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,613
All right, Avdol.

212
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:08,344
It's your turn now.

213
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:12,840
I'd like you to meet an Egyptian
friend I met a few years ago.

214
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,566
Say hello to Avdol.

215
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:16,981
Hmm?

216
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,594
Do what you need to.

217
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,139
Just get my grandson to leave this damn cell.

218
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,358
Back off.

219
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,230
You look strong enough,

220
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:29,413
but do you really think I'd let someone chase
me outta here just 'cause you told them to do it?

221
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,496
I don't work like that. In fact,

222
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:35,924
all you've done now is made me wanna stay here even more.

223
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,861
I'm afraid this may get a little bit rough.

224
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,831
But in a few minutes, he'll be riddled with so much pain,

225
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,319
that he'll be begging you to let him out of here.

226
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,524
Just do what you gotta do.

227
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,438
Papa, you can't be serious.

228
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:49,091
W... wait a sec. We can't let you turn this...

229
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,091
Zip it, pig!

230
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,222
Yes, sir!

231
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,195
This is...

232
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,355
Heh. That's right.

233
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:14,793
Avdol also has what you'd call an evil spirit,

234
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:19,418
an evil spirit under the complete
command of Avdol's will, and his name is...

235
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:22,000
Magician's Red!

236
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:30,207
It's hot. I feel like I'm on fire.

237
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,414
My arms, they're burning.

238
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,875
What are these evil spirits?

239
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,245
What's Kujo doing? Why's he
flattened himself against the back wall?

240
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,699
Yeah, I don't get it.

241
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:42,050
But do you feel how hot it's gettin' in here?

242
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:43,553
Look at those numbers.

243
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,824
That's insane! What's happening?!

244
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,076
Aha! There it is!

245
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,271
It's finally shown itself, and the fact that
it's so clearly visible means it's incredibly strong.

246
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,670
Let's do this.

247
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,597
I can't believe he's able to
make it manifest so distinctly.

248
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,789
Well done.

249
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,140
Your evil spirit is impressive, too.

250
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:19,102
So tell me, grandpa, you know about these evil spirits?

251
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,845
Of course I do.

252
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:25,679
Mr. Joestar, when you asked me to help
get your grandson out of this jail cell,

253
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,261
I had planned on going easy on the boy,

254
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:31,985
but in light of his tremendous
power, I'm reconsidering that.

255
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:35,123
Just one misstep could put us all in danger.

256
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,627
Tell me if you want me to stop.

257
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:41,222
If not, I'll resort to a use of force
that could land your grandson in the hospital.

258
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,570
Like I said, do what you gotta do.

259
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,090
Yes, sir!

260
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,648
Red bind!

261
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,375
Huh? What the...

262
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,594
What's up with this heat?

263
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:01,160
Yeah, what the hell's going
on? None of this makes any sense!

264
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:04,036
Papa, that's enough! What are you doing to Jotaro?

265
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:08,618
Holly, be a good girl, and let
papa finish what he started, okay?

266
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:10,219
I can't breathe.

267
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,087
The evil spirit is withdrawing.

268
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,091
The heat is restricting his breathing,

269
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,616
which causes the evil spirit to weaken.

270
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,079
And now for the truth.

271
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,288
This may seem like an evil spirit, but it's far from it.

272
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,558
Jotaro,

273
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:29,826
this thing you believe has possessed you is actually
a powerful vision created by your own life energy.

274
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:33,303
This vision will always appear standing by your side,

275
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,557
and because of that, we call it...

276
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:36,875
A stand!

277
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,331
A stand?

278
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,418
Remember Aesop's fable.

279
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,798
The cold wind made the traveler pull his coat tighter,

280
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,268
but the heat forced him to admit defeat.

281
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:50,180
Ready to leave your cage now, JoJo?

282
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,585
I said it before. I'm stayin'.

283
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:57,185
I keep hurting other people
without even knowing I'm doing it.

284
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,077
Until that stops, I'm stayin' here.

285
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,319
It's nice to meet someone like me,

286
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:04,058
but if you keep this up,

287
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,486
you'll die.

288
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:13,787
Huh?

289
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,062
He just broke the damn toilet.

290
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,343
Hey, that's destruction of property!

291
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,401
You had your chance.

292
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:27,230
All right, bastard.

293
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,226
Don't say I didn't warn you.

294
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,026
What the hell?

295
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,447
Why'd you suddenly turn your back on me?

296
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:48,556
We're not done.

297
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,645
Mr. Joestar, he's left his jail cell.

298
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,369
I've accomplished what you asked me to do, right?

299
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,591
So now what? You got me, huh?

300
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:09,118
Not exactly.

301
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:12,445
I did have every intention of sending you to the hospital,

302
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,812
but you're stronger than I had expected.

303
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:17,523
And if I had kept going with this steel rod,

304
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,692
just what would you have done?

305
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,940
Do not underestimate my stand, Magician's Red.

306
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:27,207
It could have easily melted that
rod midair into a worthless puddle.

307
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:30,605
The power Avdol has is exactly the same as yours.

308
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:35,669
If you want to know more about this evil spirit,

309
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,742
you'll need to leave this jail.

310
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:49,375
Thank you. Thank you, Jotaro.

311
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:52,481
I'm glad you finally left that awful jail cell.

312
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,991
Why are you such an annoying bitch?

313
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,667
Okay. I don't know.

314
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,527
Hey, how dare you address your own mother that way?!

315
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,243
And what kind of language is that?

316
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:04,238
And stop smiling, Holly. You'll only encourage it.

317
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:05,230
Okay.

318
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:07,563
Hey, grampa, one question.

319
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,947
There's something that I can't quite wrap my brain around.

320
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:13,276
You seem to know all about this...

321
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,366
Evil spirit, the stand, whatever you wanna call it,

322
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:17,965
but how do you know this?

323
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,458
Hmm. How do I know?

324
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:24,193
I guess I did come all the way
from New York to explain it to you.

325
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:28,648
But in order for you to fully understand the
whole history of it, I must start from the beginning.

326
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:31,783
This is part of the legacy of the Joestar family.

327
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,766
Take a look at these pictures.

328
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,795
What are these about?

329
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:45,950
That coffin's a hundred years old, and four years ago,
it was pulled out of the Atlantic off the coast of Africa.

330
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Okay. So?

331
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,892
I did a little research.

332
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,864
My grandfather, Jonathan Joestar, your
great-grandfather, died while at sea.

333
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:58,956
Turns out this exact same coffin
was on that boat with him when he died.

334
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,739
When they discovered it four years ago, it was empty.

335
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,933
But I know exactly what was inside it.

336
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,119
Avdol and I are trying to locate him as we speak.

337
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,073
Hold on. Did you say, "him"?

338
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,307
Are you suggesting there was a person inside that thing?

339
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:19,569
Come on. How could a human being stay
buried underwater for a hundred years?

340
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,776
Because that person is evil incarnate,

341
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,731
and his name is Dio!

342
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,130
And now that he has been awakened
from his hundred-year slumber,

343
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:30,109
it is our fate to fight that man!

344
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,501
What the hell does that face mean?

345
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:38,135
And don't you turn your back on me
like this has nothing to do with you!

346
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:42,718
Look, you old man, this face means your
story is so lame, I don't know what to say.

347
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:44,372
What? "Old man"?

348
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:45,810
Avdol, was it?

349
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,284
I don't know you, but you are one arrogant bastard.

350
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,994
And as for you, old man...

351
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:51,391
Huh?

352
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,638
Did you really expect me to fall
for an unbelievable story like that?

353
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:59,073
Heh. I know the story sounds far-fetched,

354
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:03,624
but wouldn't you also say our evil
spirits are equally unbelievable?

355
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,588
Think what you want,

356
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,440
but soon you will have no choice but to believe it.

357
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:14,103
If you want me to tell you how I know that
Dio exists and why I've chosen to go after him,

358
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:16,517
the best way to explain it is to show you.

359
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:23,541
See, the truth of it is I myself had a rather
startling revelation that prompted all of this.

360
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:26,957
About a year ago, I suddenly obtained a stand of my own.

361
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,275
What did you say?!

362
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,817
Gramps, what did you...

363
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,562
Get ready.

364
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:33,888
Let me introduce...

365
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,015
My stand!

366
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,446
Did you see it, the thorns that came out of my hand?

367
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,997
This is my stand.

368
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,476
It can reveal faraway visions and place them on film.

369
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:56,966
The only downside is I have to bust a
30,000-yen camera every time I use it!

370
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,761
Excuse me. Is everything all right here?

371
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,049
We're fine. Now go on. Run along.

372
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,309
Of course.

373
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,927
In a matter of seconds, a vision
will appear in this photograph, Jotaro,

374
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,744
and it will reveal your very destiny!

375
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:12,451
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,152
Jotaro, Holly,

377
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:18,996
have either of you ever taken the time to
look carefully at the back of your necks?

378
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,846
What does that mean?

379
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:24,463
You each have it, but you
probably never thought much about it,

380
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,663
a birthmark shaped like a star.

381
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:28,949
It turns out that we all have it.

382
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:35,084
I'll say it again. What the hell does all this mean?

383
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:40,551
My father died when I was young, so I asked my
mother about it, and she said he had one, too.

384
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:45,730
It seems that everyone from the Joestar
bloodline is born with this exact same birthmark.

385
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:49,942
All right, and just what the hell
is gonna turn up in that photograph?

386
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:53,420
It's our destiny, a path that until now has been unknown.

387
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:53,629
Papa.

388
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:57,338
I'm losing my patience. Just
show me the damn photo already.

389
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:06,879
Dio. He shows up in all my spirit photos,

390
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,119
and look what's just above his shoulder.

391
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,815
From the neck of this bastard on down

392
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,833
is Jonathan Joestar, my grandfather!

393
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,057
This son of a bitch took over his body!

394
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:23,589
A hundred years ago, there was
an incident in the Atlantic ocean.

395
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,899
All I know is what I've learned
from my grandmother, Erina.

396
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:30,648
Somehow, Dio took over the body
of my grandfather and survived.

397
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,216
And this much I know is certain...

398
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,473
This bastard is currently hiding somewhere on the globe,

399
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:37,919
plotting something.

400
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,720
It's four years since he's revived,

401
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:43,095
and the reason my spirit photography

402
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:48,490
and your evil spirit have manifested
since is most likely connected to Dio.

403
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,825
To society in general, our gifts
are considered a kind of psychic power.

404
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:58,386
I've had my stand since the day I was
born, but your powers seem bound to Dio's body,

405
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:01,296
or, rather, Jonathan Joestar's body.

406
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,648
There's some sort of invisible
string that connects you all to him.

407
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:08,778
His rebirth is also your own,
awakening your sleeping powers.

408
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:14,014
Avdol, does this photograph give you
any indication to where he might be now?

409
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,328
No, nothing.

410
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,762
There's hardly anything of note in the photo at all.

411
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,228
I see.

412
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,707
I'll take a closer look later.

413
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,249
Thank you. Hmm?

414
00:22:25,774 --> 00:22:26,981
Oh, Holly.

415
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,913
I'm sorry I sprang this all on you out of the blue.

416
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:31,310
Let's head home now.

417
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:32,528
All right.

418
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:35,307
I think I'll be sticking around for quite some time.

419
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,734
You mind if I stay at your place while I'm here?

420
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,029
No, of course not, papa. Let's go, Jotaro.

421
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,310
Again...

422
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:57,404
Just now...

423
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,914
A most intense feeling like
someone somewhere is watching me.

424
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,361
It is Jonathan's descendants.

425
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:10,668
This body is sending out some kind
of spiritual signal to his offspring.

426
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:14,553
Fine. It must be my fate.

427
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:18,417
But fate must be purged.

428
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:20,881
It's all set.

429
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:23,377
I've taken the first step.
