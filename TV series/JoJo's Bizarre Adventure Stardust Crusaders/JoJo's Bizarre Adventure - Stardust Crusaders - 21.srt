1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,746
Previously, on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure".

2
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,273
Hey, old man, something's off.

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:10,022
You're going the wrong direction.

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,220
Hmm?

5
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:13,724
You seem to be heading toward that island.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,972
But before we arrive in Egypt,
we need to make a slight detour.

7
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:19,627
Someone is waiting for us on the island.

8
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:21,016
Hmm.

9
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,949
He's a man who is extremely important to our journey.

10
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:27,466
What is that supposed to mean?

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,738
Hey, what's the big idea?

12
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:39,771
Does someone actually live here?

13
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:42,955
This is such a tiny, little
island, it's practically deserted.

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,719
I would have to agree.

15
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,165
Mr. Joestar, are you sure someone actually lives here?

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,850
He's been living on this island by himself.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,205
A man told me back in India,
and I'm sure I heard him correctly.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,094
Wait a sec. When you say a man...

19
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:59,397
What? Mangos from India?

20
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:46,840
Hate to interrupt, but I thought you should know
someone's watching us from the grass over there.

21
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:47,396
What?

22
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:50,376
Hey!

23
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,295
From the back, he looks...

24
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,472
You're right. I know that face.

25
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:04,048
Hold on! Just wait!

26
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,418
Eat up now.

27
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,737
Are you hungry, Michael?

28
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,199
How about you, prince?

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,203
I mixed in those shells you love, so make
sure you share with the others, all right?

30
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,491
And there's lots more where this came from.

31
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:28,710
Make sure to get nice and fat so
you'll be a tasty chicken, Lionel.

32
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,213
It's not possible. That man...

33
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,849
It can't be. It's...

34
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:33,574
Hold it.

35
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,465
I'm gonna go and talk to him.

36
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,769
The rest of you just wait here for now.

37
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,416
Pardon me. My name is Joseph Joestar.

38
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,873
My friends and I are currently
traveling on an expedition to Egypt.

39
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,827
Go away! I won't hear it!

40
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:51,799
His voice sounds like...

41
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,059
I won't say it again. Don't talk to me. Got it?

42
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:58,612
No one ever comes to see me when
they have actual good news to report.

43
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,367
I only get visitors when something bad happens!

44
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:02,455
Just shut up!

45
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,821
Go away!

46
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,014
Mr. Avdol!

47
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:07,721
Avdol, wait.

48
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:08,802
I said go!

49
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,997
Hold on! That's impossible!

50
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,991
That wasn't Avdol.

51
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,032
It was his father.

52
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:17,995
His father?

53
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,985
He withdrew from society and lives alone on this island.

54
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:26,418
I'm sorry that I wasn't able
to tell you about this earlier,

55
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:30,375
but if it ever became known to
Dio that we stopped at this place,

56
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:33,670
Avdol's father would be put in grave danger.

57
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,616
I would never forgive myself if that happened.

58
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:42,813
But for now, my focus has to be on
telling him what every parent fears most,

59
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,958
that his son is dead.

60
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,365
Polnareff!

61
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,682
Don't let yourself go there.
Avdol's death wasn't your fault.

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,269
No, it's entirely my fault.

63
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:12,776
I'll carry that burden for as long as I live.

64
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,258
Is it safe to assume his father's a stand user?

65
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,494
Yeah, but I don't know what kind of
stand it is or what sort of power it wields.

66
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,995
Judging by the way his father reacted to us,

67
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:31,639
I doubt he'll offer us much in the way of assistance.

68
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,381
You just leave the talking to me, all right?

69
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,803
Hopefully my words will be able to reach him.

70
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:59,042
All I ever wanted was to avenge my sister's death,

71
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,412
and I ended up killing my friend.

72
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:04,939
There's nothing I could possibly
do to make it up to his father.

73
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,193
I'm between a rock and a hard place.

74
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,523
Talk about depressing.

75
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:11,612
Hmm?

76
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,436
Huh?

77
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,677
Hmm. This thing is pretty shiny.

78
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:30,030
I wonder if it drifted up from some sunken ship.

79
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,110
Just look at all these barnacles.

80
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:35,152
It's definitely made of metal, but...

81
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,706
There's some kind of creepy face carved on it.

82
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,033
Despite that, it looks pretty valuable.

83
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:45,393
Now, if I can scratch off these
barnacles, we'll really be in business.

84
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,207
What the hell?!

85
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:58,490
It's gone.

86
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,318
What in the world happened just now?

87
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,845
From the looks of it, the air trapped inside
just burst out, and I was scared over nothing.

88
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,315
Whew.

89
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,724
Luckily I'm not dealing with a Aladdin's magic
lamp or anything, I guess I can relax a little.

90
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,689
You get three...

91
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:19,279
Three, I say!

92
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,098
Your wish is my command.

93
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:24,136
Three wishes for whatever your heart desires.

94
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:26,892
What sort of fresh hell is this?

95
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:28,655
I am known as Cameo.

96
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,593
Allow me to thank you for freeing me from the lamp.

97
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:34,996
Tell me your three wishes so
that I might grant them for you.

98
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:38,141
Hold it, you smoky freak! Are you a new stand user?

99
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,051
Silver Chariot!

100
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:52,387
Damn it. This guy's not half bad.

101
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:54,492
What awesome power.

102
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:59,226
Listen, buddy. Your strength tells
me that your user is definitely nearby.

103
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:00,300
Now who is it?

104
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:04,900
Would you like the answer to that question
to be considered as your first official wish?

105
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:08,291
It's a little on the boring side, if you ask me.

106
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,979
Don't pull that "genie in a
bottle" crap with me, fait chier.

107
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:16,429
But if you're saying you could make me a
super-rich man right this instant, let's see it.

108
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,837
Is that your first wish?

109
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:19,997
Going once.

110
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,499
Go ahead, and grant it if you can, but
otherwise stop jerking me around, damn it.

111
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,645
Then consider your wish granted.

112
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:27,130
Huh?

113
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:30,579
Hail 2 U!

114
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:37,880
Huh?

115
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:40,619
Huh?

116
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:48,141
I don't understand a single thing that just happened.

117
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,532
So that strange guy wasn't the enemy's stand after all.

118
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,743
I thought he'd attack me, but
instead he told me to make three wishes.

119
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,613
I don't know what's going on
here, but I don't trust that guy.

120
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,149
Someone shady is on this island.

121
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,022
It's probably a good idea to
tell Mr. Joestar what happened here.

122
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:13,929
There might be a chance it could have
something to do with Avdol's father.

123
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:15,780
Huh?

124
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:18,714
That's weird.

125
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,167
What's up with all that loud clanging back there?

126
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:24,885
Hmm?

127
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,391
Whoa, is this for real? But it can't be.

128
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:37,066
W-Wait, this is gold from the Napoleonic era.

129
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:40,648
This isn't a dream or an illusion. Holy crap!

130
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,740
A treasure trove of gold. I wouldn't
believe it if it wasn't right here.

131
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,619
I don't get it! What is this?!
Are you mocking me or something?!

132
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:52,511
No, that's not it. He can't be mocking me.

133
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,425
When could he have buried this gold here?

134
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:58,469
There's no way he would have had
time to bury it after I made my wish,

135
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:01,559
so how the hell did that freak do all this?

136
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,658
Now what is your second wish?

137
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,097
Your wish is my command.

138
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,789
This doesn't make any sense!

139
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,014
Why are you doing this?! What are you scheming?!

140
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,612
You don't think I'd fall for your stupid tricks?

141
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,225
If you are my enemy, then fight me like one.

142
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,655
If not, I'll take this treasure for myself.

143
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:24,043
So I take it knowing the answer to
that question is your second wish?

144
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,872
Though, it's a little on the boring side, if you ask me,

145
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:33,297
but I owe you a debt of gratitude for letting
me out of that lamp, so I shall grant your wish.

146
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,252
You know, you're a smug bastard.

147
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,936
All right, then. Have it your way.

148
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,927
I do have a wish.

149
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,528
I want to be a comic artist!

150
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,539
That was always my dream back when I was a kid.

151
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,866
And don't make me some pathetic one either.

152
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,534
I wanna be bigger than Disney.

153
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,630
In fact, someday I'm gonna build my own Polnareff-land!

154
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,581
You know what? Scratch that idea.

155
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,233
Just give me a second to think.

156
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,323
Any minute now, it'll come to me.

157
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,819
I've made up my mind! I want a beautiful girlfriend!

158
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,949
More than money or fame,

159
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,381
what I want is true love.

160
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:14,678
I'm talkin' not only someone who's really cute, but a
girl who will pinky swear she loves me with all her heart.

161
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:18,261
I wanna meet a girl who feels the
same way about me as I do for her.

162
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:22,360
So if that's within your power to do,
then prove it to me right now, damn it!

163
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:26,118
You want a girl, do you? Very well.

164
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:27,604
Wait. No, never mind.

165
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,248
I need time to think this through.

166
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,577
I have a question.

167
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:51,055
Do you have the ability to revive someone?

168
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:55,598
Am I to assume your wanting to know the
answer to that question is your second wi...

169
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,584
Cut it out!

170
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,779
I'm asking you to bring my dead sister back to life.

171
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:02,820
And while you're at it, you can
do the same for my friend Avdol.

172
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,306
That shouldn't be too much of a challenge, right?!

173
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,402
Ah. Very well.

174
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,714
I shall grant your wish.

175
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:20,734
Wha... are you serious?

176
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,866
So you can really do it?

177
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:45,434
Indeed, but know that since you made two
wishes, I'll grant them in the order you asked.

178
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,519
First I will grant your second
wish, to bring back your sister.

179
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:53,175
Hail 2 U!

180
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,723
Hey, don't just disappear!

181
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,479
Who the hell are you, and why are even you doing this?

182
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,196
What was that sound?

183
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,493
I'm sure I heard something rustling around.

184
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:18,531
It sounded like someone was digging up the ground.

185
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:31,068
There's that weird digging again.

186
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,887
W-Where's that sound coming from?

187
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,168
No. Impossible.

188
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:47,971
Wait. Is that a woman crying?

189
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:51,060
All right, who the hell's back here?!

190
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,159
T-These are...

191
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,642
These are strands of hair,

192
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,571
and a woman's hair, no less.

193
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,319
A woman's footsteps.

194
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:10,829
It can't be!

195
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:20,636
There's no way.

196
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,391
This can't be happening, can it?

197
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:27,663
As far as I know, my little sister is still in
her coffin back in France, so how could she be...

198
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,960
Just who the hell are you?!

199
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,231
You better answer me right now!

200
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,998
Please stay away.

201
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,969
I'm in so much pain.

202
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:45,383
My body hasn't fully formed yet.

203
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,250
I know that voice.

204
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:55,604
Sherry, it's you.

205
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:00,486
Polnareff's been gone awhile.

206
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,027
Where'd he run off to?

207
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:04,109
I couldn't find him up top.

208
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,827
Where could he have gone? It's already
nightfall, and he's nowhere to be seen.

209
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,863
Do you think that he could have gotten
tangled up in a fight with the enemy?

210
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,191
Sh-Sherry...

211
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,773
Am I hallucinating, or is it really you?

212
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,237
It is you, isn't it?

213
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,325
Huh?

214
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,992
Wait! Where are you going?

215
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,112
Where are you going, Sherry?!

216
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,146
Wait, Sherry. It's only me.

217
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,314
Sherry, why are you running away?

218
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,233
Where are you?!

219
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,474
Come on, Sherry, please! I'm begging you to show yourself!

220
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,961
Let me see your face. Let me see it one more time.

221
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,847
Hey, brother!

222
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,050
Higher, brother!

223
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,321
Raise me as high as you can!

224
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,681
Yay! Now spin me around!

225
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:16,461
Oh, it's simply wonderful.
I've been wanting a new umbrella.

226
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,751
Thank you for buying it for me.

227
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:22,482
I'm off now.

228
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,751
Sherry!

229
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,497
Sherry!

230
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,741
Mon dieu, what the hell happened here?

231
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,363
They've been half eaten.

232
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:55,457
Sherry!

233
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,251
Can you hear me?

234
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,957
Why are you running away?! It's me, your big brother!

235
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,721
Because my body is covered in mud.

236
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,900
And there's my hair. It's so unkempt.

237
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,701
It's okay, Sherry. Don't worry about that.

238
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,798
You've gotta believe me when I
say you're perfect as you are.

239
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,066
Why are you crying?

240
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,053
Sherry, talk to me. Why are you sad?

241
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:40,720
Oh...

242
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:45,818
Oh, Sherry.

243
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:47,831
No.

244
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:48,273
Eh?

245
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:52,173
Just stay back. Don't come any closer.

246
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:53,831
W-What are you saying?

247
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:55,680
You're not making any sense.

248
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,283
It's simple.

249
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,723
I'm saying you'll hate me.

250
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:04,909
Oh, Sherry, have I ever said
anything to make you think I'd hate you?

251
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:06,540
Yes, you have.

252
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:12,352
It was when we were little kids and I gave
your favorite tropical fish to that stupid cat.

253
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,933
You got really angry over it and said you hated me.

254
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,131
I admit I was angry that day,

255
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:23,862
but no matter what, I've always loved you
more than the stars in the sky, and I still do.

256
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:27,636
Really? You've always loved me, no matter what I did?

257
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:29,464
Yes, of course I have.

258
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,450
And does that feeling hold true to this day?

259
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,192
I will always love you, no matter what,

260
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,924
and I can clearly see now that you're the real Sherry.

261
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:41,166
You have no idea how much I've missed you, little sister.

262
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,318
I see.

263
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,214
I feel the same, big brother.

264
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,496
Sherry, please look this way.

265
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:52,148
I'm begging you to show me that beautiful face of yours.

266
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,484
Why are you crying, Sherry?

267
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:57,936
Are you still sad?

268
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,904
Sad? No, brother.

269
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,676
These aren't tears of sadness.

270
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,611
I'm crying, because...

271
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,369
What? What is it, then?

272
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:08,745
I'm...

273
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,489
I'm happy, brother,

274
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,835
'Cause I can finally eat you!

275
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,832
Ch-Chariot.

276
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,425
Sher... ry.

277
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,524
I'm sorry that I bit you, brother.

278
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,996
I'm afraid my body is still underdeveloped.

279
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:50,746
But if I eat your flesh, I'll return to normal.

280
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,606
It's okay if I eat you, right?

281
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:55,244
What am I saying?

282
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:58,039
You always did what I asked you to.

283
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,462
Cameo!

284
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,449
You rang?

285
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,364
You bastard!

286
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,200
What's all the fuss about?

287
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:17,941
Do you have a complaint? I granted your wish, didn't I?

288
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:21,135
Granting wishes is my power, after all.

289
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,907
What you do with them is completely up to you.

290
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:29,267
Then let me use this opportunity
to tell you my third wish.

291
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,716
Ma-make my sister...

292
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,347
Make her...

293
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:48,999
Make my sister return to her
grave so she can rest in peace!

294
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,631
I don't think so.

295
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,713
Why not?

296
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,467
You still don't get it do you, Polnareff?

297
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:13,489
If you haven't figured it out, I'm a stand and not
just any stand, the one represented by the judgment card.

298
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:19,973
You see, my powers allow me to extract
wishes from the deepest corners of the human mind

299
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:22,514
and manifest it from the soil below.

300
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,390
You created your sister from your own yearning.

301
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,465
How dare you?

302
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:31,539
And since you created her, I cannot undo it.

303
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,211
It looks like the winner of this battle is me.

304
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:45,281
By the way, I seem to recall you
saying something about a third wish.

305
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,172
But don't you remember, Polnareff?

306
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,413
You've already made your third wish.

307
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:50,557
Oh, no.

308
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,711
You don't mean him.

309
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:15,051
All the old paintings on the tomb

310
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:17,219
They do the sand dance, don't you know

311
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,563
If they move too quick

312
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,699
Oh, whey, oh

313
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,017
They're falling down like a domino

314
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,385
All the bazaar men by the Nile

315
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,640
They got the money on a bet

316
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,086
Gold crocodiles

317
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,002
Oh, whey, oh

318
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,281
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

319
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,556
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

320
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,939
Whey, oh, whey, oh

321
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:39,476
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

322
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:43,089
Walk like an Egyptian.

323
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:57,102
The blond waitresses take their trays

324
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,198
They spin around, and they cross the floor

325
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:00,472
They've got the moves

326
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:01,465
Oh, whey, oh

327
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:02,499
You drop your drink

328
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,000
Then they bring you more

329
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:06,270
All the school kids so sick of books

330
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,480
They like the punk and the metal band

331
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:09,907
When the buzzer rings

332
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:10,958
Oh, whey, oh

333
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,218
They're walking like an Egyptian

334
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,345
All the kids in the marketplace say

335
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,580
Whey, oh, whey, oh

336
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:22,385
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

337
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,162
Walk like an Egyptian
