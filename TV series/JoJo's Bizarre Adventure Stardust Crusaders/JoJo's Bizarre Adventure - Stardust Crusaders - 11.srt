1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,962
For such a tough guy, he sure was easy to finish off.

2
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:17,984
But I guess if you think about it,

3
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:21,913
the end is usually a pretty sudden curtain call, you know.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,648
Most folks don't get to say goodbye,
especially when a bullet to the brain's involved.

5
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:31,175
Think that as a little parting
wisdom before I make you croak.

6
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:34,790
Polnareff!

7
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:37,866
Don't let him get to you! You're much stronger than that!

8
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,066
You still don't get it, do you?

9
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,724
Mr. Avdol told you, he begged you not to fight alone...

10
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,042
But you completely ignored him.

11
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:51,563
Even if it meant dying with your enemy,
you were hellbent on getting revenge.

12
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:55,433
He followed you, because that worried
him, and this is what happened as a result!

13
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:58,387
Then tell me, what am I supposed to do?

14
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,483
We need to fall back for now.

15
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,401
Avdol was stabbed in the back and didn't have a chance.

16
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,261
My sister couldn't defend herself and was killed.

17
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:10,041
You want me to hold these regrets inside and run away?

18
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,890
And just forget all this happen?

19
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:15,137
How can we fight them when we don't
even know what their stands can do?

20
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,766
Don't fight a battle that'll only end in your death!

21
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:20,076
That's what Mr. Avdol was trying to tell you.

22
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:22,444
Hey, come on.

23
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,231
Do it, li'I pol pol.

24
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,782
Why, you...

25
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:30,357
Polnareff, calm down, and
slowly retreat toward me, got it?

26
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:32,056
That truck's our way out of here.

27
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:32,887
Calm?

28
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,491
Calm down you say? How?

29
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,173
A... All right.

30
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:50,114
Hey, Polnareff.

31
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,203
It's your fault Avdol died, you know?

32
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,421
I think that means you owe him.

33
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,273
It only seems fair.

34
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,421
Your friend bit the dust because of you.

35
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,168
Damn you, you bastard.

36
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:21,139
Where's your real body?!

37
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,792
Polnareff, calm down!

38
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,762
But there's no need to be sad.

39
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:29,384
Actually, you should be happy.

40
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,927
You're about to see your dear friend again.

41
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:38,148
You'll soon be dead, and then you can
enjoy the afterlife with those two fools.

42
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:39,291
You're welcome.

43
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:45,079
I have to say your sister was so very sweet.

44
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:54,591
Once you're reunited with your sister, be
sure to ask her exactly how I killed her.

45
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,330
We had such a ball.

46
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:01,573
Polnareff, don't fall for his
tricks! He wants you to attack!

47
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:03,360
Bastard!

48
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,623
Oh, didn't you know?

49
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:13,824
Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.

50
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:21,372
I'm in the mirror, where your stand can't go.

51
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,430
That's why!

52
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:29,650
So close and yet so far away.

53
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,876
Hol Horse, fire away.

54
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:34,896
Let's put an end to this idiot.

55
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,421
Aye, aye, sir.

56
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,728
Die!

57
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,747
Emerald splash!

58
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:46,788
What?!

59
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:55,106
What the... wait. He shot Polnareff!

60
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,407
Huh?

61
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:07,132
Kakyoin, was it?

62
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,735
Not bad, partner.

63
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:18,442
That's out of my stand's range. Even if I got him from
here, the bullet wouldn't hit him with very much force.

64
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,085
Hmm?

65
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,735
He went after them, eh?

66
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:24,069
Well, I'll be.

67
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,254
He must really have it in for Polnareff.

68
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:33,837
I'm so sorry, Kakyoin.

69
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,788
I... It's just that...

70
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:40,441
I thought so long as I could avenge my sister,

71
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,501
I wouldn't care if I lived or died.

72
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,882
But I understand now.

73
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,843
I know Avdol was fighting for me.

74
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,936
His sacrifice won't be for naught.

75
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,644
I'll fight to keep on living.

76
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:57,411
You sure that you really mean that, Polnareff?

77
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,151
Mm, we...

78
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:05,301
That's all I'm giving you as
proof that we've made up, Polnareff.

79
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:06,071
Right.

80
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:08,566
M... Merci, Kakyoin.

81
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,926
When those bastards come after us again,

82
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:14,073
I swear we'll defeat them together.

83
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,742
Avdol, my old friend.

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,958
You know, I was so sure that I stabbed him with my sword,

85
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,254
but my strike never hit him.

86
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,638
It was like he wasn't there.

87
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,024
Even breaking the mirror into pieces didn't stop him.

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,674
The Hanged Man just attacked from the shards.
How in the hell am I supposed to fight against that?

89
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,985
He attacks your reflection,

90
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,702
but his knife sinks into your real flesh,

91
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,729
and my stand can't go inside mirrors.

92
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:05,338
How are we supposed to attack him if
he's in some kind of mirror world? Damn it!

93
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,519
Polnareff, you keep talking about
"inside the mirror" and "the mirror world,"

94
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:14,578
but there's no such thing as a world in a mirror.

95
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:17,287
Remember, this is reality, not fantasy.

96
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:21,294
What are you talking about? You saw it, too, didn't you?

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,542
You can only see him in a mirror,
and when you turn around, he's gone.

98
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:29,314
Yes, but anything that you see in a
mirror is just a reflection created by light.

99
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:32,516
I'm not an idiot! You don't have to tell me that!

100
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:36,358
Listen, I mean this case. I'm
talking about what's going on now.

101
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,005
If stands can exist in this world,
there could be a mirror world, too.

102
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,164
There isn't.

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,696
Come on, man!

104
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:47,694
I think that fact is what's going to
help us solve the mystery of Hanged Man.

105
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:53,709
Look, stands are able to destroy other stands, so
there still has to be something we don't know about his...

106
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:54,562
hmm?

107
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,927
Polnareff! The chrome of the steering wheel!

108
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:10,546
What?!

109
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,119
The bastard's caught up to us!

110
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:13,691
Look out!

111
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:30,109
Hey, are you okay? Talk to me.

112
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:33,483
I... I slammed my chest, but I'll be fine.

113
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:36,999
What?

114
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:42,678
Chariot!

115
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,967
Kakyoin, avoid the reflection!

116
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:55,839
Damn. I got it.

117
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:57,253
I just saw him do it.

118
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,968
Huh?

119
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:00,043
He's going from mirror to mirror.

120
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,759
This guy moves by jumping
around, one reflection to another.

121
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,605
He traveled all this way by reflecting over and over.

122
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,912
It's the only explanation for how he caught up to us.

123
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,095
Reflecting?

124
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,560
That means he's actually light.

125
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,498
Are you saying that the true nature of his stand is light?

126
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:21,454
I am. I just saw him in the car's bumper.

127
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,680
He's going to reflect off that
surface and onto something else.

128
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,729
Stay clear of reflective stuff.

129
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,298
Take anything shiny off your
body and your uniform buttons!

130
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:32,522
Hey, mister, are you guys okay?

131
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:34,667
Want me to bring you some medicine?

132
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,432
We're fine. Look, it's dangerous! Get out of here!

133
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,665
Whoa, you guys totally messed up your car.

134
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,865
Hey, you're bleeding, mister.

135
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,979
Are you sure you're okay?

136
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,914
That asshole!

137
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,836
He's reflected in the kid's eye!

138
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,030
Listen, kid. Don't look at us.

139
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:58,574
Huh?

140
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,203
I told you, don't look at us!

141
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,325
Don't follow me with your eyes!

142
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:05,810
Huh? But you're hurt.

143
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,829
I'm fine, see? Perfectly fine, got it?

144
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,385
So go look over there!

145
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,335
But... but you're bleeding.

146
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,983
You brat, I said look over there!

147
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:14,464
Huh?

148
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,221
Damn you, Centerfold!

149
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,698
What are you going to do?

150
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:26,528
You wouldn't poke out this cute little kid's
eye with that sword of yours, would you, Polnareff?

151
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:28,737
Polnareff!

152
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,011
And now I finally got you.

153
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:35,666
You can't run anymore, not
unless you gouge the kid's eyes out.

154
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,863
You disgusting, cruel son of a bitch. You're dead!

155
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:45,900
Hmm?

156
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,119
Don't worry, Kakyoin.

157
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:54,155
Mon frere, that's not what you say at a time like this.

158
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:58,356
Listen, in times like these,
you've got to say something fitting.

159
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:01,697
Before you get your revenge, say something like this here.

160
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,981
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

161
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:12,187
For the honor of my dearest sister's soul and so my
good friend Avdol can rest peacefully in heaven above,

162
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:15,223
I'm going to hurl you into the depths of despair!

163
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:18,254
Prepare yourself, Centerfold!

164
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,995
Sorry about this, kid. I'll buy
you whatever candy you want, okay?

165
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,787
You got sand in my eye!

166
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,319
What the...

167
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:37,257
Polnareff, he's in your eye!

168
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:41,601
I don't really understand how, but he
essentially moves at the speed of light.

169
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:44,151
No one can normally see speed like that.

170
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:48,306
But then, I knew that if the kid closed
his eyes, the next move would be to my eye.

171
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:51,412
There was no other place for him
to go, and that's how we'll beat him.

172
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,667
Oh, I see.

173
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:56,734
Hanged Man can only exist within the world of reflection.

174
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:01,478
When one world is about to be destroyed,

175
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:04,336
he must migrate to another reflective object.

176
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,491
So, as long as I can read his trajectory,

177
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,536
I can slice through him like butter.

178
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,967
His real body is over there.

179
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,560
You bastard. Finally.

180
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,498
Finally!

181
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,592
At last we meet...

182
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:37,214
Centerfold!

183
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,588
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff, and I've
seen through your stand's clever little trick.

184
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:49,185
It's a stand of light that moves at extraordinary speed.

185
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:51,657
I know there's no way that I can catch it,

186
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,675
but if I can predict where your stand's going to jump next

187
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:57,915
and I slash its trajectory in that moment,

188
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,338
I can cut you!

189
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:05,935
If Kakyoin and Avdol hadn't shown up, I probably wouldn't
have figured that out, and you would have killed me.

190
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:06,451
- Huh?

191
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,035
No, Polnareff! This isn't the
man with a pair of right hands!

192
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,600
That's not Centerfold!

193
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:19,758
What the hell?!

194
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:21,523
Polnareff!

195
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,287
Polnareff!

196
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,148
Over here!

197
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:45,364
I'm Centerfold, insignificant fools!

198
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:46,810
At last.

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,275
That man is some beggar who was in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

200
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,666
I just carved a small wound in him,

201
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:56,757
the same wound you were so gracious to give me.

202
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,665
You totally fell for it.

203
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:07,616
Getting close to him without knowing what I look like
was a grave mistake, one you'll pay for with your lives!

204
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,431
You bastard.

205
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,459
Take this! Emerald...

206
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,778
Whoa! Wait now. Take a good look around you.

207
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,934
Hey, gather round!

208
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,605
See these two gentleman?

209
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,439
They say they've got a boatload of cash to share!

210
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,325
What?!

211
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,629
They'll give us money for nothing, huh?

212
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,080
Such generosity!

213
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,398
You have such big hearts! Thank you!

214
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,221
Bless you, kind sirs.

215
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,212
Have you figured out what's going on yet?

216
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,414
You say you've figured out my stand?

217
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,527
You fool!

218
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,061
You think I don't know my own weakness?

219
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:56,822
I have no weakness!

220
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,958
You can never know where I'll jump to next.

221
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:01,335
Don't look.

222
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:02,645
Don't stare at us.

223
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,378
Please, just look away!

224
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,042
You can't run anymore!

225
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,347
What are you going to do, blow everyone up?

226
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,964
You sacrificed your entire youth just to hunt me down,

227
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,917
and just when you're close, you're
going to fail to avenge your sister?

228
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,531
How pathetic and sad.

229
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:28,300
Meanwhile, I, Centerfold, will continue a life
surrounded by young beauties like your sister.

230
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,239
I can see it now. Oh, the pleasures.

231
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:38,366
Come to think of it, that sweet sister
of yours was really good at sobbing.

232
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:44,737
Farewell.

233
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,813
Wh... why, you...

234
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,640
Polnareff, you could do better than that.

235
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:50,291
Eh?

236
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,309
"Why, you," isn't what you say.

237
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,850
When taking revenge, you have to be more refined.

238
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,780
This is what you say.

239
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,490
My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.

240
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,035
In order to avenge my dear friend Avdol

241
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:07,968
and so that the soul of my friend Polnareff's
sister may rest in peace for all eternity...

242
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,037
I will have you pay with your life.

243
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,183
Whoa!

244
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:17,218
I'll give this gold coin to whoever picks it up.

245
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:20,625
Behold, a coin so perfect it shines like a mirror.

246
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,659
Yeah, now I see.

247
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:29,920
Looks like all of their eyes are focused on one point now.

248
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:30,739
Yeah.

249
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:36,151
We know the trajectory that Hanged Man will have to take.

250
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,812
Merci, Kakyoin!

251
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:41,613
Huh?

252
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:51,672
Now!

253
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,673
Hold it!

254
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,989
It won't open!

255
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,543
Looks like you're the one who's
really good at sobbing, Centerfold!

256
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,151
And you're about to plummet into hell,
begging and crying the whole way down.

257
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:23,016
But there's one thing I can't
rely on the guardians of hell to do,

258
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:24,850
and that's...

259
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,860
To turn your body into a pincushion!

260
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,765
I've been waiting years for this moment!

261
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,270
I'll leave the rest to the devil. Rot in hell.

262
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,167
So this is the true Hanged Man, huh?

263
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,169
He was rotten all the way to the core.

264
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,438
I got my revenge.

265
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:14,695
Hold it!

266
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,343
Finally caught up with you.

267
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,433
Why are you walking so slow?

268
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,756
If you're gonna run, run like your
lives depend on it. It's way more fun.

269
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,465
Isn't that right, Mr. Centerfold?

270
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:45,412
Better say your prayers, boys. This
is where your lives come to an end.

271
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:48,343
Come at us with everything you've got. Understand?!

272
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,130
It's so boring if you just stand there and die.

273
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,188
Right, Mr. Centerfold?

274
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:04,309
Hey, Mr. Centerfold, aren't you gonna play?

275
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:07,168
I don't think he's listening anymore, cowboy.

276
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:07,724
Huh?

277
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:14,119
He's quite busy at the moment
carrying out his sentence in hell.

278
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,311
Hmm?

279
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,848
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

280
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,017
Don't try to pull that nonsense.

281
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:24,090
Bluffing won't work on me. Nice try, though.

282
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,284
There's no way you could have beaten him.

283
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:31,930
Even I wouldn't try my luck against that mother.

284
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,626
You know, Polnareff, your sense of humor stinks.

285
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:41,608
That piece of shit's corpse is 2,000 or
3,000 meters that way if you wanna take a look.

286
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,132
Huh?

287
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,645
Okay, I will!

288
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:47,439
Huh? You're running away?!

289
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,895
I don't stand a chance.

290
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,063
I'm at a total disadvantage by myself.

291
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm high-tailing it out of
here, waiting for a better chance.

292
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:59,906
Or better yet, waiting 'til I
find myself another partner in crime.

293
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,806
It's all about being number two.

294
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,904
That's the motto I like to live by.

295
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,642
Got a problem with it?

296
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,500
What?!

297
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,247
Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!

298
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:19,832
We already know about Avdol. What a tragedy.

299
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,092
We didn't have a lot of time to do much
for him, but we gave him a proper funeral.

300
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:34,268
The one who stabbed Mr. Avdol in the
back was the man with two right hands,

301
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:37,106
but the cause of death was Hol Horse's bullet.

302
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,187
What should we do with him?

303
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,681
I'll give him his sentence.

304
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:49,091
Death!

305
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,035
Please run, sir Hol Horse!

306
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,037
I'll hold them off for you!

307
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,276
The hell?! Get off me!

308
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,594
I don't know what exactly is going on here,

309
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,247
but I do know I will always protect you!

310
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,606
You are my everything, darling!

311
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,569
Please run! Hurry!

312
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:08,205
Let go of me, stupid bitch!

313
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,756
Come on! What are you doing?!

314
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,933
Jotaro, Kakyoin, don't let Hol Horse get away!

315
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,664
It's too late.

316
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:16,307
Huh? Eh?

317
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,092
Very well said, my little sweetheart!

318
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,355
I'll gladly accept your feelings and keep on living!

319
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:31,109
Remember, I'm only running away because
I love you, baby, forever and ever!

320
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,081
Why, you...

321
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,057
Come back here!

322
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,799
Aah!

323
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,581
Oh, don't you dare, "aah," at me!

324
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,991
Polnareff, that woman is just another one of his victims,

325
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,154
and he no longer had any intention of fighting with us.

326
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,005
We have no time to deal with him.

327
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,550
Avdol is gone now,

328
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,885
but we have to forge ahead.

329
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:05,678
It's already been 15 days.

330
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,314
We don't have time to waste.

331
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:12,718
Damn it.

332
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,403
Guess it can't be helped.

333
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,875
All right, we continue onward to Egypt.

334
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:22,849
Listen up!

335
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,153
In order to defeat Dio, we have to fight as one.

336
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,895
We can't go off on our own, or we'll
play right into the enemy's hands.

337
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:31,998
Got it?

338
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,097
Let's get a move on!

339
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:38,312
Good grief.

340
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,159
All the old paintings on the tomb

341
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:17,327
They do the sand dance, don't you know

342
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,671
If they move too quick

343
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:19,807
Oh, whey, oh

344
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:22,125
They're falling down like a domino

345
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,493
All the bazaar men by the Nile

346
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,748
They got the money on a bet

347
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,194
Gold crocodiles

348
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:29,110
Oh, whey, oh

349
00:22:29,135 --> 00:22:31,389
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

350
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,664
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

351
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,047
Whey, oh, whey, oh

352
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:39,584
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

353
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:43,197
Walk like an Egyptian.

354
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,210
The blond waitresses take their trays

355
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:59,306
They spin around, and they cross the floor

356
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,580
They've got the moves

357
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:01,573
Oh, whey, oh

358
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:02,607
You drop your drink

359
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,108
Then they bring you more

360
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,378
All the school kids so sick of books

361
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,588
They like the punk and the metal band

362
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,015
When the buzzer rings

363
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,066
Oh, whey, oh

364
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,326
They're walking like an Egyptian

365
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,453
All the kids in the marketplace say

366
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,688
Whey, oh, whey, oh

367
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:22,493
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

368
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,270
Walk like an Egyptian
