1
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:08,922
Ah, my, that looks quite good on you.

2
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,887
In all my years, I've never received
such a strange request for clothing,

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,746
but the pleasure was mine, sir.

4
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:17,401
Here. I gotta go.

5
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:18,934
Keep the change.

6
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:20,506
See ya.

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,691
Uh, thank you, sir.

8
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:28,104
Let go! Let go of me!

9
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,550
And don't you dare touch me there, you jerk!

10
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,868
Hey, don't say it like that.

11
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:35,709
No! I don't wanna! I wanna keep going with you guys! Eh?

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,262
Listen, little miss.

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,363
We're not vacationing here.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,390
My daughter, Jotaro's mother,
is in grave danger at the moment.

15
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:49,089
We're on this journey to save my
daughter's life, not to put yours at risk.

16
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:52,117
Forget this running-away business, and start heading home.

17
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,515
I'm sure your parents are worried
sick wondering where you are.

18
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:56,833
There.

19
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,003
Fine. I suppose so.

20
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,479
I'll make you look good this time, grandpa.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,809
Huh?

22
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,874
Hmm? What's the matter?

23
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,067
Nothing.

24
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:14,702
See ya! Life is just a bunch of goodbyes anyway.

25
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,933
I do sort of wish I could have
seen him once more before I had to go.

26
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:23,560
Huh?

27
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,850
Goodbye, JoJo!

28
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:37,287
You better save your mom! We're all counting on you!

29
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,590
I'll be cheering you on!

30
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:44,715
Hmph.

31
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:23,278
Pakistan is a young country, established
in 1947 following its separation from India.

32
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:26,614
But when Japan was still a hunter-gatherer culture,

33
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:30,071
Pakistan was the seat of a highly-developed civilization.

34
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:37,076
Here in Pakistan, the people carry on the
5,000-year history of the Indian subcontinent.

35
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,281
I gotta say, Jotaro,

36
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm impressed you got a Japanese
school uniform made here in Pakistan.

37
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,199
The fit is perfect, too.

38
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,288
It's 100% wool.

39
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,433
Hey, Polnareff, are you okay driving right now?

40
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:57,190
The fog in this area is getting quite thick.

41
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,249
These aren't exactly the safest conditions.

42
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:04,754
It's one hell of a drop off the right
side, and there's no guardrail anywhere.

43
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,670
Hmm. The fog looks even thicker up ahead.

44
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,669
It's not even 3:00 yet, but we should head in.

45
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,625
Let's find a place to stay in that town for the night.

46
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,927
Do you think they have nice hotels?

47
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,042
A nice hotel, huh?

48
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:23,855
That's right, and it'd better have a decent bathroom.

49
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:29,877
I... I just couldn't get used to the really strange
toilets they have all over India and the middle east.

50
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,416
What the hell? Was that a dead dog?

51
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:39,887
What's the matter, Jotaro?

52
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:40,325
Hmm?

53
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,849
Oh. Uh, it was nothing.

54
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,066
Hmm?

55
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,733
Hey, this is a nice little town, don't you think?

56
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,555
There must be at least a few
thousand people living here.

57
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:01,035
Let's ask about a hotel at that restaurant over there.

58
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:08,177
But there's a weird quiet about this place.

59
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,135
No matter where we've gone, every
other place has been rowdy and congested.

60
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,563
It's probably because of the fog.

61
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:18,239
Listen up, guys.

62
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:22,741
In Pakistan and the rest of the Islamic
world, this is how you greet people.

63
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,926
First, you smile and say...

64
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:28,508
"As-salaam alaikum."

65
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:32,147
Eh...

66
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,976
Uh, no harm intended.

67
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,168
No need to close up shop just for us, sir.

68
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,003
We just wanted to ask a question.

69
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,536
Are there any hotels here in town?

70
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,222
Uh...

71
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,445
Anybody home?

72
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,998
I do not know.

73
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:07,629
Huh?

74
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,306
Good day.

75
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,307
Hey, wait a minute!

76
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:10,979
What do you mean, you don't know?

77
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,292
Huh?

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,286
Huh? What's with that guy? That can't be right.

79
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:26,797
I must have imagined it.

80
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:30,903
I'm sure he couldn't understand you,
because your pronunciation's so bad.

81
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:33,540
Let's just go ask that guy over there.

82
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:40,537
Excuse me. Sorry, but we're looking for a hotel around
here, preferably a hotel with nice, clean bathrooms.

83
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,051
Do you know any that...

84
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:48,982
Whoa! Hey, you, what's wrong?!

85
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,622
What the hell?!

86
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,640
He's dead!

87
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:02,713
With that look of fear on his face.

88
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,715
Wh-what's going on?

89
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,692
Why is he lying dead in the road?

90
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,523
What could have killed him, a heart attack?

91
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:10,650
A stroke?

92
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,914
It's possible, but look.

93
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,448
What we've got here is no ordinary heart failure.

94
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:16,932
Huh?

95
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,152
It's a gun.

96
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,620
Wait a minute. This guy's holding a gun!

97
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,653
You just noticed?

98
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,148
Check it out. It's still smoking.

99
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:31,213
He must have just fired it, maybe two to five minutes ago.

100
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,654
Either way, he must have died
right before we arrived in town.

101
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:39,508
Do you think he shot himself?

102
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:44,489
No, I doubt it. His body doesn't seem to have
any visible wounds, and there's no blood anywhere.

103
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,326
Then how'd this guy die? This isn't natural. Look at him!

104
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,727
His face is all twisted, like
he was screaming in utter terror!

105
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,268
Astounding.

106
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,745
You gotta wonder who or what he shot at with that gun.

107
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,135
What exactly happened?

108
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:59,802
Didn't anyone here see anything?

109
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,066
No one's stopped to help.

110
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:03,347
Excuse me! Ma'am, wait!

111
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:06,063
Someone has died here! Please call the police!

112
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,164
Pardon me, young man.

113
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,705
My boils seem to be festering today.

114
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:27,978
My apologies. You had a question.

115
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:30,251
What was it that you needed?

116
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,854
I asked if you could please call the police, ma'am.

117
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,868
The police?

118
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:39,167
What would I do that for?

119
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:40,834
Look!

120
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,256
That man's dead.

121
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,389
Hmm.

122
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,397
Someone is dead, you say? How terribly unfortunate.

123
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:53,933
I'm not sure if there is anything I can do about that.

124
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,346
I already asked you to call the police twice.

125
00:08:56,808 --> 00:09:00,216
Of course. Call the police. I think you did say that.

126
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,860
Well, good day, sir.

127
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,520
My boils are infected.

128
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:08,608
They are so itchy, so terribly itchy.

129
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,442
What is with the people in this town?

130
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,122
There's a man lying dead in the street,

131
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,979
and nobody seems even the slightest bit concerned.

132
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:25,278
Didn't they hear the gunshot? Nobody's
doing anything. It's like they don't even care.

133
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:30,108
These people are more oblivious than
the most jaded New Yorker or Tokyoite.

134
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,163
That dog...

135
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:37,134
This blasted fog just keeps getting thicker and thicker.

136
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:40,161
It's almost as if the fog is swallowing the town whole.

137
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,050
This is really creepy.

138
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:45,594
Call me crazy, but doesn't
that part there look like a skull?

139
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,014
What do you want to do?

140
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,660
You don't think it could be the
work of another stand user, do you?

141
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:10,075
Eh, probably not. There's no motive.

142
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:15,550
Why would someone who's after us kill a man who
has nothing to do with us before we even got here?

143
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,235
There's no reason for a stand user to kill him.

144
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:19,926
Who knows?

145
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,308
The way he died is obviously unnatural.

146
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,008
Let's examine the body before the police come.

147
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,191
Just try not to touch it.

148
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:27,842
Right.

149
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,305
This might be something.

150
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,960
It appears he was traveling, too, just like us.

151
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:37,542
He has bus and train tickets in his pocket.

152
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,092
And he looks like he might be Indian.

153
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,191
He's carrying Indian money on him.

154
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,263
I'm guessing he's not from this town.

155
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:46,167
Oh?

156
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,100
Look at this wound.

157
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,373
He's got a gaping hole here, right in his upper chest.

158
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,493
This must be what killed him.

159
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,471
Hang on. Why isn't there any blood coming out?

160
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,920
With a fatal chest wound this big,
there should be blood gushing everywhere.

161
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:03,304
Unless, of course...

162
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,696
This is no ordinary murder.

163
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,951
Looks like things are about to get messy.

164
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:10,143
We've gotta get to the bottom of this.

165
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:11,676
It's time to search him.

166
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:13,234
Take off his clothes.

167
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,725
What happened to his body?!

168
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,385
There are tons of holes all over this guy!

169
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:24,445
He's like that cartoon cheese you see on "Tom and Jerry"!

170
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,440
And there's not a drop of
blood anywhere near those wounds.

171
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,006
How on earth was this man killed?

172
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:31,652
What does all of this mean?

173
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:32,661
Be careful.

174
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,402
If there wasn't a stand user here
before, you can bet there's one here now.

175
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,836
Everyone, get in the car! We're leaving this town now!

176
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:44,535
What the...

177
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,195
Hmm?

178
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,395
Impossible!

179
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,802
This isn't the car!

180
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,638
Oh, no!

181
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,965
Hermit Purple!

182
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,546
Hey, old man...

183
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,253
What in the hell are you doing?

184
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,394
You're crazy.

185
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,001
Huh? Oh, no!

186
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:16,384
What do you mean, what am I doing?
The car was right here just minute ago.

187
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,332
Huh? What are you talking about? We
just parked the car over there and walked.

188
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:21,046
What?!

189
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,057
But just now, I could have sworn that...

190
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:45,871
Well, hello, good sirs. I see you are travelers.

191
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:49,999
I'm afraid, with this fog, it's
dangerous to leave the town now.

192
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,104
There are many cliffs, you know.

193
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,481
I run my own bed-and-breakfast not far from here.

194
00:12:55,991 --> 00:13:00,591
If you'd like, why not stay there for the
night? There's plenty of room for everyone.

195
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,973
I'll even give you a healthy discount.

196
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,437
Finally. We've actually met a normal person for once.

197
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:21,623
We have to assume a stand user
is hiding somewhere in this town.

198
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,244
With this fog, there's no telling what our enemy could do.

199
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,031
They could be next to us, and we wouldn't know.

200
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:29,177
We absolutely cannot let our guard down tonight.

201
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:34,841
You know, guys, I realize no one's attacked
us quite yet, but, damn, this town is creepy.

202
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:39,173
Come on. This way, master Joestar.

203
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:42,032
That building over there is my bed-and-breakfast.

204
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:44,707
Follow me, and I'll show you to your rooms.

205
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,157
Try not to fall behind.

206
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:50,454
I know it doesn't look like much, but it has history.

207
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:57,588
About 20 years ago, one of the 007 movies was filmed here,
and when John Lennon of the Beatles visited the country,

208
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,455
he spent the entire time in our little hotel.

209
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,044
What?! Seriously?!

210
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,895
Oh, no, I was just pulling your leg, young man.

211
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:05,415
Wha...

212
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:09,804
Still, it is quite a lovely hotel.
I've put my heart and soul into it.

213
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,005
We don't have any other guests at the
moment, so you can pick the dinner menu.

214
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,374
Would you prefer meat? If not,
we have fresh fish available.

215
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,819
Wait a second, grandma.

216
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,420
Before, you called me "Joestar," didn't you?

217
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,009
How did you know my name?

218
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:26,946
Hmm?

219
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:36,555
Uh...

220
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,711
Come, now.

221
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:44,853
That delightful young man next to you said, "Mr.Joestar,"
earlier. I may be old, but my ears still work.

222
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:46,037
You mean me?

223
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,443
I think I said it, but I'm not sure.

224
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,041
Ah, you did, sir.

225
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,992
When you've been working in this
business for as many years as I have,

226
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:57,272
you really learn to memorize people's names quickly.

227
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,528
So I'm sure of it.

228
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:03,685
By the way, ma'am, I just noticed the
bandages. What happened to your hand?

229
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:07,181
Uh, oh, this? A minor burn, nothing more.

230
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:12,769
I suppose it's just my old age, but I
accidentally spilled boiling water on it.

231
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:18,221
Oh, don't be silly, madame. You hardly look
a day over 40, and that's god's honest truth.

232
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,335
What do say you and I get dinner alone?

233
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:24,976
Oh, you naughty boy. Don't tease an old woman like that.

234
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:31,751
You damn babbling, pathetic fool.

235
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:34,591
It is you I despise most, Polnareff.

236
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:39,727
I'll make you suffer a pain one thousand
times worse than what my son endured.

237
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:43,756
Then I'll cut off your dick and
rip out your guts to finish you off.

238
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,753
Oh, this doesn't look bad at all.

239
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,764
Here, Kakyoin.

240
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,717
Right.

241
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,861
My autograph's worth as much as Lennon's.

242
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:56,236
Here.

243
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:58,268
I'm Paul-nareff, after all.

244
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,420
Make sure you take care of it.

245
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,122
Of course.

246
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:04,940
I'll make sure it's preserved for all time.

247
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:08,158
To commemorate the day I murder you.

248
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:09,501
It's done.

249
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:14,041
Well, then, allow me to show you to your rooms, gentlemen.

250
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:24,919
Man, talk about a weird town.

251
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,640
Now, time to hit the loo.

252
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,009
I don't think it's functional.

253
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:40,237
Oh. If that's the case, I won't be able to
use Hermit Purple to get info on the enemy.

254
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:41,929
Hey, Mr. Joestar.

255
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:42,775
What's the matter?

256
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,981
Looks like my room doesn't have a bathroom.

257
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:46,856
Is there one in here I can use?

258
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,032
Perhaps the bathroom here is communal.

259
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:50,954
Ah. Of course.

260
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,474
He's so carefree. Good grief.

261
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,884
A stand user could attack at
any moment. He should be on guard.

262
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:20,003
So the Joestar party is on the third floor?

263
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,889
Maybe me and my six-shooter ought to pay them a visit.

264
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:27,158
Ah, Hol Horse. So you've come.

265
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:31,995
That's right. I finally managed to track
those sorry bastards as far as this creepy town,

266
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,777
but finding you is a surprise, Enyaba.

267
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,512
I didn't think you'd come all the way out here yourself.

268
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,761
What's the matter, Enyaba?

269
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,351
Did I say something wrong?

270
00:17:55,085 --> 00:18:01,337
Forgive me. I'm just happy, Hol
Horse. It means so much that you're here.

271
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:04,966
Thank you for coming to see this lonely old woman.

272
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,257
It is so wonderful to finally see you.

273
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:10,817
Huh?

274
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:14,742
Tell me something.

275
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:18,235
You and my son were friends, were you not, Hol Horse?

276
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:19,618
Were we friends?

277
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,858
Uh, well, I...

278
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:24,268
Yes, we were as thick as thieves, ma'am.

279
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,429
So you were close?

280
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,906
Yeah, we were practically brothers.

281
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,541
He was a dear friend and an excellent partner.

282
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,421
What's this all about? You aren't
acting like yourself at all, Enyaba.

283
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:41,501
His death must weigh heavily on you.

284
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:44,652
Will you avenge him? Is that why you're here?

285
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,974
Yes! That's exactly it!

286
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,541
I'm gonna make sure those bastards
pay for killing my best friend.

287
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:56,768
That's exactly what I want to hear!

288
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,355
Because now I can kill you, too, you filthy traitor!

289
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:07,978
Enyaba, what the hell are you doing?!

290
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:18,363
Idiot. Isn't it obvious?

291
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,279
You abandoned him to save yourself.

292
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:25,362
I swore I would kill you the moment I saw
you again. You deserve the same as the Joestars.

293
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:29,192
How dare you call yourself his best friend? Cretin! Judas!

294
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,150
Wait! You got it all wrong.

295
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,483
By the time I got there, Centerfold
was already a goner, honest.

296
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:39,314
You wretch.

297
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,483
You're as unforgivable as that bastard, Polnareff.

298
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,757
I'll have you die at the hands of my stand, Justice.

299
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:48,236
Wait. Have mercy!

300
00:19:54,556 --> 00:20:02,781
Only a few have seen the terrifying power of my stand,
and now you will join all of them in death, Hol Horse.

301
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,187
Huh? What the hell is happening to the blood in my arm?!

302
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,501
It's like it's all just evaporating.

303
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:21,612
It made such a fine wound, did it not?

304
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:25,814
That's right. This is Justice, a stand that's made of fog.

305
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,769
Any wound my stand happens to graze

306
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,230
becomes a gaping hole, and then...

307
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:39,339
Justice wants to dance, Hol Horse.

308
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,278
My stand's fog has entered your arm, like a string, and
now you're a helpless puppet I can do with as I please.

309
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:52,718
You will die by your own hand, Hol Horse!

310
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,513
Damn it.

311
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,278
You shouldn't get so damn cocky.

312
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,382
Emperor!

313
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,860
Die, you crazy old hag!

314
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,470
Justice prevails.

315
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,480
Huh?

316
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,176
What the hell was that noise?

317
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,153
Sounded like an giant explosion.

318
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:23,552
It came from the room at the back of the downstairs lobby.

319
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,495
Is something wrong, Polnareff?

320
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:31,900
Huh?

321
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,983
We heard something strange and came to investigate.

322
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,739
Same here. I was about to check downstairs.

323
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,306
I'll look in the lobby first.

324
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:42,371
Call me if you find anything, okay?

325
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,784
Hmm.

326
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,631
Your time's finally come, Polnareff.

327
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:15,007
All the old paintings on the tomb

328
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,175
They do the sand dance, don't you know

329
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,519
If they move too quick

330
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:19,655
Oh, whey, oh

331
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,973
They're falling down like a domino

332
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:24,341
All the bazaar men by the Nile

333
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,596
They got the money on a bet

334
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,042
Gold crocodiles

335
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:28,958
Oh, whey, oh

336
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,237
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

337
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,512
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

338
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,895
Whey, oh, whey, oh

339
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,432
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

340
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,045
Walk like an Egyptian.

341
00:22:54,347 --> 00:22:57,058
The blond waitresses take their trays

342
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,154
They spin around, and they cross the floor

343
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,428
They've got the moves

344
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:01,421
Oh, whey, oh

345
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:02,455
You drop your drink

346
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:03,956
Then they bring you more

347
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,226
All the school kids so sick of books

348
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,436
They like the punk and the metal band

349
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:09,863
When the buzzer rings

350
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,914
Oh, whey, oh

351
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,174
They're walking like an Egyptian

352
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,301
All the kids in the marketplace say

353
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,536
Whey, oh, whey, oh

354
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,341
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

355
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,118
Walk like an Egyptian
