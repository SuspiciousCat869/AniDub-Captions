1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,839
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore...

2
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:13,011
So the Indian leg of our journey is finally upon us.

3
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,102
But, well, I'm a little bit worried.

4
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:22,147
I mean, is there anywhere to get a cheeseburger there?

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,567
I've always heard India was a land
of curry, disease, too many people.

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,488
I know. I'm worried my stomach
won't be able to handle the culture gap.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,699
That assessment is rather distorted.

8
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:33,992
You needn't worry.

9
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:36,870
It's a country of extraordinary people.

10
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,331
That, I assure you, my friends.

11
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,752
Well, we've reached Calcutta.

12
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,045
Let's get going.

13
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:51,468
Let me carry that for you!

14
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,054
Want a tattoo? You're very pretty.

15
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:57,108
Need some anti-venom? It won't hurt your stomach.

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,259
Stay at our hotel!

17
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:00,425
Calcutta, India,

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,022
in the 20th century, its population is 11 million.

19
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:08,906
Calcutta buzzes with a bustling energy
that will pull you in and never let you go.

20
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:09,787
I don't need any.

21
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:11,081
I stepped in some cow shit! Damn!

22
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,215
Seriously, thank you.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,992
Aw, crap. Somebody's already stolen my wallet.

24
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,526
Tip! Tip! Tip!

25
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:19,193
If you don't give me tips,
you won't go to heaven, sir.

26
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:22,040
Hey, kid, don't put your nose all over my stuff!

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,368
Avdol!

28
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:24,905
So this is India?

29
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,379
See? Great country, isn't it?

30
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:31,603
They're what makes India great, don't you think?

31
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,606
Here. Try this.

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,110
This is chai. I think you'll find it to your liking.

33
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:16,238
Chai, one of India's most popular drinks,

34
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,222
a sweet concoction made by boiling
black tea, sugar, and ginger with milk.

35
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,495
At last, a little peace.

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,122
Be patient with India.

37
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:28,724
Once you get used to it,
you'll see how wonderful this country is.

38
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,712
You know, I kinda like this place. It's pretty cool.

39
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:34,923
What, Jotaro? You cannot be serious.

40
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,885
It's a hell of a lot of culture shock, though.

41
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,763
Guess I'll like it once I get used to it, huh?

42
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,727
Well, I guess people adapt to
their surroundings eventually.

43
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,103
Where's the John?

44
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,563
It's right over there, sir.

45
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,351
Polnareff.

46
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:52,315
Yeah?

47
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,298
Aren't you going to order first?

48
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,360
Pick for me.

49
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:57,344
It better be something amazing,

50
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:59,413
something gorgeous and sophisticated

51
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,725
that suits a Frenchman such as moi.

52
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:05,579
Which means it doesn't matter, he'll eat anything.

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,582
Let's see. What's something he'll like?

54
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,000
Excuse me.

55
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,707
Pardon me, sir. Could you please wait?

56
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,061
Eh?

57
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,758
Huh?

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,677
Please use this while you're in here.

59
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,762
Hmm?

60
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,341
What am I supposed to do with this? Hey!

61
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,017
Hmm? Hmm.

62
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:33,142
Hmm.

63
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:35,936
Ooh la la.

64
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:41,155
I must say, the toilet looks weird, but at
least it's a lot cleaner than I had expected.

65
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:46,077
A gentleman like myself has certain standards
and won't stand for it when a bathroom is dirty.

66
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,325
Sir, is something wrong?

67
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,825
D...d...d...d...don’t "is something wrong?" Me!

68
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,702
Th...th...th...th...the toilet...

69
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,185
The toilet...

70
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,105
There's a pig sticking its head out of it!

71
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,294
Why, yes. No need to be frightened.
He's actually quite friendly.

72
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:23,297
The builders constructed the pigpen down
below higher than they were supposed to,

73
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,302
so when the pigs get hungry,
they come up for more. That's all.

74
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,787
But that's not even what I'm asking you about!

75
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:30,505
No. Wait. What?

76
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,873
So you're telling me...

77
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,625
That this pig's food is...

78
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,245
That's what it's there for?!

79
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,381
As I told you, sir, here. Use this stick,

80
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,008
like this.

81
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:48,529
See? Now you can do your business while the
pig's knocked down. Though some like the pig.

82
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:54,980
Our manager gets the pig to lick his
buttocks and always sings the pig's praises.

83
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,148
He gets it so clean.

84
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:03,363
Feel free to take your time.

85
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,866
Hey, monsieur, don't leave me alone!

86
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:13,241
I don't think I could ever get used to this,
no matter how much I tried.

87
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,629
I'll wait until we get to the hotel.

88
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,192
Sorry to keep you waiting.

89
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,010
Oh.

90
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,661
Crap, the food.

91
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:31,996
Hmm?

92
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:39,065
Where is he?

93
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,860
No way. Too weird.

94
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,987
I know I saw someone out there.

95
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,396
Huh. I must have imagined it.

96
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,984
I guess I can't help it.

97
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,662
I mean, there was a pig in the John, for god's sake.

98
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:55,089
Oh, well. Nothing there.

99
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,459
What's a little monster in the mirror, anyway?

100
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,796
So this is what they mean by culture shock here.

101
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:14,409
Wh...what the?!

102
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:16,261
Huh?

103
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,813
Huh?

104
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:22,150
What the hell is going on here?!

105
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,986
I can only see this damn thing in the mirror!

106
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:29,230
This must be the mirror stand Jotaro talked about.

107
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,493
Merde, this is not good.

108
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,629
Mon dieu! This is so not good!

109
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,460
Ah! Silver Chariot!

110
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:48,309
Huh? Where did that bastard go?

111
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:49,744
Damn it.

112
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,248
Huh?

113
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,863
A stand!

114
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:55,491
Hmm?

115
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,726
But where's the user?

116
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,688
Who is it?! The man with two right hands.

117
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:07,794
Too many people.

118
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,166
Damn it.

119
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,539
What's the matter, Polnareff?

120
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:11,700
What is this about?

121
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,381
If that was it,

122
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,299
if that stand belongs to who I think it does,

123
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,398
then...

124
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,318
That means I've finally found him.

125
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:25,714
Jotaro, the stand user who uses the mirrors, he's here.

126
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,050
The bastard who killed my sister.

127
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,885
My angelic sister.

128
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:38,059
The scum who heartlessly trampled
my sister's life, soul, and pride,

129
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,062
who destroyed the world's most pure heart,

130
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:42,794
finally,

131
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,643
finally we meet.

132
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,096
Are you absolutely sure it's him?

133
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,199
It's settled.

134
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,808
Mr. Joestar, I'll be traveling on my own from here on out.

135
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:54,409
Wha?!

136
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,251
With my sister's murderer finally within reach,

137
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:02,459
I'll be damned if I'm going
to wait for him to come after me.

138
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:06,588
I'm screwed if he gets the drop
on me, and that's just not my style.

139
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,757
I'll find him first and kill him.

140
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,129
But we don't even know what he looks like
or what his stand is.

141
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:14,804
He's got two right hands. That's enough for me.

142
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:18,533
And don't forget, he knows that I'm coming after him.

143
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:22,265
That should put him on the defensive
and give me the advantage.

144
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:23,771
See ya.

145
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,735
Tough talk for a man who's digging his own grave.

146
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,361
And that means?

147
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,847
Just as it sounds, my friend.

148
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,962
Are you implying that I'm gonna lose?

149
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:36,614
Yes.

150
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,979
Can't you see? The enemy attacked in order to isolate you.

151
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,873
He's exploiting your biggest weakness!

152
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:44,501
I won't let you go alone, Polnareff.

153
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,670
Listen up. I'm only gonna say it once.

154
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,913
This whole time, I never once gave a damn about Dio.

155
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:51,632
Hmm?

156
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:56,404
I told you in Hong Kong that I would go
along with you so that I could get my revenge.

157
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:00,021
Mr. Joestar and Jotaro already know this.

158
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,188
I've been alone from the beginning.

159
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,116
I've always been fighting alone!

160
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,514
You selfish fool!

161
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,283
Did you forget that you were brainwashed by Dio?

162
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,291
Are you so foolish you forgot
that he's the root of all of this?

163
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:16,296
You have no idea how it feels to have
your sister murdered, so shut the hell up!

164
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,993
I heard, the last time you met Dio,

165
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,204
you pissed yourself and ran away.

166
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:25,734
A coward like you would never
understand why I need to do this!

167
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,043
What did you say?

168
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,711
Don't touch me!

169
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:33,021
You just got lucky the day you beat me in Hong Kong.
Enough with this lecturing.

170
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,592
How dare you?

171
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,818
Oh, did that offend you?

172
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,747
But don't forget! I'm a lot angrier than you are right now

173
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:42,238
and with a hell of a lot better reason.

174
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,316
You can just keep being yourself

175
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,273
with your holier-than-thou attitude, Avdol!

176
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,034
Why, you...

177
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:51,568
Mr. Joestar!

178
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,237
That's enough. Just let him go.

179
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,158
Now that his mind is made up,
I doubt that anybody could stop him.

180
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,244
Yeah?

181
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,705
I've lost all respect for him, that's all.

182
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,666
My impression of him was completely wrong.

183
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,379
You are correct in that I did run in fear from him.

184
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,174
You see, I'm certain that foresight will let us win.

185
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,594
Rushing in without thinking will get us killed.

186
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:18,811
Oh?

187
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,806
Then I'll say this with certainty, too.

188
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,476
Your precious little divination will be wrong.

189
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,547
Time to get off.

190
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,508
I'm here to see a friend of mine.

191
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,464
Now get gone, girl. You're on your own.

192
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,558
Please make me your wife.

193
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,010
I'll do anything you want.

194
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:07,852
Hmm?

195
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,771
My life will belong to you.

196
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,148
Just say whatever you wish of me, my love.

197
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,607
Please, let me stay with you.

198
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,527
Let me be by your side forever.

199
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:18,947
Oh, come on now. Don't be stupid.

200
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,698
You're still only 16.

201
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,367
I'm old enough to marry.

202
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,119
I love you.

203
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:37,340
Listen. I'm just a no-good drifter, baby.

204
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,759
I live each day like it's my last,

205
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,512
and one day, the end will come for me.

206
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:44,072
Shh.

207
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:46,266
This is no life for a lady,

208
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:47,976
and you have royal blood.

209
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:50,144
We can't have a fairy-tale marriage,

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,064
no matter how much we might love each other.

211
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:57,151
Really? You've never said that before.
You love me?

212
00:12:57,302 --> 00:13:00,655
Yeah. You're the only woman I've ever loved.

213
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,866
That's just it.

214
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,419
It's 'cause I love you that we can't marry.

215
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,626
I want you to be happy and have something better.

216
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,164
You understand, don't you?

217
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,167
I know, sweetheart.

218
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,962
This breaks my heart just as much as it breaks yours.

219
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,674
But I'll come back to see you

220
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,177
and hold you like this whenever I can.

221
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:25,888
That's enough to make me happy.

222
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,682
Okay.

223
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,700
Goodbye. Love ya, darling.

224
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:45,283
Hmm?

225
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:51,122
You know, it's bad manners to eavesdrop.

226
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,642
You think I spend too much time on romance, don't ya?

227
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:58,516
Well, when you've got girls like her
all over the world at your beck and call,

228
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,799
well, you've always got an ally, a partner.

229
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,137
They'd do anything for me,
even throw away their own lives.

230
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,974
You are aware of how I work, aren't you,

231
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,018
Mr. Centerfold?

232
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:20,844
By the way, about this Silver Chariot's Polnareff,

233
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,273
seems that he left the group
and is looking for you on his own.

234
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:25,823
What do you wanna do?

235
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:30,064
He totally fell for your plan, hook, line, and sinker.

236
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,289
Heh. Shall we go and kill him first?

237
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,715
Huh?

238
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:42,757
Hmm.

239
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,448
Let's go.

240
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:10,201
You know, between your Hanged Man and my Emperor,

241
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:14,022
I have no doubt that we can kill 'em all, no sweat,

242
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,290
this'll be a hell of a ride.

243
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,419
So he really didn't come back after all.

244
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,779
What? You've seen him?

245
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,949
Are you absolutely sure you
saw a man with two right hands?

246
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,368
Where?!

247
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:36,662
Huh?

248
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,717
Eh? I just saw him.

249
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,719
I don't understand it.

250
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,679
He was just right there.

251
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:54,847
What?

252
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:58,226
There. He was with that man in the street.

253
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,625
The gun is mightier than the sword.

254
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,051
Eh?

255
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:09,495
Mm, not bad, if I do say so myself.

256
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,841
Wait. What?

257
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,615
Who the hell are you, buddy?

258
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,086
Hmm.

259
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,764
Hol Horse,

260
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,411
that's what they call me.

261
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm a stand user just like you
are, and my card is the Emperor.

262
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:27,691
Lord Dio paid me to get rid of you guys,
so say your prayers, and get ready for a beating.

263
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:31,373
Look here, cowboy, I don't give
a rat's ass who you say you are.

264
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:31,890
Hmm?

265
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,438
Where is the man with two right hands?

266
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,930
That was pretty rude.

267
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,307
You asked who I am, so I answered you.

268
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,017
Well, whatever.

269
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,219
I came here with that guy.

270
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,559
He's nearby.

271
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,135
What?

272
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,440
Where is he?!

273
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:49,348
There's really no point at all
in you asking that.

274
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:53,155
I, Hol Horse, will have the pleasure of snuffing you out.

275
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,345
Arrogant morons like you always talk trash,

276
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,704
and it always ends up the other way around.

277
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,735
Oh, was that funny?

278
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,959
Lord Dio had you pegged.

279
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,716
"Polnareff has the fatal habit
"of underestimating his opponents.

280
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:11,591
Beating him into a corpse won't be any trouble for you."

281
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:15,177
He was exactly right, so I couldn't help but laugh.

282
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:21,726
If I can't face him until I defeat you,
then that's just what I'll do, chump.

283
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,686
Bring it on.

284
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:26,383
Ever heard of military chess?

285
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,686
The tank is stronger than the soldier,
and the tanks are weak against the mines.

286
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,285
See, it's pretty much the basics of battle.

287
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,241
My Emperor is stronger than you,
so I thought I'd be a gentleman.

288
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:41,604
I'll let you know my stand's abilities
before we fight so we're square.

289
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,498
The gun is mightier than the sword.

290
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:47,043
Heh. Such a brilliant quote.

291
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:50,504
What are you trying to say, exactly?

292
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,999
That I have a stand that shoots,

293
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:55,213
and a sword simply can't beat that.

294
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,511
So, what? A peashooter?

295
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,275
Prepare to die!

296
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,819
You underestimated me!

297
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,448
And now, Polnareff, you're dead!

298
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,638
If I take off my armor...

299
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,874
I can knock down a bullet!

300
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:27,678
Wait. What the?!

301
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:29,511
That's impossible!

302
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,087
It bypassed my sword!

303
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,421
Oh, crap!

304
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:34,715
The bullet is also my stand,

305
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,214
and underestimating me just cost you your life.

306
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,521
Polnareff!

307
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,942
What? Avdol!

308
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:56,186
I've been worried about you,
and now look where you are!

309
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,437
Your ego will end you, Polnareff.

310
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,922
You're worried about me?

311
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,890
Damn you! You came here to lecture me again?

312
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,454
The enemy already knows everything about you!

313
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:09,333
You said you're a loner, but from now on,
you won't be able to win alone!

314
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,459
Hmph.

315
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,838
What bad timing for an outsider to interfere.

316
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,718
Polnareff, move! The bullet's coming back!

317
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:21,131
Go, Magician's Red!

318
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,348
I'll melt it down!

319
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,770
Damn that Avdol.

320
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,775
He went after Polnareff himself.

321
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:37,708
Where are you, Mr. Avdol,

322
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,738
Polnareff?

323
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,865
I have a terrible feeling.

324
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,021
Hey, there's a weird fight going on over there!

325
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,049
The puddle...

326
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:05,431
What the?!

327
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,136
Mr. Avdol!

328
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:25,945
Man, today must be my day.

329
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,498
My gun and Centerfold's mirror don't do
very well against Avdol's flames, you see.

330
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,441
We were sure he'd be our most formidable enemy.

331
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,794
Talk about luck.

332
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:38,631
With him gone, the game is in the bag!

333
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,509
Mr. Avdol!

334
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,765
H... He's just hurt. That's all.

335
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,768
It's just a minor wound. See?

336
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:52,750
He's going to start speaking.

337
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,391
He'll open his eyes in a moment.

338
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,982
Right, Mr. Avdol? Right?

339
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,777
You're going to wake up, right?

340
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,398
Mr. Avdol, you gotta wake up!

341
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:04,532
No, please! Mr. Avdol!

342
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,669
That seemed awfully easy.

343
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:19,755
It was too quick.

344
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:27,137
That's what he gets for lecturing people.

345
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,556
Look at him now.

346
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,642
W... What did you say, Polnareff?

347
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,446
Mr. Avdol was worried about you.

348
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,939
Who asked him for help? Because I never did.

349
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,965
He likes to meddle in other people's business,

350
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,194
but he's slow as hell, so they got him.

351
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,528
Guys like him just get in the way and screw up.

352
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,783
That's why I said I was going it alone.

353
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:49,869
You bastard.

354
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,163
He saved your life. How dare you?

355
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,876
Huh?

356
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,338
I am sick of it...

357
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,766
Having people up and die on me.

358
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,560
Polnareff.

359
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,565
I'm so sick of it.

360
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:22,526
You hear me?!

361
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:42,576
All the old paintings on the tomb

362
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:44,744
They do the sand dance, don't you know

363
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:46,088
If they move too quick

364
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:47,224
Oh, whey, oh

365
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,542
They're falling down like a domino

366
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,910
All the bazaar men by the Nile

367
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,165
They got the money on a bet

368
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,611
Gold crocodiles

369
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,527
Oh, whey, oh

370
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,806
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

371
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:01,081
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

372
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,464
Whey, oh, whey, oh

373
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:07,001
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

374
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:10,614
Walk like an Egyptian.

375
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,627
The blond waitresses take their trays

376
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,723
They spin around, and they cross the floor

377
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:27,997
They've got the moves

378
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:28,990
Oh, whey, oh

379
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:30,024
You drop your drink

380
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,525
Then they bring you more

381
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,795
All the school kids so sick of books

382
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,005
They like the punk and the metal band

383
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,432
When the buzzer rings

384
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:38,483
Oh, whey, oh

385
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:40,743
They're walking like an Egyptian

386
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:42,870
All the kids in the marketplace say

387
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:45,105
Whey, oh, whey, oh

388
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:49,910
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

389
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:52,687
Walk like an Egyptian
