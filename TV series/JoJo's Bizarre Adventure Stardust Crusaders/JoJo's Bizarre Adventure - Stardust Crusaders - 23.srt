1
00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:03,985
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure".

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,487
Tum-ta-da-da!

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,321
Here he is!

4
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:13,285
That sly bastard Avdol was still alive! Isn't that great?!

5
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:20,764
Mr. Joestar and Jotaro were the ones who
tended to the wounds on my head back in India

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,470
after I was shot by Hol Horse.

7
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:25,998
But I also had Avdol do some
shopping for me while he was laying low.

8
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,785
That's right! From here on out,
we're riding to Egypt in this!

9
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,477
You've gotta be kidding!

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,470
How did you afford this?!

11
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:22,273
The terrain has changed for Jotaro and company,
who've entered what divers across the globe

12
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,725
call the most beautiful sea in the world.

13
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:31,676
Flanked on the east and west by desert, the red sea was
once believed to have been surrounded by crimson sands.

14
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:35,786
Today its general lack of
pollution and inflowing river water

15
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:39,383
makes it one of the most
immaculate bodies of water on earth.

16
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,741
Hang on a minute. Are you telling
me you can drive this thing, Avdol?

17
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,735
Tsk, tsk. It's not a problem whatsoever, Polnareff.

18
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,467
Wow.

19
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,374
And Avdol's not the only one.

20
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,914
Don't even think about it.

21
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,665
I refuse to let you put us through another crash.

22
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,654
Well, you sure seem to be in a foul mood today.

23
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,258
So this is a submarine.

24
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:04,053
I have to say I'm a bit surprised.

25
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,451
It's a lot more spacious than I expected.

26
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,611
Isn't it?

27
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,560
Rich folks typically use vessels like
these when they want to get away for a while

28
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,401
and explore the seafloor for pleasure.

29
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,630
As you can see, it even has windows.

30
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,248
Ooh! C'est genial.

31
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:21,189
You know, come to think of it, I've
always sort of liked this kind of thing,

32
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,020
although I wish I could have
ridden in one with a cute girl.

33
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,370
Once again, you haven't changed, Polnareff.

34
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,181
Now could you please try just once to take this seriously?

35
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,780
Hmm? What's that?

36
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:37,460
This is sonar. It uses reflected sound waves
to detect underwater objects, much like radar.

37
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:38,109
Wow.

38
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,262
All clear.

39
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,617
I'm not picking up anything in our vicinity.

40
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,924
With this machine, we can
detect anyone trying to attack us,

41
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,761
no matter which direction the enemy decides to come from.

42
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:52,219
But if someone did attack us in
here, there'd be nowhere for us to run.

43
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:53,681
We'd be like trapped rats.

44
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:56,254
Don't forget where we are,

45
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,889
60 meters below sea level.

46
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,674
This sub is amazing,

47
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,876
but I guess it is a pleasure cruiser for the wealthy.

48
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,894
It has a refrigerator, a coffee maker,

49
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:12,691
and it's even equipped with
the latest in satellite phones.

50
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:13,537
Hey, Kakyoin...

51
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,203
I should call...

52
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,515
Would you mind getting me a drink while you're up?

53
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,326
I'm dyin' of thirst here.

54
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,398
I'll take one, too.

55
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:19,985
Sure.

56
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,867
Hmm?

57
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,106
Is cola okay?

58
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,592
Old man...

59
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:25,730
Why are you just standing there?

60
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,048
Something bugging you?

61
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,347
Men, I need you to give me a moment's quiet.

62
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:31,836
I just remembered I have a phone call to make.

63
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,893
A phone call? To where?

64
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,465
"Where?" is right.

65
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,280
Who would you need to call from a
submarine in the middle of the red sea?

66
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,106
Someone important, I assure you.

67
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:43,147
You might even call it a delicate matter,

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,253
so, as I said, I need you all to be quiet.

69
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:56,201
Oh, heavens me. I just don't know.

70
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,574
Which one should I pick?

71
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,365
Between the two, the sparkly
design is much more to my liking,

72
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:05,131
but is it appropriate for the charity event tomorrow?

73
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:07,491
Perhaps a refreshing white would be better.

74
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,476
Oh, what do you think, Rosas?

75
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,298
Both of the gowns look lovely on you, madam.

76
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,078
Hmm? Coming!

77
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:16,700
Yes? Hello.

78
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,218
Oh, Joseph, darling, it's you!

79
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:22,864
Where have you been? And where are you calling from?

80
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,288
What was that, dear?

81
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,043
It's a bit hard to hear you.

82
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,687
Right. Sorry. I'm at a hotel.

83
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:34,504
Here's the thing. I hate to say it, but, uh, I
have to attend some unexpected business that's come up.

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,088
Oh, goodness. It must be difficult traveling on
business to another country right after going to Japan.

85
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,345
It's been nearly a month, hasn't it?

86
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,332
Yeah, it has. Sorry.

87
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:48,255
By the way, Suzie, have you spoken to Holly?

88
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,633
Why, yes, I have.

89
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,969
In fact, I spoke to her on the phone yesterday.

90
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:56,005
She mentioned catching a cold that's
developed into a bout of pneumonia.

91
00:05:56,241 --> 00:06:00,794
She tried convincing me that it wasn't
serious, but I'm thinking about going to visit her.

92
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,748
No, don't. There's no need for that.

93
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,884
I'm positive she'll recover quickly.

94
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:05,888
You're such a worrywart.

95
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,167
So this is what he meant by a delicate matter?

96
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:08,973
Indeed.

97
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,022
Madam Joestar is still as
effervescent as someone half her age,

98
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:17,246
so he checks in now and again to ensure
she doesn't visit miss Holly in Japan.

99
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,877
That way, she's protected from the truth.

100
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,101
Are you saying that she...

101
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:24,824
I am. She hasn't been told anything.

102
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,550
There's no need to worry her unnecessarily.

103
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,251
There's nothing to worry about.

104
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,563
Well, if you say so.

105
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,669
All right, I understand.

106
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,752
I'll hold off on going to Japan.

107
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:42,859
While I have you on the line,
there's something I need to ask you.

108
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:47,092
I'm having a hard time deciding whether I
should wear the white dress or the purple one.

109
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,577
Is that so?

110
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,782
Suzie, I need to speak to Rosas.
Could you pass the phone to him?

111
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:52,607
What?!

112
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:53,488
Madam...

113
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:53,719
Huh?

114
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,547
Have you considered wearing your blue dress to the event?

115
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:59,359
If I remember correctly, it's in the back of the closet.

116
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,241
Hmm.

117
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,372
That's right. I'll go and have a look at it.

118
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:09,131
Hello, master Joseph. It's me, Rosas.

119
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,426
- Where's Suzie?

120
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:15,305
She left the room, sir. There's no chance
of her overhearing our conversation now.

121
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,162
I see.

122
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:20,975
I'm actually calling from the submarine
that the two of us spoke of a while back.

123
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,072
Oh. Then I take it you were successful
in reuniting with master Avdol?

124
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:28,441
That's right. Now, then, tell me about Holly's condition.

125
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:33,039
Surely by now you've gotten hold of the
doctors from the Speedwagon foundation.

126
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,034
Well, actually...

127
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:41,707
When speaking to her mother on the phone, miss
Holly says that her illness is nothing more than a cold.

128
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,561
She's quite insistent that there's no cause for alarm,

129
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,880
but her condition worsens by the day.

130
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:53,370
Master Joseph, don't you think the time has
finally come to tell madam Joestar the truth?

131
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,284
No. There's no need to get her riled up.

132
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,968
We're going to put an end to all this very soon.

133
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:07,243
I want Holly to go back to her normal life

134
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,205
and never know about any of this.

135
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:15,298
Don't inform my wife of what's going on
under any circumstances. I'll call again soon.

136
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,425
If that is what you wish, sir.

137
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,291
I pray for your safe return.

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,374
Oh, no! Did you hang up the phone already?
I wasn't finished talking to him yet.

139
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,482
Oh, madam...

140
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,711
It's no matter. Why don't we have some tea?

141
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,316
You will join me for a cup, won't you?

142
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,041
Hmm?

143
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,065
Madam!

144
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:37,901
Oh, please, madam, allow me to serve the tea for you.

145
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,317
Are you sure?

146
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,507
I'm sorry you have to do that, truly.

147
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,857
But you can rest easy, because
we're right here behind you.

148
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,855
We'll be in Egypt before you know it.

149
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,208
We must defeat Dio as soon as we can

150
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,220
and save miss Holly from his curse.

151
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:56,198
I have returned from the brink for this very reason.

152
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,369
Mm.

153
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,417
Thanks, you guys, really.

154
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,597
Driving this is actually pretty easy.

155
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,791
I suppose that's how you were
making it look so simple, Avdol.

156
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:18,127
For Pete's sake! Hey, don't get so carried away.

157
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:21,021
Believe it or not, the sea has
its fair share of rough terrain.

158
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:22,404
Yeah, yeah, I know.

159
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,731
All right, let's speed this tub up a little bi...

160
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:29,728
Polnareff, what are you doing?!

161
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,427
I had nothing to do with that! You gotta believe me!

162
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:41,946
I'm so tired.

163
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,257
Tell me when we're almost there.

164
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,252
One, two, three, four, five.

165
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,945
Oh, there's exactly five cups in here.

166
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:51,587
Hey!

167
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:55,170
Hurry up, and make the coffee, man. I want some now.

168
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,036
Then why don't you make it yourself?!

169
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:10,784
Good news! I've just spotted the coast of Africa.

170
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:12,673
We'll be there soon.

171
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,271
Sea water has worn away the rocks and carved
out an underwater tunnel near this coral reef.

172
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:27,246
The exit is 200 meters inland, which
makes this the perfect spot for us to surface.

173
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,454
At long last, we've finally made it.

174
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:32,623
Enfin! It took long enough.

175
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,252
So this is Egypt.

176
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,691
It is. We have arrived.

177
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,678
What's so funny?

178
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,433
Nothing. I'm just feeling sort of happy is all.

179
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:47,994
It's been quite a while since the five
of us were all gathered together like this.

180
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:56,909
Hmm?

181
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,910
Hey, Kakyoin...

182
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,506
Why'd you grab six cups for five people?

183
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,204
That's peculiar. I guess I didn't notice.

184
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,868
I could have sworn it was five.

185
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:07,577
Huh?

186
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:14,773
What the...

187
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:18,580
Old man!

188
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,112
Mr. Joestar!

189
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:28,579
Impossible!

190
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,493
It's a stand!

191
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,224
I don't know how, but it managed to sneak aboard!

192
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,544
Ora!

193
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,368
It disappeared!

194
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,203
No, it didn't.

195
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,267
It transformed! I'm sure of it.

196
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:48,111
The stand disguised itself as one of
the gauges, just like with the coffee cup!

197
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,299
Come again?! Merde!

198
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,173
The coral reef is right there!

199
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:55,214
And we were only a few hundred meters from reaching Egypt.

200
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:59,455
On the bright side, it looks like
Mr. Joestar was only knocked unconscious.

201
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,452
The problem is his hand.

202
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,245
Huh?

203
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,193
The phone?! Who'd be calling us at a time like this?!

204
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,179
Ignore it, Polnareff! We have to stay focused!

205
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,681
It's the high priestess.

206
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:12,969
Careful.

207
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:16,099
Our enemy's using a deadly
stand called the high priestess.

208
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,163
So how do we win?

209
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,735
By knowing the user.

210
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:23,074
The name of this particular stand user is Rose.

211
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,355
She has the ability to control her stand from far away,

212
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,318
so she's most likely on land.

213
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,596
What's its power?

214
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,378
It can turn into almost any inanimate
object, as long as it comes from a mineral...

215
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,095
Plastics, metal, glass, or vinyl.

216
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:40,104
Its transformations are perfect.

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,616
There's no way to recognize the
thing until it decides to attack.

218
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:48,167
That's freaky, but how did it sneak
aboard the submarine in the first place?

219
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,678
I get it now. So that's how it did it.

220
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,243
How simple. It cut a hole and moseyed on in.

221
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,423
The stand found a way to damage the ballast tanks.

222
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,892
We're sinking even faster now!

223
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,798
Not to mention we're losing oxygen!

224
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,475
We've got to get out of here!

225
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:09,684
Mon dieu!

226
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:10,758
Shut up!

227
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,046
Whoever's calling has horrible timing!

228
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,484
Jotaro!

229
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,305
Hey! Remember anything we touch might be the...

230
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:22,459
Hi again, Joseph. It's me!

231
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:27,947
We weren't finished with the conversation we were
having earlier, so I made Rosas give me your number.

232
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,023
Hmm?

233
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,049
Why aren't you speaking? And come to think
of it, what's with all the ruckus over there?

234
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,110
Whatever's in the background sounds like a siren.

235
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:44,483
I also hear running water. Is a bathtub overflowing?

236
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:48,567
I'm sorry, but the old man can't come to the phone.

237
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:53,644
I know that voice. Is that you? Jotaro?

238
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:56,345
Where's Joseph? You should be in Japan.

239
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,459
Why are you with your grandfather?

240
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,168
Jotaro, answer me!

241
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,709
There's nothin' to worry about, grandma Suzie.

242
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:17,267
He's gonna be just fine, 'cause I'm right here with him.

243
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:21,970
Later. We'll call back once things calm down.

244
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,045
Jotaro!

245
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:29,166
Brace yourselves, people! We're about to hit the bottom!

246
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:30,925
Oh, my god!

247
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,692
I knew this would happen to us somehow!

248
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:39,753
It's like every vehicle we
ride in ends up getting destroyed!

249
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,508
That is the last straw.

250
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:45,116
I'm never riding in a submarine again.

251
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,508
How strange.

252
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:08,099
I was getting through a moment ago, but now it
seems as though the line's suddenly gone dead.

253
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,595
And why was Jotaro there?

254
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:25,273
Hey, you guys,

255
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,527
the air is getting pretty thin in here.

256
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:29,322
Kakyoin.

257
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,127
I need your help.

258
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:34,406
Did you catch which one of the
gauges the stand merged with?

259
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,085
Well, from what I can tell,

260
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,309
it looked like it turned into this one.

261
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:56,783
Mm?

262
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:01,643
That's not it!

263
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,866
Jotaro, it's already moved!

264
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,980
It's right behind Kakyoin!

265
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:11,313
Hierophant Green!

266
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:17,332
Kakyoin!

267
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,750
Ora!

268
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,417
Everyone, head for the door quickly!

269
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,668
The stand's become part of the hull's
surface and is traveling through the machines!

270
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,320
Yeah, you say that, but...

271
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,442
If we stay in this room any longer, there's a very
good chance that none of us will leave with our lives.

272
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,081
Kakyoin, are you all right?

273
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:44,203
Yes, I'm fine.

274
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,197
Come on, everyone. To the next room!

275
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,510
We'll seal the room off and trap it inside.

276
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,907
There's no way!

277
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,800
It already moved to the door

278
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:04,367
and transformed itself into the wheel.

279
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,441
I have to let go before it's too late.

280
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,914
Its claws were able to slice through
Mr. Joestar's prosthetic hand like it was nothing.

281
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:12,994
What?!

282
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,809
Oh, yeah! We got it!

283
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,589
That was close.

284
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:24,331
Apparently our little friend
here isn't as fast as Star Platinum.

285
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,952
So what should we do with it?

286
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,417
Show no mercy, Jotaro.

287
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,847
Don't hesitate. Here's an idea.

288
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:34,240
Why don't we begin by ripping off its little head?

289
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:35,263
Works for me.

290
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,011
Eh?

291
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,501
That bastard.

292
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,330
It transformed into a freakin' razor!

293
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,628
How are we gonna beat it?!

294
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:52,925
It's strong! Damn!

295
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:00,004
I can't believe it outsmarted Jotaro.

296
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,282
What an enemy.

297
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,666
Huh? What the hell is going on?

298
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,979
Whatever's happening here, I'm
pretty sure that we're in a pinch!

299
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,154
Shut up, old man!

300
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,344
That beast will attack us if we touch it,
which means we should use our stands instead.

301
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:16,496
Magician's Red!

302
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,990
Silver Chariot!

303
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,659
That stand's a tough one.

304
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,899
Chariot's rapier can't pierce its armor.

305
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,172
Come on! Pick up the pace!

306
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:31,354
We've got to attack before it gets away.

307
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,303
I need all of you to stand back!

308
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,173
There's still some oxygen over here.

309
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:40,041
But it's going to run out before long.

310
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,464
Are you all right, sir?

311
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,964
Yeah.

312
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,872
Forget it, Jotaro! It'll only transform again.

313
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:48,342
We're taking on water fast, so we
need to find a way to trap that thing.

314
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,116
We'll figure out how to fight it then.

315
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:07,879
Don't get too cocky, because this battle isn't over.

316
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,879
I'll kick your ass soon enough.

317
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:21,935
What'd you say?! Jotaro, why in the hell
would you answer a phone call from Suzie?

318
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,265
Damn it. You know, you really shouldn't have done that.

319
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:29,697
Whatever. We'll talk about it
when we get out of this mess.

320
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,207
Leave everything to me.

321
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,043
Yeah? Do you have a plan?

322
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,768
You bet, and it's a brilliant one!

323
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:39,751
The one and only Joseph Joestar

324
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:44,778
has been in more situations like this than he
can count on the prosthetic hand he left behind.

325
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:57,454
For the life of me, I can't begin to
understand why Jotaro is with Joseph.

326
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,487
Has Joseph said anything?

327
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:00,336
No, ma'am.

328
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:05,897
Although my heart jumped with joy to
hear that boy's voice after so long.

329
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:11,053
I've heard my precious, little grandson
has been quite the handful as of late,

330
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:15,644
but deep down, he's a sweet child
who cares very much for his family.

331
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,307
Whatever they're doing,

332
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:21,159
I'm sure he's helping Joseph as much as he can.

333
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:26,261
You have no idea how right you are, madam.

334
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,029
Master Jotaro and master Joseph are most likely
in the midst of battling a common enemy as we speak.

335
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:40,735
They're fighting tooth and nail to save miss Holly,
someone very dear to them, from a curse of unbridled evil.

336
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,503
What do we do now?!

337
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:56,818
I have a feeling that she-devil of a stand
isn't really the one who's actually trapped here.

338
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,782
Sooner or later, that monster is going to
cut its way out of that room and catch up to us!

339
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,701
And to make matters even worse, as long as we're
surrounded by all this machinery, we're sitting ducks.

340
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:08,456
The submarine is done for anyway.

341
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,632
We need to abandon ship and escape.

342
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:13,279
We'll just have to find some
other way to make it to Egypt.

343
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,219
Are you forgetting that we're 40 meters below sea level?

344
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,801
I know it doesn't sound that far down,
but how are we supposed to get out of here?

345
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,202
Are we really scuba diving all the way there?

346
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,268
In my entire life, I've never done anything like this.

347
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:30,041
Hurry, everyone! Suit up on the double!

348
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,203
Oh, good grief.

349
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:35,419
Ah, I just realized there's no way I'll be
able to suit up in time with this busted hand.

350
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:37,149
Can you help me out, Jotaro?

351
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,354
Do it yourself.

352
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,094
All the old paintings on the tomb

353
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,262
They do the sand dance, don't you know

354
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:18,606
If they move too quick

355
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,742
Oh, whey, oh

356
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,060
They're falling down like a domino

357
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,428
All the bazaar men by the Nile

358
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:26,683
They got the money on a bet

359
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,129
Gold crocodiles

360
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,045
Oh, whey, oh

361
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,324
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

362
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,599
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

363
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,982
Whey, oh, whey, oh

364
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:39,519
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

365
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,132
Walk like an Egyptian.

366
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,145
The blond waitresses take their trays

367
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,241
They spin around, and they cross the floor

368
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,515
They've got the moves

369
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,508
Oh, whey, oh

370
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,542
You drop your drink

371
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,043
Then they bring you more

372
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,313
All the school kids so sick of books

373
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,523
They like the punk and the metal band

374
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:09,950
When the buzzer rings

375
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:11,001
Oh, whey, oh

376
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,261
They're walking like an Egyptian

377
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:15,388
All the kids in the marketplace say

378
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:17,623
Whey, oh, whey, oh

379
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:22,428
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

380
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:25,205
Walk like an Egyptian
