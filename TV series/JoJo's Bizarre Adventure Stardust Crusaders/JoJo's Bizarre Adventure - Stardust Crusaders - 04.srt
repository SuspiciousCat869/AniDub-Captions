1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,557
Fear, glorious fear,

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,789
it's a natural emotion present in all animals.

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:11,125
Now I'm curious.

4
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,675
Tell me. What do you think causes fear?

5
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:20,046
There is the kind of fear born of animal instincts

6
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:25,398
and the kind of fear born of a
rational mind that terrorizes humans.

7
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:29,913
Namely when you encounter a foe stronger than yourself

8
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:34,251
and realize you have no way of
fighting back against the unknown,

9
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:38,239
your helplessness begins to sink in

10
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:43,347
and evokes inside of you a terrible and paralyzing fear.

11
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:54,119
When you are faced with such fear, you have a
number of options before you from which to choose.

12
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:59,847
You might struggle, resist, flee, accept, or freeze.

13
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:05,608
But upon meeting lord Dio, a
new, unexpected reaction arises.

14
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:07,792
You feel joy!

15
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:12,449
How do you think most people
act once they feel joy in fear?

16
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,078
It's an interesting experience.

17
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:20,306
Our friend is currently on the plane
that Joestar and the others have boarded.

18
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,371
He'll greet them accordingly,

19
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:28,297
and they will find it utterly impossible to
reach their final destination in one piece.

20
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,357
Hmm?

21
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:51,809
Hmm?

22
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,144
A rhino beetle?

23
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:12,589
No. It's a stag beetle.

24
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,450
Hey, Avdol, is that a stand?

25
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:18,206
Are we already encountering another stand user?

26
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,650
It's possible.

27
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:22,650
This could be a stand that takes the shape of an insect.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,096
What the... it hid in the shadow of the seats.

29
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,018
Damn. It could be anywhere.

30
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:37,462
JoJo, it's next to your head! Look to your right!

31
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,175
Whoa. It's so huge. That thing has to be a stand.

32
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,424
No doubt. It's here for us.

33
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,602
That's disgusting.

34
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:21,223
Just sit tight. I'll take care of it.

35
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,867
Be extremely careful.

36
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:25,770
I've heard that there is a user of an insect stand

37
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:28,526
that likes to rip out the tongues
of his victims before they die.

38
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,272
Star Platinum!

39
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:34,461
It dodged you.

40
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,042
I... I can't believe it.

41
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,199
It's faster than Star Platinum, a stand that has
the speed and precision to grab a flying bullet.

42
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:44,242
Then there's no doubt about it.

43
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,403
That bug can only be a stand.

44
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,195
Where is he? Where is he hiding?

45
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,495
Where is the one who's controlling it?

46
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,543
We need to find him.

47
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,966
It's getting ready to attack!

48
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:58,946
No, damn it.

49
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:00,551
Jotaro!

50
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:01,378
JoJo!

51
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:13,010
Star Platinum stopped it with
its teeth just in the nick of time.

52
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,328
Just as I feared,

53
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:16,671
it's going after Jotaro's stand's tongue.

54
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,586
It's him, represented by the tower card of the tarot,

55
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:24,035
symbolizing calamity and the interruption of a journey.

56
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,458
This stand is called...

57
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,697
Tower of Gray!

58
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,552
Tower of Gray is responsible for countless mass murders,

59
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,913
which he made to look like unfortunate accidents.

60
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:41,906
The plane crash last year in England that
caused over 300 deaths was likely his work.

61
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,370
And how many more have there been over the years?

62
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:47,643
I'd heard rumors, but to think he's teamed up with Dio...

63
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,384
Ora!

64
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,298
It dodged that attack, too?

65
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,791
Not just from the single hand,

66
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,078
but it also dodged a two-fisted barrage of blows.

67
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,152
I... It's so fast.

68
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:10,587
Even if you had 10 guns to shoot
bullets from one centimeter away,

69
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,011
they would not be able to touch my stand.

70
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,838
Not that you could kill a stand with a gun, anyways.

71
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:19,055
You're all going to die with the rest of these weaklings.

72
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,114
He has to be on this plane with us.

73
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,603
Who is it? Who is the one controlling the stand?

74
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:33,022
Which one of the passengers is he?

75
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,177
If we can track him down, we can squash him.

76
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,435
It disappeared again.

77
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:46,821
Heads up. It's over there now.

78
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,685
What's it planning to do?

79
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:55,274
No. It can't be.

80
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,628
Bingo.

81
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,477
Got their tongues.

82
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,193
Now for the best part.

83
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:16,424
Massacre...

84
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,622
its definition, to kill everyone.

85
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:22,063
No. It actually did it.

86
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,543
Fine. I'll burn that damn bug alive!

87
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,910
Go, Magician's Red!

88
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,326
Avdol, just hold on a second.

89
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:31,707
Hmm?

90
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,253
It's so damn noisy on this flight.

91
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,821
What's with all the ruckus?

92
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:42,766
Be careful!

93
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,624
Might as well go to the bathroom.

94
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,089
Why's this wet?

95
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,916
What's with all this slimy stuff?

96
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,178
"M"...

97
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,220
"a... s."

98
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,694
Blood! This is blood!

99
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:04,252
Atemi.

100
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,931
We have to defeat it before the
other passengers start to panic.

101
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,596
Easier said than done, though.

102
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,562
Mr. Avdol...

103
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:19,211
Using an active stand like your Magician's Red inside an
airborne plane could make it explode, killing all of us.

104
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:23,780
JoJo, if your power were to rip a hole
in the fuselage, it'd be a catastrophe.

105
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:26,631
This calls for a quiet and discreet stand.

106
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,096
My Hierophant Green is most suited to defeating it.

107
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:32,082
Let me take care of the pest control.

108
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,856
Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?

109
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,681
I've heard all about you from lord Dio.

110
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,428
Don't bother.

111
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:43,978
You think you have silence on your side,

112
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,180
but your stand cannot keep up with my speed!

113
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,256
You sure about that?

114
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:54,656
Emerald splash!

115
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,923
Hmm? Emerald splash again!

116
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,304
You seem to think you can hit me if you fire enough shots,

117
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,431
but you haven't hit me at all.

118
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,300
Huh? Not good.

119
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,581
It's dodging everything he throws at it.

120
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,228
Kakyoin.

121
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,599
I'm just too fast for you.

122
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,031
You're way too slow to get a bingo.

123
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,042
And, Kakyoin...

124
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,567
With my next attack,

125
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:39,127
I'll stab your stand's tongue with this
tower needle and rip it out. Won't that be fun?

126
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:42,575
Emerald splash!

127
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,966
Don't you get it?

128
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,566
Damn. Impossible.

129
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:51,283
How can he win if his attacks don't find their mark?

130
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:54,914
You'll go mad from the pain once this rips its tongue out.

131
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,362
How exquisite.

132
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:58,992
Is that right?

133
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,802
If its tongue's ripped out, I'll go mad from the pain?

134
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:05,529
My Hierophant Green will go mad, all right.

135
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:10,384
What?

136
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:14,388
If it rips you apart, it'll go mad...

137
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,301
From pure joy.

138
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,913
His appendages had already slipped beneath the seats.

139
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,880
I just needed enough time to set up my little trap.

140
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:33,937
You didn't realize I was using my
emerald splash to keep you in one spot?

141
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,192
What the...

142
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,988
So that geezer was the user all along, huh?

143
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:53,252
Heh. Guess I should have expected as much.

144
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,356
A repulsive stand usually has a repulsive user.

145
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:01,792
Well, that's strange.

146
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,284
It doesn't look like he had
Dio's flesh bud in his forehead.

147
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,804
Tower of Gray was always evil.

148
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,046
He killed tourists by the hundreds and got paid for it.

149
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:12,920
He'd make it look like an accident

150
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:14,737
and got away with it every time.

151
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:20,147
I'm sure Dio was able to use him, because
he was easily bought and blinded by greed.

152
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:22,857
Eh?

153
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,631
Something's wrong.

154
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:31,103
It could be my imagination, but I get the
feeling this plane isn't flying straight anymore.

155
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,332
It's crooked. No doubt about it.

156
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,104
Huh? It can't be.

157
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,301
Hmm?

158
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,558
Sorry, sir. You can't be up here.

159
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,234
The cockpit is up ahead, so passengers may not enter.

160
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,251
I know that.

161
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,355
S... Sir, wait.

162
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,824
Oh. He's so handsome.

163
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,993
Move it, bitch.

164
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,075
What a shock.

165
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,622
Whoa, there.

166
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,697
Sorry, ladies.

167
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:12,168
His disrespectful behavior
towards you two is incorrigible,

168
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,528
but we have an emergency on our hands.

169
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:16,865
Please forgive him, for me.

170
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:17,928
Okay.

171
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,718
Damn it! This is horrible!

172
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,794
We've been had!

173
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,979
Their tongues have been ripped out.

174
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,713
That rhino bastard.

175
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:31,046
He killed the pilots before we knew he was here.

176
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,394
Hmm. We're losing altitude fast.

177
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,079
The autopilot's been destroyed as well.

178
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:45,418
Damn it, we're going to crash.

179
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:50,097
What?

180
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:59,518
My stand is the tower card, which signifies
horrible accidents and the end of journey.

181
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:03,298
I'll keep you from lord Dio if it's the last thing I do.

182
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,008
Even if you manage to survive the crash,

183
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,891
you're still 10,000 kilometers from Egypt.

184
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:13,229
Those who swore loyalty to lord
Dio will pursue you relentlessly.

185
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,270
You don't stand a chance in hell.

186
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,817
There are stands in this world with powers
that defy the very limits of imagination.

187
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:24,790
Lord Dio's power is the one that rules over all of them.

188
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,886
He is the master of stands,

189
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,913
reigning over the world like a god among mortals.

190
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,742
There's no way you'll reach him alive.

191
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,332
You bastards won't even see Egypt.

192
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,453
Your deaths will be swift and painful!

193
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,938
You're definitely professionals.

194
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,092
Good thing you didn't scream.

195
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,959
That annoys me all to freaking hell.

196
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,755
Now, I've got a request.

197
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:54,590
This heap's gonna hit water,

198
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,673
and this old man's gonna land her there.

199
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:57,087
Huh?

200
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,279
Go put life jackets on the other passengers,

201
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,917
and make sure they're buckled up.

202
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,909
Uh, yes, sir.

203
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,341
You got this?

204
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,247
Mm...

205
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,822
I have some experience with prop planes, but this...

206
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:09,990
Prop planes?

207
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:11,771
But, Jotaro,

208
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:14,148
this'll make three plane crashes for me.

209
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,886
Have you ever heard of someone
being in a plane crash three times,

210
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,445
let alone surviving each one?

211
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,203
That settles it.

212
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,358
I'm never riding in a plane with you again.

213
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:51,504
The plane landed 35 kilometers off the coast of Hong Kong.

214
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:55,517
Jotaro and the others had no
choice but to head to the city.

215
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,742
...south of Hong Kong, near Lamma island.

216
00:14:57,893 --> 00:14:59,903
Rescue efforts are now under way.

217
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,349
Hong Kong, Hong Kong island,

218
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,671
Kowloon, the new territories.

219
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:09,435
With more than 235 individual islands in the area,

220
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,149
its breathtaking nightscape is known
the world over as the million-dollar view.

221
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:17,547
Yeah, no problem. That'll be fine.

222
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,557
Please make sure the only ones aboard are us and the crew.

223
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,182
Right. There's been enough
collateral damage because of us.

224
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:26,773
By the way...

225
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,725
Hey, big guy.

226
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,630
Hmm?

227
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,386
You guys aren't from around here, are you?

228
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:33,826
Want some rice porridge?

229
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,682
Can't come to Hong Kong and not
try our rice porridge and dim sum.

230
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,383
We have some hot cola, too.

231
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:40,816
Rice porridge? Not bad.

232
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,635
Did you know, JoJo,

233
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,033
unlike in Japan, rice porridge
is a staple food in Hong Kong.

234
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,558
To some, it's quite a delicacy.

235
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:51,993
One bowl, the popular way, with
pork and century egg, if you have it.

236
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,086
Coming right up.

237
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,384
In that case, I'll have...

238
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:54,988
Hey!

239
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,131
What?

240
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,976
You boys think we have time to eat?

241
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:59,317
We're going to my old favorite.

242
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,273
You can wait to stuff your faces there.

243
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,148
Hey, you dandy guy over there,

244
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,127
I know you'd be interested in some Hong Kong hot cola.

245
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:08,502
Hot cola? That's blasphemy.

246
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,397
Everyone knows it's supposed to be cold.

247
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:12,959
Old man, who were you just callin'?

248
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,245
Hmm? Oh, that.

249
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,013
I'll explain when we get to the restaurant. Be patient.

250
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,058
We need to work out a plan that'll get us
to Egypt as safely and quickly as possible.

251
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,672
More users are bound to come
after us, and that could cost lives.

252
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,761
Right. A plan.

253
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,151
I agree with you.

254
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:34,326
We can't allow any more innocent
civilians to be hurt because of our failure.

255
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,192
The quickest way would be by plane, but that's out.

256
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,089
Indeed.

257
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:43,118
It's now become completely
impossible for us to fly to Egypt.

258
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:44,716
You see,

259
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,132
if we encounter a stand user like the last one
on a commercial flight, we'll cause a disaster,

260
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,772
one that will harm many people and might kill many more.

261
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,109
With that in mind,

262
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,920
we'll have to get to Egypt by either land or sea.

263
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:59,144
I hear you,

264
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:02,479
but if we fail to find Dio within 50 days...

265
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:03,639
Hmm.

266
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:11,334
If we could have stayed on that plane, we'd
probably be in Cairo, and this would be over.

267
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:18,999
I'm well aware of that.

268
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:22,476
However, it's too soon to worry about it.

269
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:24,820
One hundred years ago,

270
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,688
Jules Verne wrote "around the world in 80 days,"

271
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,983
a story about a man who travels
40,000 kilometers in 11 weeks

272
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,503
using nothing but trains and steamboats,

273
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:37,506
we may not have a plane, but we still have 50 days.

274
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:40,894
We'll be able to travel the 10,000 kilometers to Egypt.

275
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,784
And as for the route we'll take...

276
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,042
I say we go by sea.

277
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,140
We'll charter a suitably sized boat,

278
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:53,911
go around the Malay peninsula, and cross the Indian ocean,

279
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,565
"a Silk Road of the Sea," as it were.

280
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,575
I believe that is best as well.

281
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,934
Crossing by land could be difficult,

282
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:06,415
and we'd have to cross the Himalayas or the desert.
If we ran into trouble, we'd lose a lot of time.

283
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,393
There are too many dangers.

284
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:12,945
I haven't been to any of those places using
either route before, so I really don't know.

285
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,979
I'll leave it up to the two of you.

286
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,140
Same with me.

287
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,871
Then it's decided.

288
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,846
Now the greatest danger that we'll face

289
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:24,736
will be the stand users that Dio sends against us.

290
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:28,644
We'll have to do our best to
get to Egypt without being spotted.

291
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,667
Don't be so jumpy.

292
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,596
This is just to let them know we want more tea.

293
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:43,694
If you do this in Hong Kong, they'll
usually bring you more within a few seconds.

294
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,402
Also...

295
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,671
Anytime the server pours some tea into your cup...

296
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:55,334
Tap the table.

297
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,930
It's a way of saying thank you.

298
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,840
Excuse me. Sorry to be a bother.

299
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,731
I'm a tourist from France.

300
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:05,693
Could you help me out?

301
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:10,079
My Chinese is a bit rusty, and I'm having
a hard time with the characters on the menu.

302
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,321
Could you help me decipher it?

303
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,589
You're annoying.

304
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:14,904
Go away.

305
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,039
Come now, Jotaro. It's fine.

306
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,659
Try to be nice to the man.

307
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,114
I've been to Hong Kong many times over the years.

308
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,798
I can at least read the characters on the menus.

309
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,346
Why don't you join us?

310
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,578
So what do you want to order?

311
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:33,700
Dish with shrimp, duck, shark fin, and mushrooms?

312
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:35,129
Hmm.

313
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:38,932
We'll have this, this, and this,

314
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:41,303
and might as well get some of these.

315
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,676
Oh, and this.

316
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,208
Mm... hmm.

317
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,522
These look like dishes with beef, fish...

318
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,167
Clams, and frog.

319
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:53,043
Indeed, this is quite different from our order.

320
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,339
I knew this would happen, damn it.

321
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:01,360
Well, it makes no difference.

322
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:02,768
It's all on me, boys.

323
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,928
Besides, it doesn't matter what you order.

324
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,072
It's all delicious.

325
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,956
All right, everyone. Dig in.

326
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:17,482
Oh. This is...

327
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,905
You see that? And you were worried.

328
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:28,919
Well, they've certainly taken a lot of
time to prepare this. It's almost artistic.

329
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,431
Take these carrots, for example,

330
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,512
cut into perfect little stars.

331
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:37,086
In fact, it reminds me of something.

332
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,161
I remember now.

333
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,130
Someone I know has a mark,

334
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,211
a birthmark just like this on the back of their neck.

335
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,406
Know anyone like that?

336
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,825
Are you another...

337
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,216
Enemy?

338
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,270
Mr. Joestar, look out!

339
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,161
It's a stand!

340
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,235
Magician's Red, come forth!

341
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,208
What the hell?

342
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,297
You were right, another stand user.

343
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:29,746
Whoa.

344
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,796
He has such speed with his sword.

345
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:38,624
My stand is the chariot card,
and his name is Silver Chariot.

346
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,452
Mohammed Avdol,

347
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,629
it seems that I will be disposing of you first.

348
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,425
I've carved a burning clock into that table.

349
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,944
Before that clock strikes 12:00,

350
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:51,454
you will be a dead man.

351
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:14,583
All the old paintings on the tomb

352
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,751
They do the sand dance, don't you know

353
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,095
If they move too quick

354
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,231
Oh, whey, oh

355
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,549
They're falling down like a domino

356
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,917
All the bazaar men by the Nile

357
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,172
They got the money on a bet

358
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,618
Gold crocodiles

359
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:28,534
Oh, whey, oh

360
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,813
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

361
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:33,088
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

362
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:35,471
Whey, oh, whey, oh

363
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:39,008
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

364
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,621
Walk like an Egyptian.

365
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:56,634
The blond waitresses take their trays

366
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,730
They spin around, and they cross the floor

367
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:00,004
They've got the moves

368
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:00,997
Oh, whey, oh

369
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,031
You drop your drink

370
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,532
Then they bring you more

371
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,802
All the school kids so sick of books

372
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,012
They like the punk and the metal band

373
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,439
When the buzzer rings

374
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,490
Oh, whey, oh

375
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,750
They're walking like an Egyptian

376
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,877
All the kids in the marketplace say

377
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,112
Whey, oh, whey, oh

378
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:21,917
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

379
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,694
Walk like an Egyptian
