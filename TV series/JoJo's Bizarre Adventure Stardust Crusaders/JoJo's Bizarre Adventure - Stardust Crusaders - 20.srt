1
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:52,256
So this is Saudi Arabia, about
8,800 kilometers from Japan.

2
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:58,046
And it's been around four
weeks since we began our journey.

3
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:02,976
If we don't hurry, we'll be in serious trouble.

4
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,143
Kakyoin.

5
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:22,165
Hey, Jotaro. What do you think is up with Kakyoin?

6
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:26,580
First he nearly kills us in his sleep. Now
he looks like he's coming apart at the seams.

7
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,706
He even went after the baby.

8
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,887
Something's just not right. If
you ask me, he's at his wit's end.

9
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,899
I hate to say it, but really do...

10
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,151
we may have to sent him back

11
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,023
For a second there, I thought
he'd actually figured me out,

12
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:51,792
but now the poor louse is half-doubting himself.

13
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,307
To top things off, we're in the middle of the desert.

14
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,832
All I have to do is wait until they fall asleep.

15
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,175
If there's no one to wake them up...

16
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:07,854
Something smells good. What kind of food is that?

17
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:09,447
This is baby food.

18
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,840
It's a delicious concoction of milk, egg
yolks, bananas, and bread all stewed together.

19
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,760
So you wanna taste it?

20
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,198
Wow!

21
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:25,727
This is flat-out amazing! Give me more!

22
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,046
Easy now.

23
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,709
At this rate, there won't be any left for the baby.

24
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:33,451
You incompetent bastard, how dare you eat my food?

25
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,399
I'm wasting away over here, so
hurry up, and feed me, damn it.

26
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,875
It's... it's a scorpion.

27
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,763
What am I going to do?

28
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,209
That was a close one.

29
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,234
Crap baskets. Kakyoin was watching.

30
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,637
He killed the scorpion.

31
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,937
So I was right.

32
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,963
That baby really is a...

33
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,039
Shit. What now?

34
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,398
You're not getting any more.

35
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:26,066
Mr. Joestar, Polnareff, did you see that?

36
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:29,242
I was right after all. That baby's not normal.

37
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:31,487
He just killed a scorpion.

38
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,042
He stabbed it.

39
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,016
The boy skewered it with his own safety pin.

40
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,524
Kakyoin, hold on a sec.

41
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,171
What the hell are you talking about?

42
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,166
The baby, damn it. That kid isn't human.

43
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,820
He's not even a year old yet,
but he knew what a scorpion was,

44
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:52,721
and he killed it with those tiny hands of his.

45
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:54,489
A scorpion?

46
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,192
Where is it?

47
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:56,984
It's in here.

48
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:58,230
Huh?

49
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,196
Where'd it go? There should be an impaled scorpion here.

50
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,665
It's gone.

51
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,166
I swear it's true. He must have hidden it somewhere!

52
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,195
Check his clothes!

53
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:19,087
We get the point. Knock it off, Kakyoin. That's enough.

54
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,451
Mr. Joestar.

55
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,383
Like I said before, you're clearly exhausted.

56
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:23,921
But...

57
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,669
Let's table this, at least for tonight.

58
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,508
We'll talk after you've calmed down.

59
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,140
Okay, here's the choo-choo.

60
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,375
It's dewicious.

61
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,169
Uh-oh. What's the matter? You
were hungry a minute ago, right?

62
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,555
Did you lose that big appetite?

63
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:03,234
Would you stop shoving that spoon in my
face? I can't eat right now, you idiot!

64
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,998
Mr. Joestar, listen!

65
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:07,834
I'm not imagining things.

66
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:12,276
I don't know where he could have hidden the
blasted scorpion, but I'm sure that he's a stand user,

67
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:15,894
and I have just the thing to prove
to you that I'm telling the truth.

68
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:18,574
Do you see these cuts?

69
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,256
Read what the letters spell out.

70
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,362
Can't you see that it's a warning?

71
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,975
It must have happened to me when I was sleeping earlier.

72
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,651
Oh, my god!

73
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:34,323
Kakyoin, you didn't do that to yourself, did you?

74
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:35,601
Say what?

75
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,295
I-it's finally happened. Kakyoin.

76
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,707
Oh, my god.

77
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:48,537
You colossal buffoon. How stupid can you be?

78
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:53,141
Didn't you realize if you showed them the
cuts on your arm, they'd think you were crazy?

79
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,766
What's going on? Did I make things even worse?

80
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,476
Then it looks like I have no other choice.

81
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:02,896
It's time for a little force.

82
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,136
Hierophant Green!

83
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:14,543
It's no use.

84
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,762
Damn it. The guy has completely lost his mind.

85
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,984
This can't be happening.

86
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,537
I'm certain of what I saw, Jotaro.

87
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,834
His stand was the one we fought in our dreams, Polnareff.

88
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,721
We can't fall asleep, Mr. Joestar.

89
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,467
Believe me, everyone,

90
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:38,549
if we fall asleep, we'll all be killed.

91
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,527
Please, You have to believe me.

92
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:50,526
Yes! My secret is still safe, which means the end is near.

93
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,447
Your petty mistrust just cost you your lives.

94
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,892
Victory is mine, fools.

95
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,407
I can't believe it.

96
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:01,601
If he's like this, does that mean Kakyoin
can't fight or travel with us anymore?

97
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,167
We'll discuss it in the morning.

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,775
Let's get some sleep.

99
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:10,802
Polnareff, give me a hand moving Kakyoin.

100
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:11,975
Sure thing.

101
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:14,526
Jotaro, you bring the sleeping bags.

102
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,350
Right.

103
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,220
You say something?

104
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,863
No. He's just really heavy.

105
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,693
I've got you right where I want you.

106
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:27,815
I'm gonna slice you up and scatter
your remains all over the desert.

107
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,854
What in the world?

108
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:59,672
Why are we in the middle of an amusement
park? We were just out in the desert.

109
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:00,499
That's right.

110
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:01,170
Eh?

111
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,015
I know this place.

112
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,822
Jotaro, Mr. Joestar, be on your guard.

113
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:09,323
M-my memory is coming back.

114
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,644
We've been transported to a dream world...

115
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,117
A horrible one.

116
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,135
This is bad.

117
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,193
We've entered a world of nightmares.

118
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,660
Oh, so it's a dream, huh?

119
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:23,263
You had me a little worried for a minute there.

120
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,695
Don't make the same mistake that I did!

121
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,315
Listen, everything Kakyoin said to us earlier is true.

122
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,697
Baby... stand.

123
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,035
We are in enemy territory.

124
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:39,438
I know none of these make any kind of
sense, but the stand user is that baby.

125
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:46,843
There's no one left to wake you from your slumber now,

126
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:51,987
and that means there's absolutely no
way for you to escape Death 13's world.

127
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:57,228
I'll finally finish you off once and for all.

128
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,319
Why did I have to hit Kakyoin and knock him out?

129
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:05,330
But since I did that...

130
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,445
He should already be here! We've got to find him.

131
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,884
Where in the world are you, Kakyoin?!

132
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,401
I have to find a way to make this up to you.

133
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:17,501
P-Polnareff! Good lord, what is going on with your hair?!

134
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,248
Did you mess up brushing it?!

135
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:32,643
Polnareff!

136
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:36,299
What the...

137
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:41,378
Ahh! What's going on? My prosthetic hand is...

138
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,854
Yah! Holy shit bricks!

139
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:53,876
How are we supposed to fight this? It's maddening.

140
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,925
Damn, anything can happen in this world.

141
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,661
There are no rules here. Nothing makes sense.

142
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,926
As long as we're in this place,
we're completely at his mercy.

143
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,683
Wait. I remember there being one rule...

144
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,288
His murder weapon.

145
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:14,716
If he wants to slice us to pieces,
then he'll have to use his stand...

146
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,895
And nothing but his stand.

147
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,757
Lali-ho!

148
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,083
Lali-ho!

149
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:41,883
Ora! Star...

150
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:46,395
Jotaro, it's no use! It's impossible
for us to bring our stands into this world!

151
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:47,705
Platinum!

152
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,020
That's weird.

153
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:52,891
His stand manifested.

154
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:19,016
Lali-ho.

155
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,996
Surprise. I'm a fake.

156
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:27,852
Oh, the overwhelming power, the
absolute terror, it's so much fun!

157
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,359
A stand is a manifestation of the mind,

158
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,622
and what are dreams if not the mind laid bare?

159
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:42,173
My Death 13 has trapped you within your subconscious,
which is why you can't summon your precious stands.

160
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:43,595
Although...

161
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:49,366
Things might be different had you
summoned your stands before you fell asleep.

162
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:54,103
Then, they would have appeared here with you,

163
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,722
just like your clothes, sleeping
bags, and your prosthetic hand.

164
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:03,353
Death 13 will never be forced
to face another stand in battle.

165
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:09,713
And, as you know, the only thing that can defeat a
stand is another stand, so I'll always come out on top.

166
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:17,006
Now that I have all of you in my cross
hairs, how about you give me a scream,

167
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:21,650
one that captures the joy and elation
I'm about to feel at my easy victory?!

168
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,172
Lali... ho?

169
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,803
Lali-ho.

170
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:28,558
Oh, it's just one of the fakes I made.

171
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,424
What? I don't understand.

172
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,735
This one doesn't seem to be a fake.

173
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,849
This is the real Hierophant.

174
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,978
It's normal.

175
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:48,365
Look! It's Kakyoin.

176
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,392
Kakyoin's right there.

177
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:54,670
Obviously it slipped your notice
that I'd already summoned my Hierophant

178
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,713
by the time I was knocked unconscious.

179
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,367
What's more, I had it burrow underground to conceal
itself from detection just before I fell asleep.

180
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:05,610
You can't do this.

181
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,703
Now, it's time for your punishment, baby.

182
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,174
Damn that bastard.

183
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:18,710
Let go!

184
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:21,477
Give up, Death 13.

185
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,615
I had Hierophant place himself in your blind spot.

186
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,150
If you keep up this futile struggling...

187
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,752
I really don't care that you're a baby,

188
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,939
I'll snap your neck like a twig.

189
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,059
Kakyoin!

190
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,845
Kakyoin, the three of us owe you an enormous apology.

191
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,559
I thought after the hell you'd been through on
this trip, you might have suddenly lost your sanity.

192
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,740
I mean, a baby stand user?

193
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,029
You were fighting this battle
alone, and for that, I'm sorry.

194
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:54,848
Don't worry, Polnareff.

195
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:56,165
It couldn't have been helped.

196
00:14:56,487 --> 00:15:00,173
You were the reason I found a way to
bring my stand to the dream world with me.

197
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,090
If you hadn't hit me, we'd be stuck
here without a way to defend ourselves,

198
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,721
so, in a way, this is all thanks to you.

199
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,656
Yeah? Do you mean that?

200
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:12,711
Gee, now I feel conflicted about
the whole thing. That's embarrassing.

201
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,468
Kakyoin hasn't killed me yet, because I'm a baby.

202
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:25,108
Kakyoin, that compassion of you cost is a fatal fault.

203
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:30,111
In case you've forgotten, you're all
still trapped inside my nightmare world.

204
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:39,732
What's up with these clouds?

205
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:43,106
No kidding. They're changing shape and closing in.

206
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:47,861
I warn you now, don't try anything, Death 13.

207
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,145
Kakyoin, you have to get Hierophant
away from his back before it's too late.

208
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,808
How did...

209
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,929
I'll chop you in half!

210
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,111
Impossible.

211
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,128
How could he do that?

212
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,665
He... he chopped himself in half.

213
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:16,705
Kakyoin! No!

214
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,816
Lali-ho.

215
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:21,523
Haven't you figured it out yet?

216
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,185
Death 13's body is as hollow
as the space between your ears.

217
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:31,607
My stand is only comprised of the head,
arms, and the giant scythe it wields.

218
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:34,105
You gigantic ignoramuses.

219
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,237
Let's see.

220
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:42,092
Given the way the stands work, Kakyoin's body
should also be split in two inside the sleeping bag.

221
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,723
Nah, just kidding.

222
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,137
Kakyoin!

223
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:47,034
Hey, you sure you're all right?

224
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,419
Hah. Please take a closer look.

225
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:52,038
Surely you know Hierophant isn't that careless.

226
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:55,280
He wouldn't just stay on the enemy's
back without a plan in the wings.

227
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,661
He's not chopped in half.

228
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:09,388
He's turned into a snakelike thing,
and he's slithering into my ear!

229
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,973
My arm is moving on its own!

230
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,637
No! It's coming in!

231
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:36,327
I told you before, my stand was in your blind spot,

232
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:37,996
and your scythe couldn't cut him.

233
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,755
Now, then, unless you'd like to
be destroyed from the inside out,

234
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:45,242
how about you do me a favor and heal the cuts on my arm?

235
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,747
Anything is possible in a dream, right?

236
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,074
So healing a cut should be easy.

237
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,726
R-right.

238
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:05,441
All right, everyone, time to wake up.

239
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,111
Come on, Polnareff. Up and at 'em.

240
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:13,295
There's a nice breakfast waiting for you.

241
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:20,252
I feel like I had a terrible dream last night.

242
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:26,283
You and me both. I can't remember it, but I
have the sneaking suspicion that it was terrifying.

243
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,343
Kakyoin.

244
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,230
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

245
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:33,381
I'm fine.

246
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,209
What? Are you positive?

247
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:39,553
'Cause you were acting like a deranged lunatic
last night. You even carved letters in your...

248
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,418
Arm.

249
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,776
Wait. What?

250
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,405
Where did the wound go?

251
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:48,596
All right, I think I'll change the baby's diaper now.

252
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,951
What in the world?

253
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,989
It's morning, sleepyhead.

254
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,924
He seems to be getting along famously with the baby.

255
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,040
Maybe I just dreamed the whole thing.

256
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,260
Well, then, did you have a good rest?

257
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,641
Oh, well. Never mind.

258
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,109
Everyone's forgotten.

259
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:18,094
A stand whose very existence is completely forgotten,

260
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:20,596
what a strange creature.

261
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:23,689
But I haven't forgotten anything.

262
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:28,137
Since I brought my stand into the
dream with me, my memories are intact.

263
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,808
Listen, because you're just a baby,

264
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:35,022
I won't eliminate you. I won't even injure you.

265
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:37,501
We'll take you to a nearby town.

266
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,920
You need to be returned to your mother.

267
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,538
However, don't come anywhere near us again.

268
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,037
If you do, you'll have to be punished...

269
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,720
In a manner such as this.

270
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,073
Huh? Is that my poop?

271
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:05,263
Oh, Kakyoin. I see you've made
some baby food for the little lad.

272
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:06,643
Yes.

273
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:09,727
Good work. I'm sure he must be starving by now.

274
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,979
Hey, no, you wouldn't.

275
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,839
Eat up. These yum-yums are dewicious.

276
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:22,027
Say, "ahh."

277
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,280
This again? What's the problem?

278
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,552
It's as if he doesn't like the stuff.

279
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:33,167
At this rate, I'll have to force-feed him.

280
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,420
Stop!

281
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,755
You can't force it, Mr. Joestar.

282
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,546
If you do, he'll just end up hating it even more.

283
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:42,683
In special cases like this...

284
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:48,599
Ah, coochie-coo. Ah, coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coo.

285
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,362
Ah, coochie-coochie-coochie-coo.

286
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,190
I told you it was delicious.

287
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:01,130
Ba-dum-bum.

288
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,864
Joestar and the others have
now crossed the Arabian Peninsula

289
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:18,292
and are currently making their way across the
red sea as they prepare to enter Egypt, but...

290
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,785
Hey, old man, something's off.

291
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:24,917
You're going the wrong direction.

292
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,610
If you're headed to Egypt, shouldn't
you be traveling directly west?

293
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,509
You seem to be heading toward that island.

294
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:36,466
That's right. Nice deduction.

295
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,203
I've had my reasons for keeping this to myself,

296
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,839
but before we arrive in Egypt,
we need to make a slight detour.

297
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:45,387
Someone is waiting for us on the island.

298
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:50,391
He's a man who is extremely important to our journey.

299
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:53,247
What is that supposed to mean?

300
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:15,545
All the old paintings on the tomb

301
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,713
They do the sand dance, don't you know

302
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,057
If they move too quick

303
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,193
Oh, whey, oh

304
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,511
They're falling down like a domino

305
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,879
All the bazaar men by the Nile

306
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:27,134
They got the money on a bet

307
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,580
Gold crocodiles

308
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,496
Oh, whey, oh

309
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,775
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

310
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,050
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

311
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:36,433
Whey, oh, whey, oh

312
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,970
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

313
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:43,583
Walk like an Egyptian.

314
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:57,596
The blond waitresses take their trays

315
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,692
They spin around, and they cross the floor

316
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:00,966
They've got the moves

317
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:01,959
Oh, whey, oh

318
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:02,993
You drop your drink

319
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:04,494
Then they bring you more

320
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,764
All the school kids so sick of books

321
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,974
They like the punk and the metal band

322
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:10,401
When the buzzer rings

323
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,452
Oh, whey, oh

324
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,712
They're walking like an Egyptian

325
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,839
All the kids in the marketplace say

326
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:18,074
Whey, oh, whey, oh

327
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:22,879
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

328
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:25,656
Walk like an Egyptian
