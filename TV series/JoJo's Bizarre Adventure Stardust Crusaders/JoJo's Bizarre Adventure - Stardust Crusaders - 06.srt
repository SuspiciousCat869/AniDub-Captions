1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,572
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,905
Mrs. Kujo has materialized her own stand!

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,777
I'll keep you from lord Dio if it's the last thing I do.

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,803
But if we fail to find Dio within 50 days...

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,578
Someone I know has a mark,

6
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:18,643
a birthmark just like this on the back of their neck.

7
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,137
Know anyone like that?

8
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:21,042
What?!

9
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:28,731
If that is true, I must join you
on your trek to Egypt, messieurs.

10
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:32,561
By going after Dio, I will find
the one who took my sister's life!

11
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,474
The loathsome curse of Dio.

12
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:10,690
Even the Speedwagon foundation's leading
physicians with their cutting-edge treatments

13
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:13,302
stand powerless before Dio's curse.

14
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:20,166
To save Holly, JoJo and crew
continue on their journey to Egypt.

15
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,552
With air travel now too treacherous,

16
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,372
they board a boat, heading first to Singapore.

17
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,285
To get from Hong Kong to Singapore,

18
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,788
we'll be on the water for three full days.

19
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:36,161
Well, let's relax and keep our spirits up.

20
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,679
But first, I have a serious question.

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,085
What the hell is with the high school uniforms, you two?

22
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,931
Can't you go and find something else to put on?

23
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:47,972
Isn't it ridiculously hot?

24
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,798
Well, we are students, after all,

25
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,957
and good students should behave
as such, no matter where they are,

26
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,921
but I guess that sounds like a stretch.

27
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,684
Hmph.

28
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:56,681
Hah!

29
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,498
Japanese students are such stiffs, aren't they?

30
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,769
So this is what they call Bushido.

31
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,819
Like they say, clear your mind, and even flames feel cool.

32
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:08,157
That's all well and good, but
that really won't get you any girls.

33
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:08,830
Let go!

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,038
Huh?

35
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,239
Let go of me!

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,850
Damn it, I said get off of me!

37
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,104
Shut your trap!

38
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,941
Let me go! What's your problem?

39
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:14,906
You brat!

40
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:19,440
Hey, who's that? I thought we agreed
there'd be no other passengers on-board but us.

41
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,951
Sorry, sir. It's a stowaway.

42
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,839
This little brat was hiding in
one of the storage holds below.

43
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,142
Stowaway?

44
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:30,172
What you waitin' for? Come at
me! I'll fricking break your balls!

45
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,878
Tell that to the police, you little shit. I dare you.

46
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,513
What? The police?

47
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:35,886
Wait. I'm sorry, all right?

48
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,235
Please, just let me go.

49
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,124
I just wanted to go to Singapore
to see my dad. That's all.

50
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:43,020
I'll do anything. You could
even put me to work for my ticket.

51
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,895
Let's see. What should I do?

52
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,749
Should I let you go or turn you in?

53
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,538
What to do? What to do?

54
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,673
We could use another cabin boy.

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,008
No way I'm letting you go.

56
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:57,392
That's too easy.

57
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:02,717
But first, I'm gonna let the captain know.

58
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:11,188
Whoa. In he goes. That kid's got guts.

59
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:13,723
Is he planning to swim to shore from out here?

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,055
What should we do?

61
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:17,689
Just leave him.

62
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,380
He wouldn't have dived in if he wasn't a good swimmer.

63
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,037
No, he's in danger!

64
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,916
This entire area is infested with sharks!

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,936
This isn't good.

66
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,758
Hey, kid, come back! It's dangerous! You'll die!

67
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,493
Listen to us! There's sharks out there!

68
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,819
Ora, or a, or a!

69
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:19,041
Good grief. Come on, you brat.

70
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:26,583
Hold on.

71
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,057
A girl?

72
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,640
And a runty one, at that. Just my luck.

73
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,897
Hey, how dare you feel me up like that, you bastard?!

74
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:42,926
Hands off!

75
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,268
Good grief, kid.

76
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:57,710
Huh?

77
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,948
Hey, Jotaro, below you!

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,423
Something's coming after you from underwater.

79
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,833
It's not a shark, and it's racing towards you!

80
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,625
You have to get out of there now!

81
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,478
Hurry! Swim to the boat!

82
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:16,897
He's too far away.

83
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,293
If it's at that distance, leave it to my Hierophant Green!

84
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,253
It just disappeared!

85
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:34,265
That thing is a stand!

86
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,584
Stunning, an aquatic stand.

87
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:39,949
In all my dealings with the occult,
I've never heard of such a thing.

88
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,382
This girl, there's no way she's the...

89
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,373
Could she be that stand's user?

90
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:54,120
Did she try to lead JoJo into
shark-infested waters on purpose?

91
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,000
Eh? Jeez, what's with you jerks?

92
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,733
Stop staring like that. It's creepy.

93
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:02,102
I have no idea what's going on here, but I'll fight you!

94
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,218
Don't underestimate me, okay?

95
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,048
You're gonna regret this.

96
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:09,105
One-on-one. Come at me! I dare you, you punks.

97
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:10,840
Is she playing us?

98
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,022
Maybe we should toss her back into the ocean.

99
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:17,488
Calm down. If she is just a stowaway
and gets eaten by sharks, it'd be bad,

100
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,578
we've already checked the 10 people on this
boat. I'm positive they're all in the clear.

101
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,216
I don't know who it could be, other than this girl.

102
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:27,337
Isn't there a way we could find out who she really is?

103
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,578
Hey, how is Dio doing these days?

104
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,634
Dio, huh?

105
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,598
What the hell is that?

106
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:36,213
Don't pretend like you don't know, you little brat.

107
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:39,277
Hey, I warned you, punks. You
gonna be a man and talk to me,

108
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,997
or do you just want to get shanked? Which is it, huh?

109
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,800
My demon blade wants the blood of its
340th victim, and you all look like prime cuts.

110
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:52,024
What's so funny, stupid jerk hole?!

111
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,030
Jerk hole?

112
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,847
I'm starting to get the feeling she's not our stand user.

113
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:59,134
Yes, but who, then?

114
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:02,586
Is this girl our stowaway? Thanks for grabbing her for me.

115
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:02,912
Huh?

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,548
Whoa, captain.

117
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:14,142
I'm pretty strict when it comes
to stowaways on my ship here.

118
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,205
You're hurting me!

119
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,242
You may be a girl, but if I go easy on
you, we'll just get more and more stowaways.

120
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,112
I think we'll lock you up in the brig
below deck until we make it to port.

121
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,906
Hey, captain, I'd like to ask you something.

122
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:34,446
You verified the identities of
all 10 men on-board, haven't you?

123
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,690
Of course. They're all veterans, each one of them on this
ship for over 10 years. I'll vouch for every single man.

124
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:45,669
I'm not sure why you're so worried about that,
since I gave you my word from the very beginning.

125
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,516
Oh, by the way...

126
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,819
I must request that you not smoke on deck.

127
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:59,296
What were you planning on doing with
the ash and butt after you were done?

128
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,990
Were you just going to toss
them into these pristine waters?

129
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,787
You may be a guest on this ship,
but you will abide by my rules.

130
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:08,710
You got that?

131
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,867
You got it, kid?

132
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,964
Hold it, pops.

133
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:27,447
If you don't want me to smoke
aboard ship, then just tell me.

134
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:31,129
Don't be a condescending prick
about the whole thing, you jackass.

135
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,970
Eh?

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,057
Hey, Jotaro,

137
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,515
don't be disrespectful to the captain.

138
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,167
You're the one at fault.

139
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,390
His rules don't mean shit.

140
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,231
I'll be as rude as I want, and you know why?

141
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,261
The captain is the stand user.

142
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,090
Wha?!

143
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,318
What the?!

144
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:52,855
A stand... user?

145
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,810
I'm not sure I follow you. What is that?

146
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,784
That is completely impossible, Jotaro.

147
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,961
We chose captain Dragon, because he came recommended
with verification by the Speedwagon foundation.

148
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,145
He's someone that we can trust.

149
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,216
There's no chance that he's a stand user.

150
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,852
Hold on. What's this thing, a stand?

151
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,246
I've no idea what you guys are talking about.

152
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:18,364
JoJo, random guesses will only make things more confusing!

153
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,394
Do you have any real proof, JoJo?

154
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:23,927
I've found a way to differentiate stand users from others.

155
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:24,702
What?

156
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:28,896
The trick is to watch a possible
stand user around cigarette smoke,

157
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,775
because a single whiff... makes
a vein pop up on their nose.

158
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,603
Huh?

159
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,780
What the hell are they all doing?

160
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,222
You're not serious, Jotaro!

161
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:40,096
Relax. I'm lying.

162
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:43,685
That said, it looks like we found the idiot, didn't we?

163
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,590
Huh?

164
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,340
Hmm.

165
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:06,152
Quite impressive, but what tipped
you off that it was the captain?

166
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,916
Actually, I really didn't have a clue.

167
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:09,476
Huh?

168
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:14,405
However, I'd planned to try this with
the entire crew from the moment we arrived.

169
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:15,431
Simple as that.

170
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,093
And I fell for it.

171
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,911
Didn't expect this, but, damn, you're good.

172
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,088
You're right. I'm not the captain.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,236
The real captain's already sleeping with
the fishes at the bottom of the China sea.

174
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:30,818
If that's true, then you can sleep
in the depths of hell, you bastard.

175
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:36,937
Damn it! No!

176
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,913
Let me go! I can't move!

177
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,051
Trouble on the water, lies and betrayal...

178
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,429
The moon card represents the fear of the unknown.

179
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,090
Its name, Dark Blue Moon.

180
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,871
I kept my identity hidden,
hoping to pick you off one by one.

181
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:59,696
Five-on-one is so troublesome, even for me.
The other way would have been much simpler.

182
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:04,302
But since you've figured me out, I
have no choice. Five-on-one, it is.

183
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:08,299
Getting my hands on her just
shows that lady luck is on my side.

184
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:12,017
Think I'll take a dip in these
shark-infested waters with the runt.

185
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:15,324
If you wanna save her, you're
gonna have to dive in after us.

186
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:19,278
In the ocean, I have the advantage.
I can take on all five of you.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,322
Go on. Act tough while you hide behind a hostage.

188
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,760
It'll take a lot more than
that to shake me up, you dumb-ass.

189
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,523
It's no act. This is a prediction.

190
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:34,089
I hear your stand, Star Platinum, is fast.

191
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,315
I'd like to put that to the test.

192
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:40,462
I'm not trying to brag, but my
Dark Blue Moon is king underwater.

193
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:45,972
It's much swifter than any fish in the sea and
certainly faster than a vulgar meat head like you.

194
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,666
Why don't we test them out right now?

195
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on. Follow me. If you're not afraid of a...

196
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:55,707
Little saltwater.

197
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,131
Ora!

198
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,325
Ehh. He attacked me faster than we could fall.

199
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,763
That's impossible for a human. How'd he...

200
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,569
You're the only one who's
swallowin' saltwater today, pops.

201
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,913
Choke on it. Tell him, Avdol.

202
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,541
Your folly was trying to out predict a fortuneteller.

203
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,520
Tough break.

204
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,283
Well said, Avdol.

205
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,858
There he goes.

206
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:49,655
He talked up his stand's power so much, I expected
more, but in the end, he was just a blabbering idiot.

207
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,171
What's the matter, Jotaro?

208
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,912
Hurry and pull the girl out already, would you?

209
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,016
What's wrong? Do you need a hand with her?

210
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:05,811
Damn it. I'm being pulled in.

211
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:10,664
Th-those are...

212
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,071
They're barnacles.

213
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:15,339
They're a type of crustacean that
lives between high and low tides.

214
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:18,928
They're on Star Platinum's arm, and
they've got him stuck to the side of the boat.

215
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,890
He's still got some fight left in him.

216
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,639
He must have attached them when I hit him before.

217
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,944
Damn things keep multiplying.

218
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:29,595
My stand's strength, it's being drained.

219
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,524
The captain's disappeared.

220
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,834
I can't see him in the water anymore.

221
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,986
Jotaro, pull in your stand right now.

222
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,257
What do you think I'm trying to do?

223
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:44,070
That's why I'm sweating like a freakin pig, old man!

224
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:45,755
Jotaro!

225
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,005
JoJo!

226
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:57,470
Crap! He fell in!

227
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,899
We've... we've gotta...

228
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:06,925
Ora.

229
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:14,946
Hmm?

230
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:18,605
Hah. Welcome, landlubber.

231
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,882
Glad you could join me in the watery depths.

232
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:26,562
It's where Dark Blue Moon
reigns supreme, the undersea realm.

233
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,065
Bad idea to underestimate me, brother.

234
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,828
Could be deadly.

235
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:36,753
Since we can talk underwater through our stands,

236
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:40,952
how 'bout you pop out another one of
those cocky one-liners before you die?

237
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:42,221
What's the matter?

238
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:44,281
Catfish got your tongue, brother?

239
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,429
So, what would you like after I'm done with you?

240
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,239
Huh?

241
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,481
It would be a shame to waste such fresh fish.

242
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:53,698
Fish paste?

243
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,558
Maybe a plate of sashimi?

244
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,478
I'll make one hell of a meal out of your stand.

245
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,544
Don't play games with me.

246
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,539
You're trying to sound tough, but I know the truth, boy.

247
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:07,460
The real terror of all this is
starting to sink in to your thick skull.

248
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,394
I can even tell what you're thinking.

249
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,802
"How long can he stay underwater?

250
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:16,163
"I can probably last about two
minutes, but can he last longer than me?"

251
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,705
Am I right, brother?

252
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:20,224
Let me answer you.

253
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,522
My lung capacity is three times that of a normal human's.

254
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:27,111
See, for years, I've been training.

255
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,750
Six minutes and 12 seconds is my best submerged time.

256
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:34,317
You must be dizzy just hearing
that number, right, brother?

257
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,353
And...

258
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:43,725
Dark Blue Moon's fins are cutters that move
faster than a ship's propeller, far sharper, too.

259
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,906
Before you get overconfident again, you
might wanna take a good, hard look at your stand.

260
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:54,354
Seems Dark Blue Moon's barnacles have
taken a liking to absorbing your stand's power.

261
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,440
How does it feel to have your life
energy slowly draining away from your body?

262
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,469
Trying to run away by swimming back up?

263
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,432
Take a good look around you.

264
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,761
Haven't you realized, brother,

265
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,979
Dark Blue Moon has created an underwater whirlpool?

266
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,599
There's no way you can possibly escape.

267
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,404
That's right. Swim faster.

268
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:21,127
You'll just make it harder to
breathe while your power keeps draining.

269
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:26,406
But it's little too early to kill a
stupid, smartass punk like you just yet.

270
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,988
It's been too long! He's still not coming up!

271
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,926
A giant whirlpool! It must have him trapped.

272
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,206
Where the hell is JoJo?

273
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:37,668
Let's go and save him.

274
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,277
These are scales.

275
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,492
That guy's stand has scales as sharp as razors.

276
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:51,407
There are countless scales swirling in that whirlpool.

277
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,663
He wasn't bluffing when he said he
could beat all five of us at once.

278
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,182
It's like a watery ant-lion pit.

279
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,345
If we dive in, it's very
possible we'll be sliced to pieces.

280
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:04,812
His scales?

281
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:12,082
I'll take another guess at what you're thinking.

282
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:15,636
"In a whirlpool, only one spot stays still."

283
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,581
Such mundane logic.

284
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,955
"It's the eye.

285
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,226
If I jump into the center where he is, I can attack him."

286
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:25,942
That's what you're thinking, right?

287
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:29,732
If you believe you can hit me
with that punch of yours again,

288
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,870
then come and give it a shot.

289
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:36,763
Throw your worthless stand at me. It's
power's so drained, it doesn't have a chance.

290
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,816
See if you can manage an attack, one that's
even sharper than these underwater cutters.

291
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,613
I'm waiting, brother.

292
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,713
Damn him! We're completely helpless.

293
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:49,874
It's JoJo!

294
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,942
I just saw JoJo in the whirlpool.

295
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,653
I don't think he's moving down there.

296
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,144
So he went limp?

297
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,582
He wasn't struggling against the whirlpool?

298
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:03,340
Well, that might actually be a good thing.

299
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,432
Weren't you gonna turn me into sashimi, boy?

300
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:13,000
You're the one who's gonna be sliced up.

301
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,420
Star finger!

302
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,201
Sorry. Did I interrupt you?

303
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,010
Who's gonna be sashimi?

304
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,427
What's that? I can't hear you.

305
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,731
You're gonna have to speak up. We're underwater.

306
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,066
But your power was being drained.

307
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,208
You let yourself go limp on purpose, didn't you?

308
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,384
You concentrated your power in your fingers.

309
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,213
Th-that's what you were thinking all along.

310
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:53,670
Not even close.

311
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,848
The only thing on my mind is how gross it'll be

312
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:03,167
when I kick your stupid ass and you
piss yourself underwater, and that's all.

313
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,108
Bye, pops.

314
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,469
JoJo!

315
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,347
That's my grandson for you.

316
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,770
Well done, Jotaro.

317
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,644
Hurry and come u... huh?

318
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:22,080
Huh?

319
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:32,533
Th-that captain planted some bombs after all! Damn it!

320
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,549
Send out a distress call!

321
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,059
Here. You should have some water.

322
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:15,535
We've sent out distress calls, so someone
should be here with a rescue ship soon enough.

323
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,835
Okay, just what the hell is going on here?

324
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,629
I don't get any of this. Who are you guys?

325
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:25,623
Just think of us as fellow travelers.

326
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,109
You're on a journey to see your father,

327
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,964
while I'm on one for my daughter.

328
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:31,675
Heh.

329
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,369
Hey, that's the only fresh water we have,

330
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:41,045
so don't spit it out. We need it.

331
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,849
N-N-No.

332
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,261
Everyone, look there!

333
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:47,845
Hmm?

334
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:49,655
Huh?

335
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,670
All the old paintings on the tomb

336
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:17,838
They do the sand dance, don't you know

337
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:19,182
If they move too quick

338
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,318
Oh, whey, oh

339
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,636
They're falling down like a domino

340
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:25,004
All the bazaar men by the Nile

341
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,259
They got the money on a bet

342
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,705
Gold crocodiles

343
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,621
Oh, whey, oh

344
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:31,900
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

345
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:34,175
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

346
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,558
Whey, oh, whey, oh

347
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,095
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

348
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:43,708
Walk like an Egyptian.

349
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,721
The blond waitresses take their trays

350
00:22:57,746 --> 00:22:59,817
They spin around, and they cross the floor

351
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,091
They've got the moves

352
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:02,084
Oh, whey, oh

353
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:03,118
You drop your drink

354
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,619
Then they bring you more

355
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,889
All the school kids so sick of books

356
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:09,099
They like the punk and the metal band

357
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:10,526
When the buzzer rings

358
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:11,577
Oh, whey, oh

359
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,837
They're walking like an Egyptian

360
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,964
All the kids in the marketplace say

361
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,199
Whey, oh, whey, oh

362
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:23,004
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

363
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,781
Walk like an Egyptian
