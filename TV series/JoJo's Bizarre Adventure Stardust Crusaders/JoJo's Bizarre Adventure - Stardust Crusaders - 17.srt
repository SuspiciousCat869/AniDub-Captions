1
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:39,871
What a nice bridge you make, Jotaro.

2
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:58,225
Oh, hang on. Jotaro, I have a very nasty itch.

3
00:01:58,857 --> 00:01:59,894
Scratch it.

4
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:10,200
Just a little lower.

5
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:11,828
Even lower.

6
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:13,576
Ah, yeah, that's it.

7
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,905
But not too hard, mind you.

8
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,231
Huh?

9
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,242
Mr. Joestar?

10
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:23,623
Hey, what's the matter?

11
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:26,865
It honestly feels like someone's tickling my back.

12
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,347
I can't concentrate much longer like this.

13
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,339
Whah! Whah! Whah! Aah!

14
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:32,191
Calm down!

15
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,430
Enough already!

16
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:38,877
Just perfect. We've got quite the captive audience.

17
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:42,435
Mr. Joestar! Keep your voice down. People are staring.

18
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,509
Keep this up, and they'll think you've gone nuts.

19
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:47,041
You... you think I'm screaming for the hell of it?

20
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,478
Oh, no!

21
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,483
That poor man.

22
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,411
Why don't we give him some change?

23
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,645
W-Why are they throwing money?

24
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,446
I pity 'em.

25
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,889
Older relatives like that can be tough.

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,532
That is so true.

27
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:07,059
Kakyoin, go buy the TV. Let's get out of this crowd.

28
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:07,984
Right.

29
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:09,761
Is this your store?

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,422
Uh, yes, it is.

31
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:12,842
I'd like to buy that TV.

32
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,148
Unbelievable.

33
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:27,715
Kakyoin's Hierophant and Polnareff's Chariot made
themselves microscopic and infiltrated Joestar's body.

34
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,516
They intend to fight me. I can see them.

35
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,919
They're traveling through the bloodstream
and heading toward the brainstem,

36
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,592
right to my Lovers.

37
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:49,367
Quickly. We don't have long before the flesh
bud in Mr. Joestar's brain eats clean through.

38
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,298
Hurry, you two!

39
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:52,575
Allez hop!

40
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,341
All right.

41
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:56,157
Do it, Mr. Joestar.

42
00:03:56,374 --> 00:04:00,044
Right. Hermit Purple!

43
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:05,943
Th-these are...

44
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,221
The flesh bud's tentacles.

45
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,795
Great. We're finally at the brainstem, but
the flesh bud's already taken over. Damn it!

46
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:25,916
It's him!

47
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,914
Just look at that fiend.

48
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:36,682
He's using those weird claws of his to knead
Mr. Joestar's brain cells into a gooey mash,

49
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,950
and I bet he's going to feed it to the flesh bud.

50
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:43,550
We have to destroy him and tear out all
the flesh bud's roots as fast as we can,

51
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,683
or else they'll completely devour his brain.

52
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,845
D'accord. I'll julienne him to ribbons!

53
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:55,123
You know, on second thought, I
think a finer cut should do the trick.

54
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:58,186
I'll turn you into a lump of pate!

55
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,573
No, you don't!

56
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,329
Now!

57
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:13,920
He did it!

58
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,982
No, not quite.

59
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,698
I gotta say, Kakyoin, that thing's pretty fast.

60
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,705
But, luckily for us, I've already figured him out.

61
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,245
If that's all the little beast
has, then he's no match for...

62
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,084
Polnareff...

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,876
Who are you talking to?

64
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,185
Wha... huh?

65
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,458
Polnareff, that's not me,

66
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,323
and that wasn't the real stand.

67
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:38,026
Look. It's melting away.

68
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:42,926
What the?!

69
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,228
I'm the Lovers.

70
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,274
Polnareff.

71
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:57,692
He disguised himself using the
brain cells, Mr. Joestar's brain cells.

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,925
Somehow, that thing was able to use
the collection of kneaded brain cells

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,555
to disguise himself as my Hierophant Green!

74
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:10,684
And since he can mold his cells at will, all you
destroyed was a decoy made of those brain cells.

75
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,717
You hit the nail on the head.

76
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,203
And you dummies completely fell for it.

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,473
Come on.

78
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,021
Pull your head out of your ass, would you?

79
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,643
You better shine those shoes right, Jotaro.

80
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:36,132
I'm in such a good mood, I can hardly stand it,

81
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,666
so I'm gonna need you to keep polishing these shoes
until they're shining as brightly as I feel right now.

82
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,264
Do you think you can handle
that, my little sycophant?

83
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:49,181
You can stop polishing when that magnificent
sun up in the sky makes these puppies sparkle.

84
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,561
Also, I want you to use your tongue to shine them.

85
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,155
Hey, you bastard,

86
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,561
what are you writing in there?

87
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,704
You're looking at your tab,

88
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,500
and you're gonna pay in full.

89
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,915
I wrote it down so I won't forget.

90
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:17,001
You're a scoundrel, Jotaro.

91
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:18,725
Heh.

92
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,449
Well, it doesn't matter.

93
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,645
It'll all be meaningless in the end.

94
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:26,207
Whoa! Kakyoin, look!

95
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,001
Check out the decoy's head that I just opened.

96
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,389
What?

97
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,280
What the hell's going on?

98
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,148
Somehow he's splitting in two.

99
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:48,422
Listen up. Here's some advice.

100
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:51,157
To win in life, one must thoroughly know oneself.

101
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,188
It's like Aesop's fables,

102
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:55,664
when the unassuming tortoise beats the hare.

103
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,775
The tortoise outruns the hare, because he knows
himself and his abilities better than anyone else.

104
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,839
Of course, the same applies to me.

105
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm no fool. I know perfectly well I
don't possess the power or speed necessary

106
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,328
to mortally wound either of you one-on-one,

107
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,510
but remember this.

108
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:16,543
The spoils belong to those who admit their own weaknesses!

109
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,094
Emerald splash!

110
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,532
Did it work?

111
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:37,067
What? More decoys are forming out of the brain cells.

112
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,228
They're multiplying.

113
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,849
But a person can have only one stand,

114
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,276
which means only one of them is real.

115
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,373
That said, where's the real one?

116
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,246
Right here!

117
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,486
Emerald splash!

118
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,058
Well, that's not good.

119
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,128
Any closer, and I would have been killed.

120
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,603
The more decoys we hit, the more they multiply.

121
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,661
No, no. It's me. It's me.

122
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:17,275
It's me. It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me.

123
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:21,386
They're all me. Can't you tell?

124
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,508
Polnareff, that's enough.

125
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,481
Withdraw your stand now.

126
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,413
I can't just watch you get hurt,
even if you are trying to save me.

127
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:34,677
No way in hell! I can't stand the thought
of giving up and watching you die like this.

128
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,735
Are you trying to die? Withdraw your stand.

129
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:41,026
Do as I say. It's over.

130
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:44,135
You can't quit, Mr. Joestar. We'll fight till the end.

131
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,367
Damn. They all look the same.

132
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,868
Which one is the real one,

133
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,968
and which one of them is the stand?

134
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,357
I can't tell them apart.

135
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,877
The world's weakest stand is...

136
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:03,214
The most, the most, the most, the most,
the most, the most, the most, the most,

137
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,586
the most, the most, the most, the
most, the most, the most, the most,

138
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:09,942
the most, the most, the most, the most,
the most, the most, the most, the most,

139
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:14,092
the most, the most, the most, the most,
the most, the most, the most, the most,

140
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,228
the most powerful of all!

141
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,776
Hey, now, take a look at this, Jotaro.

142
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,344
It's beautiful, isn't it?

143
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:38,542
I would wager an expensive gift like this
would make any girl fall head over heels.

144
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,690
Jotaro...

145
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,789
You see that space there in the glass?

146
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:46,617
Use your stand to sneak through and steal the bracelet.

147
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,642
Steal it.

148
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,523
What don't you understand, moron?

149
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:59,148
Get a move on, if you know what's good for you.

150
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:03,241
I mean, I don't mind breaking the
glass and taking the bracelet myself.

151
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:07,038
Then again, if I'm caught, I
could be beaten to a bloody pulp.

152
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:10,248
Old Joseph would surely die from the pain.

153
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,290
Hurry, would you?

154
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,946
Do it while the salesman's looking the other way.

155
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,582
Oh, no! This guy is shoplifting!

156
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:36,710
Son of a...

157
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,167
Do something! This guy's shoplifting!

158
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,788
Come on, salesman!

159
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,020
I'll go and get some help!

160
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,886
Please, sir, don't let him get away!

161
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:54,863
Sure thing.

162
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:57,523
Bastard.

163
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:04,070
All right, boys, where is this thief at?
Who's the culprit? Is it that guy there?

164
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:06,266
You talkin' about that Asian kid?

165
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:08,404
You know, back where I come from,

166
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,075
when someone steals somethin'. We chop their fingers off.

167
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,860
Hey, Jotaro...

168
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:18,219
You better not use your stand against civilians.

169
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,385
Punk!

170
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,949
Take this!

171
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:25,937
Despicable!

172
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,390
You dirty thief!

173
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,767
Now you get the hell out of our country,
and don't come back. Good for nothin' asshole.

174
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,154
You do that, and we'll allow you to
leave here with your fingers intact.

175
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:56,281
That was great. Nicely done, my friend.

176
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,937
Thanks to the commotion you caused,

177
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,492
I was able to get my hands on
something even better than that bracelet.

178
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,553
Jotaro, what the hell are you laughing about?

179
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:14,192
What's so damn funny?!

180
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,241
Nothing. I'm just a bit excited.

181
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,364
I was laughing, because your punishment has doubled,

182
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,927
and I've been waiting a while for this moment.

183
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:30,521
It's just about time for payback,
and I gotta say it's really got me tingling.

184
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,222
Why, you...

185
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,060
It would seem...

186
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:37,887
That we have something of a misunderstanding.

187
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,639
I'm sorry to say, but your old
man isn't long for this world.

188
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,701
That's the reality you're facing.

189
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:48,631
How sad. You don't know us very well, do you, friend?

190
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,343
And I see you don't know Kakyoin at all.

191
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,141
Come again?

192
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:57,654
It seems to me you're obsessed
with the notion of knowing oneself.

193
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,570
Yes, that makes sense.

194
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,752
I suppose I'm inclined to agree.

195
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,647
But before you continue pontificating,
think on this for a moment.

196
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:09,540
There's another adage, "know thy
enemy," that's nothing to scoff at.

197
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:13,464
Can't you see? My Hierophant has a certain ability.

198
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:18,211
It has the power to stretch out its feelers,

199
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,099
and I've been inspecting every single one of you.

200
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,814
Gah! How could I have not noticed something touching me?

201
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:26,645
So you're the stand.

202
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,420
Emerald splash!

203
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,487
Success!

204
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,787
Well, well, what do we have here?

205
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,833
Looks like Kakyoin got you pretty damn good.

206
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:48,284
So I'm wondering, will I get my payback once he's done?

207
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,574
He realized that he's out of his league,
and now he's trying to escape into the artery.

208
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,759
He's trying to escape from Mr. Joestar's brain.

209
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,791
Huh? Did you say he's leaving?

210
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:07,695
All right. That's great news, isn't it?

211
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,075
Mr. Joestar, hurry, the flesh bud.

212
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:10,821
Right.

213
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,401
Time for overdrive!

214
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,979
The flesh bud's vanishing.

215
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:26,858
Thank god it's gone.

216
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:32,944
Well, if you ask me, this whole experience has
done a lot to bring our group closer together.

217
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,111
You're incorrigible, Polnareff.

218
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:40,744
Hold on a minute. If that thing's
really trying to leave my brain...

219
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:44,521
Then wouldn't that imply that the stand is...

220
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:51,152
The bastard is returning to its user!

221
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:54,543
This is bad. Jotaro's has no way of knowing.

222
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,077
What's wrong?

223
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,166
Why are you backing away from me?

224
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:06,580
Aren't you going to tell me
more about my grandfather's death?

225
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,177
I'd really love to know.

226
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:12,589
Hey, wait a minute.

227
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,148
What's with the big hurry?

228
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,269
We weren't done talking yet.

229
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,445
No, it couldn't be.

230
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,497
You're not actually trying to run away, are you,

231
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,091
after all you've done?

232
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,825
Please Jotaro, sir, forgive me.

233
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,302
I admit it. You win.

234
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:36,181
I'll lie down and lick your boots.

235
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,014
I know I did a bad thing, and I wanna change.

236
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:42,289
You can pummel me as much as you'd like.

237
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:48,722
Hit me, kick me, but, please, don't
kill me. I'm begging you to spare my life.

238
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:53,423
Lick, lick, lick, lick,
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

239
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:57,322
Soon, very soon, the Lovers will return to me,

240
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,719
and this idiot Jotaro doesn't have a single clue.

241
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:04,290
Just you wait. This time, it'll enter your brain.

242
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:07,372
Kakyoin can't help you from hundreds of meters away.

243
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:11,508
I'll make you suffer pain so horrible,
you'll wish you were never born.

244
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,894
Heh. It's here.

245
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,138
It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here.

246
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,725
Now, enter his ear.

247
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:23,751
Ora!

248
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,741
I kinda figured you'd go and
try something shitty like this.

249
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:46,944
Don't you know my stand, Star Platinum,
possesses excellent eyesight and precise reflexes?

250
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,366
You're pathetic.

251
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,606
Didn't you check up on us at all, even a little bit?

252
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:55,309
No, no, no, no, no.
Believe me, I wasn't planning anything,

253
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,625
not against your stand's immense power.

254
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,640
Did you just say, "your stand"?

255
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:01,306
Only "your"?

256
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,632
Let me explain.

257
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:07,848
W-What I meant to say is that your awesome
and powerful stand is far superior to any other.

258
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:12,327
I knew it didn't stand a chance, so I had it come back.

259
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,424
Just look at what you've done.

260
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,317
You've already shattered my arm and leg to pieces.

261
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,694
I can't possibly fight anymore. I can't even move.

262
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,120
In that case...

263
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:29,478
I guess I'll take pity on you and
accept your arm and leg as payment

264
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,939
for all the low blows you took out against me,

265
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,023
but only if you swear that you'll never
show your ugly mug in front of us again.

266
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:38,068
I'll do whatever you say. I promise.

267
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,594
I'll head for some deserted island,

268
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:43,231
or I'll go to the ends of the
Earth and never return to bother you.

269
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,772
You'd better not be lying.

270
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,400
The next time I see that face,
it'll get a thousand punches.

271
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,473
I'm not lying. I would never, ever lie to you.

272
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,355
Get lost.

273
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,618
Let's play soccer over there.

274
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,359
Jotaro.

275
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:13,261
You're an utter fool.

276
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:15,411
Just take a look at that girl.

277
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:17,003
Well, I wanna play over here.

278
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:21,230
It might interest you to know that my stand,
the Lovers, just went into that girl's ear.

279
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,343
Now he's heading for her brain.

280
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:26,207
You better not move, Jotaro.

281
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,683
Here's what's about to happen.

282
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:36,194
I'm gonna stab you in the back with this knife
and make sure that you're never able to move again.

283
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,029
Attack me with your Star Platinum,

284
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:41,683
and this girl's pathetic life ends right here and now.

285
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:45,648
But you would never allow such an
innocent child to die, would you?

286
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:52,851
Oh, good grief. Go ahead, and stab me, then.

287
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:53,516
Huh?

288
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:56,893
Hey, now, did you not hear me? I just told you not to...

289
00:19:58,654 --> 00:19:59,497
I told...

290
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,831
You not... to move.

291
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:06,201
What's the matter?

292
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,677
Didn't you say something about stabbing me?

293
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:10,756
Like this, right?

294
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,031
My... my body won't move!

295
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:17,729
W-Why?

296
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,259
What the...

297
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,675
What is this thing wrapped around me?

298
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,848
I see you didn't notice.

299
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,167
As your stand was trying to make its escape,

300
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:29,777
Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacle to its leg.

301
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:35,884
And seeing as those tentacles stretch all the
way back to your stand like a string to a kite,

302
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,614
you must have been so
self-absorbed, you didn't even notice.

303
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,887
Please, I'm begging you, forgive me!

304
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:57,122
Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba, the woman you killed.

305
00:20:57,447 --> 00:21:01,150
But as for me, I never had the
slightest intention of forgiving you.

306
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,024
D-Dio paid me to cause this madness.

307
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,039
Y-you can have it all.

308
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,454
Good grief. I know this is blatantly
obvious, but you really are a piece of work.

309
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:15,904
What you owe me

310
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,352
can never be paid back with money!

311
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:21,756
Ora!

312
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,316
Your receipt.

313
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,453
You can keep the freaking change.

314
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,974
All the old paintings on the tomb

315
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:17,142
They do the sand dance, don't you know

316
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,486
If they move too quick

317
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:19,622
Oh, whey, oh

318
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:21,940
They're falling down like a domino

319
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,308
All the bazaar men by the Nile

320
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,563
They got the money on a bet

321
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:28,009
Gold crocodiles

322
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:28,925
Oh, whey, oh

323
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,204
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

324
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:33,479
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

325
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:35,862
Whey, oh, whey, oh

326
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,399
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

327
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,012
Walk like an Egyptian.

328
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:57,025
The blond waitresses take their trays

329
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,121
They spin around, and they cross the floor

330
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,395
They've got the moves

331
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,388
Oh, whey, oh

332
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,422
You drop your drink

333
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:03,923
Then they bring you more

334
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,193
All the school kids so sick of books

335
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,403
They like the punk and the metal band

336
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,830
When the buzzer rings

337
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,881
Oh, whey, oh

338
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,141
They're walking like an Egyptian

339
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,268
All the kids in the marketplace say

340
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,503
Whey, oh, whey, oh

341
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:22,308
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

342
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:25,085
Walk like an Egyptian
