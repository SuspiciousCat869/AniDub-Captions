1
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:09,062
Now with a new set of wheels, JoJo and crew
head north from Varanasi to the nation of Pakistan.

2
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:13,112
We're about to hit the Indo-Pakistani border.

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,478
I guess it's time to say goodbye to India.

4
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:19,001
You know, I had mixed feelings
about the country at first, but now

5
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:24,875
I actually kind of miss the hustle and bustle
of Calcutta and frenetic chaos of the Ganges.

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,531
I'll be coming back again one of these days.

7
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:32,350
I owe it to Avdol to give him a proper burial.

8
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:37,737
Mr. Avdol.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,436
The road's getting narrower.

10
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:41,182
Hmm?

11
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:53,026
Quit driving so slow, idiot! Out
of the way! I'm gonna pass the guy.

12
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,769
Polnareff, calm down.

13
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,920
This four-wheel drive is great.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,986
You know, that crazy maneuver of yours
might have just damaged that poor car.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,472
Yeah. Your point?

16
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:10,957
I'm saying we don't need any more trouble now.

17
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:14,310
I'm wanted because of what happened in Varanasi.

18
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,171
I'd like to get across the border in one piece.

19
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,570
What's up? Why'd you stop?

20
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,278
I told you. A crash could be disastrous.

21
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:30,978
I know that. Just look who's standing there.

22
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,807
Good freakin' grief.

23
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,222
Hey. Long time no see, guys.

24
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,819
Got room for one more?

25
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,512
I mean, come on. I'm a girl.

26
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,302
Soon I'll be doing girl things like wearing a
bra and doing my nails to get the attention of boys.

27
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:40,885
I'd look pathetic wandering
around the world when I'm that age.

28
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:45,581
This is the only chance I have
to be free and see the world.

29
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:46,709
Know what I mean?

30
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,843
Look, I feel bad for lying about going to see my
dad in Singapore, but let's just forget about that.

31
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:57,983
Hey, it's that car we passed.

32
00:03:58,603 --> 00:03:59,818
Looks like he's in a hurry.

33
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,018
Let 'em pass, okay, Polnareff?

34
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:02,534
Yeah.

35
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:18,877
What the hell?

36
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,238
What's he trying to do?

37
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:25,059
I let you pass. Now hurry up, and go already!

38
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,163
He's probably angry about your
maneuver, and these are the consequences.

39
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,847
So did you get a look at the driver's face?

40
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:38,764
No. The windows were covered in thick dust.

41
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,837
Couldn't see a thing.

42
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,329
Neither could I.

43
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,046
Couldn't be.

44
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,611
Be very careful, Polnareff.

45
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,128
Hmm?

46
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,123
Heh. Now he's wants me to pass.

47
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,729
Looks like the fool's realized
how shitty that piece of junk is.

48
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,834
You should have stayed behind
me the first place, dumb-ass.

49
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,930
Comin' through!

50
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,570
What?!

51
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,707
Where'd that come from?!

52
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,091
No use. Hold on.

53
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,275
Star Platinum!

54
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,125
That was close.

55
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:25,655
If it weren't for Star Platinum's power, we
would have been crushed beneath that like a tin can.

56
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:28,601
He's gone. Where did that blasted car go?

57
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,834
Looks like it just kept going.

58
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:35,774
I think the driver could have been one of the stand users.

59
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,381
Then again, it could have just been some sick bastard.

60
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,035
Of course he's one of Dio's lackeys.

61
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,373
We were almost roadkill, for god's sake.

62
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:48,448
Then why didn't he simply attack us
with his stand when he had the chance?

63
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:52,777
Anyway, we've gotta keep heading to Pakistan. Be on guard.

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,430
If someone comes after us
again, we'll make 'em eat our dust.

65
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:57,617
Damn straight.

66
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,968
What should we do about that truck?

67
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:03,089
Star Platinum left it a wreck. It won't be going anywhere.

68
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,063
That's easy. We pretend we never saw it.

69
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,198
Let's get going.

70
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,742
He's so cool.

71
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,361
A roadside tea stand.

72
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,929
A break would do us some good.

73
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:45,774
If we take our time, we may avoid
running into that crazy driver.

74
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:58,631
What is that stuff?

75
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,751
Fresh sugar-cane juice.

76
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,233
Care for a glass?

77
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,136
Sure. Why not?

78
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:09,680
Mm.

79
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,084
What?!

80
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,622
I... It's him.

81
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:16,170
That car's here!

82
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,520
Hey, tell me something.

83
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:31,267
Who's the owner of that car parked over there?

84
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,634
Come on. Spill it!

85
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,026
Uh, I'm not sure, sir. To be
honest, sir, I didn't notice it there.

86
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,859
Our driver isn't just going to come out and announce it.

87
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,320
He's messing with us.

88
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,640
Yeah. Then, I guess this leaves us
with only one option, right, Jotaro?

89
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,419
Yeah.

90
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,722
Poor innocent bastards.

91
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:50,588
Huh?

92
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,243
We'll just beat them all down.

93
00:07:55,992 --> 00:08:00,621
Hey, Jotaro, this is crazy. Mr. Joestar, not you, too!

94
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:03,606
Pretty suspicious mug you got there. Was it you?

95
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:04,893
Wha?! Not me!

96
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:06,355
Huh?

97
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,982
That slippery bastard just
played the lot of us, didn't he?

98
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,770
Damn it. Did anyone see his face?

99
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,573
No. What is he trying to do?

100
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,372
He could be just some madman with a
car, or he could be trying to kill us.

101
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:34,290
We need to take care of this crap. I won't rest
until I catch him and get to the bottom of this.

102
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:39,184
Not to mention we owe him payback for
the truck that almost hit us earlier.

103
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,894
Damn it. For a piece of shit,
that car can really get up and go.

104
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:15,716
That's strange. According to the map, we should
be running parallel with train tracks or something.

105
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:19,140
Who the hell cares? We'll catch up soon anyway.

106
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:20,736
That bastard!

107
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,191
I'm gonna nail him once we round this curve.

108
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,998
A dead end! That's impossible!

109
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,894
Where the hell'd he go? He's gone.

110
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,378
Did he just drive off the cliff?

111
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:42,609
There's no way he could cross the suspension bridge.

112
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,693
What?!

113
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,977
I... It's him. He keeps pushing us.

114
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,518
How the hell did he get behind us?

115
00:09:56,756 --> 00:10:00,017
Damn. How much horsepower is
that piece of junk running with?

116
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,107
Damn it. It's like fighting a tank!

117
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,773
It's no use. Everyone, get out! It's our only chance.

118
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,251
Polnareff, what are you doing?!

119
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:17,827
You can't get out of the car until the rest of us
are clear first. You have to hold down the brake.

120
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:18,314
Huh?

121
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,021
S... S... Sorry.

122
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,116
Hierophant Green!

123
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:31,355
Stop!

124
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:35,286
Hierophant isn't nearly strong
enough to support this kind of weight!

125
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,955
You'll be torn to shreds!

126
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:43,311
Mr. Joestar, with all due respect, I am
aware of my own abilities. I am not a fool.

127
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:49,007
Ah, I get it.

128
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,659
You used the car's winch instead of just brute strength.

129
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,199
Heh. Not bad, Kakyoin.

130
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,694
I got a question for you.

131
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,068
You like sumo?

132
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:01,745
Especially deadlocks at the edge of the ring?

133
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:03,190
Ora!

134
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,659
It's exciting, isn't it?!

135
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,089
Ora!

136
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,322
Yeah. I'm a fan of sumo.

137
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:25,270
But in sumo, it's against the
rules to punch your opponent.

138
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:26,524
Hmm.

139
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,761
Nothing here suggests he used a stand attack.

140
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:47,708
I think it's safe to say he's
just some weirdo with an ax to grind.

141
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,656
Yeah, either way, he's a goner after that fall.

142
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:53,199
Heh. I guess what goes around comes around.

143
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,050
Yeah, but I still wonder, how did it get behind us?

144
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,275
It was like watching a magician or something.

145
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,816
It's so strange.

146
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,107
Actually, little girl, it's not strange at all.

147
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,740
The radio! He's coming through the am-fm.

148
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:15,125
I was able to do that, because it's my stand, Joestar.

149
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:15,706
What?!

150
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,772
He knows my name, so that confirms it.

151
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:20,648
He's an enemy stand user.

152
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:23,834
Where is he? Could he really be sending
a signal - from the car down there?

153
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,605
No way!

154
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:26,282
Do you see the wreck down there?!

155
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,751
No. That old jalopy could very well be a stand.

156
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,000
You remember the boat stand?

157
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,445
This may be a repeat.

158
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,863
Behold the Wheel of Fortune.

159
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,403
My stand will lead you to your maker.

160
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:41,770
The Wheel of Fortune?

161
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,372
What the... an earthquake?

162
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,056
I've got a bad feeling.

163
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:48,613
Everybody, get in the car!

164
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,587
No! Stay back! Don't go anywhere near it!

165
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,412
Couldn't be.

166
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:53,247
Below us!

167
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:06,584
Impossible!

168
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,229
It burrowed up through the ground!

169
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,845
All right, I think it's pretty
obvious that car is actually a stand.

170
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,847
Looks like the stand's user is inside the car.

171
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,399
What the hell?!

172
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,616
Now what is it doing?

173
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:29,739
It's like it's alive!

174
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,845
It's heading straight for us!

175
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,889
If it's a duel you want, I'm happy to oblige.

176
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:51,091
Don't do it, Jotaro! Don't fight it yet,
not until we know what that stand's power is!

177
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:56,367
Jotaro!

178
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,288
Impossible. I couldn't see it.

179
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,372
What the hell did he shoot at
me, and how the hell did he...

180
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:05,820
Don't even know what hit you, eh?

181
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:11,575
You'll soon find out, the moment you croak, that is!

182
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,225
Jotaro!

183
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:19,037
Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!

184
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:26,855
Damn! What the hell is this? The wounds
aren't deep, but they sting like hell!

185
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,269
I can't see it at all.

186
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:31,780
I thought the car threw something at
us, but there's nothing inside our wounds.

187
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,480
What the hell is going on here?!

188
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,149
Jotaro, are you all right?

189
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,595
Don't worry about me, old man.

190
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,975
I don't know what the hell he's
hurling at us, but he's got damn good aim.

191
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:48,542
I'll pulverize your legs so you
can't move and then run you over!

192
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:51,188
Everyone, run between the boulders!

193
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,670
Stop running away, you cowards!

194
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:57,783
What?

195
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,698
What are you? Roaches?

196
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:04,653
Oh, no! He's digging his way through!

197
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,451
And we're no match for him in here.

198
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,323
What a freak.

199
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:12,512
He's acting like some stupid musclehead who got
cut off in traffic and flew into a fit of road rage.

200
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:13,831
Just keep running.

201
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,120
Wait! Come back! I can't keep up!

202
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:29,062
Yeah, okay, so I ran away from home! I'm a
good-for-nothing drifter that nobody loves!

203
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,391
I'm gonna die!

204
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,989
Good grief.

205
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:38,263
If you have time to say all that crap,
you can run away, you damn little brat.

206
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,504
I love you so much, Jotaro!

207
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,894
Go ahead and climb.

208
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,411
There's no path left for you to take,

209
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:59,084
no way to escape, no way to survive,
and, last but certainly not least, no future!

210
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:06,863
Because this Wheel of Fortune is going to grind you
into mincemeat and splatter you all over these boulders!

211
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:10,230
I'll paint this mountain red with your guts!

212
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,484
Hmm.

213
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:13,429
Oh, no!

214
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,227
It's climbing up the cliff.

215
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:18,005
Is there anything this car can't do?

216
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,640
Ah, good grief.

217
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,760
Looks like the time to fight him's now.

218
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:26,277
The rest of you, stay back. He's mine.

219
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:29,034
Once he climbs up here, the car's underside'll be bare.

220
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:32,434
Then we'll see just how strong this thing is.

221
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:34,121
I get it.

222
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,662
Once its underside's exposed, we may be able to attack it.

223
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:50,570
You're pretty fast there, Jotaro, but not too bright.

224
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,986
Your bodies reek, and you haven't even noticed.

225
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,867
Try paying attention!

226
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:01,424
Come to think of it, I guess I did smell gasoline.

227
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,873
Oh, no. It's coming from us. Our
bodies smell like a gas station.

228
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:13,110
That's what it was shooting, gasoline.

229
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:18,020
It was shooting small amounts of it
at high speed like bullets. Incredible.

230
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:19,896
This is nuts!

231
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,779
So he wasn't trying to wound us.

232
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:25,179
He was dousing our bodies with
gasoline. We're covered in the stuff!

233
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,178
Looks like you finally caught on, but it's too late now.

234
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:33,394
Now all you need is a little jolt.

235
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,654
What?!

236
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:42,951
Jotaro!

237
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,106
Jotaro!

238
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:53,896
Mr. Joestar, stay back! We're soaking
with gasoline, too. It's too dangerous.

239
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:01,320
Jotaro!

240
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,494
I win.

241
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,284
Your valiant hero finally bit the dust.

242
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:14,966
Is that so?

243
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:18,659
And who exactly would replace me, Jotaro Kujo?

244
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,052
Huh?!

245
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:26,727
Let me guess.

246
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:28,737
You thought it'd be you, you road-hog?

247
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,798
You burrowed into the ground with Star Platinum,
so the only thing that burned up was your jacket!

248
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,342
A little parting wisdom.

249
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,780
What you said earlier about paths...

250
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:43,213
Was dead wrong.

251
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,564
You see, in life, you have to forge your own path.

252
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:50,203
No one can do it for you. So I'll offer you some guidance.

253
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,928
But first you have to go through a little pain.

254
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,731
I... I'm being crushed.

255
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:05,033
Go, Jotaro!

256
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,777
Ora!

257
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:18,428
That is how it's done.

258
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:21,114
See? You just paved your own path.

259
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,981
Congrats on being a fast learner.

260
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,706
Here ends the lesson.

261
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,530
What an odd guy.

262
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,993
His arms are the size of boulders,
and yet everything else is so small.

263
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:39,962
Talk about a bluff.

264
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:46,817
Hello. Going somewhere?

265
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:53,292
Please, don't kill me. I'm just
in this for the money, honest.

266
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:58,165
Huh?

267
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:13,083
Oh, would you look at that? I can't believe the
stand was disguising such a small car that entire time.

268
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:17,468
Kinda reminds me of a fluffy little sheep
that just had all of its wool shorn off.

269
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:21,473
What a pathetic hunk of junk.

270
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,943
Well, then, let's take his car across the border.

271
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,373
Only fair, since he smashed ours.

272
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,957
It's pretty beat-up, though.

273
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,720
I wonder if it'll last that long.

274
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:45,697
Help! Help!

275
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,614
And you're on the next flight to
Hong Kong once we find an airport.

276
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,273
Aw, no! Why?!

277
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,109
Shut up!

278
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:54,047
Don't you understand that
you're in the way, you little brat?

279
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,462
Uh, we might not make it that far.

280
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:00,671
Help!

281
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:26,016
My seven assassins have all been defeated, and so easily.

282
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:29,345
How could they be crushed like that?

283
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:33,745
The shame! I cannot bear to face lord Dio.

284
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:37,870
Damn you! Curse you, Polnareff!

285
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:39,284
Curse Kakyoin!

286
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,063
Curse Jotaro and his wretched grandfather.

287
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,007
I, Enyaba, shall be your next and final opponent!

288
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:55,031
I will fight with my very own stand, the stand of justice!

289
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,073
All the old paintings on the tomb

290
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:17,241
They do the sand dance, don't you know

291
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,585
If they move too quick

292
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,721
Oh, whey, oh

293
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:22,039
They're falling down like a domino

294
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,407
All the bazaar men by the Nile

295
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,662
They got the money on a bet

296
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:28,108
Gold crocodiles

297
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,024
Oh, whey, oh

298
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,303
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

299
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:33,578
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

300
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,961
Whey, oh, whey, oh

301
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:39,498
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

302
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,111
Walk like an Egyptian.

303
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,124
The blond waitresses take their trays

304
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,220
They spin around, and they cross the floor

305
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,494
They've got the moves

306
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,487
Oh, whey, oh

307
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,521
You drop your drink

308
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,022
Then they bring you more

309
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,292
All the school kids so sick of books

310
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,502
They like the punk and the metal band

311
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:09,929
When the buzzer rings

312
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:10,980
Oh, whey, oh

313
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,240
They're walking like an Egyptian

314
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,367
All the kids in the marketplace say

315
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:17,602
Whey, oh, whey, oh

316
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:22,407
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

317
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,184
Walk like an Egyptian
