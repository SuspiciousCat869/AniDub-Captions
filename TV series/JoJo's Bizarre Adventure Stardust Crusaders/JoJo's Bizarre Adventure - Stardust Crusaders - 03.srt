1
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:37,050
Well, I hate to say it, but it's too late for him.

2
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:39,863
He's got a few days before he dies at most.

3
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,913
Jotaro, this is not your fault. Trust me.

4
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:47,283
Do you want to know why this
man swore his allegiance to Dio

5
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,443
and came to your school to kill you?

6
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:53,337
Look right here, and I will show you!

7
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,100
What is that?

8
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,571
It looks like a spider or a piece of flesh.

9
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,914
That's it? Is that what made him swear allegiance to Dio?

10
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:04,196
Yes, it's a flesh bud formed from Dio's cells.

11
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,356
It connects directly to the boy's brain.

12
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:09,336
Flesh buds are small,

13
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,119
but they have the power to influence
a person's thoughts and actions.

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:20,235
Simply put, that bud stirs him and awakens
a certain feeling far beyond his control.

15
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:22,596
Charisma!

16
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:25,495
The sheer emotive power that drives a soldier

17
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:29,390
to follow a dictator or a believer
to put his faith in a corrupt cult.

18
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,671
This young man revered Dio, and
that's why he swore allegiance to him!

19
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:39,550
Dio knows how to wield the power of charisma,

20
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,346
which means there will be others he will try to influence.

21
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:47,408
He ordered this young man, Kakyoin here,
to kill us, and he won't stop until he has.

22
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,996
So remove the bud.

23
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,140
No. The brain is very delicate.

24
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:54,881
If he even twitches while we extract
it, it could cause brain damage.

25
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,262
JoJo...

26
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:00,191
I need to tell you something.

27
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,948
Four months ago, while I was still there in Cairo...

28
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,079
I encountered Dio!

29
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,473
I am a fortuneteller by trade.

30
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,583
I have a shop in a souk called Khan Khalili.

31
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,196
It was a full moon that night,

32
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,310
and there he was.

33
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:30,898
He just stood at the top of the
stairs outside my shop silently,

34
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,639
with eyes so cold it felt like he was invading my heart,

35
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:38,096
golden hair, and translucent alabaster skin,

36
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:43,307
but, most of all, a dubious sensuality,
the kind you wouldn't expect from a man.

37
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:47,907
Because Mr. Joestar had warned me
about him, I knew exactly who he was,

38
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:51,140
Dio resurrected from the depths of the Atlantic!

39
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:56,799
I hear you have a special ability
beyond that of an ordinary person.

40
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,586
This true?

41
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:02,804
It would please me if you'd
grant me a small demonstration.

42
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,636
It was then that I found him to be truly terrifying.

43
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,566
Every word he spoke calmed my heart.

44
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,980
The dangerous sweetness in his voice

45
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:18,785
is precisely what makes him so terrifying!

46
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,813
Avdol, come here.

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,640
I ran for my life.

48
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,630
I didn't dare think of fighting him.

49
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,072
I was very fortunate.

50
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:36,843
Because I had prior knowledge of Dio,

51
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,844
I was able to realize who he was.

52
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,719
I immediately jumped out the window.

53
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:43,824
That souk is a labyrinth, but I
know it like the back of my hand,

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,326
and thanks to that, I was able to escape.

55
00:04:47,924 --> 00:04:50,815
Otherwise, I would have ended up like this young man,

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,547
another follower controlled by a flesh bud.

57
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:58,308
You would have died a few years later,
with your brain completely devoured.

58
00:04:58,512 --> 00:04:59,213
Died?

59
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,152
Let's not jump the gun.

60
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,719
Kakyoin's not in great shape, but he's not dead yet!

61
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,614
I'll pull it out with my stand.

62
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,133
No, Jotaro! Stop!

63
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,420
Old man, just back off.

64
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,566
I can remove this thing without damaging his brain.

65
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:24,144
If my stand has the precision to catch a
speeding bullet, then it can also do this.

66
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:24,811
Listen!

67
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:27,101
That flesh bud is alive. Can't you see?

68
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,920
Part of that flesh bud lives
outside his body for a reason.

69
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:33,319
Even a skilled surgeon can't
remove it without serious damage!

70
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:34,431
Shit.

71
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:36,457
It just sunk itself into his flesh.

72
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,762
This is bad. You have to let go, JoJo!

73
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:42,456
It can infiltrate anyone's
brain who dares try to remove it!

74
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,795
Why are you...

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,495
I would try not to move.

76
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:52,371
If I mess this up, your brain is fried.

77
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,459
No, JoJo!

78
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,714
It's ready reached your neck!

79
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,591
You have to let go!

80
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,780
Hold on, Avdol.

81
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,296
My grandson is very impressive.

82
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:09,642
That thing's made it halfway through his
body, and yet he's still completely calm,

83
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,564
not even a tremble from either him or his stand.

84
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:16,904
He can move with more precision
and strength than I ever anticipated!

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,696
He did it.

86
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:30,978
Overdrive!

87
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,418
Tell me,

88
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,140
why did you risk your life to save me?

89
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:58,299
Don't know.

90
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,777
I don't really have an answer for that.

91
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:15,097
Jotaro, I see right through you.

92
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,012
All done.

93
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,786
Thank you for everything.

94
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,715
So it's Kakyoin, was it?

95
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,273
You need to rest for a while.
Why don't you stay here tonight?

96
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,475
Papa, go and get his futon ready.

97
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,507
Hmm? Why do I have to do it?!

98
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:35,535
I've never even liked the idea
of sleeping on the damn floor!

99
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:39,570
In fact, that futon in my
room, replace it with a real bed!

100
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:44,380
No way. You're in Japan now, papa,
and here in Japan, we sleep on the floor.

101
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,494
And I'd prefer if you call me Seiko here.

102
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:48,590
What?!

103
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,868
The Japanese also have a word for holy.

104
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,164
Here, the word for it is "seinaru,"

105
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,162
so that's why all my friends call me Seiko here.

106
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,402
What the hell is that?!

107
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:00,445
Holly's a beautiful name! I gave it to you mys...

108
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,057
if you don't refer to me as Seiko, I won't answer.

109
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:03,663
Holly!

110
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,353
How's the pain, Kakyoin, bad?

111
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:06,600
No. I'm fine.

112
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:07,661
Holly!

113
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:08,048
Gimme a break.

114
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,398
All right, Kakyoin, let's get you out of that uniform.

115
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,058
Go on. Take it off.

116
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:12,890
Holly!

117
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:13,983
Did I hear something?

118
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:23,801
Holly!

119
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,817
Hey, Holly!

120
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,478
Come on! Where are you?

121
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,913
I want you to look at this.

122
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,429
You gave me jotaro's pants.

123
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,963
Where the heck are mine?

124
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:39,006
They're the right size and all, but I'm not wearin' these.

125
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,213
Hey, Holly!

126
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,043
Oh, I'm supposed to call her
Seiko, or she won't answer me.

127
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:48,045
Hmm.

128
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,373
No! My daughter has one name.

129
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,256
Answer me, Holly!

130
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,123
All right, time for school.

131
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,409
I'm actually gonna go.

132
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:00,481
Hmm.

133
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,371
That's weird.

134
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,779
Here is your goodbye kiss.

135
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:10,639
That's usually how my mornings play out.

136
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:29,834
Huh?

137
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:53,742
No. Mrs. Kujo!

138
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,759
Mrs. Kujo, please, wake up.

139
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,549
She's burning up.

140
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:01,684
Is she sick?

141
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,903
No. This can't be.

142
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,071
Mrs. Kujo, please.

143
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:09,231
Forgive me.

144
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,235
No. How did this happen?

145
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,183
It's transparent.

146
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:18,415
She has a stand.

147
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:21,766
Mrs. Kujo has materialized her own stand!

148
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:34,061
Mrs. Kujo has gained a stand as well.

149
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:35,532
But this high fever.

150
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,803
The stand is doing damage to her.

151
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:43,953
We were all so relieved that Dio's body
had only affected JoJo and Mr. Joestar.

152
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,605
We were so certain Mrs. Kujo was fine.

153
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,823
But that's just what we wanted to believe.

154
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,118
It's impossible for her to escape that.

155
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,873
As long as she has Joestar blood in her veins,

156
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,453
there will inevitably be an effect from Dio.

157
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:58,625
But still...

158
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:03,517
A stand is controlled by an
individual's own mental strength,

159
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,503
and they move according to
that person's fighting instinct.

160
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:10,140
Mrs. Kujo is a kind and peaceful woman

161
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,905
who doesn't have the power to resist Dio's curse.

162
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,442
She doesn't have the strength
she needs to control her stand.

163
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,691
This has to be why her stand is making her so ill.

164
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,542
It's acting against her, not with her.

165
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,395
It's only getting worse.

166
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:25,641
This is very bad.

167
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:28,079
At this rate, she'll die.

168
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:29,983
She'll be overcome!

169
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:37,740
She has a stand?

170
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,044
Holly.

171
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:52,176
Nooooo!

172
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,328
This is the one thing I feared the most.

173
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:01,298
This is very last thing I ever wanted to happen.

174
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:04,951
My daughter has developed a stand as well.

175
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:08,744
I've always known she's too weak.

176
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,308
She can't withstand it.

177
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:13,120
I knew if this day came, it would destroy her.

178
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,625
She doesn't have the strength needed to repel Dio's curse.

179
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,568
Tell me. What we can do?

180
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:31,716
Okay.

181
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,210
To start, we must find Dio.

182
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,850
The only way to break this
curse is to find Dio and kill him!

183
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:43,926
Finding him is the problem.

184
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:47,659
No matter how many times I try,
he's always hiding in the darkness.

185
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:51,303
In every spirit photo I take, the background is black.

186
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,831
We won't be able to locate him with my photographs.

187
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,897
We've used various methods to try and analyze them,

188
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,758
but with this darkness, we always come up with nothing.

189
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,343
Hey, you should have mentioned this to me sooner.

190
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:08,513
Let me look. I might be able to find out...

191
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,888
What's hiding in that darkness.

192
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:20,456
It's found something within the shadows.

193
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,468
My stand can move accurately enough
to pull a flesh bud from someone's brain

194
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:29,479
and catch a bullet.

195
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:33,022
Let's have it sketch what it sees.

196
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:40,423
Hmm.

197
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,473
No way!

198
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,292
It saw a fly through all that!

199
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,199
Yeah, but how in the hell is a fly gonna help us?

200
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:53,884
Wait a second. I've seen this fly before.

201
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:54,402
What?

202
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,935
Do you have an encyclopedia?

203
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,644
We do have a library.

204
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:58,870
Let me have the sketch.

205
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,550
I'll do some research!

206
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,646
Hmm. Oh, Holly.

207
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,797
Papa, I...

208
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,210
You just rest.

209
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,841
Jotaro, get some water.

210
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:26,840
Hmm.

211
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,646
You seem to be doing well.

212
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,187
Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.

213
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,657
Can your own stand really do that to you, kill you?

214
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,777
Yes.

215
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:44,659
I have seen far too many people
suffer exactly that same fate.

216
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:45,549
Really?

217
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,971
It's limited to her back right now,

218
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:50,704
but that stand will grow like a fiendish vine,

219
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,272
and it won't stop until her
whole body is overtaken and bound.

220
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:58,472
Her fever will rise, and her illness will worsen,

221
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,404
she'll fall into a coma and never wake up, and then...

222
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,809
She'll die.

223
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:10,361
Your average person would see
this as some rare and unknown disease

224
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:13,291
that no doctor in the world would be able to treat.

225
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:18,756
And normally neither you nor I could do anything about it.

226
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:23,284
But there is still hope.

227
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,924
It will take 50 days for her body to reach that state.

228
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,173
We just have to find and defeat Dio before that.

229
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,866
If we can sever the link her stand has with Dio,

230
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,527
we can save her.

231
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,286
Thank you for that, Jotaro.

232
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,975
I wonder what it was that came over me today.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,724
I can't believe I had a fever and passed out like that.

234
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:47,883
But that said...

235
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,687
Because it's on her back, she can't see it.

236
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,117
She has no idea what's happened.

237
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,769
Well, you gave us quite a scare, Holly.

238
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:58,828
Hey, now that you're up, why don't you brush your teeth?

239
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,363
Say, "Ahh."

240
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,189
Ahh.

241
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:05,592
And let's get that face clean.

242
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:08,507
We'll tidy up your hair while we're at it.

243
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,810
Then let's take care of those nails.

244
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:12,986
Ahh...

245
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:13,742
Ahh.

246
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,252
Oh.

247
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,178
Papa, will you help me change my underwear, too?

248
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:20,828
Huh?

249
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:24,077
Just relax. I was only kidding.

250
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,629
All right, then.

251
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,027
What do you want for dinner, Jotaro?

252
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:28,416
Hey.

253
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,508
Don't move! You just stay in bed.

254
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:30,889
Huh?

255
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,211
I just meant you should stay put,

256
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,070
at least until your fever breaks.

257
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,317
Now be quiet, and get better.

258
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:43,535
He's right.

259
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,536
Rest.

260
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,493
Heh. Okay.

261
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,163
I kinda like this.

262
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,244
Everyone's so nice when I get sick.

263
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:57,525
Having a little cold isn't so bad from time to time.

264
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,801
What? Holly!

265
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,297
Say something.

266
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,163
She... she lost consciousness again.

267
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:06,295
Come on.

268
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:10,155
She was acting fine, but this fever is so bad.

269
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,298
It's spiked.

270
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,149
She was just putting on a good front.

271
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,509
I know she didn't say anything,

272
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,711
but my daughter is definitely aware of her stand.

273
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:24,930
She was doing her best just
now to try and hide it from us.

274
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:30,118
My guess is that she didn't want us to worry about her.

275
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,710
My daughter's always been like that.

276
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,969
Mr. Joestar, I've found it.

277
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:39,580
I know where that fly is from.

278
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:43,098
It's this one.

279
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,664
The Nile Tsetse Fly,

280
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,928
a bloodsucking insect prevalent in the Nile river basin.

281
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:53,624
The Tsetse genus includes a striped
species known as the aswan tsetse fly.

282
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,919
Egypt.

283
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,623
And we've narrowed it down to the aswan region.

284
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:58,726
Dio is there.

285
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,720
So he is in Egypt after all.

286
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:02,848
Kakyoin.

287
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,755
What do you mean by that?

288
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:08,100
The flesh bud was planted into my brain three months ago.

289
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,393
That's when I met Dio.

290
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:12,120
I was on a trip with my family in Egypt.

291
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,986
We were there touring the Nile.

292
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:15,749
You were in Egypt, too.

293
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:17,459
It seems for some reason,

294
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,634
Dio wants to remain in that area.

295
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:22,392
So when are we leaving?

296
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,657
Because I'll be going with you.

297
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,269
Seriously?

298
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,193
Why would you want to do that?

299
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,378
To be completely honest,

300
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:34,348
I have no idea why I want to either.

301
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,072
It's just something I feel compelled to do.

302
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:42,388
Let's just say that you opened my eyes.

303
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,000
It's that simple.

304
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,310
Holly, we're gonna save you, no matter what.

305
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,734
You have my word.

306
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,402
There's nothing for you to worry about.

307
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,642
We are gonna make you better. I promise.

308
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:04,803
Just take it easy, and rest.

309
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:13,824
Jojo's mother, Holly, has the ability to
calm a person's soul and put their minds at ease.

310
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,730
People feel relaxed just by being near her.

311
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:20,845
This may sound strange, but if I ever fall in love,

312
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,046
I'd want it to be with someone like her.

313
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:25,437
I'd feel the need to protect her.

314
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:29,840
I'd do anything to see her feeling better and smiling.

315
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:31,714
Indeed.

316
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:34,599
There's no time!

317
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:36,544
We leave immediately!

318
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:44,277
We can trust 'em.

319
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,841
They're doctors from the Speedwagon foundation.

320
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:51,170
They're going to stay with her and
take care of Holly around the clock.

321
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:54,777
JoJo, since I am a fortuneteller by trade,

322
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,057
I'd like to name your stand before we go.

323
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:58,137
Huh? Name it?

324
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,948
With the tarot, the cards of fate.

325
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,809
Do not look, but let chance guide your choice.

326
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:06,658
It will not only suggest to us your destiny,

327
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,525
but also the abilities of your stand.

328
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,832
The star card.

329
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:19,444
I shall name your stand...

330
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,462
Star Platinum!

331
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,997
Jotaro Kujo.

00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,101

336
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,738

337
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:36,174
Mohammed Avdol.

338
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,003

00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,483

343
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,864
All right, we're off!

344
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:54,360
Let's hit the road.

345
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:14,034
All the old paintings on the tomb

346
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,202
They do the sand dance, don't you know

347
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:17,546
If they move too quick

348
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:18,682
Oh, whey, oh

349
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:21,000
They're falling down like a domino

350
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:23,368
All the bazaar men by the Nile

351
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,623
They got the money on a bet

352
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,069
Gold crocodiles

353
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:27,985
Oh, whey, oh

354
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,264
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

355
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,539
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

356
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:34,922
Whey, oh, whey, oh

357
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:38,459
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

358
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,072
Walk like an Egyptian.

359
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,995
The blond waitresses take their trays

360
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,085
They spin around, and they cross the floor

361
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,359
They've got the moves

362
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,456
Oh, whey, oh

363
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,482
You drop your drink

364
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,983
Then they bring you more

365
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,253
All the school kids so sick of books

366
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:07,463
They like the punk and the metal band

367
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:08,890
When the buzzer rings

368
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:09,941
Oh, whey, oh

369
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:12,201
They're walking like an Egyptian

370
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:14,328
All the kids in the marketplace say

371
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,563
Whey, oh, whey, oh

372
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:21,368
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

373
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:24,145
Walk like an Egyptian

374
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:54,275
As I thought, they found out where I am.

375
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,194
So then, will you come to Egypt,

376
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,150
Joseph and Jotaro?

377
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:09,664
He saw us. I definitely felt Dio looking at us just now.

378
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,531
Yeah.

379
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:11,843
Be careful.

380
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,496
A new stand user could already be on this plane.
