1
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:12,314
With Enyaba in tow and a new carriage to boot,

2
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,584
JoJo and crew arrived in the coastal town of Karachi,

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,384
Pakistan's industrial and financial
center located in the Indus river delta.

4
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:02,363
Oh.

5
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,723
Hey, a doner kebab joint.

6
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,067
Let's stop and get something to eat.

7
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:16,842
The doner kebab, it's been called
the hamburger of the middle east.

8
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,121
A slab of meat is placed on a spit,

9
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:21,517
its outer layer roasting as it turns.

10
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:27,444
Before long, the meat is cooked, sliced, and
served with any number of sides and condiments.

11
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,227
Excuse me, sir. I'd like five of those.

12
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,032
That'll be 1,000 yen.

13
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,528
1,000 yen?

14
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,907
In the middle east, Japanese and western
business practices are by no means universal.

15
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,115
Namely, prices change and are open to negotiation.

16
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:46,238
With no understanding of how to
haggle or how to value goods for sale,

17
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:49,796
first-time visitors can become
easy targets for exploitation,

18
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:53,520
but here, people don't see
such exploitation as a bad thing.

19
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:56,915
The swindled are deserving of the label fool, not victim.

20
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,646
Haggling takes guts and ingenuity.

21
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,297
Really?

22
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,715
The first step is the art of the bluff.

23
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,713
Make it clear you see through the trick.

24
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,835
Let him know you're no slouch.

25
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:13,208
Don't mock me now. That's far
too much for a handful of kebabs.

26
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,158
A hearty laugh always helps. Then...

27
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,341
How much would you buy 'em for?

28
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,466
The merchant will test the waters.

29
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:23,151
Make it 250 yen for five.

30
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:28,981
In return, you throw out a price so
low, you can't help but blush. And then...

31
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,285
He'll act as if you have no sense at all.

32
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,568
Catching on?

33
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:37,993
If I sold them for that cheap,

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,910
I'd be out on the streets, and my wife
and seven children would starve to death.

35
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,974
Then he'll gesture the old throat slash,

36
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,793
but you can't give up the fight just yet.

37
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,450
Then maybe I'll just buy them somewhere else.

38
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,238
Pretend that you're leaving.

39
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:55,186
Okay, friend, you win.

40
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,917
I very much like foreigners.

41
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,257
I'll sell you five for 700 yen.

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,395
He'll try to stop you.

43
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,326
Then make it 300.

44
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,130
Let the haggling begin!

45
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,239
600!

46
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,499
350!

47
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:08,671
550!

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,719
400!

49
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:10,358
450!

50
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,092
425!

51
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,260
I'll take 'em.

52
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:18,080
All right. I got them for less
than half his original price.

53
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:21,162
Take that. I made out like a bandit.

54
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:23,603
And just as you think you won.

55
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,486
I usually sell five for 150 yen.

56
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,249
Bye-bye. Thank you, sir.

57
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:32,259
Huh?

58
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:39,567
Holy crap!

59
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,933
Turn around! That old lady's awake.

60
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:52,306
I... I promise you

61
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:55,021
I haven't said anything to any of them, I swear.

62
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,059
Wh-why are you here?

63
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,357
What could you possibly want with me?

64
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:03,152
Did you think I would actually tell
them the secret of lord Dio's stand?

65
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:06,157
I am and shall always be his loyal servant.

66
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,125
Eh?

67
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,181
Gross.

68
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,484
What are they? Some kind of worms?

69
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:36,192
Why? I have done nothing wrong!

70
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:38,256
Why have you come here to kill me?!

71
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:42,515
Lord Dio places his trust in no one,

72
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,184
not even you, Enyaba.

73
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,547
That is why.

74
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:49,860
And it's my job to make sure that you never speak again.

75
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,915
As for the rest of you...

76
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,992
The only way you're leaving is in pieces.

77
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:01,615
Memere!

78
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:04,915
What?

79
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,356
You can call me Dan,

80
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,488
Dan of Steel.

81
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:13,487
My stand represents the one and only lovers card.

82
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:17,702
I will see to it that you all meet the
same fate as that pathetic witch Enyaba.

83
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:19,034
How could you?!

84
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,396
That old lady was one of your own, you son of a...

85
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:22,777
Memere!

86
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,893
Lies. Lies.

87
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,410
These are all lies.

88
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,305
This isn't happening. Lord Dio would never do this to me.

89
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,602
I am his loyal servant, loyal.

90
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,096
These things coming out of her body
they're definitely not some stand.

91
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,401
Don't you see it? They're actual tentacles.

92
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:46,187
I have dedicated everything to him.

93
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,752
Lord Dio would never do me such harm.

94
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,313
He'd never plant a flesh bud in me.

95
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:53,724
What did she say?

96
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,280
Lord Dio is my only reason for living.

97
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:00,102
We trust each other wholeheartedly.

98
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:01,864
Hold on!

99
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:09,996
See that?

100
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,435
The sun just disintegrated them!

101
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:15,729
The flesh bud, it's made out of Dio's own cells.

102
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,040
Precisely.

103
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,318
I must say you are quite the perceptive one.

104
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,971
Since you're so astute, I'll continue.
This is what a full-grown flesh bud looks like.

105
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:29,007
I want to kill her, not control her,
so I just grew it inside the old bag.

106
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:34,188
Enyaba, you may be the very one
who told lord Dio about the stands,

107
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,789
but you're a fool to think that a man with such complete
power would ever trust a feeble old woman like you.

108
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,932
Unfortunately, it's a point you failed to realize.

109
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,042
Old lady!

110
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:48,153
What's the true identity of Dio's stand?

111
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:51,060
Tell us!

112
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,325
You placed all your hope in Dio.

113
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,409
You trusted him with your life and your son's.

114
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:59,628
And now after all you've sacrificed, you
know he's not the man you thought he was.

115
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:00,928
You know I'm right.

116
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,802
We must defeat Dio, no matter the cost.

117
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,333
You have to tell us.

118
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,432
We need to know!

119
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,157
Tell us what we need to know about
Dio's stand before it's too late!

120
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,416
D-Dio...

121
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:17,649
My lord.

122
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,991
He believes in me, so I'll serve him even in death.

123
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,880
I won't betray him.

124
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,495
Oh, god!

125
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,201
How pathetic.

126
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,464
It's laughable how sad that old woman was.

127
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:56,009
But the very depth of her trust
in him should tell you something.

128
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,461
Lord Dio's evil charm is more
powerful than you can imagine.

129
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,106
The old woman may have had it out for us,

130
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:16,203
but she was misled and sure as
hell didn't deserve that death.

131
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,703
I'll see you join her.

132
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:21,255
Four against one, but we won't hold back.

133
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:22,810
Prepare yourself, Dan.

134
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,364
On your feet.

135
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:31,138
Hey, jackass,

136
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,501
stop trying to act cool, and get up and fight.

137
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,253
This is going down, whether you want it or not.

138
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,427
Go ahead.

139
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,171
But you can't touch me.

140
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,712
I'm Dan of Steel, and none of you can
take me down. You don't have what it takes.

141
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:45,571
Ora!

142
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,199
What the?

143
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,539
W-What happened, Mr. Joestar?

144
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,406
He flew back just like that guy.

145
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,237
You're an utter fool. I was about
to explain my powers when you hit me.

146
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:04,456
That impatience nearly killed your
grandfather. I suggest you listen next time.

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,539
Huh?

148
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:11,947
Listen. My job's not over. I have
other important business to attend to.

149
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:15,607
You really think I would show
my face here just to kill Enyaba?

150
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:21,651
You... you damn bastard. You told us that
your stand is the lovers. Isn't that right?

151
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:25,005
So tell us! What the hell does it do?!

152
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:30,482
What's the point in telling you now?
The battle's already begun, Mr. Joestar.

153
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,426
You're all simpletons.

154
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:37,690
You do know, no matter how hard you
look, you won't be able to see my stand.

155
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,533
Hey, half pint.

156
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:45,597
You want some cash? It's all yours if
you can hit me in the leg with that broom.

157
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,341
Whoa.

158
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,585
Oh.

159
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:49,544
Wha?

160
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:52,203
What? But why would he...

161
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,549
Now hit me!

162
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,499
The hell? Now what?

163
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:02,288
It... it hurts!

164
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,185
I don't get it! It's like I broke my leg!

165
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:09,106
You mean you still haven't figured
it out? That's so disappointing.

166
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:12,727
My stand can't be seen, because
it's rooted firmly inside you.

167
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,938
The moment Enyaba died, it entered you.

168
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,528
It got to your brain through your
ear, and that's how I'll get to you.

169
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:19,444
What?!

170
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,751
My stand and I are connected, just like yours.

171
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,639
If my stand gets hurt, so do
I, and the reverse is also true.

172
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,282
You're utterly helpless. If you so much as scratch me,

173
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:43,755
in that instant, my stand will react
to my pain by going berserk in your head

174
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,865
and inflicting the same agony on you.

175
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:49,416
Not only that, it will deliver
a pain several times greater.

176
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:51,631
Now I'll say it once more.

177
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,533
Alone or together, you won't be
able to lay a single finger on me.

178
00:11:57,736 --> 00:12:01,530
Plus, the lovers has taken one of
lord Dio's flesh buds into your body.

179
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,009
It's growing in your brain as we speak.

180
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:08,580
Just like it did to Enyaba, it'll
devour you from the inside out.

181
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,492
I don't recall asking you to strike
me again, you stupid little brat!

182
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:27,916
Well, to be honest, my stand, the lovers,
isn't as strong as you might think it'd be.

183
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,391
It doesn't have the strength to
move even a single strand of hair,

184
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,543
making it the world's weakest stand.

185
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,353
However...

186
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:39,985
Power isn't necessary if all you
want to do is kill your opponent.

187
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,114
Do you understand, gentlemen?

188
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,529
Say something fortunate happens,

189
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,635
like I get into an accident, a
baseball hits me, or I just trip and fall,

190
00:12:57,771 --> 00:13:01,339
how do you think that would affect you, Mr. Joestar?

191
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:07,044
I might get banged up some, but your
body would suffer far greater pain than mine.

192
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,477
What the? How?

193
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:13,652
How am I feeling your knuckles
cracking in my prosthetic hand?

194
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,659
You've got 10 minutes, old man.

195
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:19,293
Then your brain will be eaten through,
and you'll be a corpse like Enyaba.

196
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:25,591
Jotaro, calm down. Don't do anything rash.

197
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:26,770
Sorry, but no.

198
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,218
I'm gonna kill this damn tool so quickly,
he won't have enough time to feel pain.

199
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:43,666
Kill me before I feel it, huh?
Sounds interesting. Do it, then.

200
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,371
I wanna see what happens.

201
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,821
What are you waiting for, Jotaro?

202
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,661
Come on. Let's see it.

203
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,171
Just what were you planning to strike?

204
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,967
Tell me. My face? Or maybe my throat?

205
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,827
What? You mad?

206
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,312
Let's see what'll happen.

207
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:02,178
Don't back down on me now, man.

208
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,200
Why don't you try busting a hole through my chest?

209
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:10,319
Or how 'bout you give up on using your
stand, and crack my head open with a rock?

210
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,804
This one looks like a prime specimen.

211
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:15,197
It sure looks big enough for the job.

212
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,875
You do not want to underestimate me, pretty boy.

213
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,224
When I say I'm gonna do something, I do it.

214
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,319
Jotaro, don't do it!

215
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:38,183
We've already seen how effective his power
is. Are you trying to kill your own grandfather?

216
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,388
Uh, this is Jotaro we're talking about. He might be.

217
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,383
You dumb, good-for-nothing punk.

218
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:49,829
Oh?

219
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:55,740
Jotaro!

220
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:59,799
Don't you toy with me, you bastard.

221
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,792
After the geezer kicks the bucket, you're next.

222
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,313
Look out!

223
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:09,396
It'll be your brain that I send the Lovers in to kill.

224
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,935
Stop. What the hell do you think you're doing?

225
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,751
This is just insane.

226
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:21,985
My grandson is being beaten up to save me.

227
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,195
We're completely at this guy's mercy.

228
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,836
I can't do anything while it's in my brain.

229
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:31,001
I remember when that poison ring
was placed around my aorta long ago,

230
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:35,136
but think, Joseph. There's got to be something you can do.

231
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,121
H-hey!

232
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,572
Jotaro, keep him away from Mr. Joestar at all costs!

233
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,433
We're gonna try and get as far away from him as possible!

234
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,428
I see. So that's your plan?

235
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:02,732
Putting some distance between me and the old man
might make my stand's power vanish without a trace?

236
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:07,411
Sorry, but my stand's physical
weakness is made up for in other ways.

237
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:12,550
The Lovers may be physically weak, but its
range is farther than any stand in existence.

238
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,392
It doesn't matter how far they run. Their
lives are forfeit as long as it remains in a host.

239
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,031
What's up?

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,493
Hey, Jotaro, I'm talking to you.

241
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:27,833
It's impolite not to look at
people when they're speaking to you.

242
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,557
Look at me!

243
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,623
What's wrong?

244
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,876
You sound like you're starting to lose your cool.

245
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,463
What's your plan?

246
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:39,579
Follow me around 'til grandpa
Joseph keels over? Sounds like a blast.

247
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,749
Dan of Steel, was it?

248
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,786
I'll make you pay for this. Just a matter of when.

249
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,883
Well, if you're gonna stick around for a
while, I might as well help myself to your wallet.

250
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,746
Nothing but chump change, huh?

251
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:07,509
Though I didn't expect a guy
like you to be sporting a tag heuer.

252
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:09,128
I'll be borrowing this.

253
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:17,282
There!

254
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:22,179
An electronics store. Mr. Joestar, they have TVs.

255
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,119
Yeah, so? Why does that matter now?

256
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,325
Come on, Polnareff. Did you
really think we were running away?

257
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,699
I'm going to fight this blasted
stand that's inside my head.

258
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,566
Fight? Mon dieu, non.

259
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,623
We only have a few minutes, and we're
gonna need your help to pull this off.

260
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,348
Huh?

261
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,672
Hermit Purple!

262
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,076
That's it!

263
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:52,892
Oh, no!

264
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:54,137
I hoped he was bluffing.

265
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,907
How the hell did he get inside my brain so damn quickly?

266
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,630
Wow. If I hadn't seen it myself,
I wouldn't have believed it.

267
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:02,972
At least now we know for sure that it's in there.

268
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:06,279
But I still don't see how
we're going to destroy the thing.

269
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:10,931
By having our stands enter Mr. Joestar's
ear canal to find and destroy the monster.

270
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:12,675
Are you crazy?

271
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,170
Stands are simply materializations of energy.

272
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:16,956
We should be able to shrink them.

273
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:18,346
You don't know that.

274
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,657
Hey, try not to break anything while you're in there.

275
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,340
There's no time. We're going in now, Polnareff.

276
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,073
A-all right.

277
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,131
Hierophant Green!

278
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,705
Silver Chariot!

279
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:30,998
Smaller.

280
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:36,895
Get smaller.

281
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,185
We're going to be entering a blood vessel.

282
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:40,689
R-right.

283
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:48,983
A drainage ditch.

284
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,659
This could be fun.

285
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:53,961
I'd try to jump it, but if I trip and twist my ankle,

286
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,494
it could be real bad for old man Joestar.

287
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:59,733
Walking all the way to that bridge would be such a bother.

288
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,333
I've got an idea.

289
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:04,521
Lie down across this ditch,
and make yourself into a bridge.

290
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,908
I'll just walk on you to get across.

291
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:09,570
What now?

292
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,866
You don't want to be my bridge or something?

293
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,085
Shut up.

294
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,042
The hell do you keep yammerin' about?

295
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,974
I said make yourself into a bridge!

296
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,682
You good-for-nothing, arrogant prick!

297
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,616
What?! What's the matter?

298
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:24,754
Mr. Joestar.

299
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:26,606
M-my leg,

300
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,809
i-it's going numb.

301
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,812
Damn it, Jotaro.

302
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,563
What the hell are you doing?

303
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,925
Aw, don't look so upset, Jotaro.

304
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:51,117
Come on.

305
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:53,223
I don't have all day, you know.

306
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,102
Good.

307
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:18,351
You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?

308
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:20,612
Boing, boing, boing.

309
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:21,896
Impressive.

310
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,799
Hold on.

311
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,676
Almost there.

312
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:36,124
Mr. Joestar, I think the stand is here.

313
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:39,099
Hiding around the thalamus makes the most sense.

314
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,471
That's the point where the nervous system begins.

315
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,896
Polnareff and I will enter a blood
vessel from inside your inner ear,

316
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,339
then swim through the veins toward the brainstem.

317
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:51,112
But to do that, we need to
tear the wall of the blood vessel.

318
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:52,931
Hey, hold on.

319
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,346
You're using your stands.

320
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:56,987
Can't you just slip through it without cutting me?

321
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,456
At this size, it's not possible.

322
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:01,278
The blood vessel's wall is too thick.

323
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:06,068
The slit will be microscopic, so
there'll be no hemorrhaging to worry about.

324
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:08,629
The only other issue is time.

325
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,957
Cutting through a blood vessel or nerve
right now will take several minutes at least.

326
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,177
Otherwise, the Lovers would have
already done its damage by now.

327
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,609
Though, in all probability, it may have already started.

328
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,230
Keeping our stands this tiny is really exhausting.

329
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:27,913
It's taking a ton of stand power
just to get where we can fight.

330
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:30,520
On y va!

331
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,285
Oh, my god!

332
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:39,434
I-I really don't feel so well.

333
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,640
All the old paintings on the tomb

334
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,808
They do the sand dance, don't you know

335
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,152
If they move too quick

336
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:19,288
Oh, whey, oh

337
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,606
They're falling down like a domino

338
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,974
All the bazaar men by the Nile

339
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,229
They got the money on a bet

340
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:27,675
Gold crocodiles

341
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,591
Oh, whey, oh

342
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,870
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

343
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,145
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

344
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,528
Whey, oh, whey, oh

345
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:39,065
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

346
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,678
Walk like an Egyptian.

347
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,691
The blond waitresses take their trays

348
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,787
They spin around, and they cross the floor

349
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,061
They've got the moves

350
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,054
Oh, whey, oh

351
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,088
You drop your drink

352
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,589
Then they bring you more

353
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,859
All the school kids so sick of books

354
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,069
They like the punk and the metal band

355
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,496
When the buzzer rings

356
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,547
Oh, whey, oh

357
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,807
They're walking like an Egyptian

358
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,934
All the kids in the marketplace say

359
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,169
Whey, oh, whey, oh

360
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:21,974
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

361
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,751
Walk like an Egyptian
