00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:03,378
Previously on "JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:04,626
...Ka...

3
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:05,419
...kyo...

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,246
...in.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,467
Beware...

6
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:08,017
of...

7
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,596
...him...

8
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,028
...Di...

9
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:10,369
...o...

10
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:11,752
...loyal...

11
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:12,848
...servant...

12
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:15,506
Dio!

13
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:20,082
So then, where is Kakyoin?

14
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,688
He’s with Jotaro.

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,757
Oh!

16
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,644
Can I get some ice cream, please?

17
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,696
Welcome.

18
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:37,400
You know, ice cream is pretty good, but this baby
here, chilled coconut juice, nothing in the world like it.

19
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:38,683
How ’bout it?

20
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,709
Uh...

21
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,198
I guess we can try it.

22
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:44,836
Three, then.

23
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:45,893
Thank you much.

24
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,339
That’s $12.

25
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:50,450
Hey, jerk! What are trying to pull? Make it six!

26
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:51,426
Here.

27
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,036
This should cover it.

28
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:54,471
Okay, thanks.

29
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:55,417
Enjoy!

30
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,100
Hah! I’ll take that!

31
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:20,741
So you dumb, useless, disgusting piece
of shit, who the hell do you think you are?

32
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:21,660
Eh?

33
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:22,009
Huh?

34
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,751
I’ll make you wish you were never born!

35
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,402
Kakyoin!

36
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:32,801
Get up, you vile little cockroach
dick. Do I look like easy pickings to you?

37
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,596
And now you’ll feel the pain!

38
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:40,767
How dare you touch my wallet with the
same grimy fingers that wipe your filthy ass!

39
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:44,843
I can’t let you get away with
something like that, now, can I?

40
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,666
Can I? Come on! Tell me! Can I?! Can I? Can I? Can I...

41
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,521
Kakyoin!

42
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,532
What are you doing to this guy? You’ll kill the bastard.

43
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:56,852
How the...

44
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,319
Oh, my god, a back-breaker? What a brutal move!

45
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:00,868
Come on!

46
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:04,366
And he’s using such filthy
language. It’s not like him at all.

47
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,549
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

48
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:07,711
Come on!

49
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,390
Kakyoin!

50
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,423
Now cut it out, damn it.

51
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,193
You’re losing control.

52
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,136
You’re acting like such a bastard.

53
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,510
Something’s not right.

54
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:19,973
What the hell’s gotten into you?

55
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,507
That hurt, you know.

56
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:30,108
You didn’t have to shove me
around, like you’re the one in charge.

57
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:32,277
That man tried to steal my wallet.

58
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,820
He was committing a crime,

59
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,781
and criminals should be punished.

60
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:41,286
Tell me, am I wrong, Jotaro? You’d do the same, old pal.

61
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,190
This guy.

62
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,484
What are you glaring at?

63
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:23,805
You know, the look in your
eyes is awfully hostile, Jotaro.

64
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,225
What’s wrong? Why are you so upset?

65
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,099
You couldn’t possibly be
thinking about ending our friendship

66
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,689
over a little tussle with a thief, now, would you?

67
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,400
You’re acting as if I’ve done something unforgivable.

68
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,539
Look, a beetle. That’s awesome!

69
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:44,281
Oh, wow!

70
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,364
I see ’em! There’s four of ’em up there.

71
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,663
So cool!

72
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:49,039
Hmm?

73
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:53,960
Huh?

74
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:55,462
JoJo...

75
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,715
You’re making way too big of a deal out of this.

76
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,543
I’m just having a bad day. No big thing.

77
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,815
I’m so exhausted from the trip.
It’s put me in such a bad mood.

78
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,936
Just a bad mood, huh?

79
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,547
Seemed to me you felt pretty good.

80
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,401
The old man and Avdol think it’s a
good idea for us to head to India by train.

81
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:20,862
We leave tomorrow.

82
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,866
We’ll take the cable car to
Singapore station to reserve tickets.

83
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,163
Hmm?

84
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,740
Mr. Kakyoin,

85
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,295
JoJo’s left already. Shouldn’t we get going?

86
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,161
Huh?

87
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:43,885
Ah, right.

88
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,762
I’ll catch up in just a second.

89
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:50,350
Oh, okay. I guess you must like
coconut juice a whole lot, huh?

90
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:09,912
Was that a b...beetle?

91
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,481
N...No, no. I must be seeing things.

92
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:14,666
It must have been a piece of coconut or something.

93
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,720
Oh, yes, I do love coconuts.

94
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:19,379
They’re my favorite.

95
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,310
What’s up, half pint?

96
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,724
Uh, nothing. Don’t worry.

97
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,910
Hey, Jotaro.

98
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,485
You gonna eat that cherry?

99
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,572
Not, then hand it over already.

100
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:46,948
I’m starving.

101
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,452
Uh...oh! Better watch out, Jotaro!

102
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:52,787
JoJo!

103
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:57,506
Good one, huh?

104
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,923
I’m only playing with you, good ol’ Jotaro.

105
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:07,402
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

106
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:16,812
It’s like he’s a totally different person.

107
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:23,485
That look again! What’s with all this hardcore glaring,
Jotaro, old pal? Have you lost your sense of humor?

108
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,302
Get in, Kakyoin.

109
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,459
The cable car just got here.

110
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,836
Now, I told you to get in.

111
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,422
See? I’ve got your ticket right here.

112
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:47,328
I’m gonna knock your crooked, possessed ass

113
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,311
right into that cable car.

114
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:51,271
Huh?

115
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,017
What the?!

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,526
You’re a bit off.

117
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,885
"Possessed" isn’t quite the word.

118
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,775
Wanna give it another try?

119
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,929
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,033
Wait a minute.

121
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:15,837
This isn’t Kakyoin.

122
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,350
Congrats on not being as stupid as you look.

123
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,585
Though, you still haven’t realized my
body’s been growing this whole time, have you?

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,317
All right, who are you?

125
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,048
Is he a stand? Can’t be.

126
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,911
I was able to touch him just now.

127
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:32,093
Unless he’s a stand I can strike with my own fists?

128
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,556
Huh? JoJo!

129
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:37,851
I can merge with any organic matter I consume.

130
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:43,202
I’m a stand anyone can see and
touch. Lucky them, don’t you think?

131
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:46,502
I’m Yellow Temperance, of the temperance card.

132
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,322
Gaze upon my handsome face with envy!

133
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,543
Come now, Jotaro, old pal.

134
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,011
Take a good look at your hand.

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,330
See that little bit of me?

136
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:01,794
It latched on when you hit me
and really doesn’t want to let go.

137
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,316
I advise you not to touch,

138
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:06,667
or it’ll go after your left hand, too.

139
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,175
You should save your left hand for picking your nose.

140
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,093
This stand is a slow eater,

141
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,804
and the more it eats, the bigger it gets.

142
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,514
You’ll never get it off.

143
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:18,982
Crap! Damn you.

144
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:20,671
Ora!

145
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,270
What do you mean, "ora"?

146
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:26,532
When I digest you, I’ll shove
your own crap down your measly throat!

147
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,234
Enh! The hell?

148
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,444
This stuff burns.

149
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,656
Damn bastard.

150
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,788
Hey, is this Mr. JoJo’s grandpa?

151
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,241
He needs your help!

152
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,279
Anne? Tell me what’s wrong.

153
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,105
It’s Mr. Kakyoin!

154
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:45,662
What about Kakyoin?

155
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:48,716
It’s true. Seems he has betrayed us.

156
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,382
Mr. Kakyoin’s face split, and now he’s a giant!

157
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:55,404
But Mr. Kakyoin wasn’t Mr. Kakyoin. He’s a fake, and

158
00:09:55,491 --> 00:10:00,100
JoJo got attacked by some weird slime on
the cable car, and now it’s eating his finger!

159
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,064
Calm down, Anne. Where are you now?

160
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,147
I’m at the cable car station at the train center!

161
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,732
He’s being attacked!

162
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,866
Mr. Kakyoin went crazy and is attacking JoJo!

163
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:13,212
Hurry, and come back to the hotel as fast as you...

164
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,896
Did someone say my name just now?

165
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:15,615
Hmm?

166
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,575
Where the hell have you been?

167
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,522
Hmm? JoJo left me behind,

168
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,539
so I was sunbathing by the pool.

169
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,457
With your school uniform on?

170
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,542
Yes. Why not?

171
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,256
It’s all right.

172
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:29,129
We have the real one here with us.

173
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,942
Anne, be careful. This means your Kakyoin is a fake!

174
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,342
I told you that!

175
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,469
Oh, no!

176
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,714
JoJo just jumped out of the cable car!

177
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:01,703
Good freakin’ grief.

178
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,497
A stand that fuses with flesh?

179
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:05,957
It’s devouring my finger.

180
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,208
This could get bad.

181
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,546
First, I’ve gotta get this stuff off me.

182
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,715
Might be easier said than done.

183
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,654
It might mean I have to cut off my finger.

184
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:19,960
Ha! Do you really think you got away?

185
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:22,098
Sorry to burst your bubble, ol’ pal.

186
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:26,436
Now dig that earwax out of
your ears, and listen up, hotshot.

187
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,188
Your time’s run out,

188
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:32,066
’cause Yellow Temperance has no weaknesses!

189
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:34,328
You didn’t escape!

190
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:37,312
It’s just that I don’t have to chase you.

191
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,365
You’re as good as dead!

192
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,763
This’ll hurt like a son of a
bitch, but I don’t have a choice.

193
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,133
Wait. What the hell?

194
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,366
The flame only made it grow bigger.

195
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,554
That was a bad idea.

196
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,178
Damn. I thought I had it.

197
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,474
Hmm?

198
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,114
Pardon me.

199
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:24,486
My goodness. That’s certainly a bizarre entrance.

200
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:25,890
Don’t mind me.

201
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,356
Hey, there, kid.

202
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,064
I’m gonna need to borrow your Popsicle for just a second.

203
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,503
Hold on, young man.

204
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,964
What is it you think you’re doing with that child?

205
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,111
Is this your kid?

206
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,522
No, he’s not, but...

207
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,666
Then shut up, lady, and enjoy the scenery.

208
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,783
Sorry, kid. When we get down to the bottom, I’ll
buy you a new one, okay, whatever kind you want.

209
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:45,479
Uh...huh.

210
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,059
If I can’t burn it off...

211
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,188
That bastard.

212
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:56,362
What? Now it’s forming needles
and digging even deeper into my hand!

213
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,703
You really are stupid.

214
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,363
Nothing will work on it, not even fire and ice.

215
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,329
I told you before, didn’t I?

216
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,789
You won’t find a single weakness.

217
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,337
And now you’re mine, you little shit!

218
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,098
You’re the...

219
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:23,303
Papa! The puppy! It’s got our puppy!

220
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:27,988
You bastard, you were already in this
cable car waiting for me, weren’t you?

221
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,020
No! Please don’t hurt Pocky!

222
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,495
Watch out! Don’t pull him!

223
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:35,732
Let go!

224
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,538
And now it’s your turn to die, Jotaro, old pal!

225
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:45,953
Ora!

226
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:48,244
Eh, you’re fast, but...

227
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:52,212
I keep telling you I don’t have any weaknesses.

228
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,375
Are you even listening to me?

229
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,753
You dumbass redneck!

230
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,423
My stand is armor that can also absorb power,

231
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,759
a defensive wall that can also attack.

232
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,633
No matter how fast you are,

233
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:07,333
no matter how strong or smart you think you are,

234
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:10,965
against Yellow Temperance, you are helpless!

235
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,234
There’s no way you can defeat me.

236
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:18,066
You won’t survive, unless, of course, you
suck it up and take a cleaver to your right hand!

237
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:21,235
Do you understand?!

238
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:25,946
Try as hard as you want, but you have no way of winning!

239
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,492
You’re not getting out of this,

240
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:29,391
not until you’re digested.

241
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,864
I’ll eat you up!

242
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:32,891
Oh, good grief.

243
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:33,998
Eh?

244
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,335
You’re right, you really don’t have any weaknesses.

245
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,629
Maybe you are the world’s strongest,

246
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,047
and that’s terrifying,

247
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,341
but I’ll tell you, we Kujos...

248
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,802
no, wait. I mean Joestars.

249
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,554
We use strategy to fight our way past any obstacle.

250
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:53,142
You haven’t won yet, and I still have one strategy left.

251
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:54,143
Really?

252
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,108
And that’s to...

253
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:57,980
And that’s to...

254
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,402
Run away!

255
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,695
What the hell?!

256
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,073
You’re in the middle of being eaten alive, you dumb-ass!

257
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:12,726
My stand’s got a hold that you can’t escape,
and you say you’ll run away? Don’t make me laugh.

258
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:14,929
When I said run away...

259
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,835
I meant into the water.

260
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,044
Damn it!

261
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,588
I...I can’t breathe.

262
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:29,470
You let your stand’s guard down to take a breath.

263
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,971
Your stand may be invincible, but you sure as hell aren’t.

264
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,228
If I destroy you, then your stand dies, too.

265
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:40,731
Do you understand?

266
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:46,491
Listen, I’ve had it up to here with
that cocky ass mouth of yours, all right?!

267
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,269
I just happen to be the type of
guy who takes these things to heart.

268
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,659
Ora!

269
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,501
No, please, stop it.

270
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,981
I can’t fight anymore. I’m through!

271
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:06,013
My beautiful nose is completely shattered,

272
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:11,279
and my face is so messed up, they’re
gonna have to wire my jaw shut, too. It hurts!

273
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,345
Spare me! Dio, h...he paid me to do this.

274
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:18,822
Look, I don’t plan on risking
my life going after you guys.

275
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,261
There! See?

276
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,396
I want something from you.

277
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,065
Eh?

278
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,168
The other stand users,

279
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,042
I want all the info you’ve got.

280
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:31,532
But that’s the one thing I can’t
say. Don’t ask me that! Please!

281
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:32,906
I won’t do it!

282
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,286
I mean, I do have some pride, you know.

283
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:37,317
I just can’t, okay?

284
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,207
Well, okay, then.

285
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:40,625
That’s honorable.

286
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,043
I remember now!

287
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,673
There are four of them, okay?

288
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,420
One is the Emperor, then Hanged Man and Empress,

289
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,216
and the last one goes by Death.

290
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,093
Got it. And what about their powers?

291
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,137
Sorry. I...I don’t know.

292
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:56,140
No, no, really! I honestly don’t know any more!

293
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:59,310
Don’t you see? Stand users don’t reveal their powers.

294
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,813
If they did, they’d be exposing their weaknesses outright.

295
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,649
But I do know something.

296
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,167
Some witch taught Dio about stands,

297
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,376
and her son is one of the four coming after you.

298
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,379
His name is Centerfold.

299
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,190
He’s unmistakable, because he has two right hands.

300
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,293
His card is the Hanged Man.

301
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:21,165
He’s the one who killed
Polnareff’s little sister, isn’t he?

302
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,706
I’ve heard the occasional rumor about his powers.

303
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,594
A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.

304
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,382
I haven’t actually seen it,

305
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:31,759
but Polnareff has no chance of winning.

306
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,173
He’s dead meat.

307
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:35,671
Hmm?

308
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,894
I just noticed something, Jotaro.

309
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,924
Looks like I’ve still got some luck on my side.

310
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,025
Ha ha! Sucks to be you.

311
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,677
See that drain over there off to your right,

312
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,772
the one with all the blue crawdads?

313
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,256
Take a real good look.

314
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,189
Huh?

315
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,485
A manhole.

316
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,978
That drainpipe connects to this manhole!

317
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:21,350
It’s a perfect setup for Yellow Temperance’s power!

318
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:24,228
I’m gonna pull you in and hold you there!

319
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,565
Now you can’t attack me, loser.

320
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,238
I guess what I told you about the man
with two right hands will go to waste.

321
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:35,531
You’re not gonna be able to
help poor Polnareff, Jotaro Kujo!

322
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:39,066
Aren’t I lucky to have this drain to slurp you into?

323
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,361
And you thought you had me, didn’t you?

324
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,164
Man, am I lucky!

325
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:47,043
Time to power up with some crustaceans!

326
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,122
This is gonna be fun!

327
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,381
I’ll mash you up and turn you into jelly,

328
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:58,387
and when I kill you, Dio’s
gonna give me $100 million. Ha ha!

329
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,289
A few minutes of brawling with
you, and I will be set for life!

330
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,809
Aren’t I lucky?

331
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,855
Tell me I’m lucky, you ball-less little butt-munch!

332
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,358
Good grief, really?

333
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:14,320
When you’re focused on everything
else, it’s hard to observe yourself.

334
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,322
You don’t get it, do you?

335
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,949
Fine. Then I’ll just beat the lesson in.

336
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,910
Your luck finally ran out.

337
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:24,205
Before, you got away with only a broken nose.

338
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:25,446
Huh?

339
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:28,209
When I’m done, you won’t have any bones left to break!

340
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:33,215
What did he just do?!

341
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,341
He punched me with water?!

342
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,084
I was only kidding around, Mr. Jotaro.

343
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,027
I swear I was just messing with ya, buddy!

344
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,210
Didn’t mean anything by it, okay?

345
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:00,247
Be cool, man. Be cool. It was just a prank!

346
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,368
Wait. Hang on a second.

347
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,287
You’re not thinking about punching me any more, are you?

348
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,238
I’m seriously injured here.

349
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:10,918
My nose is badly broken, and my
jaw’s gonna have to be wired shut.

350
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:15,589
Just shut up already.

351
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,008
I have nothing more to say to you.

352
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,136
You’re way too pathetic.

353
00:20:20,856 --> 00:20:22,763
I’m done wasting my breath.

354
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:38,466
Good grief.

355
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,990
So we’re finally heading to India.

356
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:47,329
And the man with the two right
hands is called centerfold, right?

357
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,869
By the way, where did Anne run off to?

358
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:56,240
She was hanging around Singapore station
right before our train departed, but...

359
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:01,135
She vanished. Remember, she came to Singapore
to meet her father. I’m sure she found him.

360
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:06,348
Yeah, well, that story about her meeting up with
her dad sounded fishy to me. I bet she’s a runaway.

361
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:11,372
But it is a bit lonely without
that little rug-rat, right, JoJo?

362
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,775
But that stand earlier was pretty creepy.

363
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:18,944
It freaks me out that a stand
could disguise himself as me.

364
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,245
You know, I’ve been thinking about it.

365
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,365
He must have transformed when I left the hotel.

366
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:26,350
JoJo, those cherries, are you gonna eat ’em?

367
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,079
Not to be greedy, but they are my favorite.

368
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:30,691
Could I have one?

369
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:31,415
Yeah, sure.

370
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,833
You’re the best.

371
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,629
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.

372
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,673
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick,
lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.

373
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,362
Hey, look, JoJo. Flamingos in flight.

374
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:45,791
Oh, good grief.

375
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:54,855
JoJo.

376
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:15,633
All the old paintings on the tomb

377
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,801
They do the sand dance, don't you know

378
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:19,145
If they move too quick

379
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,281
Oh, whey, oh

380
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,599
They're falling down like a domino

381
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,967
All the bazaar men by the Nile

382
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,222
They got the money on a bet

383
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:28,668
Gold crocodiles

384
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:29,584
Oh, whey, oh

385
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,863
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

386
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:34,138
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

387
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,521
Whey, oh, whey, oh

388
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:40,058
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

389
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,671
Walk like an Egyptian.

390
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,684
The blond waitresses take their trays

391
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,780
They spin around, and they cross the floor

392
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:01,054
They've got the moves

393
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,047
Oh, whey, oh

394
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,081
You drop your drink

395
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:04,582
Then they bring you more

396
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:06,852
All the school kids so sick of books

397
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,062
They like the punk and the metal band

398
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,489
When the buzzer rings

399
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,540
Oh, whey, oh

400
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,800
They're walking like an Egyptian

401
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,927
All the kids in the marketplace say

402
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,162
Whey, oh, whey, oh

403
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:22,967
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

404
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,744
Walk like an Egyptian
