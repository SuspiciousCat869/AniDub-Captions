1
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:33,613
How could this have happened?

2
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,583
I can't believe...

3
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,406
We totally fell for it.

4
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:15,496
Having managed to halt the
Lovers' horrifyingly invasive attack,

5
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:20,024
Jotaro and company choose to avoid
the political unrest in Iran and Iraq

6
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:26,206
and instead cross the Arabian sea at
Karachi to arrive in the United Arab Emirates.

7
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,932
Now then, if you'd be so kind as to sign this document,

8
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,504
everything will be squared away, sir.

9
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,306
Right here, yes?

10
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,054
Man, oh, man.

11
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:44,933
You know,I'm the kinna guy who do almost
anything for a pretty girl, even buy a car.

12
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,511
My, aren't you sweet?

13
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,664
How would you feel about the
two of us having dinner sometime?

14
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,302
Sorry, Polnareff.

15
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,754
I hate to interrupt when you're obviously so busy, but...

16
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:57,298
Mr. Joestar!

17
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,745
Come on. It's time to leave.

18
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,671
Seriously, try not to mess with the hair.

19
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:04,669
Do you know how hard it is to make it look this good?

20
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,346
As if anybody cares about your hairdo.

21
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:08,975
You're driving.

22
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,366
Right-o.

23
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,582
Au revior, mademoiselle.

24
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,109
Hey, Mr. Joestar,

25
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,980
I don't get why we're riding in such a
fancy, expensive car in this sandy death trap.

26
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:23,648
Wouldn't it be better for us to
get an off-road vehicle instead?

27
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,909
Oh, there's a method to my madness.

28
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:36,719
C'est magnifique! This country's amazing.

29
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:39,011
Are you guys seeing what I am here?

30
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,822
It's like every house is a crazy mansion or something.

31
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:42,817
Yeah.

32
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:48,039
In Tokyo, a house like one of these,
would cost three or four billion yen.

33
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:52,253
However, for most people in
this country, it's standard living.

34
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,523
It wasn't but 20 years ago that
this place was a barren desert,

35
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,078
though, thanks to a thriving oil industry,

36
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,707
it's grown into a playground for the rich.

37
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:04,971
The sun is merciless, but at least with air conditioning,

38
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,396
it's perfectly comfortable inside the car,

39
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,395
so no complaints here.

40
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,739
What's wrong, Kakyoin?

41
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:17,746
It's nothing. I was just
thinking about how open it is here.

42
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:20,132
I know we could spot anyone following us,

43
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:24,245
but I just can't shake the feeling
that there's someone out there watching.

44
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,608
Yeah, can't say that I blame you.

45
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,618
Well, back to business.

46
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:32,187
I've given a bit of thought to the route we should take.

47
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:36,317
About 100 kilometers northwest
is a village called Yarpline.

48
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:40,549
The desert and mountains make
taking a direct route near impossible.

49
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,434
It normally takes two days to reach by car,

50
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,432
so to expedite the travel time,
the locals use a Cessna to get there.

51
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,013
If you want my opinion,

52
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:53,909
we should go to the village and buy a Cessna
in order to cross the vast Saudi Arabian desert.

53
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,086
You know, I've been apprehensive
about getting anywhere near a plane.

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,649
If a stand user attacked and the plane went down,

55
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:02,910
we'd be putting innocent lives in harm's way,

56
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,305
but if we had a Cessna, I could be the pilot.

57
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,982
We'd be able to save a couple of days for sure.

58
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,573
Flying in a Cessna with a man
who's been in three plane crashes,

59
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,229
yeah, that seems like a perfect idea to me.

60
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,934
That comment notwithstanding,

61
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:23,796
our priority should be crossing the desert
and hightailing it to the village of Yarpline.

62
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,346
It'll take us one day on camelback.

63
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,625
Camelback?

64
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,149
A Cessna is one thing, but on camelback?

65
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:32,172
I've never ridden a camel in my life!

66
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,960
Just leave everything to me.

67
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,548
I know these creatures well,

68
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,047
and I'll teach you how to ride them.

69
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,289
You boys sit back, and watch the magic happen.

70
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:46,106
You want camels, you say?

71
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:49,534
Sure, I have them, but they're gonna cost you, my friend,

72
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,333
and they need a gentle touch.

73
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,942
We're kind of in a life-or-death situation here,

74
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,962
so we need them, whatever it takes.

75
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:59,094
As for payment, how about a trade for that car?

76
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,378
I couldn't possibly accept such a generous offer!

77
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,856
Yeah, Mr. Joestar!

78
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,684
And besides, you literally just bought that car!

79
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:12,394
What other reason did you think I
had to buy such a fancy, expensive car?

80
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:15,424
It's true an off-road vehicle would perform better here,

81
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,227
but we're not in the big city.

82
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,749
We can't just write a check in this place,

83
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:22,224
and cash isn't accepted here.

84
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:26,568
In my experience, trading is far
more effective in places such as these.

85
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:30,222
If you try to buy safety for cheap in a time of emergency,

86
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,893
you'll find yourself even worse off in the end.

87
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:37,342
Besides, I don't know about you, but
I think we've suffered enough already.

88
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:38,768
Hey, mister!

89
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:42,017
I take it this seals the deal?

90
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh, hey, you know what?

91
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,830
To make things a little more even,
I'd like the water in those tanks, too.

92
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,296
It's the most important thing when you're in the desert.

93
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:55,177
But the water isn't nearly as valuable as your car, sir.

94
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:58,407
You are very strange indeed, sir!

95
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:02,597
All right, everyone. Let's get ready, shall we?

96
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,662
Crossing the desert will be no
easy task. Brace yourselves, men!

97
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,334
Merde! That stinks!

98
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,699
Hey, Mr. Joestar, how the heck are we
supposed to get on one of these things?

99
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,461
It's, like, three meters tall!

100
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:22,369
Allow me to demonstrate the proper way to mount a camel.

101
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:25,475
You have to make them sit first, and then you get on.

102
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,749
Like I said, make them sit, and then get on.

103
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,985
You see? Just like this!

104
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,473
You make 'em sit, and then you get on 'em!

105
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:43,945
Give me a minute! Any second, this
beast is gonna sit and let me saddle up.

106
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:48,149
Hey! Sit down, would you?!

107
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,497
Damn it, you stubborn animal!

108
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,645
Mr. Joestar, you have ridden
one of these before, haven't you?

109
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:57,734
I will have you know that I've watched "Lawrence
of Arabia" three times now from start to finish!

110
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,637
I know all too well how to ride a camel!

111
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,248
Although, two of those times, I slept through half of it.

112
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,212
You learned to ride from a movie?!

113
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:09,510
So you're saying you've never actually ridden one before?

114
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,678
The saliva makes great sunscreen.

115
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,173
The more you know...

116
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,117
Listen up. When you're handling an animal,

117
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:29,001
it's absolutely imperative to
understand exactly how it feels,

118
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:31,310
and I mean exactly.

119
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,237
Here. Doesn't this yummy apple
look absolutely scrumptious?

120
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,724
It's really good!

121
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,391
Come on. Come on.

122
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,949
There's a good boy.

123
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:47,010
You see? I made the camel sit down. If you
just take the time to get inside its head,

124
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,549
it'll sit down for you for sure!

125
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:54,769
Whoa! I did it!

126
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:58,222
Whoa. It's so high off the ground.

127
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:03,600
By the way, did you know camels can
close their nostrils to keep the sand out?

128
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:07,867
And before I forget, you're forbidden
from making stupid camel jokes.

129
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,281
Is that understood?

130
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:14,354
Your turn. Now you greenhorns get to
learn the finer points of riding a camel.

131
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:15,805
Listen up.

132
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:20,009
The first thing you need to know is that
camels don't walk anything like horses.

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,380
The front and back legs on either side move
forward together, so these things can sway a lot,

134
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:25,986
but don't let that throw you off.

135
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:29,808
If you find a way to ride with the
camel's rhythm, I know you'll be just fine.

136
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,057
For example...

137
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,155
Yah! Hey, wait!

138
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,455
You're going too fast! Slow down!

139
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,346
Listen to me, damn it!

140
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:40,254
Yah! I didn't tell you to go that way!

141
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,618
Yaah!

142
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,796
Okay, then.

143
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:49,460
Now that everyone's gotten the hang
of mounting and riding their camels,

144
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:54,400
All right, we have a desert to get through!

145
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,138
The time has arrived, men!

146
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,054
Onward toward the northwest!

147
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,116
Hey, now! Wait just a minute! Hey!

148
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,632
Something's wrong.

149
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:18,422
I still haven't been able to shake the
feeling that someone out there is watching us.

150
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,389
Kakyoin, don't you think you
might be worrying a bit too much?

151
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,489
I mean, the palm leaves will erase our tracks.

152
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:33,401
Plus, we can see for kilometers in all directions.

153
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,411
If someone were here, we'd know.

154
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,031
Actually, I think he's onto something.

155
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,388
I feel some sort of presence, too.

156
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,181
Hey, Jotaro, why don't you go take a look?

157
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,827
How about it? Do you see anything suspicious out there?

158
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,794
No, nothing,

159
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,753
nothing whatsoever.

160
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:08,083
Even so, something's not right here, but what is it?

161
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,764
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

162
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:12,740
Yeah.

163
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,427
Let's get as far away as we can.

164
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:18,790
We'll keep pressing forward until
the sun goes down this evening,

165
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,897
then stop to pitch our tents.

166
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,929
It's much too dangerous for us to travel at night.

167
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,885
I only wish we could get out of this freaking heat.

168
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:30,512
Just look at this. It's reading 50 degrees Celsius.

169
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,613
Yeah, it is hot out here.

170
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:36,410
But then again, the weather is
at its hottest right around now.

171
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,519
Huh? 8:00?

172
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:39,466
Wha?

173
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,181
Jotaro, check your watch. What time does it say?

174
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:46,496
It's 10... Past 8:00.

175
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:48,939
Hey, old man!

176
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,438
My watch is correct.

177
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,629
We lost track of time,

178
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,378
but what the hell's going on?

179
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:58,024
According to my watch, it's past 8 P.M.

180
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,900
So why isn't the sun setting?

181
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,782
This is impossible.

182
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,794
The thermometer is jumping to 60 degrees Celsius!

183
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:18,087
No, the sun isn't setting at all. It's actually...

184
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,858
It's actually rising higher in the west!

185
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,242
Wait. Could it be that that sun is really...

186
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,066
A stand?

187
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,301
I don't understand how such a thing is even possible.

188
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,932
How could this sun actually be a stand?

189
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:42,531
Quickly, take cover behind those rocks!

190
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,765
How the hell could that sun be a stand?!

191
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:49,849
We're such fools. How did we miss this?!

192
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:54,371
I knew that we were being watched, but I never
thought this is why I couldn't see our stalker.

193
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:56,916
At this rate, that Sun is gonna burn all day...

194
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,412
No, all night long. Ah, nom de dieu!

195
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:03,573
It's going to roast us like a bunch of
rotisserie chickens. We're totally screwed!

196
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:04,474
Yeah,

197
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,080
though I doubt it'll take that long.

198
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:11,016
The thing is a sauna can dangerously
raise the body's temperature in minutes.

199
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,356
Okay, then, how do we fight it?

200
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,511
C'est des conneries! It's 70 degrees Celsius!

201
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:21,818
And to add insult to injury, we
can't tell if the stand is close or not!

202
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,106
The distance is impossible to judge!

203
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:28,880
Our only option here is to
quickly take out the stand user.

204
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,518
Indeed, the user.

205
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:33,105
He has to be nearby.

206
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,294
We have to find him.

207
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,639
He must have a way to conceal himself,

208
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,516
and somehow he's been following us all this time.

209
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,666
Hang on a minute.

210
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:46,520
What if it's like the Lovers we encountered in Pakistan?
Maybe this guy has a stand he can use from far away.

211
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:48,588
That's not the case this time.

212
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:52,036
Sure, a weak stand can be controlled from a distance,

213
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:54,162
but this Sun is just too strong.

214
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,555
The energy it's emitting is incredible!

215
00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,258
The stand user has to be nearby.

216
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,039
Hey, check it out.

217
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:16,129
The camels are starting to
collapse from exposure to the heat.

218
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,773
And this waiting isn't getting us anywhere.

219
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:21,887
I'll use Hierophant to do some
reconnaissance around the area.

220
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,827
Kakyoin.

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,704
I'm only searching for the stand's rough location.

222
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,892
Once we know how far away it actually is,

223
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,351
we might just be able to locate the user.

224
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,790
20 meters. 40 meters.

225
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:36,511
60 meters. 80 meters.

226
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,515
100...

227
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,266
Something's not right.

228
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,840
Kakyoin, have Hierophant come back!

229
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,780
There's something's coming right at us!

230
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,430
Before that happens,

231
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,490
Emerald...

232
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,503
No! Kakyoin!

233
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:56,957
The camel!

234
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:02,246
You bastard!

235
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:07,383
I'm gonna bust a hole in the ground, everybody get in now!

236
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:08,444
Ora!

237
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:29,892
You okay, Kakyoin?

238
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:31,686
Yes, I am.

239
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,161
I was in the middle of initiating my Emerald Splash,

240
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,785
so that protected me from any major damage.

241
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,730
More concerning is this intense heat.

242
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,434
I feel like it's gonna drive me insane.

243
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:46,459
Did any of you notice that
attack was perfectly aimed at us?

244
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,983
And that could only mean that
the enemy has been watching us.

245
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,106
But from where? Where is he?

246
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:54,372
Polnareff, keep your voice down.

247
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,011
If you keep shouting, the enemy will find us.

248
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,495
Just lay low for now.

249
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,517
We'll sit tight for a while and see what happens next.

250
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,075
Oh, shit!

251
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,858
Things can't go on like this.

252
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,999
Come on. Think, damn it.

253
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:36,050
It's time for this old-timer
to take the bull by the horns.

254
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,211
But this isn't the most ideal spot.

255
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,501
I can't even use my best technique.

256
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,731
It's crucial that I get more information.

257
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,505
Jotaro.

258
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:53,622
Yah!

259
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,175
Son of a bitch!

260
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:56,800
Where the hell are you?!

261
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:59,442
How are you watching us?! Are you invisible or something?!

262
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:02,355
Show yourself, you coward! Damn!

263
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:03,794
Hey, Kakyoin, what's the matter?

264
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,448
Kakyoin!

265
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,512
What the hell are you laughing
about? Hey, snap out of it already.

266
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,369
Control yourself, man.

267
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:18,932
J-Jotaro!

268
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,264
This is happening to you, too?

269
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,871
P-Polnareff, no!

270
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,282
Not you, too.

271
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,061
Oh, my god, no!

272
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:41,417
They've all lost it!

273
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,853
This damn heat has driven them all completely insane!

274
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:47,896
I have my sanity, but what can I do?

275
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:52,330
Hey, Jotaro! Get a hold of yourself, man!

276
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,959
You have to settle down!

277
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:55,956
You need to listen to me, Jotaro.

278
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,288
Sometimes things get rough, but when
they do, you have to remain in control. Eh?

279
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:04,548
Please, please don't get the
wrong idea about this, Mr. Joestar.

280
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:07,124
Have a look at that rock over there.

281
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,553
It's large enough for someone
to hide behind. Don't you agree?

282
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,724
What? I don't follow you.

283
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,879
Oh, you will.

284
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,750
Now take a look at the rock
that's sitting on the opposite side.

285
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,741
Opposite side, huh?

286
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:27,308
Um...

287
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,477
You still don't see it, sir?

288
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:30,891
Have another look.

289
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:35,247
There's a rock that's shaped exactly the
same way, but it's on the opposite side.

290
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,363
The shadow is also reversed, which means...

291
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,330
What a stupid trick!

292
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:44,253
Move.

293
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,191
Stay here, old man.

294
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:51,120
Jotaro! If you go out there now, you're
all but asking for the enemy to attack you!

295
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,500
It's dangerous!

296
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:56,808
Ora!

297
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,383
How'd a hole suddenly appear in thin air?!

298
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,948
Good grief, old man.

299
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,917
You really are pathetic.

300
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:13,436
Well, I'll just assume that the
intense heat was too much for you,

301
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:17,519
or else I'd find it very hard to
believe that you're my grandfather.

302
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,537
Since we defeated the enemy stand, night's finally fallen.

303
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:23,887
Or maybe I should say it's back to being night.

304
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,691
However you wanna slice it, we're safe at last.

305
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:29,699
Just how long do you plan on hiding in that hole?

306
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,166
Oh, yeah, right.

307
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,838
Good grief.

308
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:36,198
It's finally gotten dark around here.

309
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,397
Well, what do you know? It's a mirror.

310
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,487
And look at this.

311
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,473
Check out the little car he's got behind the mirror.

312
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,576
It looks like it's rather comfy.

313
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:48,882
There's even air conditioning.

314
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:55,674
Man, I had no clue he was reflecting the desert
and tailing us from behind in this nifty little thing.

315
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,252
He was smarter than I thought.

316
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,752
I see he has a tank of water, too.

317
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:01,818
How about we take it off his hands?

318
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:03,571
Oh, and here's a drink.

319
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,634
Let me understand all this.

320
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,470
You mean we've already defeated the stand user?

321
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,309
There's nothing else to do?

322
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,552
We don't even know this guy's name,

323
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:21,146
but somehow we've already made short work of his stand?

324
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,302
Yes, you've hit the nail on the head.

325
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,103
So this was the sun card's stand, huh?

326
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,926
At first, he was pretty impressive,

327
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,209
but once we figured the guy out, he
actually kinda sucked, didn't he? Heh.

328
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,983
So off to our next destination.

329
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,396
It's pretty chilly in the desert at night, isn't it?

330
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:46,955
Hold your horses. Traveling at night is dangerous.
If we're not careful, we could lose our way.

331
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,217
Yeah, and with that idiot out of
the way, it'll be sweet dreams tonight.

332
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:52,542
Ah-choo!

333
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,533
Ba-dum-tss.

334
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:15,064
All the old paintings on the tomb

335
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,232
They do the sand dance, don't you know

336
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,576
If they move too quick

337
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,712
Oh, whey, oh

338
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,030
They're falling down like a domino

339
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:24,398
All the bazaar men by the Nile

340
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,653
They got the money on a bet

341
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,099
Gold crocodiles

342
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:29,015
Oh, whey, oh

343
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,294
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

344
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,569
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

345
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,952
Whey, oh, whey, oh

346
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:39,489
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

347
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,102
Walk like an Egyptian.

348
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:57,115
The blond waitresses take their trays

349
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,211
They spin around, and they cross the floor

350
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,485
They've got the moves

351
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,478
Oh, whey, oh

352
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:02,512
You drop your drink

353
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:04,013
Then they bring you more

354
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:06,283
All the school kids so sick of books

355
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:08,493
They like the punk and the metal band

356
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:09,920
When the buzzer rings

357
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:10,971
Oh, whey, oh

358
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:13,231
They're walking like an Egyptian

359
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:15,358
All the kids in the marketplace say

360
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:17,593
Whey, oh, whey, oh

361
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:22,398
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

362
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:25,175
Walk like an Egyptian
