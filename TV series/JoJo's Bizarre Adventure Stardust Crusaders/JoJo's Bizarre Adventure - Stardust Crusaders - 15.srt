1
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:36,332
Polnareff, I shall savor killing you.

2
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:41,216
To avenge my dear son, I shall
rip out your insides while you watch.

3
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:45,970
But I can't let him find Hol Horse's
body, or else my chance will be lost.

4
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,218
She's not behind the counter, either.

5
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,084
It'll be even worse if the other three show up.

6
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,809
I need to kill them one by one, damn it.

7
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:56,653
Stay back. Go away.

8
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,624
Oh, madame, are you here?

9
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,657
I thought I heard some kind of
crash back here. Are you okay?

10
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:08,870
Hmm.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,108
I'm coming in, madame.

12
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,698
Oh, no! What happened?

13
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:24,052
Oh, it's nothing. It's only a tiny
fall. Just bruised my hip a little bit.

14
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:27,001
You fell down? You can't be falling now.

15
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,635
And you burned your left hand?

16
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,965
You're being much, much too careless.

17
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,508
Oh, thank you, dear boy.

18
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:34,542
I'm fine.

19
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,664
No problem. I promise.

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,259
Get out. Get out. Get out!

21
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,510
Who said you could come in here, damn it?

22
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:52,032
I'll spare you my wrath for now,

23
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,858
but when the time is right, I'll kill you
just like I killed that bastard Hol Horse.

24
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,904
All it takes is just a tiny, little
wound, and then you're finished.

25
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,310
I'll turn you into my very own puppet of Justice.

26
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,080
Hmm?

27
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:05,566
Eh?

28
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,760
Oh? Cool.

29
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,598
Here. Your staff.

30
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:13,163
Madame, you seem to be sweating a lot.

31
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:16,437
It's nothing. Don't concern yourself with me. I'm fine.

32
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,764
Just go to your room, and get some rest.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,116
Well, if you insist.

34
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,032
So I was wondering, are you running
the entire hotel all by yourself?

35
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:28,202
Don't you have some family around to help, like a son?

36
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:34,075
Huh? Sorry. Did you say something?

37
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:38,887
Uh, I was just saying I've gotten used to living alone.

38
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,604
Ah, I see.

39
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:42,663
Sounds lonely to me.

40
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:45,682
Just think, life with the son and daughter along.

41
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,789
Your grandkids could run around and play in the lobby.

42
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,910
They'd definitely cheer this place up.

43
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:54,603
It'd be a little noisy, but
that's what makes families great!

44
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,870
If you had a son, he'd probably be older than me, right?

45
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,488
Hey, what's the matter?

46
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:03,636
Did you have a son who moved away or something?

47
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:09,195
N-No. He passed away.

48
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,104
Oh, I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,371
That was terribly insensitive of me.

50
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:17,389
You're the one who killed him, you monster. I despise you.

51
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:20,583
I'll slaughter you. I'll slaughter you.

52
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:23,102
Please, sit down and rest.

53
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,860
I'll give you a nice back rub.

54
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,773
I know how it feels to be alone.

55
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,275
I lost my mom when I was still just a kid.

56
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,238
Isn't this great? Ah, the memories.

57
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,137
Tonight, you can think about me...

58
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:37,157
as if I'm your own beloved son.

59
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,938
Ask me for anything, okay?

60
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:46,729
You rotten little brat. I should
just kill you right now, you fool!

61
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,764
Wow, you're really tense.

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,427
I guess living alone has been pretty tough on you.

63
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:54,906
Hmm?

64
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,929
Huh? What's that guy doing there?

65
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:07,401
Hol Horse? How is he still alive?

66
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:12,994
That miscreant must have made his stand vanish
as soon as it shot the bullet into his mouth.

67
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,664
What? No! That face.

68
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,216
Hey. Look behind you, Polnareff.

69
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,782
Behind you, you fool!

70
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:23,609
No way! You're Hol Horse!

71
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,417
What are you doing?

72
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,632
Getting my vengeance!

73
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:30,546
I'm the mother of Centerfold, who
you mercilessly murdered in cold blood!

74
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,091
Chariot!

75
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,142
So you were a stand user all along!

76
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:43,488
Dare play a part in murdering my boy,
and I'll make sure you'll pay for it!

77
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,382
Mr. Joestar, I need help!

78
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:46,829
Hah.

79
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:52,064
It's too late. I'm afraid your trusty
friends will never hear your cry, my dear...

80
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,964
Because...

81
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:59,077
I've summoned my own allies.

82
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,795
Who the hell are you guys?

83
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:04,924
Wait. It's you.

84
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:07,506
B-But you're dead.

85
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,335
You were dead when we got here.

86
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,176
You're the one from India!

87
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,818
Holy shit. We've got zombies.

88
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:29,256
Behold the terrifying power of Justice, my stand.

89
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:36,374
One can only have one stand, but Justice, the fog
stand, can transform the dead into my personal army.

90
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:41,706
It can control hundreds of
corpses, even thousands of them.

91
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:45,915
Aren't you taking this grudge a bit too far?

92
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:49,069
To think that such a twisted stand user was after us.

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,484
I had no idea.

94
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,558
This whole godforsaken town's got it in for you.

95
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:57,275
And if you get any kind of wound,
she'll turn you into her personal puppet.

96
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,263
I need only to give you a little
scratch. It doesn't take much, you know.

97
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,600
Soon you'll be mine.

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,850
Then my stand, Justice, will take care of the rest.

99
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,605
You're dead!

100
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,702
Get him!

101
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:11,878
I'm outta here!

102
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,748
Polnareff!

103
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,583
Don't leave me here, please.

104
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,512
Oh, shut up.

105
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,372
Did you forget about shotting my friend Avdol?

106
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,373
Now, why in the hell should I save you?

107
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,915
You're on your own, pal.

108
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,934
You can't escape my righteous vengeance, Polnareff!

109
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,277
I'll yank your brains out through your nostrils!

110
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:31,248
I'll snap your spine in half and shatter your bones!

111
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,166
I'll crush your balls 'til they pop!

112
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:35,451
My vengeance comes now!

113
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:39,790
She's psychotic.

114
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,998
How can an old crone like her possibly run so fast?

115
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:44,181
Take this.

116
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,185
Damn it. That filthy coward ran into the back room.

117
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:51,688
After him, you fools!

118
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,732
Break down that door at once!

119
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,648
Merde. Just my luck.

120
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,008
This hallway leads down to the basement.

121
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,279
I'm so far away from them now,

122
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,163
Mr. Joestar and the others will never hear me.

123
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,526
I don't think those creepy zombies can beat me, but
if I get even a single scratch, I'll be in trouble.

124
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,607
She'll take control of me, just like Hol Horse.

125
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,713
D-Damn it. Isn't there any way outside?

126
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:23,489
And of course the windows have iron bars on them.

127
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:28,378
Damn it!

128
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,141
I'll hide in this room.

129
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:34,924
Crap, they broke down the door.

130
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,449
At this rate, I'm going to have to fight them.

131
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:41,444
I just have to keep these freaks
as far away from my skin as possible.

132
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,116
And now they're coming down the hallway.

133
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,245
They must be checking every room.

134
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:50,232
Damn it. They're getting closer and closer.

135
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,540
Wait a minute. Oh, come on.
Did I run into another bathroom?

136
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:59,473
Why am I always getting ambushed in bathrooms?

137
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,707
Damn it. The toilet is so dirty.

138
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,297
All right, just try it.

139
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,029
But the second you walk in,

140
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,522
my Chariot will chop up the
four of you in a single breath.

141
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,215
Huh?

142
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:26,166
What's going on?

143
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,341
Now it's totally quiet out there.

144
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:29,381
Creepy.

145
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:32,114
Damn zombies, that old hag,

146
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:34,078
what the hell are they doing?

147
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,293
Aren't they going to break down the door?

148
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,548
What's taking them so long?

149
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,876
Come on. Do something, damn it.

150
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:54,412
Hmm?

151
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:03,794
Ahh! They were looking through the keyhole the whole time!

152
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,090
What the hell?

153
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,026
Merde! This is not good.

154
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,031
The bastard stabbed me in the tongue!

155
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:23,614
Perfect! You've finally fallen under my
Justice's control, you shitty little brat!

156
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:30,631
And now, if you don't open that door
and come out on your own this second,

157
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:34,792
I'm going to slowly crush your
face and pull you through the keyhole!

158
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,176
Laugh now.

159
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:50,341
How pitiful, Polnareff. Very pitiful, indeed.

160
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,183
This isn't even close to the level of
torture you put my Centerfold through.

161
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,917
Because of your cowardice, my
precious son died in unimaginable agony.

162
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:09,477
Now, then, how about we have you clean the bathroom, eh?

163
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,964
Sound like a plan to you?

164
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:24,417
Lick the toilet until it sparkles like new.

165
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,547
Don't be shy.

166
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:30,081
Lick it 'til it's shiny, like this.

167
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,759
No, not that.

168
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,800
Anything but that.

169
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,244
Oh, god, help me!

170
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,506
Oh, you startled me.

171
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,072
You must learn to knock, my young man?

172
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,439
What can I do for you?

173
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,714
I'm here looking for Polnareff, and I did knock.

174
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:23,688
Maybe you didn't hear me, because
you were too busy doing something else.

175
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,085
I wonder what.

176
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:37,472
I'm looking for Polnareff, but I can't find him.

177
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:39,205
Seen him, grandma?

178
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,778
Damn. Now what?

179
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:48,100
Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever and knows
the right questions to ask to get what he wants.

180
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:49,698
I have to be careful.

181
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,195
Playing dumb will just make him
more suspicious. I need something else.

182
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,746
What a troublesome brat.

183
00:12:57,222 --> 00:13:01,735
I know. I'll tell him where he can find
Polnareff, and as soon as he turns his back,

184
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,302
I'll turn him into a pincushion with these.

185
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:07,973
Then he'll be easy pickings for my Justice.

186
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,030
Yes, of course I can help you.

187
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:16,494
I know exactly where he is, Mr. Jotaro.
He and I were just having a lovely chat.

188
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh?

189
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:23,568
This isn't good.

190
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:27,835
Jotaro has no idea a tiny scratch will spell his doom.

191
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,162
S-Stay back.

192
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,268
Tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin.

193
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,330
That hag is the enemy.

194
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:38,075
He's in the bathroom, but he's
been in there for quite some time.

195
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,820
Of course he's taking a shit.

196
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,490
Through this door here?

197
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:50,240
Yes, that's right. Once you're
through the door, make a left turn.

198
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:53,664
The bathroom is at the very end of the hall.

199
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:59,160
What an incompetent fool. You are a child after all.

200
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:02,307
Murdering Polnareff will delight my son's soul,

201
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:07,874
and spilling your blood, Jotaro, will
send lord Dio in Egypt into jubilation.

202
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

203
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:10,807
You have a second?

204
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,270
I got a question.

205
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,608
Huh?

206
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,270
What's the matter?

207
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,706
Did you trip, or are you just that clumsy?

208
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,543
You should be more careful.

209
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:24,488
That was too close.

210
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,253
Yeah. Could have been real bad.

211
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:31,822
It could have gone into your eye or
cut a huge chunk out of your scrawny neck.

212
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:33,847
You're pretty damn lucky.

213
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:39,377
Sorry to ask before you even get
up, but I have a few more questions.

214
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,158
First on the list, how did you know my name is Jotaro?

215
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,065
I never told you my name.

216
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,020
No one has, not since we got here.

217
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:48,481
Huh?

218
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:50,801
I find that strange.

219
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,932
Well? Come on, tell me.

220
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:55,553
You know, it's funny.

221
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,548
Maybe it's because I watched "Columbo" as a kid, but
it's little details like that that keep me up at night.

222
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,791
Oh, you're beginning to hurt this old lady's feelings.

223
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,659
It's the guest book.

224
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:08,184
You wrote your name in the guest book earlier.

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,312
Don't tell me you don't remember.

226
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:15,493
It's so dry. You wrote "Jotaro Kujo," yes.

227
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,568
Oh, then I guess you mean...

228
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,587
This guest book here?

229
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,112
Yes. That's it.

230
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,686
See? Your name is right here.

231
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,190
"Qtaro Kujo"?

232
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,725
"Jotaro" isn't written anywhere in this old thing.

233
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,301
Calling me Joestar when we
first met was your first mistake.

234
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,930
I've suspected you since.

235
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:40,155
I told the others not to use my name,

236
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,706
and yet, you know it, which could only mean...

237
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,079
Cut the crap, you old hag.

238
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,718
I already know you're one of the stand
users that's after us. The jig is up.

239
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,232
What's the matter now?

240
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:03,091
Aren't you going to show me your stand and fight?

241
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,991
You're looking right at it.

242
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:33,537
My stand, Justice, always prevails.

243
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:38,870
All it needs is one small scratch,
and then your life is as good as forfeit.

244
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:42,022
You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro.

245
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:46,043
Polnareff.

246
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:49,182
Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse, remember?

247
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:51,970
Enyaba's stand is made entirely out of fog.

248
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:56,484
It'll split your wound right open and start flowing
through your body. That's how she controls you with it.

249
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,787
It'll even control corpses.

250
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,423
Shut your mouth, Hol Horse!

251
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,658
Ora!

252
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:16,773
Can you punch the fog with your fist or cut the fog
with your sword or shoot it with a gun? I don't think so.

253
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,284
Absolutely futile.

254
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,305
There's nothing you can do but accept your fate.

255
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:26,008
It's the biggest, toughest, fiercest stand there is.

256
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:29,090
Ours are puny by comparison. We're no match for it.

257
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,973
Nothing stands a chance against Justice.

258
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,943
Lovely. Keep it coming, Hol Horse.

259
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,830
Your fearful praise is music to my ears.

260
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,467
Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro.

261
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,521
Quick, run away, Jotaro.

262
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,686
She's gonna turn you into a puppet!

263
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,420
Good grief.

264
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:51,135
I don't need to run.

265
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,918
Before that old hag takes another breath,
I'll defeat that stand and send her packing.

266
00:17:57,186 --> 00:18:04,163
Huh? What was that? I could have sworn you just made some
idiotic proclamation about defeating me, you little brat.

267
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,792
Before I take another breath, is that right?

268
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,263
Well, I'll do that...

269
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:12,775
I'll do that right...

270
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:22,290
What did you do to me?

271
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:23,514
Huh?

272
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,328
Jotaro's Star Platinum is sucking in her entire stand!

273
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:31,935
No, no, please stop.

274
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,112
I can't breathe.

275
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:35,678
And he's holding it in!

276
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,625
He's suffocating that bitch.

277
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,194
Huh. You see that?

278
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,340
Looks like her head is in a bit of a fog.

279
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,980
You ask me, that's Justice at its finest.

280
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,362
I'm so angry.

281
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,856
What do you mean, "what have I been
licking?" You ask such stupid questions.

282
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,143
I honestly don't see why that matters.

283
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:18,551
The toilet.

284
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,611
Eh? You were licking what, again?

285
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,210
I couldn't hear you very well.

286
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,743
Who cares what it was? Now I
need to disinfect my tongue, okay?

287
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,134
Give me the medicine already.

288
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,779
Hmm? I thought I just heard the word "toilet."

289
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,481
What are you giggling about?

290
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:37,962
Actually, I already knew about that, but I
couldn't resist picking on him about this first.

291
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,387
Hold on!

292
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:42,413
Jotaro already told you what happened, didn't he?!

293
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,176
You shitty old man!

294
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,891
You were just messing with me!

295
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,202
Forget the medicine.

296
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:51,492
All right, all right. I'm sorry, come
here, and I'll fix you up, Polnareff.

297
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,914
If you don't take care of that, it'll get infected.

298
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:55,770
Ahem.

299
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,042
Toilet.

300
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,141
Ahem.

301
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,807
You licked it real good.

302
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:04,859
Jotaro, Kakyoin, come on. Let's
just get the hell out of here.

303
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,409
Everyone, come outside.

304
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:06,779
Eh?

305
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:07,195
Huh?

306
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:09,823
Hmm?

307
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:14,827
What on earth?

308
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:19,355
We step outside of the hotel, and this place is a...

309
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:22,073
It's a graveyard.

310
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,910
She was using her stand's fog to make
this graveyard look like a town and a hotel.

311
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,088
So the whole time we were here,

312
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,963
we were talking to some corpses six feet under?

313
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:43,441
You wanna take her with us?

314
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:44,895
Are you serious?!

315
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,442
Sure am.

316
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,812
We need to know how many more stand users are out there,

317
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,218
what their powers are,

318
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,449
and wherever Dio's dug a hole for himself in Egypt,

319
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,090
as well as what his power is.

320
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,240
If we get the hag to tell us,

321
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,918
it might finally give us the edge that we need.

322
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,398
That's worth the risk of dragging her around.

323
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:09,078
I highly doubt she'll be willing
to share that information, though.

324
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,420
We just need to use my Hermit Purple.

325
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,763
I'll project everything she's thinking onto a TV screen.

326
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,330
Great idea!

327
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:19,610
We'll hop over to the next town and use a TV there.

328
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,581
Hmm?

329
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,717
Hol Horse, you slimeball!

330
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,867
That's our car!

331
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,404
Sorry, boys. I'm stickin' with Dio after all.

332
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,410
Catch you all later,

333
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,483
provided you all don't die before then, that is!

334
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,136
A little advice for y'all...

335
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,480
you better put a bullet between
that old lady's eyes real soon,

336
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:43,628
or else you'll find out just how terrifying
Dio really is, and you do not want that.

337
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:44,551
Hmm?

338
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:46,335
See ya!

339
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:51,323
Does anyone know what he's talking about? 'Cause I don't.

340
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,520
All the old paintings on the tomb

341
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:17,688
They do the sand dance, don't you know

342
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,032
If they move too quick

343
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:20,168
Oh, whey, oh.

344
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:22,486
They're falling down like a domino

345
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,854
All the bazaar men by the Nile

346
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,109
They got the money on a bet

347
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,555
Gold crocodiles

348
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,471
Oh, whey, oh.

349
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:31,750
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

350
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:34,025
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

351
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,408
Whey, oh, whey, oh

352
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:39,945
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

353
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,558
Walk like an Egyptian.

354
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,571
The blond waitresses take their trays

355
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,667
They spin around, and they cross the floor

356
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:00,941
They've got the moves

357
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:01,934
Oh, whey, oh

358
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:02,968
You drop your drink

359
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,469
Then they bring you more

360
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:06,739
All the school kids so sick of books

361
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,949
They like the punk and the metal band

362
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,376
When the buzzer rings

363
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:11,427
Oh, whey, oh

364
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:13,687
They're walking like an Egyptian

365
00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:15,814
All the kids in the marketplace say

366
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:18,049
Whey, oh, whey, oh

367
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:22,854
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

368
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,631
Walk like an Egyptian
