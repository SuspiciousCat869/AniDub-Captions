1
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,739
Is anyone else here getting nervous?

2
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:10,032
Try to stay calm.

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,393
Times like these require us to keep
our heads on straight and be prepared.

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:19,883
Oh. Putting this stuff on with only one
hand is a lot harder than I thought it'd be.

5
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:24,189
All right, before we leave, has
anyone here ever scuba dived before?

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,183
Not me.

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:25,802
No.

8
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:26,921
No, I haven't.

9
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,727
You have to teach us how to use this equipment right now.

10
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:32,007
That thing is going to attack us in any second.

11
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:34,130
Try and calm yourself, Avdol.

12
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,995
You must never panic, no matter what.

13
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:39,927
That is the most important rule when scuba diving.

14
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,680
When you're traveling underwater, for
every ten meters you go below the surface,

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,491
the corresponding pressure increases along with you.

16
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:52,353
The surface pressure starts at one atmosphere,
and since we're 40 meters below the surface,

17
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,537
we'll endure five atmospheres of pressure.

18
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:56,485
If we surface too quickly,

19
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:59,272
the pressure'll cause our
lungs and blood vessels to burst.

20
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:02,633
We have to rise slowly so our bodies can adjust.

21
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:06,733
Since we're nearing the Egyptian coast,
it's best to ascend along the seafloor.

22
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,656
Okay, I'm letting the water in.

23
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:17,797
Now pay very close attention.

24
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,558
What you're looking at is a regulator.

25
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,313
The valve inside only allows air
in from the tank when you inhale.

26
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:26,752
The air you breathe out exits
through the piece on the left.

27
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,852
Wait a second. What about spit?

28
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:33,070
What happens if I need to drool or
have to hock a loogie or something?

29
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:35,772
Stuff like that just comes out of the opening here.

30
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,331
By the way, this should go without
saying, but we can't talk underwater.

31
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,396
Instead, we'll use hand signals.

32
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:43,692
Let's keep things simple and only use two.

33
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:47,273
When things are going smoothly,
we'll use this to say, "okay."

34
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,666
But when they aren't, use this.

35
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:54,370
Mr. Joestar, couldn't we just use
our stands to communicate underwater?

36
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,063
Huh? Oh, yeah. I didn't think about that.

37
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,338
Aww, man. And I was just about to say
that I know a really good hand signal.

38
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:07,066
He says, "your underwear is showing."

39
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,575
Yeah, nice.

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,132
We could be attacked and killed at any time!

41
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,339
Stop fooling around, and let's go!

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,193
This room is about to be filled to the brim with water.

43
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,355
Put on your masks and regulators
while you still have time.

44
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,701
P-Polnareff!

45
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,099
But when did it...

46
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:32,467
That's it.

47
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:35,191
The stand had already integrated with the regulator.

48
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,059
That bastard.

49
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,705
It's gonna rip him apart from the inside.

50
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,232
We've gotta drain the room while we still can.

51
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,425
It's too late.

52
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,213
It must have been lying in wait for just this moment.

53
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:49,525
Ora!

54
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:50,876
Damn it.

55
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,809
It's already burrowing down his throat.

56
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:56,071
We can't just stand here and watch him like this.

57
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,146
What should we do?

58
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,292
Hierophant Green!

59
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,840
Hermit Purple!

60
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,654
What are you doin...

61
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,697
I was able to grab it before it could damage his organts.

62
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,404
Me, too.

63
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,691
Let's pull it out before it transforms.

64
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:18,245
Success.

65
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:20,334
All right, keep it just like that.

66
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,932
Look! It's transforming into something else.

67
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:29,382
You gotta be kidding me. It turned into a spear gun.

68
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:33,037
Emerald splash!

69
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,690
Silver Chariot!

70
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,534
Let's get moving.

71
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:46,838
It's already reloading.

72
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,054
It doesn't quit.

73
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,252
H-Hurry.

74
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,454
Move it, old man.

75
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah, I'm coming.

76
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,637
That was too close for comfort.

77
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,037
It's too soon for us to relax,

78
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,335
especially since that bastard knows
exactly how to hit us where it hurts most.

79
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,576
Polnareff, are you all right?

80
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,537
Yeah, I'll be fine.

81
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,613
You guys saved my life back there.

82
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,883
Merci beaucoup.

83
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,260
Wow, just look at how beautiful it is down here.

84
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,597
This would've been a spectacular
place to visit on vacation.

85
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,908
This isn't time to plan your next getaway.

86
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:50,521
We have to surface before we run out of oxygen.

87
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,057
Think we're safe?

88
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,067
I believe so.

89
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,704
The High Priestess can transform into metals and glass,

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,683
but it can't take the form of bubbles
or fish, so I doubt it'll come after us.

91
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,329
Just keep your eyes peeled.

92
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:07,127
If it pursues us, it'll probably
transform into a screw on our gear to do it.

93
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,987
Be careful of moving pebbles and stones, too.

94
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:14,811
Hmm?

95
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:15,993
Look up there!

96
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,281
I think it's a sea tunnel.

97
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:21,866
We're at seven meters.

98
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:24,335
We've finally reached the Egyptian shore.

99
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,608
We can swim along these rocks to get to the surface.

100
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,176
What?

101
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,591
Is that the...

102
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,684
Yes, it's definitely the stand.

103
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,758
It merged with the seafloor, and it's gargantuan!

104
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:01,547
Damn! There's no way we can fight this pull.

105
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,365
This is impossible!

106
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,070
How is it so gigantic?

107
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,461
What the hell?!

108
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,130
It was so small earlier.

109
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,925
What's this stand's power?

110
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,345
Merde, I'm so confused!

111
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:32,231
You boys are so slow on the uptake.

112
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:36,108
Didn't it ever cross your minds
that if the rocks are mineral,

113
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,390
it would mean the seabed is mostly mineral as well?

114
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,518
Yes, of course.

115
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,203
That's why the stand has suddenly gotten stronger.

116
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:47,386
It's user must be nearby, and I'd
wager she's closer than we think.

117
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,131
You guessed it, and to be more precise,

118
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:53,039
I'm seven meters above you on the shore.

119
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:56,890
But since you're about to be
ground to bits by my High Priestess,

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,878
you'll never have the chance to see my face.

121
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,321
So long.

122
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,211
It's so dark in here.

123
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,618
I can't tell what part of the stand we're in.

124
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,696
Seems like we're still inside its mouth,

125
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,273
but luckily we weren't sucked down its gullet.

126
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,824
Yoo-hoo, Jotaro.

127
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,861
Believe it or not, you're actually my type,

128
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:33,403
so this is going to be as painful for me as for you,

129
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:38,400
but despite my feelings, I still have
to make the High Priestess digest you.

130
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:38,846
Huh?

131
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,482
How sad.

132
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,422
If only our encounter had been
under different circumstances.

133
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,728
But if I kill you,

134
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,713
lord Dio will no doubt shower me with praise,

135
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,572
so don't hate me.

136
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,939
Good grief. Do I have to?

137
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,401
Would you just say it?

138
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,285
Come on. Hurry up, and get on with it.

139
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:58,382
Say what?

140
00:09:59,168 --> 00:09:59,790
Huh?

141
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:01,710
Ah, I see.

142
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,792
It's a shame things turned out this way.

143
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,095
I would have liked to have
seen your face, if only this once.

144
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,114
You might have been my type, too,

145
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,901
and if you were, well, I just might have fallen for you.

146
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh, hey, you know what, guys?

147
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:20,874
I bet she's a beauty.

148
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,184
I can tell from that gorgeous voice of hers.

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,385
She comes across as an elegant woman.
My fortuneteller's instinct senses it.

150
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,746
Well, if you ask me, she sounds just like Audrey Hepburn.

151
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,718
Man, if I were only 30 years younger.

152
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:43,818
You bastards didn't mean a single word of that!

153
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:45,596
I'll kill you all!

154
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,218
Holy shit!

155
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,411
Everyone, look!

156
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,787
What is that?

157
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,885
It looks like a tongue, the stand's tongue to be exact.

158
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,069
Here it comes!

159
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,849
Jotaro!

160
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:00,914
Jotaro!

161
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:08,422
No! Jotaro's going to land in...

162
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,974
He... he landed right on the molars.

163
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,015
Jotaro, get out of there now!

164
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,541
You're about to be crushed!

165
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:16,795
Ora!

166
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:17,718
Ooh!

167
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:21,569
You want to pit your strength against mine, do you?

168
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:24,852
Damn, what ridiculous power.

169
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,497
Oh, give up, Jotaro.

170
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,562
Those teeth are as hard as diamonds.

171
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,865
You'll never be able to break them.

172
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,029
It's time for you to meet your end.

173
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,206
We have to save Jotaro!

174
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,046
Stay out of my way!

175
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:40,861
That damn tongue again!

176
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,653
Magician's Red!

177
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,543
We're out of time!

178
00:11:57,991 --> 00:11:58,948
We have to free him!

179
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,302
Jotaro!

180
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,535
J-Jotaro.

181
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,108
No. Those giant teeth pulverized him.

182
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,531
Jo..Jotaro.

183
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,044
We didn't make it in time.

184
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,512
Hmm? Hold on a sec.

185
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,181
I think I can hear something.

186
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:43,969
It's definitely coming from rather far away.

187
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:46,026
Listen again. I think it's getting closer.

188
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:48,759
Wait. That voice belongs to...

189
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:54,962
The teeth. It's coming from inside the teeth!

190
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:55,439
Huh?

191
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:58,765
Everyone, get down, and brace yourselves.

192
00:12:58,781 --> 00:12:59,157
Huh?

193
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:09,566
Those teeth were hard as diamonds,
but he managed to punch his way out.

194
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,108
Oh, my god!

195
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:14,460
And would you look at that? He's
breaking the other teeth while he's at it.

196
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,271
That showoff.

197
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,250
His stand's immense power never ceases to amaze me.

198
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:23,175
Come on. I'm getting us out of this hellhole.

199
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,092
Ora!

200
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,640
Ah, good grief.

201
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:40,001
Well, you were right about those teeth
being sturdy, but they weren't sturdy enough.

202
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,973
Too bad. I guess your so-called
diamonds were a little low on calcium.

203
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,565
You couldn't pay me to do that again.

204
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:04,573
Hmm?

205
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,648
Hey, there's a woman passed out over there.

206
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,737
I assume it's Rose, the user of the High Priestess.

207
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:14,502
She doesn't seem dangerous. Should we just leave her?

208
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,950
I think I'll go see if she's hot or not.

209
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,800
From the looks of it, she's got a pretty nice body.

210
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:22,463
Let's see.

211
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,514
How's it going over there, Polnareff?

212
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:29,677
Nothing to see here, folks! No comment whatsoever!

213
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:34,055
Trust me, you don't wanna see her. Her teeth
are all ugh, so there's no point in looking.

214
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:34,682
I see.

215
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:45,178
It hasn't been easy, but we finally made it to Egypt.

216
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:51,692
Indeed. A trip that would have taken a mere 20
hours by plane ended up taking a whopping 30 days.

217
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:53,751
It's been quite the adventure.

218
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:57,007
We've gone inside a brain and even inside our dreams.

219
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,917
Our dreams?

220
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,505
What do you mean, Kakyoin?

221
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:03,040
Why are you talking about dreams?
It's morning. Wake up already.

222
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,502
Oh, right. You guys don't remember that.

223
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,049
Huh?

224
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:10,092
Whatever. Let's go.

225
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:21,692
Four mysterious and otherworldly stands powered
by the mystical and symbolized by the tarot.

226
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:31,305
Joseph Joestar once described their
journey as "around the world in 80 days."

227
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,293
From Tokyo to Hong Kong, they faced Tower of Gray.

228
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,998
In Southeast Asia, they tackled
Dark Blue Moon and Strength.

229
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:44,137
In Singapore, they encountered
Ebony Devil and Yellow Temperance.

230
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,718
In Calcutta, India, it was Hanged Man and Emperor.

231
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,914
In Varanasi, India, the Empress,

232
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:54,283
and near the Pakistani border,
they fought Wheel of Fortune.

233
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,341
In the mountains of Pakistan, they battled Justice.

234
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,942
In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.

235
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,707
In the desert of the United Arab Emirates, the Sun,

236
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,376
and in Saudi Arabia, Death 13.

237
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,920
On a small island in the red sea, Judgment.

238
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:15,321
And now, on the Red Sea floor,
they've just defeated High Priestess.

239
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:20,271
With several of Dio's assassins vanquished,
they have finally arrived in Egypt.

240
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,838
Only a few of the tarot cards still remain.

241
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:30,749
But little do JoJo and company know new threats
lie ahead in Egypt ready to take our heroes on.

242
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,206
That's...

243
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,208
One, two, three...

244
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:46,057
Nine.

245
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,308
There are nine in all, both genders.

246
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:50,586
Eh?

247
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,464
What the...

248
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,371
What the hell was that?

249
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:22,918
Have the meddlesome flies swarming around been swatted?

250
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:25,500
That Speedwagon foundation,

251
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:29,948
for pity's sake, I can't let my guard down for a minute.

252
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:44,669
I must say I've gotten quite used to this body.

253
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:47,567
Tell me, Jonathan, can you feel it?

254
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,722
Your descendants are inching ever closer.

255
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,422
It can be so cruel and unforgiving,

256
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:58,151
this wretched little world of ours.

257
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,065
So that's what's been going on.

258
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:10,156
Why didn't you just tell me Jotaro
was helping you with your work?

259
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,966
That's fantastic.

260
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,804
The boy still has a long way to go, compared to me.

261
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,451
So this work is important enough for you to ask for help?

262
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:20,781
That's right.

263
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:25,473
It's my most important mission yet,
and it's imperative that we don't mess up.

264
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,296
But as long as we work together, we
should get it done without too much trouble.

265
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,774
Hmm.

266
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,998
Say, Joseph, could I speak to Jotaro?

267
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:38,345
Eh? Sure, but what do you want to talk to him about?

268
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:42,752
Nothing much. Is it wrong that I want
to hear my darling grandson's voice?

269
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,476
Well, no.

270
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,922
Jotaro, it's for you.

271
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:47,380
Hmm?

272
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,753
Hey, it's me.

273
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:52,708
Grandpa told me everything, Jotaro.

274
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:56,242
Work hard, and take care of your grandfather for me.

275
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:56,839
Will do.

276
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:03,989
I know in my heart if you work together, you Joestar men
can overcome just about any hardship that comes your way.

277
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:04,689
Eh?

278
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,842
I truly believe that.

279
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,162
Grandma Suzie, you...

280
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:14,522
What's the matter? You sound so serious all of a sudden.

281
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,247
It's nothing.

282
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:20,767
All right, I'm hanging up. I
look forward to good news. Ciao.

283
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,563
Madam.

284
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:24,263
Hmm?

285
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,237
It's hard for me to believe it,

286
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,433
but at this point, it's already been 30
years that I've worked for the Joestar family,

287
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:35,523
but I can honestly say that we've
never faced something of this magnitude.

288
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,813
Oh, come now. You're overreacting.

289
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,394
Didn't he say it was just a little business trip?

290
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,856
Ah. Well, I suppose so.

291
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:47,528
It's so troublesome when men act
selfish and refuse to tell us anything.

292
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,772
But I've grown accustomed to it.

293
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:58,245
The Joestar family has been
like this for an entire century.

294
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:04,530
I'm sure if she were here, she'd say
the same thing and laugh it all off.

295
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:14,810
Hmm?

296
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,616
What's the matter, Jotaro?

297
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:17,314
Hmm?

298
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:19,959
It's nothing. I'm fine.

299
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,587
Hmm?

300
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,582
All right, it's time to head out.

301
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:28,518
After a century, it's time for us Joestars
to bring an end to Dio's grip on our family.

302
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,639
We don't have to do it alone.

303
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,604
Hey, Mr. Joestar!

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,329
We got the car that you asked us to buy!

305
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,949
Let's hurry, and hit the road.

306
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:43,604
We should probably get to where
we're going before it gets too dark!

307
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,082
Well, old man?

308
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,323
Okay, you're right. Guess we're pretty lucky, huh?

309
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,199
Yeah, yeah, hold your horses! We're coming!

310
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:57,156
This is the land of Egypt, a nation that's 97% desert.

311
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,330
However, thanks to the blessings of the Nile,

312
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:04,343
beautiful, fertile green spreads
across the entirety of its riverbanks.

313
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,752
In addition to the culture of the ancient Egyptians,

314
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:16,193
Egypt is also home to Persian, Greek, Roman, Muslim, and
Arabian cultures, and all have left their indelible marks.

315
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:22,047
What bizarre adventures and challenges
await Jotaro and the others in this eternal land

316
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,612
as they continue their perilous journey?

317
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,096
All the old paintings on the tomb

318
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:57,264
They do the sand dance, don't you know

319
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,608
If they move too quick

320
00:21:58,633 --> 00:21:59,744
Oh, whey, oh

321
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:02,062
They're falling down like a domino

322
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,430
All the bazaar men by the Nile

323
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,685
They got the money on a bet

324
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,131
Gold crocodiles

325
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:09,047
Oh, whey, oh

326
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:11,326
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

327
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,601
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

328
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,984
Whey, oh, whey, oh

329
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,521
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

330
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,134
Walk like an Egyptian.

331
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,147
The blond waitresses take their trays

332
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:39,243
They spin around, and they cross the floor

333
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:40,517
They've got the moves

334
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,510
Oh, whey, oh

335
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:42,544
You drop your drink

336
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,045
Then they bring you more

337
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,315
All the school kids so sick of books

338
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,525
They like the punk and the metal band

339
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,952
When the buzzer rings

340
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,003
Oh, whey, oh

341
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,263
They're walking like an Egyptian

342
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,390
All the kids in the marketplace say

343
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:57,625
Whey, oh, whey, oh

344
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,430
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

345
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,207
Walk like an Egyptian
