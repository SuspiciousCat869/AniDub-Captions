1
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,669
Hey, you! Turn around! Yeah, you with the flattop.

2
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:12,133
Huh?

3
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:16,904
Yeah, you. You threw this trash, right?
Then it's a 500 Singapore dollar fine!

4
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,422
No way. 500?

5
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:23,732
The law here prohibits littering and fines
all violators for doing so, and that means you.

6
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:26,174
500 Singapore dollars is...

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,815
I think that's gotta be about 40,000 yen.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,767
Trash?

9
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,490
Are you clear on that, punk?

10
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,449
Trash?

11
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:37,704
What are you talking about, sir?

12
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:48,519
All I see on the ground here is my own
luggage, so you've got me a little confused now.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,622
Would you be so kind as to tell me
what trash you're referring to, officer?

14
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:56,613
If you're wrong, then I'm obeying
the law, right? So where is it?

15
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,767
You mean that bag is your luggage?

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,205
Yeah, you got it.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,895
Oh. I'm terribly sorry.

18
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:05,633
Huh?

19
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:09,846
Well, i-i've got to get going, then

20
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,693
shoo, shoo.

21
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:14,658
What's up with this kid? She's
still following us like a lost puppy.

22
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:17,987
Hey, you, weren't you going to
see your father once we got here?

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,581
Why don't you stop tagging along
and go? You're here now, so move on.

24
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,626
I'm meeting up with him in five days.

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,785
I can go wherever the hell I want.

26
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,158
I'm not taking orders from you jerks.

27
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:36,105
She mustn't. She'll be in danger if she stays with us.

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,182
Well, maybe she lacks the cash for a place to stay.

29
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:40,475
Then that's it.

30
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,380
We'll have to get her a hotel room for a few nights.

31
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:44,443
Hey, Polnareff.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,649
Get her to come with us,
and try not to bruise her ego.

33
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:48,800
You got it.

34
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,222
Hey.

35
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:50,877
Huh?

36
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:52,923
You're stinkin' poor, aren't you?

37
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:55,353
Consider this your lucky day, freeloader.

38
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:57,876
Wha?

39
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,686
Oh, for god's sake, Polnareff.

40
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:03,065
Well, let's go check in.

41
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,791
Okay.

42
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,067
I'm terribly sorry, sir,

43
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,268
but we tend to be full at this time of year.

44
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:15,894
We no longer have any large suites
available. May I suggest our double rooms?

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,804
I guess we're stuck.

46
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,048
Now, for the rooms, uh...

47
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,560
Avdol and I will share a room with each other.

48
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:28,398
It'd make sense for Jotaro and I to share a room,
since we're both students. Does that help, Joseph?

49
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,695
Then the last room goes to Polnareff and...

50
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:39,445
That's just gross! Like I'd room with that guy!

51
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,430
You brat.

52
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:41,953
Blehh!

53
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:46,541
Well, she may be a child, but let's
give the young lady her own room.

54
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,625
Excuse me. We'll take four rooms, please.

55
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,754
Yes, of course.

56
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:56,600
Fine. I can relax more in my own room, anyway.

57
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,054
I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight.

58
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,218
Let's go. We've been through all kinds
of hell ever since the day we left Hong Kong.

59
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:10,933
We should hurry up and take a shower
in a place where it's actually safe.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,006
See ya.

61
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,167
Damn it. I should have guessed.

62
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:49,604
Couldn't you guys at least give us
a chance to rest? Persistent bastards.

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,003
Come out.

64
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:42,228
That's some insanely intense blood lust you've got there.

65
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,636
Do me a favor, and tell me who you are.

66
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:47,973
My name's Polnareff, so you'll know who sent you to hell.

67
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,456
Well, if you insist, my name is Soul Sacrifice.

68
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,146
And since you're probably wondering,
my stand is the card of the devil.

69
00:05:55,532 --> 00:06:02,445
It represents insanity of the cursed and a
precipitous and malevolent fall into ruin.

70
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,827
But tell me, how did you know
I was hiding inside the fridge?

71
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,746
So you really are that stupid?

72
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,167
You took everything out of the fridge and
didn't bother putting any of it away, you dumb-ass.

73
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,340
Die, Polnareff! Ebony Devil!

74
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,434
Silver Chariot!

75
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,518
Wow, you're really pathetic, aren't you?

76
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:38,064
That ape on the boat was a far
more terrifying stand user than you.

77
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:40,900
You realize that you're worse at this than a monkey?

78
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:47,040
Now look what you've done, Polnareff.

79
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,453
Damn, how dare you do this to me?

80
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:55,809
It hurts!

81
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:59,553
It really, really hurts!

82
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,047
What the hell is with this guy?

83
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:06,843
The pain.

84
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,553
Curse you.

85
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:15,477
How dare you? How dare you do that to me?

86
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:19,195
Now I can hold one hell of a grudge against you.

87
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,248
Such torture, such agony must be avenged,

88
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,323
and you're the pathetic one, Polnareff.

89
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:33,857
I let you find me and attack me
on purpose. You're a dead man now!

90
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,629
H-He disappeared.

91
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,802
He's gone. What the hell is going on?

92
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:58,144
Wait. What? This is unreal. When did he cut me?

93
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,897
But I don't think I felt an attack.

94
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,910
No, I'm sure of it. I didn't feel it.

95
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:12,617
Mr. Joestar. A stand user was here, ready to ambush me.

96
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,738
Wait. Is that you, Avdol?

97
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,455
Anyway, listen. I couldn't figure him out.

98
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:19,736
I couldn't tell if he was weak or strong.

99
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,802
He's really creepy, and he got away.

100
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,129
Damn it. What the hell?

101
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,924
You'd better watch out.
Somehow, he was able to cut my leg.

102
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:33,657
The devil card? That's Soul Sacrifice. Polnareff,
are you absolutely positive that's what he said?

103
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,784
Yeah. I'm racking my brain, I
just don't see how it's possible.

104
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,894
I know for a fact that I caught a glimpse of his stand.

105
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,190
The thing is, I don't remember anything
being near me, but my leg's been gouged.

106
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:47,318
But, anyway, I should be there in five minutes.

107
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,155
You're in room 1212, aren't you? On the 12th floor?

108
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,593
Contact Kakyoin and Jotaro, too, will you? Later.

109
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:00,582
Front desk.

110
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,168
Hello there. Is this room service?

111
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:05,045
I hurt my leg a bit,

112
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,798
could you send up some medicine
and bandages as soon as possible?

113
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,384
This is Polnareff, room 912.

114
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:14,095
Certainly. We'll bring it up immediately, sir.

115
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,356
Ah, this is the last thing I need.

116
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,528
No matter how you cut it, dirty underwear
makes for a really shitty band-aid.

117
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:31,946
Damn this hotel.

118
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,568
Avdol, I was wondering,

119
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,258
do you know about this guy who attacked Polnareff?

120
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,457
Yes.

121
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,331
He is Soul Sacrifice.

122
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,252
According to rumors, he's a
native-American shaman who is also an assassin,

123
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:49,380
but he's an utterly terrifying stand user.

124
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:54,155
Mafias, militaries, politicians,
lowlifes the world over hire him.

125
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:57,764
I've seen him before, and he
looks as fierce as his reputation.

126
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:03,353
His body is covered in scars, scars he receives
by cunningly provoking his enemy to attack.

127
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:04,979
That's how he gets the upper hand.

128
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:09,776
He uses the so-called power of
vengeance to fully control his stand.

129
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:13,931
That's why, to ordinary people, it
appears that a curse killed the victims.

130
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,546
So Polnareff must have fallen for soul sacrifice's trick?

131
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,645
I'm afraid that's what it looks like.

132
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,413
What kind of stand is it?

133
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,310
Nobody knows for certain,

134
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,869
because those who've seen it are dead.
We have to decide how we're handling this.

135
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,632
Right now, it's too dangerous for Polnareff to be alone

136
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,926
or any of us.

137
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:39,319
He could try to kill us one by one. I
mean, it's something he might be able to do.

138
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,182
We need to figure out a strategy.

139
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,060
He'll be here in five minutes.

140
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,979
Let's all meet up in this room.

141
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:51,193
You got it. We'll see you in room 1212 soon, old man.

142
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,529
What was that all about, JoJo?

143
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:57,365
Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.

144
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:01,953
What? Now that's odd. I can't find my room key.

145
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:07,125
I could have sworn I put it
down right here. Am I going crazy?

146
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,226
Damn it. Where is it?

147
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:11,754
Now, how the hell am I gonna get back in here?

148
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,311
Could I tell the front desk and ask for a new one?

149
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,672
There's probably a fine for that.

150
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:23,224
There it is. It must have fallen during all the commotion
earlier. Why did it have to go all the way to the middle?

151
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,479
Hmm? Wha?

152
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:35,862
What the...

153
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:39,199
Hey!

154
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:46,567
What the hell?! Shampoo?! Damn
it! This is killing my eyes!

155
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:53,463
Who's there?!

156
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,179
Crap, this isn't good.

157
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,885
I'm a sitting duck under here.

158
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:07,602
Eh?

159
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,649
Mr. Polnareff, the front desk sent me up here.

160
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,359
I've brought you a first-aid kit.

161
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,861
Get away! You'll get yourself killed!

162
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,781
Sir, what's happened here?

163
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:23,076
Get out of here! I told you, you'll get yourself killed!

164
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:07,759
How dare you?! Polnareff, how dare you stab one
of my eyes out when I hadn't even touched you once?

165
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:14,085
Wait. He's a doll? What kind
of stand is that? Silver Chariot!

166
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:19,459
You're as stupid as you look. Don't you get
it? Your stand can't fight where you can't see.

167
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:22,972
As long as you're tied up
underneath the bed, you can't hurt me.

168
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,130
Eh? Huh?

169
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,158
Oh, JoJo.

170
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:50,708
Did you need something?

171
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:52,495
So you are here.

172
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:53,601
Listen up.

173
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,476
Don't leave this room for a while.

174
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:56,112
Huh?

175
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:57,866
I'll come for you again later.

176
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,471
Keep your door locked, okay?

177
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,875
And don't open it for any strangers.

178
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,426
Oh, okay.

179
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:12,698
Damn it. How heavy is this bed, anyway?

180
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,924
It's gotta be at least 120 kilograms.

181
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,862
There's no way I can push it off of me.

182
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,586
I've gotta use Silver Chariot's sword to cut these cords.

183
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,942
You little bastard.

184
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,833
As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.

185
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,806
You better believe I'm gonna keep blindly
stabbing every centimeter of this room!

186
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:34,674
Missed me again.

187
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:53,598
Looks like the big, scary knight can't even
pin the tail on the donkey when he's blindfolded.

188
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:56,239
Talk about dense. You're mine now!

189
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,836
Bastard!

190
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:12,549
I've just about had it with you, you little runt!

191
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:14,298
Huh?

192
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,559
It's just you two guys?

193
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,369
Why isn't the girl with you?

194
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,977
Well, we went to her room and made sure she was okay.

195
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,862
We decided against it, because she would be vulnerable.

196
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,651
The risk of her falling under
attack while with us is far too great.

197
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:32,789
Good point.

198
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,710
So we're just waiting for Polnareff to arrive,

199
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:37,649
but, man, he's so late.

200
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:40,173
It's already been way over five minutes.

201
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:45,756
Let me out of here!

202
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,645
Got ya. Time to snap your spear in half.

203
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,513
Damn it.

204
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:10,046
All right. At least I'm finally free of those cords.

205
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:13,846
Now I've got to send Chariot under the
bed and get myself the hell out of here.

206
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,660
Great. Now what's he doing?

207
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:26,571
Hmm?

208
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,264
Huh?

209
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:44,008
Hmm?

210
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,518
Hey, Polnareff,

211
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:59,341
how would you like it if I took a bite out of your balls?

212
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,626
I can't believe that a doll could
be such an obscene little jerk.

213
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,708
En garde!

214
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:07,750
Whoa, there.

215
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:10,513
I'm gonna run off to a place you can't see now.

216
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,389
You numskull.

217
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,897
Give the floor you're stuck to a good feel.

218
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,153
Go ahead, moron.

219
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,546
What? This is...

220
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,392
The carpet's soaked with beer, juice, and alcohol.

221
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,487
You have a well-stocked bar that I put to good use.

222
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,301
If I had piss in me, I would have
soaked you in it to make it even wetter.

223
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:37,982
Oh, look, a hair dryer, and it's lit up
like a fireworks show at a summer festival.

224
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:40,097
There's so many uses for it.

225
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,559
Which one do you think I'm gonna pick, Polnareff?

226
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,494
Now you can style that ridiculous hair of yours.

227
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,125
Die.

228
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,057
Time to put an end to this curse.

229
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,258
Meet your maker, Polnareff.

230
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:01,238
Hmph.

231
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:05,481
You're not the only one who can break
stuff, you satanic little pincushion!

232
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,696
What? How did you know precisely
where I was on top of the bed?

233
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,126
I trapped you underneath it!

234
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,813
Simple. I broke all the mirrors

235
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:20,093
so I could see you hanging over
the bed clear as day from down here.

236
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,133
Sucks to be you!

237
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,900
At last, we meet.

238
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,442
Whoa, there.

239
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,225
Now, then...

240
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:38,919
I have a question.

241
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,098
I seek a man with two right hands.

242
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,853
He has something to answer for.

243
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,045
Save me some trouble, and tell me what his stand is.

244
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:50,516
You idiot. No assassin worth a damn
would ever reveal his stand's identity.

245
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,995
It only happens in the face of
certain death for him or his opponents.

246
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,930
You guys are so stupid, always showing
off your stands everywhere you go.

247
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,828
It's your own fault that we know all your weaknesses.

248
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,331
If it weren't for that mirror, I would have killed you.

249
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,190
You're just a moron who got lucky.

250
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,558
All right, then. Come at me.

251
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:08,433
Eh?

252
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,922
What's the matter?

253
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:13,716
Didn't you say you were going to bite
off my balls or something, tough guy?

254
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,123
Go ahead, and try it.

255
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,306
I dare you, you vulgar little shit!

256
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:20,150
I am gonna...

257
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,895
Slice up everything except your balls!

258
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:37,914
Excuse me, sir. It seems you've been
in the bathroom for quite some time.

259
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:41,705
Are you feeling all right?

260
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:49,896
Ah, Polnareff, you're finally here.

261
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,017
Yeah.

262
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,950
You're not terribly punctual, and you look like hell.

263
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,825
Okay, let's get right to it.

264
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:59,647
Let's figure out what our strategy
will be if Soul Sacrifice attacks.

265
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,166
Polnareff, pay attention.

266
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:03,466
You're joking, right?

267
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,403
Answer me, punk!

268
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,072
Why was there a dead boy's body in your room?

269
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,853
And what about the dead body that was in the bathroom?

270
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,426
The two are connected, aren't they?

271
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,345
Answer me now!

272
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,848
I have the right to remain silent, officer.

273
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,192
Huh? You've finally showed up.

274
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:33,519
I've been waiting a while.

275
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:37,556
I had the Speedwagon foundation strike a deal.

276
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:41,337
Polnareff should be released
soon enough without too much hassle.

277
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,174
But that was cutting it close, even for us.

278
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:47,461
To think that the enemy's pursuit would come so early on.

279
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,324
Don't forget that Dio's body
used to belong to Jonathan Joestar.

280
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:54,630
While they're united, he'll
know everything Jotaro and I do.

281
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:57,242
That's why his minions' attacks are relentless.

282
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:01,215
But we can use that against him and
read his thoughts just as he reads ours.

283
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:01,645
Hmm.

284
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,614
Shall I go buy a camera?

285
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:05,610
That won't be necessary.

286
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,477
I can use my powers even without a camera.

287
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:09,383
What?

288
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:20,236
Michael is still not here. Where the hell is he?

289
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:24,798
This week's number three jumps
up five points from last w...

290
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,793
In trading, the price of gold today ro...

291
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:30,089
You look delicious. Meow.

292
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,360
Oh, no!

293
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:42,014
Very strange. The channels are changing,
as if the TV has a mind of its own.

294
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:45,914
It's searching for words from among the
channels and connecting them into a sentence,

295
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,298
creating a message for the ear, not the eye.

296
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:49,856
It looks like there...

297
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:50,779
Is a...

298
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,026
There is a...

299
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,011
There.

300
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,680
I think the first part is "there is a..."

301
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:56,914
...trai...

302
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:57,849
...tor...

303
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:59,001
...who's among...

304
00:21:59,013 --> 00:21:59,891
...us all...

305
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,107
Wait. What was that?

306
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,872
What the hell did it just say?

307
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:07,889
I could be wrong, but I think it said that
there is a traitor who is walking among us.

308
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:08,353
...Ka...

309
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:09,146
...Kyo...

310
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:09,780
...in...

311
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,194
Beware...

312
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:11,744
Of...

313
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,323
...him.

314
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:13,755
Di...

315
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:14,067
O's...

316
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,971
Loy...

317
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,321
...al...

318
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:16,575
...Servant!

319
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:17,999
Kakyoin?

320
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,776
What?

321
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:19,873
It can't be.

322
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:23,016
That's impossible. Kakyoin is Dio's servant?

323
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:29,499
This is...

324
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:34,208
Joestar, you bastard, you're watching me.

325
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,624
Well, watch this.

326
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:38,078
Dio!

327
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,059
He found us! Look out!

328
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,439
But that can't be true, can it?

329
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:50,282
You know as well as I do.

330
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:53,300
Hermit Purple says Kakyoin is a traitor,

331
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:56,835
a servant to Dio, who will at some point betray all of us.

332
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,911
It can't be!

333
00:22:57,954 --> 00:23:00,867
There must be a reason. I won't
believe Kakyoin is a traitor.

334
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,600
There has to be an explanation.

335
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:04,747
We'll have to be even more alert.

336
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:07,098
If he is still connected with Dio,

337
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,678
he could exterminate any one of us while we're sleeping.

338
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:13,848
He'd be just like Dio's very own trojan horse.

339
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,327
So then, where is Kakyoin?

340
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,941
He's with Jotaro.

341
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,618
All the old paintings on the tomb

342
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,786
they do the sand dance, don't you know

343
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,130
if they move too quick

344
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,266
oh, whey, oh

345
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,584
they're falling down like a domino

346
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:52,952
all the bazaar men by the Nile

347
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,207
they got the money on a bet

348
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:56,653
gold crocodiles

349
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:57,569
oh, whey, oh

350
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,848
they snap their teeth on your cigarette

351
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,123
foreign types with the hookah pipes say

352
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:04,506
whey, oh, whey, oh

353
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:08,043
ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

354
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,656
walk like an Egyptian.

355
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,669
The blond waitresses take their trays

356
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,765
they spin around, and they cross the floor

357
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,039
they've got the moves

358
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:30,032
oh, whey, oh

359
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:31,066
you drop your drink

360
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,567
then they bring you more

361
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,837
all the school kids so sick of books

362
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,047
they like the punk and the metal band

363
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:38,474
when the buzzer rings

364
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,525
oh, whey, oh

365
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,785
they're walking like an Egyptian

366
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,912
all the kids in the marketplace say

367
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:46,147
whey, oh, whey, oh

368
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:50,952
ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

369
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:53,729
walk like an Egyptian
