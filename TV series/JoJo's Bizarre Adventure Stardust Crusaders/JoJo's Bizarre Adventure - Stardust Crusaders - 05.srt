1
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:04,372
You know your way around a sword.

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:06,437
I'll grant you that much, but

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,583
it will take much more than mere ego if you think
I'll be defeated by the time the flames reach 12:00.

4
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:15,118
Your pride may well be your undoing, Mr...

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,627
Uh, who...

6
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,034
Pardonnez-moi.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,672
We haven't been introduced yet.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,080
My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

9
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:26,245
Well met, Polnareff.

10
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,682
It's good to know the name of one's opponent.

11
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:29,357
However...

12
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,294
Back to the task at hand.

13
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:42,690
If you're under the assumption that my flames only
burn upward or with the wind as they would in nature,

14
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:44,453
let me assure you they do not.

15
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:49,115
My stand is named Magician's Red,
because it wields fire as though by magic.

16
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:53,930
Fire is what began life itself in this world.

17
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:59,840
I should have expected as much from a fiery stand
such as Magician's Red, who represents beginnings.

18
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:03,692
However, you dare to speak of pride and ego?

19
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:08,917
I assure you that my pride is well deserved!

20
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:18,991
In the fraction of a second that the coins lined up,

21
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,874
he skewered all five of them in a single shot.

22
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:22,352
No.

23
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:22,907
Eh?

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,863
Why don't you take a look at 'em again.

25
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:27,366
It can't be.

26
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,511
There, stuck on the blade of his sword.

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,410
He's cut a bit of flame for every coin that he hit.

28
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:36,764
Now you see that I'm every bit as deadly as I had said.

29
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,353
This is not mere ego.

30
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:43,567
My stand has the unrestricted power to cut
fire to ribbons, as though it were nothing.

31
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:48,191
Hmph. It can slice through air,
creating a vacuum and guiding the fire.

32
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:50,202
Your flames are useless.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,126
Face it. Your Magician's Red may be fearsome,

34
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:56,500
but it's powerless against the likes of my Silver Chariot.

35
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:01,260
Hmm?

36
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,105
How the devil...

37
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:06,426
Victory and conquest,

38
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,397
that represents the card the
chariot, and defines my stand as well.

39
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,331
I can beat you in this cramped
little place as well as anywhere else.

40
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,824
Not very sporting, though.

41
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,210
Your flames will serve you to
greater effect in a larger, open space.

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,541
Beating you at the apex of your powers,
monsieur, is the only victory worthy of my stand.

43
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,385
All of you, follow me outside!

44
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:04,992
What the hell kind of nonsense is this?

45
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:09,252
I believe they call it Tiger Balm Garden.

46
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,163
Oh, yeah?

47
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:12,745
Tiger Balm Garden,

48
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:18,653
a fantastical hillside park built
along Hong Kong's famous Tai Hang road.

49
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:23,599
With its surreal landscape of sculptures
and pagodas, it is a true Hong Kong oddity.

50
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,466
A prediction, if I may indulge.

51
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:29,722
Monsieur Avdol, you will die here,

52
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:34,291
destroyed by the flames of your
very own stand, Magician's Red.

53
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:36,157
Avdol.

54
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,373
Jotaro, this is not your fight.

55
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,325
In an open space like this one,

56
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:46,256
there's nothing to keep my
stand from fighting at full force.

57
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,102
En garde!

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,868
Come on.

59
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,805
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

60
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,149
Come, now. Nothing at all?

61
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,927
No sign of the flame you were crowing about before?!

62
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,637
Suit yourself! I shall press the attack!

63
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,149
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

64
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:18,507
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

65
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,269
That goddamn bastard, he's just toying with us.

66
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:36,327
He used Magician's Red's own
fireballs to make a statue of it.

67
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:38,345
Look at that.

68
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,603
In a place this odd, I dare say
your fiendish face is right at home.

69
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,739
Well, here it comes.

70
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:56,303
Show me your true power at last, Avdol,
but know that it will never be enough.

71
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,303
Hey, hide behind something already.

72
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,735
Avdol's gonna blow his top!

73
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,300
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,818
Crossfire...

75
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:08,217
Hurricane!

76
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,216
Really, is that the best that you've got?

77
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:19,539
I told you before what my sword does. It creates a gap
between the pockets of air so I can slice your flames!

78
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:32,656
Avdol, no! The fire is so intense,
it's burning stand and user alike!

79
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,461
It's just as I foretold.

80
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,955
You will die from an inferno of your own making.

81
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,873
Good grief, just die already.

82
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,978
One last pathetic gasp? This is hard to watch!

83
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:55,120
That hit felt wrong. What is this?

84
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:57,303
What?

85
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,012
Impossible.

86
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:02,610
How can his stand injure me after
the moment of its own destruction?

87
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,839
It's not the stand, you bastard! It's a dummy!

88
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,834
The flames blinded your eyes.

89
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,432
What you really destroyed

90
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:16,651
was the statue that Silver Chariot carved earlier.

91
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:21,942
Perhaps you didn't take me at my word when I
told you that I could control my flames freely.

92
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,688
When you deflected it, I used it to melt
the statue's joints and allow it to move.

93
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:30,783
The one defeated by his own
stand's powers is you, Polnareff!

94
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,906
Now let's try this again.

95
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,710
Crossfire hurricane!

96
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,883
Challenging a fortuneteller in a
battle of predictions is a bold move.

97
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:47,323
Give it another decade, and you
would have been a viable opponent.

98
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,723
Such terrifying power.

99
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:55,066
His stand must have melted in the face of such an attack.

100
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,130
It's done for.

101
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,815
That's one hell of a burn.

102
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,643
I'm betting he's dead or wishes he was.

103
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,363
Yeah. He's not getting up from that.

104
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:04,703
If he is alive,

105
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,824
he'll be flat on his back for months.

106
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,468
Having your stand destroyed is a major trauma.

107
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:14,848
Now then, Mr. Joestar, let us resume our trek to Egypt.

108
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:15,652
Mm.

109
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,718
What the hell's going on?

110
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,386
His stand just exploded into a bunch of pieces.

111
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,347
How is he still lying down, but suspended in midair?

112
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,941
Bravo!

113
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:38,307
Well done, monsieur. Bravo.

114
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,794
That's impossible.

115
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,812
I don't believe it.

116
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,783
He doesn't look injured at all.

117
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:43,908
Yeah, but...

118
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,029
Why the hell's he floating in the air?

119
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,994
Look with your inner eye, and see the truth.

120
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:51,502
How can it be?

121
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:56,381
Mais oui, messieurs.

122
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:59,893
He may have shed his armor,
but it's still my Silver Chariot.

123
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:03,020
You seem quite taken aback by this.

124
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:05,510
I really should explain before I destroy you.

125
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,608
Otherwise it wouldn't be chivalrous. Don't you agree?

126
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:11,306
I'm sure you were expecting nothing less.

127
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,439
If you don't mind,

128
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,463
may we take a short timeout for an explanation?

129
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:17,864
Very well.

130
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,611
Let's hear this explanation.

131
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,507
First, the explosion you saw
was not my stand self-destructing.

132
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:28,882
What you took as Silver Chariot's body was armor,

133
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:30,663
armor that was cast off.

134
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:34,499
But before it did, it absorbed the brunt of your flames.

135
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,438
That's how I escaped further harm.

136
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:40,181
And bereft of armor, it has significantly more agility.

137
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:43,517
Were you able to see my stand as it held me up?

138
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:47,819
That's right. Silver Chariot
can now move faster than before.

139
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,637
Hmm. Illuminating.

140
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:53,771
You're suggesting it only stood there
and took my crossfire hurricane head-on,

141
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:56,653
because the armor didn't allow it to dodge. Is that it?

142
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:01,481
But, bereft of armor, it is also far more vulnerable.

143
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:07,884
It may have survived my attack once before, but if
it were hit again, its destruction would be absolute.

144
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,498
Hmph. That may be.

145
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:13,257
Oui. How can one know?

146
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,735
Such a shame we'll never find out.

147
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:20,534
Never, huh? Mind if I try it out?

148
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:24,458
First, let me show you all something
that will really freak you out.

149
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,414
Well? Go ahead, then.

150
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,711
What the devil?

151
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:33,805
He now has six... no. No, wait.
He has a total of seven stands now.

152
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,608
But that's impossible.

153
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,817
There should only be one stand per user.

154
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:42,543
Tell me, are you freaked out yet? These are after-images.

155
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:49,137
Perfect mirrors of the Silver
Chariot, guaranteed to fool your senses.

156
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,134
Your sight, your hearing, your
senses can't follow their movement.

157
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:57,463
How do you like its swordsmanship now, monsieur?!

158
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,506
Suffer my red bind!

159
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:28,673
I told you that efforts to track
it would be in vain, did I not?

160
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:31,800
You waste your flame on images and spare the real threat.

161
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,061
Striking at random.

162
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:42,907
Desperation is not a good look on you, my dear Avdol.

163
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:45,465
He's going to exhaust himself at this rate.

164
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:49,937
Crossfire...

165
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,530
Hurricane!

166
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,722
Mais non. Mais non. Mais non. Mais non.

167
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:00,723
Have you learned nothing at all today?

168
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,872
You're a fool whose attacks will not work on my stand!

169
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:04,894
Now give up!

170
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,312
Come on. Come on. Come on!

171
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,102
Avdol.

172
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,895
What precision. What lethal efficiency.

173
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:14,981
It's plain to see.

174
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:18,459
His stand's ability has been trained and at great length.

175
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,835
Hmm. I've spent the last decade honing my skill.

176
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,731
You had better hit me with everything you've got,

177
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,717
for I intend my next attack to be the coup de grace.

178
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:32,682
It's very chivalrous of you to keep
giving me fair warning about your next move.

179
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:34,668
Your honor is unimpeachable.

180
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:40,158
You've inspired me. Thus, I, too, will
give fair warning before my next attack.

181
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,643
Really?

182
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:47,156
My crossfire hurricane comes in more
varieties than the one you've already seen.

183
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,627
It's a flame in the shape of an
ankh, but it need not remain whole.

184
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:54,113
I can divide it into as many pieces as I deem fit.

185
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,245
Crossfire hurricane special!

186
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:04,831
Try and dodge them!

187
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,732
You're a fool, Avdol! It's useless!

188
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,039
Damn. They've got him covered.

189
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,246
He's thought of everything.

190
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,709
Naive, naive, naive! So very naive!

191
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:22,633
I will wield this divided flame
against you precisely as I did before.

192
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,457
Slice it, and hurl it back!

193
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,014
What?!

194
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,743
That's... that's the hole that
was dug by the flames earlier.

195
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,232
Now I get it. It's clear to me.

196
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:48,715
The first shot was a setup and nothing more.

197
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,769
Then he used the tunnel to hit
him with crossfire hurricane.

198
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:57,024
Like I said, that attack can be divided
up into as many pieces as are called for.

199
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:08,114
Burning is a painful way to meet one's end.

200
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,402
Take the knife, and end it while you can.

201
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,801
My conceit was my undoing.

202
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:33,866
I couldn't picture his fire standing
a chance against my sword-work.

203
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,809
A slow death amid the flames is
no less than I deserve, monsieur.

204
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:42,145
I challenged you to this duel,
and you were the clear victor.

205
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,655
I would not Sully it with suicide.

206
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:46,721
It would be cowardly...

207
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,405
To end it myself.

208
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:53,273
Hmph.

209
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:57,546
Even in your final moments, you
conduct yourself with chivalry.

210
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:02,248
How easy it would have been for you to
throw that knife into my unsuspecting back.

211
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:06,777
Even while working for a devil like
Dio, you've carried yourself with honor.

212
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,676
Your death would be a waste.

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,703
Hmm?

214
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,316
Something must have set him down this dark path.

215
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:14,786
JoJo.

216
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,066
Got ya.

217
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:22,397
Those tentacles are so gross, I can't even look at 'em!

218
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,385
Come on, Jotaro! Just destroy the damn thing!

219
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,339
Quit your bitchin', old man.

220
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,313
There.

221
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,493
Now that my grandson has pulled out
that flesh bud, we all can be buddies.

222
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,454
You get it?

223
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,765
Hey, Kakyoin,

224
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:42,912
don't people who make stupid puns all
the time get on your nerves, or it just me?

225
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:49,085
The Speedwagon foundation
chartered a boat for us yesterday.

226
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,842
With any luck, it's reached the harbor ahead of us.

227
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:54,829
We meet again.

228
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,799
So what's on your mind...

229
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,005
Polnareff?

230
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:01,979
I never thanked you properly for
freeing me from Dio's mind control.

231
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:04,624
Young JoJo is the one you should be thanking here.

232
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:06,555
Don't need your thanks.

233
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,044
It appears your fine manners
are wasted on the likes of us.

234
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,300
As you wish. I've no desire to come off as heavy-handed,

235
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,516
but I'm not quite finished here.

236
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,164
Mssr. Joestar...

237
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:20,519
Eh?

238
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:23,387
I hope you'll indulge my asking a very bizarre question.

239
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:25,520
A bizarre question, you say?

240
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:30,952
I noticed at the restaurant yesterday that you
never took off your gloves, even while eating.

241
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,222
Tell me. Your left hand wouldn't happen
to be a right hand under that glove?

242
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,855
Huh? Is my left hand a right one?

243
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:40,795
You weren't kidding about the bizarre part.

244
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,345
What are you hoping to find out through all this?

245
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,675
I'm looking for the man who murdered my younger sister.

246
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,949
I don't know his face.

247
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,073
But he definitely has two right
hands instead of one of each.

248
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,237
Here. I lost the real thing in a
horrible battle some 50 years ago.

249
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:09,580
I apologize for the rudeness. Please forgive me.

250
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,211
If it's not too painful to talk
about, I'd like to know what happened.

251
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:22,187
It's been three years now.

252
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:30,057
My younger sister and a classmate of hers
were walking home from school in the rain

253
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,749
back in our native France.

254
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,053
It was a country road, much like any other.

255
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:39,212
On the side of the road, a
man stood with his back to them.

256
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,281
Oddly enough, the mysterious stranger was dry.

257
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,724
The rain fell in torrents around him,

258
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,297
as though an invisible shell guarded him.

259
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:54,914
Suddenly her friend fell to the ground in a fountain
of blood, as though her chest was cut by the wind.

260
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:03,847
My sister was alone.

261
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,924
He stole her innocence, and then he killed her.

262
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:14,372
That was all the man wanted. For that, she died.

263
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:18,870
Her friend escaped with her life to
tell me what she saw that fateful day.

264
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:22,364
She didn't get a good look at their tormenter's face,

265
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:25,488
but saw that both of his hands were right hands.

266
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:32,146
No one believed the poor girl's testimony
about the man, no one but me, that is.

267
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:38,230
I had already been keeping my own strange powers a
secret by then, and he sounded like a fellow stand user.

268
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:41,077
He's a stand user, all right. I'm sure of it.

269
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:42,524
I swore an oath!

270
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,021
I promised my sister's soul that I would avenge her,

271
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,504
to hunt down the killer and make him pay with his life!

272
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:53,145
I would use my own stand as a tool of righteous vengeance!

273
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:56,959
Then, a year ago, my travels led me to Dio.

274
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:19,202
That man.

275
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:21,370
The reflection shows...

276
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:24,468
It's a vision from your heart, not mine.

277
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:30,067
The man you seek, the pain you
hide, my power only makes it visible.

278
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,419
How about it, Polnareff?

279
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,151
Care to become friends?

280
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,809
Tragedy gnaws away at your soul.

281
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:43,088
I need no glass to see that.

282
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:48,216
Work with me, and your suffering will
soon be nothing more than a thing of the past.

283
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:51,955
The image in the globe is what pains you, is it not?

284
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,586
What if I could help you?

285
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,224
I, too, am plagued with misfortune.

286
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,535
I have been denied the sun's embrace for evermore.

287
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:06,444
Be an agent of my will out in the sunlight,
and I will find this man who haunts you so.

288
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,517
After that, I was commanded to kill all four of you.

289
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,099
Never once did I question my orders.

290
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,004
Even if he hadn't used a flesh bud,

291
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:26,275
Dio is quite the master at manipulating
human beings to carry out his bidding.

292
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,779
Truly. And if Dio has found your sister's killer,

293
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:34,536
we might safely assume he's enlisted the
villain in whatever dark plans he's got afoot.

294
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,511
If that is true, I must join you
on your trek to Egypt, messieurs!

295
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:42,330
By going after Dio, I will find
the one who took my sister's life.

296
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:44,643
What do we do?

297
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:47,010
I have no objections to him coming.

298
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:48,010
Hmph.

299
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:51,447
Even if we tell him no, I'm sure he'll just follow along.

300
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,847
Jean Pierre Polnareff.

301
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,650
Stand name, Silver Chariot.

302
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:59,835
Powers, fast and precise swordsmanship.

303
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:02,681
The honor is all mine.

304
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:04,954
Give me a break.

305
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,009
Excuse me, sir.

306
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:06,471
Huh?

307
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,754
I'm sorry, but could I bug you to take our picture, maybe?

308
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:13,124
He's so hot. What a good excuse to talk to him.

309
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,308
Please, will you do it?

310
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,991
Oh! Oh! Take it with the ocean behind us.

311
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,302
Shut up already! Go bug someone else!

312
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:20,429
Easy, mon ami.

313
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,123
Ladies, I would love to take your photograph.

314
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,490
Come along. There.

315
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:28,065
You have very nice legs. I'll
be sure to get them in the shot.

316
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,892
Oui. Perfection.

317
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:33,784
And another one, for safety.

318
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:35,898
Tres bien!

319
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,953
If only I could use this camera to capture your
hearts instead of just your picture, mademoiselles.

320
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,582
This is nothing like the Polnareff of a moment ago.

321
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,970
It's like his emotions change on a dime.

322
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:52,168
More like he's got two brains, and the one
downstairs suddenly started calling the shots.

323
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,801
Oh, give me a break.

324
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,991
All the old paintings on the tomb

325
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,159
They do the sand dance, don't you know

326
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,503
If they move too quick

327
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:19,639
Oh, whey, oh

328
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,957
They're falling down like a domino

329
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:24,325
All the bazaar men by the Nile

330
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,580
They got the money on a bet

331
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,026
Gold crocodiles

332
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:28,942
Oh, whey, oh

333
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:31,221
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

334
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,496
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

335
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,879
Whey, oh, whey, oh

336
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:39,416
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

337
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:43,029
Walk like an Egyptian.

338
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,042
The blond waitresses take their trays

339
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,138
They spin around, and they cross the floor

340
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:00,412
They've got the moves

341
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:01,405
Oh, whey, oh

342
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:02,439
You drop your drink

343
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:03,940
Then they bring you more

344
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,210
All the school kids so sick of books

345
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,420
They like the punk and the metal band

346
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:09,847
When the buzzer rings

347
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:10,898
Oh, whey, oh

348
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,158
They're walking like an Egyptian

349
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,285
All the kids in the marketplace say

350
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,520
Whey, oh, whey, oh

351
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:22,325
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

352
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,102
Walk like an Egyptian
