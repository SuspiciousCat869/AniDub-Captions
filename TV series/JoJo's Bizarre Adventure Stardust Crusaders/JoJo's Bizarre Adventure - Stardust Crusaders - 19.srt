1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,771
That piercing noise...

2
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,709
What is this place?

3
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:40,934
An amusement park?

4
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:43,740
I've never been here before.

5
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:48,980
W-Why in the world am I riding
on a ferris wheel in my pajamas?

6
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:50,881
How'd I get here?

7
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,747
The desert.

8
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,232
I remember being in the desert,
riding through Saudi Arabia on camelback.

9
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,244
But where are the others?

10
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,394
Did they abandon me?

11
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,019
This isn't making any sense.

12
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:15,003
There's not a soul anywhere in the amusement
park, so why do I hear the cries of a baby?

13
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,172
And for that matter, where is it?

14
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,526
Th-this card is...

15
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:38,239
Death 13..

16
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,243
Oh, no! The card is moving!

17
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:00,660
Kakyoin. Kakyoin!

18
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,271
Hey, take it easy.

19
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,840
Stop screaming and shaking the bed
like that creepy girl from "the exorcist."

20
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,241
You're weirding me out.

21
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:10,426
Where are we?

22
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:12,332
Don't ask stupid questions.

23
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,369
Now come on, and get up already, would you?

24
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,708
After breakfast, we're gonna take to the skies.

25
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,982
Looks like another scorcher today.

26
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,019
I had a terrible nightmare.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,090
It was truly horrifying.

28
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:36,833
You don't say? Lay on the
details. I wanna hear all about it.

29
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,859
Well, the thing is, I can't remember.

30
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:39,947
I've forgotten it all.

31
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:40,938
Come again?

32
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,293
Regardless, it was petrifying,

33
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,770
but when you woke me up, you pulled me out of it.

34
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:50,336
Wish we could talk more about
it, but we've gotta get a move on.

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,566
Let's go.

36
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,150
Hurry up, and get ready.

37
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:01,756
There's a cut on my hand.

38
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,888
But how'd it get there?

39
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:43,028
Jotaro and Mr. Joestar are already headed
to the plane, so we'll meet them there,

40
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:46,252
and the way I hear it, we're
traveling 500 kilometers today.

41
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:49,512
No! This can't be happening!

42
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,935
Please, not my poor dog!

43
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,873
My dog is dead!

44
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,442
Who would do such a thing?!

45
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,611
A dog? Dog?

46
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,381
I could have sworn...

47
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,166
That I saw a dead dog not too long ago.

48
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,585
Whoever did this is sick, but
there's nothing we can do about it.

49
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,809
Let's go.

50
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,399
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

51
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,422
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on a dang second there, mister!

52
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,560
What exactly do you mean, you can't sell us the plane now?

53
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,893
I seem to recall you taking my money
last night and saying it was a done deal.

54
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,785
You'll get a full refund, but first
we need to see to a baby with a fever.

55
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,865
It's 39 degrees Celsius.

56
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,411
Huh?

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,358
There's no doctor in this town, so we have no
choice but to take the baby somewhere else to get help.

58
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:45,661
Okay, then, what do you say to
us taking that plane over there?

59
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,614
I'm sorry to say that one's
broken, and the others are out...

60
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,642
What's up? Some kind of argument?

61
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:50,365
Yeah.

62
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,181
A baby?

63
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,971
A baby.

64
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,917
I remember hearing a baby's cries...

65
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,758
But where?

66
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,648
You'll be able to use the plane
after it gets back tomorrow night.

67
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:07,051
We can renegotiate and talk prices then.

68
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,952
Did you say, "tomorrow night"?

69
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:12,220
Our group has someone's life on
the line, just like you guys do.

70
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:15,182
We can't afford to spend two
days pissing around this place.

71
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,678
So what you're telling me is
you'd rather let that baby die?!

72
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,969
Well, I...

73
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:22,862
Excuse me.

74
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,463
I have a suggestion.

75
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:30,082
We can kill two birds with one stone by having
these gentlemen take him to the doctor on their way.

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,444
Uh, nice idea, but...

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,576
The Cessna is built to carry four, but
surely there's enough room for a baby.

78
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:44,220
I could have sworn I just saw it smile
and that the child already has teeth.

79
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,251
You sure about this, lady?

80
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,897
Do you really want to leave your baby with these guys?

81
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,212
Eh, just a minute. We can't do that either.

82
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,704
It's too dangerous for the baby to come with us.

83
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,782
I told them this would be dangerous.

84
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,343
Hey, just try and take it easy, Mr. Joestar.

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,632
There's no way a stand could catch a
plane flying hundreds of kilometers an hour.

86
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,782
I mean, we even made sure the plane itself wasn't a stand.

87
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,254
I'd say we're good to go.

88
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:18,939
I'm far more worried about the old man's
flying than I am an attack from enemy stands.

89
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,985
Oh, thank goodness. What a relief.

90
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,373
By the way, I wonder who that baby belonged to.

91
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,457
Huh? Are you saying you're not
the mother of that child, miss?

92
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,863
Oh, no. I found it by the well this morning.

93
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:53,251
Though, from the moment I heard the
baby's crying, I wasn't able to help myself.

94
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,951
I felt I had to put him on that plane.

95
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,765
What could happen?

96
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:14,589
Maybe it's just me, but I always
get so tired when I get on a plane.

97
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:19,028
If it's all right with you, Mr. Joestar,
I think I'm gonna take a 30-minute catnap.

98
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:19,915
Sure.

99
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,495
W-What is this?

100
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,111
Hey, Kakyoin, where the hell are we?!

101
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,826
Where'd Mr. Joestar go?!

102
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:40,713
This is the same dream I had this morning,

103
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,204
but now it seems we're both inside the dream.

104
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:45,324
What? A dream?

105
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,056
Yes.

106
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,998
That's a relief. It's just a stupid dream.

107
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:55,010
I was worried for a second, but if it's
only a dream, who cares if the dog is dead?

108
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,665
Polnareff, you can't be serious.

109
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,601
Dreams are only as scary as you make
'em. That's kind of the way it goes.

110
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:04,028
Oh. Just try and relax.

111
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:06,629
How can I relax when we're having the same dream?!

112
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,814
I suppose you have a point there.

113
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:10,675
This is kinda weird.

114
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,451
But in a dream, isn't anything possible?

115
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,665
Oh, boy! Would you look at that?

116
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,266
This dreaming thing is great.

117
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,327
So good.

118
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:23,501
See? All you have to do to make
your dreams fun is think they're fun.

119
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:28,305
Listen. Do you remember seeing
the dog's carcass this morning?

120
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,175
Obviously, the dog and I had the same dream, and
in that dream, that dog was unmistakably slaughtered.

121
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:36,503
Once I was awake, I found this cut on my hand.

122
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,195
Eh? Where from?

123
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,254
From the enemy's stand, Death 13...

124
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,111
The enemy stand?

125
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:49,131
Oh, I get it now. You're paranoid,
'cause you had a dream about stands.

126
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,085
Hah! Man, you have got to take it easy.

127
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:53,685
You're wrong! It wasn't a dream about stands.

128
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,241
A stand was in my dream. That's what I said.

129
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,049
You were having a dream about stands.

130
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,563
You still don't get it, do you?

131
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:05,320
Lali-ho! Tell me, does it hurt being that stupid?

132
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,526
Oh, for the love of...

133
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:13,206
Let me spell it out for you!

134
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:16,056
I'm saying that you're slow on the uptake, Polnareff!

135
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,730
I-it's coming from the dog's wound.

136
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:22,868
Lali-ho!

137
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:25,487
Allow me to welcome you to my humble abode.

138
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:27,616
This is a dream, and I'm the grim reaper!

139
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:28,751
It's a megaphone?

140
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,385
What the... what is that thing?!

141
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:43,239
Polnareff, stay on guard, and watch
closely. That fiend is Death 13..

142
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:49,959
W-w...

143
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:56,075
Come forth, Hierophant Green!

144
00:10:57,977 --> 00:10:59,629
Hierophant, attack!

145
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:01,772
Chario...

146
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,794
Why can't I summon Hierophant?

147
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:06,852
What is this?

148
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,546
I can't get my stand appear either.

149
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,146
Is it because we're in some kind of twisted dream?

150
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:14,745
Lali-ho!

151
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:18,952
It's romantic, wouldn't you
agree, being able to die in a dream?

152
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,712
Lali-ho.

153
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,271
Eh, Jotaro, do you sense that?

154
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,215
Yeah, clear as day.

155
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,417
Are you stupid?

156
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:55,101
Surely you know by now that
only a stand can defeat a stand.

157
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,571
It's time for you to enter your eternal sleep, Polnareff.

158
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,650
Lali-ho.

159
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:03,898
Polnareff!

160
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,868
Die!

161
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,266
Polnareff.

162
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:14,268
Hey, Polnareff, wake up.

163
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,969
It would appear our little traveler has wet himself.

164
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,409
Do us all a favor, and change his diaper.

165
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:25,751
Eh, curses.

166
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,631
Someone must have woken the fool from his slumber.

167
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,015
He's quite lucky.

168
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,891
Lali-ho. I suppose it's no matter.

169
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,081
Even if he wakes up, he won't remember a single thing.

170
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:41,754
I'll just have to finish him
the next time he falls asleep.

171
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:46,150
Which means your death has been moved up.

172
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,774
Lali-ho!

173
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:51,854
Hey, there, Polnareff, have you woken up yet?

174
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:54,079
I'd like that diaper changed this year.

175
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,753
All right. I'm up. I'm up.

176
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:01,717
Man. I feel like I had some kind of terrifying nightmare,

177
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,614
but I... I don't remember what happened at all.

178
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,535
I've completely forgotten.

179
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:11,242
After you change the boy's diaper, you can
head back to dreamland to finish your business.

180
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,781
I won't wake you up again.

181
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:20,928
Merde! Hold on a second, guys. What the hell is this?!

182
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,917
The kid took a dump in his
diaper. Just look at the size of it.

183
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,461
Well, he is a baby, you know. That's why he wears diapers.

184
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,809
You're kidding me! That's why?!

185
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,442
C'est degueulasse.

186
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,568
What a vile, disgusting creature.

187
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,706
And he's gotten it all over the place!

188
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,523
Would you stop yapping and change
the damn diaper already? It stinks.

189
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:45,525
How are you not embarrassed?

190
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,289
Do us all a favor, and grow up already.

191
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,452
Does this look right to you?

192
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,050
Well, it looks good to me.

193
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:57,915
Jotaro, I need you to hold on to the
edge there. I'm gonna try and pin it.

194
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,104
Okay. Like this?

195
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:03,330
Yeah, I think so. Now hold on to the baby.

196
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,665
Lali-ho!

197
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,793
Stop it! Stop it!

198
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,432
Kakyoin, what's wrong?

199
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:21,127
Hey!

200
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,466
What's going on?

201
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,665
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

202
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,835
Damn it!

203
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:32,776
I've lost control!

204
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,731
Wait. Are you saying that we're gonna crash?

205
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,885
Stop!

206
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,839
Kakyoin, what's the matter with you?

207
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,606
He's been this way since he woke up!

208
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,943
I don't care. Just calm him down.

209
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:48,267
Old man, if you don't regain control
of this thing, we're all done for.

210
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:57,796
Kakyoin, you need to pull yourself together,
pronto. We're about to crash because of you.

211
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,930
Lali-ho.

212
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:05,425
Talk about a restless sleeper. At this rate,
you'll kill us both, you and my user, that is.

213
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:09,695
Y-your user is that baby? How
in the world is that possible?

214
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:14,879
No way. He's only about six months old.

215
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,569
Wrong. I'm 11 months, almost a year old.

216
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,321
It may also interest you to know that I'm a genius.

217
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:25,628
I may poop in my diapers, but I know
a hell of a lot more than you fools!

218
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:29,605
Lali-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

219
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:45,211
And with that, you've lost your ability to scream.

220
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,096
A stand within a dream.

221
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:52,451
I have to find a way to let Mr. Joestar and Jotaro know.

222
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,849
What are you doing? Mr. Joestar!

223
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:58,852
Damn it. Level us out.

224
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,027
Just calm down.

225
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:03,545
Can't you see I'm working on that
while trying to stay cool and collected?

226
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,882
I'm not waking up.

227
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,391
Lali-ho. Looks to me like no one's going to notice

228
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,888
if you're cutting your arm with a
knife that's smaller than my wee-wee.

229
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,691
Besides, you can hurt yourself all you
want in this dream, but it won't wake you up.

230
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:25,745
As long as you're asleep, I completely
control every iota of your precious mind.

231
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:32,805
My stand, Death 13, infiltrates the minds of its
slumbering victims when they are at their most vulnerable.

232
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,712
Damn it. Stop.

233
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:42,060
What's wrong, old man?

234
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,487
We're crashing.

235
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,979
I'll control it with Hermit Purple.

236
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:55,651
I did it! I lifted the plane just in the nick of time!

237
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,050
What a close one.

238
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,583
It would seem we managed to avoid crashing.

239
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,734
That was too close for comfort.

240
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:10,222
Now, then, what do you say to me killing
you by crushing that heart of yours?

241
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:14,979
That way, Joestar and the others will think
you had a heart attack and died of natural causes.

242
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,599
Die, Kakyoin.

243
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:23,141
Did you guys see that? How do you boys
like them apples? My flying's not too shabby.

244
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:23,959
Well done.

245
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,340
Hey.

246
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,049
Hmm?

247
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:33,075
What? Why the hell is there a
palm tree all the way out here?

248
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,379
Good grief. Damn.

249
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:38,644
I knew you'd do this.

250
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,720
Is this enough, Mr. Joestar?

251
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:00,659
Yeah. Thank you.

252
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:04,049
We survived, but

253
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,239
Kakyoin, what's going on, man?

254
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,437
This is all your fault, you know?

255
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,917
I'm not sure.

256
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:18,652
I feel like I just endured a horrible dream,
and when I awoke, I was utterly exhausted.

257
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,962
I think there's something wrong with me.

258
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,632
Try and cheer up. It's probably a case of fatigue.

259
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,523
It's been about a month now since we left Japan,

260
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:32,209
and the enemy's been attacking
us nonstop ever since that day.

261
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,557
Hey. It looks like the baby's fever has finally gone down.

262
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,512
Thank goodness he's safe and sound.

263
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:42,168
If anything were to happen, to this
little guy, I'd never forgive myself.

264
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:48,027
Peek-a-boo. Bleh!

265
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,231
Peek-a-boo. Bleh.

266
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,545
He has such an adorable smile, don't you think?

267
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:57,441
I really don't get what's so funny.

268
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,747
You're not even making any
jokes, just faces. What an idiot.

269
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,026
Oh, put a sock in it.

270
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:08,063
This isn't my idea of a perfect night, either.

271
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,472
Hey, old man, the radio survived. What should we do?

272
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,206
Should we send out an S.O.S?

273
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,439
That'll mean Dio can find us, but...

274
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:18,787
We have to.

275
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:21,527
Let's call for a rescue, for the baby's sake.

276
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,835
I thought I was feeling twinges of pain.

277
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,790
I'm bleeding.

278
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,049
Wait. Did I cut it when we crashed?

279
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,038
What's this? The cuts form letters.

280
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,139
"Baby... stand"?

281
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,323
But how did they.

282
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,617
I don't know what it means,
even though it's my handwriting.

283
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,035
I can't remember anything.

284
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,828
Did I do this to myself?

285
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:04,710
There isn't any blood on my knife, but it
seems the cuts were made with this blade.

286
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,908
Wait a minute, could I have really
forgotten violently cutting my own arm?

287
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:17,023
Damn it. I was told that he was clever,

288
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:22,969
but I never got he actually carved letters
into his arm while trying to wake himself.

289
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,875
What was that look on the baby's face just now?

290
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,200
It's as if he deliberately looked
away the moment I met his gaze.

291
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,399
Baby...

292
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:39,982
Stand.

293
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:47,444
Baby stand.

294
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:57,457
I hate to say it, but I might be losing my mind, because.

295
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:00,891
I'm starting to think...

296
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,702
That this baby is a stand user!

297
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:11,687
Hey, Kakyoin, what do you think you're doing?

298
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,730
Come on, now. That is way too rough.

299
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,433
You could strangle the boy. What's wrong with you?

300
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:19,930
My apologies.

301
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,157
There, there. Everything's all right.

302
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,318
Let's have something to eat, shall we?

303
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,895
He should calm down once he has some food in him.

304
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,594
Hey, Jotaro, it looks like poor Kakyoin's
really starting to lose it out here.

305
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:36,718
There, there...

306
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,761
I wonder if he'll make it through the rest of this trip.

307
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,974
All the old paintings on the tomb

308
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,142
They do the sand dance, don't you know

309
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,486
If they move too quick

310
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:18,622
Oh, whey, oh

311
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,940
They're falling down like a domino

312
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,308
All the bazaar men by the Nile

313
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,563
They got the money on a bet

314
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,009
Gold crocodiles

315
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:27,925
Oh, whey, oh

316
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,204
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

317
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,479
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

318
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,862
Whey, oh, whey, oh

319
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:38,399
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

320
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,012
Walk like an Egyptian.

321
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:56,025
The blond waitresses take their trays

322
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,121
They spin around, and they cross the floor

323
00:22:58,146 --> 00:22:59,395
They've got the moves

324
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,388
Oh, whey, oh

325
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,422
You drop your drink

326
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:02,923
Then they bring you more

327
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,193
All the school kids so sick of books

328
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,403
They like the punk and the metal band

329
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,830
When the buzzer rings

330
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:09,881
Oh, whey, oh

331
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:12,141
They're walking like an Egyptian

332
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,268
All the kids in the marketplace say

333
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,503
Whey, oh, whey, oh

334
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:21,308
Ay, whey, oh, whey, oh

335
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:24,085
Walk like an Egyptian
