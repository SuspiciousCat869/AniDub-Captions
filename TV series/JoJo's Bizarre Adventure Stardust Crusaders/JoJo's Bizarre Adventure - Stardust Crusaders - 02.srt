1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,365
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure".

2
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:10,175
Come out. It's time to go home.

3
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,653
Get lost. I didn't ask you to come here.

4
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:16,267
You really think you can help me?

5
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:19,818
I'd like you to meet an Egyptian
friend I met a few years ago.

6
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:22,572
Say hello to Avdol.

7
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,516
Red bind!

8
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,151
Huh? What the...

9
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,355
And now for the truth.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,367
This may seem like an evil spirit, but it's far from it.

11
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:48,438
Jotaro, this thing you believe has
possessed you is actually a powerful vision

12
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:50,771
created by your own life energy.

13
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:54,713
This vision will always appear standing by your side,

14
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:58,169
and because of that, we call it a stand!

15
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,679
That coffin's a hundred years old,

16
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:04,748
and four years ago, it was pulled out
of the Atlantic off the coast of Africa.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,958
Okay. So?

18
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,040
I did a little research.

19
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:10,447
My grandfather, Jonathan Joestar,

20
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:13,019
your great-grandfather, died while at sea.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,918
Turns out this exact same coffin
was on that boat with him when he died.

22
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,678
When they discovered it four years ago, it was empty,

23
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:24,816
but I know exactly what was inside it.

24
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,980
Avdol and I are trying to locate him as we speak.

25
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:30,035
That person is evil incarnate,

26
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,123
and his name is Dio!

27
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,739
And now that he has been awakened
from his hundred-year slumber,

28
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,058
it is our fate to fight that man!

29
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,799
From the neck of this bastard on down

30
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,554
is Jonathan Joestar, my grandfather!

31
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,917
This son of a bitch took over his body!

32
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:01,487
Jotaro, don't leave yet.

33
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:04,183
You forgot something important.

34
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,432
Silly boy.

35
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:08,234
Here is your goodbye kiss.

36
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:10,632
You're such a bitch.

37
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:13,000
Stop clinging to me like I'm still a little kid.

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,583
Okay. Have a nice day.

39
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,897
What a giant pain in my ass.

40
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,081
Hey. Look, it's JoJo.

41
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:32,160
What? JoJo?

42
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,668
You're right. It is JoJo.

43
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:34,104
JoJo.

44
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:34,811
JoJo.

45
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:35,772
Hey, JoJo.

46
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:36,980
What's up, JoJo?

47
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:37,983
Hey there, JoJo.

48
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:38,644
What's going on JoJo?

49
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,607
So tell me, JoJo, where have you been?

50
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,625
You haven't been to school for four days.

51
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,039
Uh...

52
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:45,397
Hey!

53
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,050
Who do you think you are grabbing on to JoJo like that?

54
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,348
I don't like how friendly
you're getting with him. Stay away.

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,621
What the hell, ugly?

56
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:54,836
I'd be careful there, no boobs.

57
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,528
Ugly.

58
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:57,442
No boobs.

59
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:57,726
Ugly.

60
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,004
No boobs.

61
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:58,378
Ugly.

62
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:58,694
No boobs.

63
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,035
Ugly.

64
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,369
No boobs.

65
00:02:59,394 --> 00:02:59,737
Ugly.

66
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:00,086
No boobs.

67
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:00,390
Ugly.

68
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:00,656
No boobs.

69
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:00,864
Ugly.

70
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,089
Ugly.

71
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,467
Shut up! You're freakin' annoying!

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,541
He totally said that to me!

73
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,771
Nuh-uh, me!

74
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,036
JoJo, wait.

75
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,371
What the hell?

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,976
JoJo!

77
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:09,367
Those branches.

78
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:13,681
JoJo.

79
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,198
Oh, no.

80
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,107
JoJo fell so far down the steps.

81
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,701
Look. He can still move.

82
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,814
The branches must have broken his fall.

83
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,406
Did a branch slash open my leg?

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,192
No. Wait a sec.

85
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:30,030
That's not what caused me to fall down the stairs.

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,508
This cut is what came first. But how?

87
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:42,478
I see.

88
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:46,243
Looks like he's able to summon a pretty fierce stand.

89
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,245
I get it now.

90
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,478
Impressive.

91
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,932
No wonder he wants me to get rid of him.

92
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,380
But still...

93
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,567
He is no match for the power of my stand.

94
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:35,840
You really scared me.

95
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:37,785
Are you okay, JoJo?

96
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,399
You think you're hurt anywhere?

97
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,173
You're lucky. If you had landed just few inches off,
you'd have cracked your head right on the flagstone.

98
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,875
Nasty accidents happen on those steps all the time.

99
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,196
Tomorrow when you go down these
steps, you really should hold my hand.

100
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,288
Here.

101
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,853
Your leg seems to be cut.

102
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:10,035
You might wanna wrap it with this
handkerchief to help stop the bleeding.

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
You gonna be okay?

104
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:14,126
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

105
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,020
Hold it.

106
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,394
Hmm?

107
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,089
I forgot to say thanks.

108
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,218
I haven't seen you before. You go to our school?

109
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,342
I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.

110
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,202
And, yes, I just transferred here yesterday.

111
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,863
See you around.

112
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:37,849
Oh.

113
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,653
Oh.

114
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:39,531
Oh.

115
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,229
So his name's Kakyoin. Seems pretty cool.

116
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,134
You think so?

117
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,182
I still like JoJo way more than him.

118
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:46,796
Yeah, me, too.

119
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,828
Same goes for me.

120
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,858
At that time, I was very weak.

121
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,487
Lacking a body made me vulnerable.

122
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,141
If I had not taken Jonathan Joestar's body...

123
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,744
If it hadn't been for his energy

124
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,206
to augment my own limited source,

125
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:20,004
I couldn't have survived at the
bottom of that ocean for a hundred years.

126
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:22,129
But still...

127
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,973
This body has like a bond between a parent and a child.

128
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,531
It ties me to his kin.

129
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:36,584
They seem to know of my existence...

130
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:42,789
And of this power I've gained
from taking Jonathan’s body...

131
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,047
The stand.

132
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:51,123
It is the stand that reaches out
to the bodies of his descendants.

133
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:56,305
There are always advantages and
disadvantages to every situation.

134
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,562
I will eliminate them all.

135
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:03,279
The Joestar clan must be destroyed soon.

136
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:12,678
Why is every single room in
this house so tiny and cramped?

137
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,025
This is exactly why I hate Japan.

138
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,259
Avdol, how the hell can you stand being here?

139
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:21,088
I find it quite fascinating,

140
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,110
especially the tea ceremony.

141
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,831
Ceremony, schmeremony.

142
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,817
Instant coffee will do just fine.

143
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,120
By the way, about Dio...

144
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,419
Mr. Joestar, if you and I are aware of his existence,

145
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:45,557
would it not be safe to assume
that he knows about us as well?

146
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,284
Hmm. But if we don't know what he's going to do

147
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,802
or, for that matter, even what powers he has...

148
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,480
Gah!

149
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,046
Japanese coffee is absolutely vile!

150
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,922
That's American coffee.

151
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,410
Hmm?

152
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,883
That's a horrible cut, JoJo.

153
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:09,918
How'd you get it? Let me guess. You
got into another fight, didn't you?

154
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,428
Show some respect, and take off that hat.

155
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,000
It's poor manners.

156
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:15,910
Would you stop that?

157
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,789
Seriously?

158
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,339
Has JoJo ever been hurt in a fight before?

159
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,106
That's not what cut him, I'm sure.

160
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,106
No way.

161
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,624
Well, you do have a point.

162
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,127
Then I'll assume you were being clumsy, you big klutz.

163
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,836
Hey, hold on. What are you gonna do?

164
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,648
Cut your pants, of course.

165
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,220
Like hell, you are.

166
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,571
Well, if I'm gonna treat that wound, I must.

167
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,502
You'll ruin 'em. I'll take 'em off.

168
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,101
Didn't know you were so thrifty.

169
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,249
So while JoJo's taking off his pants,

170
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:48,957
I'm gonna take your temperatures and
prove you're nothing but a bunch of fakers.

171
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,625
Come on. We really caught a cold.

172
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,904
Totally. Now just let us go home already.

173
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:55,432
Not gonna happen.

174
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,830
Oops.

175
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,703
What the hell is this?

176
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:07,288
K-Kakyoin?

177
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,487
Hey, doctor.

178
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:11,650
What are you trying to do?

179
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,099
What does it look like?

180
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,468
I'm just shaking out the thermometer to reset it.

181
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:25,324
Th-that's not a thermometer you got in your hand.

182
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,036
Yeah, that's a pen.

183
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,574
Ah, come on. Did you just say, "pen"?

184
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,965
You think I'm dumb? Does this look like a pen to you?!

185
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,590
Tell me something.

186
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:39,377
Just how stupid are you two boys?

187
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:45,384
If you honestly think this thermometer
I'm holding looks like a pen to you...

188
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:52,151
Then maybe you need to take a closer look!

189
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,142
What the...

190
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:20,389
My eye! My eye!

191
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,425
JoJo...

192
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,591
What do you have to say?

193
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:28,349
You're not gonna stand there and tell me

194
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,512
this thermometer looks like a pen, too, are you?!

195
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,228
What the hell is going on? Such strength.

196
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,690
This is no mere woman.

197
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:42,222
Wait.

198
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,036
I saw something weird crawlin' up from the floor.

199
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,689
Was it a stand?

200
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,653
Noriaki Kakyoin...

201
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,541
Was he the one who started this?

202
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,656
Did he cut my leg on the stone steps?

203
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,308
Yes, it was me.

204
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:56,635
So it is you.

205
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,089
Hey. Long time, no see.

206
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,832
So my stand is currently possessing
and controlling that doctor.

207
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:06,912
If you attack my stand,

208
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,751
you'll hurt her, too, JoJo.

209
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:13,629
You bastard. Who are you?

210
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:16,551
I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin,

211
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:19,769
and the name of my stand here is Hierophant Green.

212
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,836
I am human, but I have pledged loyalty to him.

213
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,807
That's why I'm gonna kill you.

214
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,955
I have zero intention of hurting her.

215
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:49,322
Heh.

216
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,507
Now that I've dragged it out,

217
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:57,098
I see it for what it is, just a sleazy
stand whose only ability is to possess people.

218
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:05,007
So this is your stand, Kakyoin?

219
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:08,508
This green, stripy thing looks like shiny melon.

220
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:11,600
You're gonna regret doing that.

221
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,007
Dragging that out of her was a mistake, JoJo.

222
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,067
Don't act tough.

223
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,608
I can see my finger marks on your forehead.

224
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:26,003
If I decide to crush your
stand's head like the melon it is,

225
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,697
then I'm guessin' your head'll get crushed, too.

226
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,352
I'm gonna keep a tight grip on you for now.

227
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:35,729
We're gonna pay my gramps a little visit.

228
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,803
I'm sure he'd love to meet you...

229
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,671
And I'd like to know more about Dio myself.

230
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:50,893
What the hell?

231
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:54,014
What's that green liquid coming out of his stand's hand?

232
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:56,635
You should have listened, JoJo.

233
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,709
I told you you're gonna regret this, didn't I?

234
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:03,858
This is the attack of my stand, Hierophant Green.

235
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,962
No weird moves, Kakyoin!

236
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:16,674
Emerald splash!

237
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,445
So what do you think?

238
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,796
Did you like emerald splash?

239
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:38,211
That fluid you saw in Hierophant Green
is actually a surge of destructive energy.

240
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,277
It tore straight though your stand's chest,

241
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,448
and your insides have now been torn to shreds.

242
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:47,260
And as for that doctor over there...

243
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,685
Why?

244
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:56,028
I know I took that stand out of her, so how?

245
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,457
I told you already,

246
00:15:57,964 --> 00:15:59,524
but let me reiterate.

247
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,211
I tried to warn you that by attacking my
Hierophant Green, it would hurt her as well.

248
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:07,022
My stand can travel farther than yours,

249
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:08,930
but it dislikes open spaces.

250
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,487
Without exception, it prefers to hide within something.

251
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:16,457
If you drag it out, it gets angry.

252
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,746
That's why, when you ripped it out of her throat,

253
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,653
it hurt her along the way.

254
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,349
You're the one who did this to her.
This is entirely your fault, JoJo.

255
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,319
You must be held responsible.

256
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,876
Look at what you've done.

257
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:35,096
All you had to do was let me kill you, and
the doctor would have walked away unharmed.

258
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,111
And still you get up.

259
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,406
You are so pathetic.

260
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,422
You're nothing more than a sandbag

261
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:48,268
about to be pummeled by a skilled boxer.

262
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,103
Why even bother standing up?

263
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,216
I'm just gonna knock you down again.

264
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,078
Look...

265
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,406
No one ever said Jotaro Kujo was a nice guy.

266
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,442
I beat the crap out of people more than I have to.

267
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,843
Some are even still in the hospital.

268
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,307
I've had idiot teachers who liked to talk big,

269
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,858
so I taught them a lesson, and
they never came back to class.

270
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,584
If I go to a restaurant and the food's bad,

271
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,173
I make it a policy to stiff 'em with the bill.

272
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,448
But even a bastard like me

273
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,753
can spot true evil when he sees it.

274
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:35,305
True evil are those who use the weak for their own
gain, then crush them underfoot when they're through...

275
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,945
Especially an innocent woman.

276
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:42,870
And that is exactly what you've done, isn't it?

277
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:48,154
And your stand gets to hide from the
victim, the law, and the consequences.

278
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,442
That's why...

279
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,373
I will judge you myself.

280
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:54,184
I'm evil?

281
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,879
See, that's where you're wrong.

282
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,983
Evil is always the loser.

283
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,216
It's the victor who has justice,

284
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,813
the victor being the last man standing.

285
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,039
And how you win in battle is irrelevant!

286
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,125
See, the loser is always the evil one.

287
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,476
Time to finish you off.

288
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,875
Really? The loser's evil?

289
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:27,672
Emerald splash!

290
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,215
Then, let me show you...

291
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:34,201
What?

292
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,613
There's no way.

293
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,123
No one can just deflect the emerald splash.

294
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,593
...just how evil you are.

295
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,483
Ora!

296
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,709
I'll teach you justice

297
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,036
with my stand!

298
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:12,101
Your stand has incredible power.

299
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,024
You caught me by surprise earlier

300
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,836
and scratched its chest a little.

301
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,307
I'm glad my stand isn't weak,

302
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:24,389
but sometimes it feels like it
can get more savage than I am.

303
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,646
That was a close call.

304
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:32,521
She'll be fine once her wounds are treated.

305
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:33,752
Hmm?

306
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,373
Did a gas pipe just burst?

307
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,049
It came from the doctor's office.

308
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,590
Everyone, stay in the classroom!

309
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,202
I'll leave the cleanup to them.

310
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,506
I've had enough school for one day.

311
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,753
This guy needs to talk.

312
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:47,326
I wanna hear everything he knows about Dio.

313
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:21,792
I just had the most amazing
connection with my son right now.

314
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:25,128
Jotaro must be thinking about
me at school this very second.

315
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:26,573
I'm not thinking about you.

316
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,132
Jotaro!

317
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,619
Why aren't you at school?

318
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,564
And who is that boy on your shoulder?

319
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:34,852
Is that blood that he's covered in?

320
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,602
Wait a sec. Please don't tell me you did that.

321
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:39,954
None of your business.

322
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:42,996
I need to find the old man.

323
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,572
Finding someone in this big house really sucks.

324
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,383
I think you can find him with Avdol right now.

325
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:51,117
They're both in the tea room.

326
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,486
Oh, Jotaro, you never tell me anything.

327
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:02,349
All that does is make me worry about you all the time.

328
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,329
But still, I know that, deep
down, you really do mean well.

329
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,005
You're a very sweet little boy at heart.

330
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,091
Hey.

331
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:11,668
Yes?

332
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,917
You're lookin' a little bit pale the morning.

333
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:17,282
You all right?

334
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:21,752
Yay!

335
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,375
I'm fine! Thank you!

336
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,650
I knew it.

337
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:33,700
Well, I hate to say it, but it's too late for him.

338
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:36,052
There's no way he'll make it.

339
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,293
He's got a few days before he dies at most.

340
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:43,092
Jotaro, this is not your fault. Trust me.

341
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:46,538
Do you want to know why this
man swore his allegiance to Dio

342
00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:48,739
and came to your school to kill you?

343
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:52,060
Look right here, and I will show you!

344
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,332
What the hell is that?
