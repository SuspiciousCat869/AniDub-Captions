2
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,650
Can't breathe. Someone help me.

3
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:18,567
[EICHI] Am I going to
die all alone like this?

4
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,817
[EICHI]
I guess so. No Christmas for me.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,608
Hello! Merry Christmas!

6
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,525
[gasps] Hi, Hibiki.

7
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:33,233
[WATARU]
Let's go, Eichi. Take my hand.

8
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:34,692
What did you say?

9
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,192
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,317
I wasn't even thinking and
called you by your first name.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,275
Do we have to be so formal?

12
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,567
It's Christmas time, come on.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,358
[WATARU] Now close your eyes
and we'll say it together.

14
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:54,983
One, two... we're amazing!

15
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,692
[EICHI]
Amazing!

16
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,358
[EICHI gasps]

17
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:02,275
What's happening?
This is impossible!

18
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,942
[WATARU chuckles]

19
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,317
The only impossibility is

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,942
finding something
truly impossible.

21
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,025
Okay, it's just a dream.

22
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:13,400
[WATARU]
You're unexpectedly calm!

23
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:14,817
[EICHI]
Hibiki...

24
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,275
[EICHI]
I mean, Mr. Angel.

25
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,233
I've been terribly
sick since birth.

26
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,650
It feels like I'm being
strangled by threads of cotton.

27
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,483
Will this flying
dream come true someday?

28
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,025
If this is the future
I have ahead of me,

29
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:31,942
then please, tell me.

30
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,442
Because even though I feel sick,

31
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:37,067
this gives me
motivation to live.

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,942
Despite everything...
I can live.

33
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,733
[EICHI coughs]

34
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,067
That's not good.

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,192
Guess I must've fallen asleep.

36
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:51,775
[coughing]

37
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:53,483

[EICHI coughing]

39
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,983
[TORI]
President! Are you okay?

40
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,483
Oh my gosh! What's wrong?

41
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,400
Nothing, I'm fine.

42
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:02,650
Are not.

43
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,858
It's not uncommon
to get sick in the winter.

44
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,608
Better than last year.

45
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,733
I spent Christmas alone
in a hospital room.

46
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,817
I've been careful this year.

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,108
We also have the Starlight
Festival to prepare for.

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,400
Anyway, I'm good.

49
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:20,192
What do you have there?

50
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:21,358
Actually, that's something

51
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,942
I've been excited
to talk to you about!

52
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,233
Here!

53
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,442
[EICHI]
Hm?

54
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:02,692
[HOKUTO] The Starlight
Festival--a winter S1.

55
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,692
It's like a one-day
celebration concert

56
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,608
that's entirely
Christmas themed.

57
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,025
That sounds sparkly!

58
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,192
[ANZU] The student council
president thought of it.

59
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,733
I bet it could also double as

60
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,733
a send-off party for
Trickstar, couldn't it?

61
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:15,900
What d'you think?

62
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,150
[ANZU]
Sure.

63
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,317
The prelims are
a sudden-death tournament.

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,983
So the remaining
units will perform

65
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,025
in the send-off
portion at night.

66
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,567
Cuts will be made.

67
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,650
And the winners of the prelims
will close out the entire show.

68
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:29,858
Hey, wake up!

69
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:33,192
You don't just get to
relax any time you want!

70
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:36,150
I'm too comfortable.
I'm about to fall asleep.

71
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,358
[IZUMI]
Kuma, move. You're in my way.

72
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:42,150
Can't help it.
I was born with long legs.

73
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,567
Is that the scarf
you mentioned?

74
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,692
I want to make sure Yuu feels
supported at his next event.

75
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:51,067
He's participating in the SS
as the academy's representative!

76
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,108
So cheeky.

77
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,900
Come on, you guys, let's go!

78
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,483
[LEO]
Okay, okay. Stop yelling.

79
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:59,108
I'll compose our new song
for the StaFes. Calm down.

80
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:02,192
Oh, really, you will? Awesome!

81
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,067
We're going to blow those
worthless samurai away

82
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,567
even if we hum the entire thing!

83
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,650
There's not gonna be a star

84
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,567
on top of that
Christmas tree for long,

85
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,567
because the Knights
are going to take it!

86
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,150
Just because I've always
wanted it! That's why! [laughs]

87
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,400
[HOKUTO] Isara, don't you
have student council work

88
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,608
you're supposed to be doing?

89
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,025
Sure don't.

90
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:24,775
Believe it or not, AKATSUKI
and the Christmas spirit

91
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,275
really don't mix well together.

92
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,317
I'll take over your stage
crew duties so you can focus.

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
You don't need any
distractions right now.

94
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,608
So yeah.

95
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,733
I'm going to work harder, too!

96
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,525
We're grateful for that.

97
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,275
Also, this shows how much

98
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,942
everybody's counting
on us to win it all.

99
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,900
We never would've expected
this before the revolution.

100
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:46,067
Although, I feel kind of guilty.

101
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,608
Should we accept
their encouragement

102
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:48,983
and then just leave?

103
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,858

President?

111
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:10,192
[EICHI] I see, so that
proposal he gave me earlier.

112
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:13,942
[YUZURU]
Yes, we designed it together.

113
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,358
[TORI]
Okay, that's fine.

114
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,942
Trickstar can be the
SS representatives.

115
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,650
However, I still
want to prove that

116
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,067
fine is a better
and stronger unit!

117
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,775
All right. How so?

118
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,567
[TORI]
Quiet!

119
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,275
During the DDD, the president
always considered me a burden.

120
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:33,067
But I've improved since then!

121
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,483
I never want to be humiliated
like that ever again!

122
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,900
I was happy he was
showing so much spirit.

123
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,358
That's all that mattered to me.

124
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:46,233
He idolizes fine. To him,
we'll always be the heroes

125
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,275
that reformed this academy.

126
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,775
That proposal was like a toy box

127
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,733
filled with all
his favorite things.

128

[TORI crying]

129
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:57,900
[EICHI] I know he wants to
shine a holy light onto fine.

130
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,442
But this year's StaFes is

131
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:02,025
basically a send-off
for Trickstar.

132
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,567
This is their moment.

133
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,733
And we shouldn't do anything
to take that away from them.

134
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,692
In fact, we should all
yield the spotlight.

00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,192
I've been waiting
here for you, Hokuto!

138
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,817
I thought it might
be a nice surprise

139
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,317
to give you my parting
gift a teensy bit early.

140
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,650
[HOKUTO]
Are you serious?

[WATARU]
Mysterious Masked Hokke.

142
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,442
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

143
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,817
Don't give me something
that brings bad luck!

144
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,692
[WATARU laughs]
Well, it is Christmas.

145
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,192
I felt like teasing
my cute junior!

146
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,525
Kidding.

147
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,817
I just wanted to give
you a present, all right?

148
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:47,442
Question: Why did you make
me go on stage that day?

149
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:48,942
[WATARU]
Hm?

150
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:52,775
I was upset, and my desire
for revenge was growing strong.

151
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,983
That anger is what
led to the revolution.

152
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,733
Then at the DDD,
you withdrew your own side

153
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:02,400
from the competition, and
indirectly supported our cause.

154
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:06,108
It was you that planted
the seed of our rebellion.

155
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,442
I don't deserve such credit.

156
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,317
[HOKUTO] You held us
in the palm of your hand

157
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,025
and manipulated us,
and it pisses me off.

158
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,233
If you want something
done that badly,

159
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,525
then you need to take the lead.

160
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,858
[WATARU sighs]

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,817
[WATARU] The thing is, I love
playing all sorts of roles.

162
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,150
So it's easy for me to let
those who want the lead have it.

163
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,525
It's fun to share that
kind of joy with someone!

164
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:34,108
If nowhere else,
then at least on the stage!

165
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,192
[HOKUTO grunts]

166
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,483
[WATARU]
I had a dream back then.

167
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,317
And it came true. I'm good.

168
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,650
You're overthinking. Let it go.

169
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,150
[EICHI]
Wait. What did you just say?

170
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,567
I'll say it one more time.

171
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,733
We don't care that we won!

172
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,942
Trickstar yields all
rights gained from the DDD.

173
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,858
We won't compete in the SS as
Yumenosaki's representatives!

174
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,900
And yes, all of
Trickstar is in agreement.

175
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,192
So you're running away?

176
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,692
I wouldn't mess
around if I were you!

177
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,608
That's not what that means.

178
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,858
And besides, this
is only temporary--

179
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,942
just like what
you did at the DDD.

180
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,317
[gasps]

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,275
[HOKUTO] The winners of
the first part of the StaFes

182
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:26,400
will earn the right to
participate in the SS.

183
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,942
So you...

184
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,942
We'll only compete
if we win StaFes--fairly.

185
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:35,025
We deserve to prove that we're
fit to represent our school.

186
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,025
This is how we'll
show our determination

187
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,192
and gratitude to all
who support our send-off!

188
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:45,650
[gasps] That sounds amazing!

189
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,067
What a delightfully
exciting surprise attack!

190
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,400
It pleases me to praise
you for the very first time!

191
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:55,358
Merry Christmas!
I can't wait to see what

192
00:09:55,442 --> 00:10:00,358
Christmas miracles
you have planned! [laughs]

193
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:17,025
[ANZU] After that, word spread
like wildfire throughout school.

194
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:20,025
[laughing] Yeah! Hear that?

195
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,775
That's what I'm talkin' about!

196
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,817
Let's do this!

197
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,025
[CROWD cheering]

198
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,483
You hear that crowd?

199
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,025
It sounds pretty exciting
out there, don't you agree?

200
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,317
That's Yuu for ya,
so cheeky.

201
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,817
Like you don't
enjoy it. Come on.

202
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,692
I'm glad Trickstar got fired up
enough to participate in this.

203
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:47,233
Well, it's the chance of a
lifetime--why wouldn't they?

204
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,400
'Kay!

205
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,150
Let's go, Knights! We'll bring
them down, fast as lightning!

206
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:04,233
[CROWD cheering]

[CROWD cheers]

208
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:39,483
Yes! Everything appears
to be going smoothly.

209
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:43,108
All right! I'll be following
you for the second half.

210
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:46,067
That so? You're a Knight,
too, aren't you?

211
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,150
Keep fighting head-on, Suou!

212
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,733
Suou?

213
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,650
[ARASHI]
Hello? Is that you, Mika?

214
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,733
What's wrong?

215
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,900
I don't know yet.

216
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,942
I'm worried about Teach.
I can't get in touch with him.

217
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,567
He's been overworking himself
a lot and got sick recently.

218
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,817
[ARASHI]
I'm so sorry. King, should we--

219
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,608
Yeah! I'd love to go
and help look for him.

220
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:11,942
[ARASHI gasps]

221
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,358
When was the last time we
even saw Shu at school?

222
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,483
[LEO] I can't wait to see
how he's improved over time,

223
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,358
so I can feel as
vexed as possible.

224
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:22,483
I love being reminded of his
tenacity and how he beat me.

225
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,400
Man, he's such a genius!

226
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,233
I admire your optimism.

[SHU]

229
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,525
Valkyrie... My early life...

230
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,817
Please stop slipping
through my hands.

231
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,358
Can't stay awake.

232
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,692
You're just as
intriguing as always.

00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,067
How's it goin'?

234
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,650

What's happening to me?
Am I still dreaming?

236
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,858
Uh, no, this is cold, hard life.

Yeah, we found him.

Get back soon.

It looks like things are about
to get pretty crazy around here.

244
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,775
[MIKA]
What do you think you're doing?!

245
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:12,525
Why're you wearing
a Valkyrie outfit?

246
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:16,942
I just figured if I help,
you can avoid losing by default.

247
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,525
That's not yours to wear!
Take it off! Right now!

248
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,692
Teach put every ounce of
his soul into making that!

249
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,608
And you have no right to
put it on without permission!

250
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,942
You've done nothing
to earn that privilege!

251
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,483
You weren't there when
we were at our lowest!

252
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,650
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,108
You're right.

254
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,817
I won't argue with you.

255
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,275
Even though I've
always been a singer,

256
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,192
I've never been good with words.

257
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,983
I struggled with them even
before my voice changed.

258
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,525
And still,

259
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:50,650
Teach treated me like I was
a talented and respected idol--

260
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,983
just like you.

261

[gasps]

262
00:14:56,608 --> 00:15:00,358
[MIKA] So does that mean
Ra*bits is okay with it?

263
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,733
Yeah.

264
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,775
They were the ones
who suggested it first.

265
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,108
Huh?

266
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,525
We don't always
want to be protected.

267
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,692
We're gonna prove that we can

268
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,108
take on this big,
bad world on our own!

269
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:15,192
And this way, you won't
be worrying about us later!

That's how it went.

00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:49,608
I'll have good luck?

319
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,483
[MAO] Oh, no.
I gotta go wake up Ritsu.

320
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:53,942
[SUBARU, MAO]
Uh?

321
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,317
[TRICKSTAR MEMBERS gasp]

322
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,108
Hi there! Who'd
like some morning tea?

323
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,483
[TRICKSTAR MEMBERS, ANZU]
No, thank you!

324
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:03,275
[SUBARU]
You've gotta be kidding me!

325
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:04,900
It was supposed
to be a short break!

326
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,150
How did this happen?

327
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,692
Why didn't we set an alarm?

328
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,650
We slept way too late!

329
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:10,567
[ANZU]
I'm sorry!

330
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,233
It's not your fault, Anzu!

331
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:13,692
We were all exhausted!

332
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:17,067
Now's not the time
to talk about it! [gasps]

333
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,483
[SUBARU]
Hurry up!

334
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,233
[CROWD cheering]

335
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,192
[ANZU]
What we saw was incredible.

336
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:46,775
Hey!

337
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,233
So glad you finally
made it, Trickstar!

338
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:52,525
Some might say it's
arrogant to arrive so late.

339
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:54,817
They're all here. But why?

340
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,650
Come on! We're stalling for you!

341
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,650
How much longer do
you want them to wait?

342
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,192
Ready, go!

343
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:06,317
[ALL]
Congrats on your win, Trickstar!

344
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,733
[CROWD cheers]

345
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,275
[SUBARU gasps]

346
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,108
[KEITO]
According to the count,

347
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,608
Trickstar is in first place
for the preliminaries,

348
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,275
and that's the fair
and undeniable truth.

349
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:19,317
So you're the new Yumenosaki
Academy representatives?

350
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,067
What are you guys
waiting for? Get up here!

351
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,317
[TRICKSTAR MEMBERS chuckle]

352
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,858
[CROWD cheers]

353
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,817
Master Eichi?

354
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,192
Is this...?

355
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,817
[EICHI] What?
A humble Christmas present?

356
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,733
Yes. Well, it's actually
more like an apology.

357
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,358
What?

358
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,942
I let my personal feelings
affect your proposal.

359
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,900
It triggered
a dark part of myself

360
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:56,192
that I wasn't ready to face yet.

361
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,525
So I pushed it away.

362
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,275
Yes, I know that.

363
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:03,025
But don't worry,

364
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:06,067
I know I'm still very far
off from being your equal.

365
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,400
Although, one day I'll be strong
enough, and I'll support you!

366
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,192
[exhales, inhales]

367
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:22,150
[EICHI] I can breathe
again without straining.

368
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,817
Amazing.

369
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,733
It feels like I'm
in a dream I once had.

370
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,192
[EICHI] Congratulations
to our new representatives.

371
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,733
It's my pleasure to
entrust my wishes to you.
