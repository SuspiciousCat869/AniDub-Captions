00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,275
[SAGAMI]
Homeroom's officially over.

2
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:14,233
Congrats, everyone.
Summer break starts tomorrow.

3
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,775
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

4
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:17,233
But I guess it
doesn't really make

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,983
any difference for you guys.

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:20,525
That's the truth.

7
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:23,858
This summer feels completely
different than it did last year.

8
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,692
[MAKOTO] Maybe it's because
the revolution was a success,

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:29,358
but everyone seems
super motivated now!

10
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:31,317
[HOKUTO] Yeah. It's the
best time to level up,

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,817
if you think about it.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,942
People in summer-only events
are hard at work in lessons.

13
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:39,025
And some people are working
part-time jobs at school, too.

14
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:40,567
As for us,

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,025
we're gonna be competing in
the SS and Trickstar's ready.

16
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:46,317
We're going above
and beyond for sure.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,858
Yeah, we'll be representing
the whole academy!

--[SUBARU] Ukki!
--[MAKOTO yelps]

19
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,942
Don't let your nerves get
you all tensed up again!

20
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,942
Everything you said is true.

21
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,608
But, still, we can't forget:
it's supposed to be fun, right?

22
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,025
--[MAKOTO] Right!
--[HOKUTO] You bet!

[phone chimes]

24
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:04,442
[ANZU]
Huh?

25
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:37,400
[ANZU]
Ah, summer vacation.

26
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,275
Here we are, a few days in.

27
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:41,567
Um, Hiyori?

28
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,400
Man, where are you?

29
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:44,900
And who else is it?

30
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:48,483
Oh, Sazanami?
Are either of you around?

31
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,775
[MAKOTO]
Hmm? Hey, hold on.

32
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,983
You're Aoba from
Switch, aren't you?

33
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,025
What on earth
are you doing here?

34
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,400
Ah, you're Yuuki from Trickstar.

35
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:59,150
Isn't it obvious?
I'm looking for these guys.

36
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,483
[MAKOTO] Oh, cool, is
this for the Summer Live?

37
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,400
[TSUMUGI] Yep. They asked me if
I would be their official guide.

38
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:08,692
We agreed to meet, but they're
late and nowhere to be found.

39
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:09,567
--[phone rings]
--[TSUMUGI] Oh.

40
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,275
Excuse me for a sec.

41
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,483
Yes, hello, there.

42
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,733
This Hiyori?

43
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,108
Hey, where are you? What?!

44
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,692
Is now really the time to
be stopping for baked goods?

45
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,525
[HIYORI]
There's no way I could resist.

46
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,275
Look, I'll head
straight to the academy.

47
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:24,817
No need to wait for me.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,858
You can't just go wandering
around on your own like this!

49
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,608
I hope you know I haven't
forgotten the time

50
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,108
you ditched me and went
shopping all night long!

51
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:32,983
[phone beeps]

52
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,900
Huh?

53
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:37,025
[ANZU]
Two guesses where he went.

54
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,317
[MAKOTO]
Got enough?

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,275
Oh, wow, you're probably right.

56
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:42,067
Thank you for the tip!

57
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,233
Later. Good luck with that!

58
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,858
It's good to see you.

59
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,442
So where are you headed
with all of that bread?

60
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,817
[ANZU]
The theme park.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,650
[MAKOTO]
Well, it is summer vacation!

62
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,233
Oh, it's for work.

63
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,608
See?

64
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,775
Huh? Since the recent
hero show your group put on

65
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,525
was so well received,
our theme park would like to

66
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,733
plan further events
featuring you.

67
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:06,900
We think a summer idol concert
will increase park visitors.

68
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,275
What do you guys
think about this?

69
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,275
[YUTA]
Let's do it!

70
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,525
Hey, Big Bro!

71
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,275
How would you feel about
leaving all the planning

72
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,483
for this one to me?

73
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,733
I mean, that depends.
Think you can do it?

74
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:17,233
Yeah, c'mon, trust me!

75
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,483
So, then, Sakuma,

76
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,275
can I be in charge of planning?

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,650
Yeah, sure, do
whatever you want.

78
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,858
[HINATA, YUTA chuckle]

79
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:26,442
Aw, yeah!

80
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,192
'Bout time 2wink went out there
and made a name for ourselves!

81
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:35,150
I have no business sticking
my nose into all that anyway.

82
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,192
I leave my beloved children
in your capable hands.

83
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:40,025
[YUTA, HINATA]
Hm-hm.

84
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,150
[REI]
Nap time.

85
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,983
[MAKOTO] Ah, that's why
you're going up there.

86
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,650
[ANZU]
Yep. So what're you doing?

87
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,692
Oh, I'm gonna head to
the school after this.

88
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:49,983
We're having a planning meeting

89
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,067
about the Summer Live
in a little bit.

90
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,733
Wait, the "Summer Live"?

91
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,442
Oh, no! Surely this
isn't the first

92
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,775
you're hearing of all that?

93
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,858
Uh, I have the proposal.
Let me just dig that out.

94
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,608
Ah! Found it!

95
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,442
[EICHI]
Good grief.

96
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:08,983
Always one to keep people
waiting, isn't that right?

97
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,942
Would you like a cup of tea?

98
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,525
No, thank you.

99
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,358
I have no way of knowing
what you might put in it.

100
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,108
There's no need
to be so on-guard.

101
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,942
I'm not your adversary
this time, after all.

102
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,525
[HOKUTO grunts]

103
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,692
I genuinely want to
help you out, I promise!

104
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,942
That's the reason I planned
the Summer Live to begin with--

105
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,650
to give you all some extra
practice for the upcoming SS.

106
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,650
Competing against another
school's powerhouse

107
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,525
will do just that, right?

108
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:41,067
I do wonder what's keeping
Hiyori. He's so late.

109
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,025
I haven't heard the slightest
peep from Tsumugi, either.

110
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,525
Wait, Hiyori?

111
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,400
[EICHI] Yes, you're
going to be performing

112
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,858
with him at the Summer Live.

113
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,650
Perhaps you remember him?

114
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:55,108
He's was once a
Yumenosaki Academy student.

115
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:56,650
[HOKUTO]
Hmm?

116
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,567
[EICHI] And one of the former
fine's two star performers.

117
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,317
Tomoe Hiyori.

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,567
Don't tell me
you've forgotten him.

121
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,692
Oh, I see.

122
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,817
So this is what their
unit is called, then?

123
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,317
Eve is a good name.

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,483
[EICHI]
Yes.

125
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,192
And they're an integral
part of the group

126
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,275
expected to win the SS.

127
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,067
A group called Eden.

128
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,692
They're a masterpiece, honestly.

129
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:22,150
[ANZU]
Huh?

130
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,150
The two groups are called
Adam and Eve by themselves,

131
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,317
but they're called Eden when
they combine into one group!

132
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,900
It's kinda awesome, actually.

133
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,317
They're like a giant robot!

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,858
Eden is Trickstar's most
formidable opponent, for sure.

135
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,942
But for the Summer Live, only
the two from Eve are coming--

136
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,858
not all four of them.

137
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,775
So it's really just
a joint concert?

138
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,608
Yeah, that's why I'm not
quite as nervous about it.

139

--[JUN] Hey.

Is there some way
I can be of help to you?

143

Some way you can
be of help to me...

144
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,483
I think that should be obvious.

After all, we are dealing
with money here.

Are you trying to rob me
or something, mister?

like the opposite.

it earlier, that's all.

it back, don't'cha?

appreciate that.

Are you a member of Eden?

160
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:44,567
Or, hold on, more
specifically, you're in Eve!

161
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,858
[JUN] That's right.
My name's Sazanami Jun.

162
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,567
Nice to meet ya.

163
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,483
I see how it is, though.

164
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,900
You haven't done much
research about us, have you?

165
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:58,442
And I took time out of my busy
schedule to come down here.

166
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,692
[MAKOTO] Why's this guy
in such a bad mood?

167
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,525
Is he like this all the time?

Oh. 'Course Ohiisan

170
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,233
I guess I'll be
seeing ya around.

Yeah, yeah, whaddaya want?

172

[MAKOTO]
If I'm not mistaken,

176
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,483
Eden sings the theme for that
game in their combined form.

177
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,983
You have researched.

178
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,400
Kinda.

179
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,358
I was in the Game Research
Club so, yes, technically.

180
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,942
It's one of the more
relaxed, easy-going clubs.

181
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,900
I still pop in occasionally.

182
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:38,358
There used to be this one guy
in it--an amazing upperclassman.

183
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,775
You could even
call him legendary.

184
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,567
Rumor is, that upperclassman

185
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,733
is actually the one
who developed this game.

186
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,358
Would it be cool if
I gave it a quick try?

187
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,192
[ANZU]
Sure!

188
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,775

Welcome, Challenger!

playing as yourself?

[MAKOTO gasps]

193
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,150
No one would know it
by the way you look,

194
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,692
but you've got some guts.

195
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:08,108
It's just a coincidence.
I didn't pick me, I swear!

Well, I gladly
accept the challenge.

197

Let's do this, then.

198
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,858
It's almost like we're being
forced onto the same path

[EICHI]
Listen, Hokuto.

204
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:27,233
Even if it's motivated
by hostility or hate,

205
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,400
you must make
sure Eve's serious,

206
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:32,233
and you'd better make it
happen by the Summer Live.

207
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,775
[HOKUTO]
Hmm.

208
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,317
That way we'll see
how to beat Eden,

209
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,483
even if we only
know about one half.

210

I get it.

211
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,150

been waiting for.

you're still alive.

you're sincere.

Ah, well, I don't care.

I'm no longer in
fine, after all.

222
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,358
Therefore, you're not
someone who matters to me

223

in one way or another anymore!

224

Now you've upset me.
How callous.

Where's Tsumugi, by the way?

[HIYORI]
Oh, him?

227
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,817
I requested that he carry
my luggage to the hotel.

brought his pet, Bloody Mary.

Although you guys didn't
seem very interesting,

you think I could have it?

enough, but yeah, okay.

is all right for you,

The air conditioner in my
coffin is on the fritz lately,

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,108
so I came here in search
of cooler temperatures.

don't you two have a joint
lesson with Eve this afternoon?

268

Don't eat too much or your
lunch is going to come back up.

know about that?

now that I know everything

272
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,525
there is to know about
Yumenosaki Academy?

273
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,275
So, um, could you maybe
give us some information?

Hm?

275

Would you happen to know
anything about that group Eve?

276
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,442
Tomoe, one of their members,
used to be a student

277
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,567
here at Yumenosaki Academy.

278
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,567
I tried doing some research
on him in the records room.

279
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,900
But I couldn't find
anything on him at all.

scoop on your rival?

00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:37,983
I can't help it.

If you really want to know more,

then I would go
talk to Sakasaki.

He's persistent when it
comes to gathering information.

Particularly when there's
been some sort of cover-up.

00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,025
But he's so busy.

289
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:52,900
All Natsume has time for
is his fortune-telling work.

290
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:55,650
I barely even
see him these days.

If we were to work
down on your level,

we'd end up looking subpar,

that Trickstar can be
beneficial in some way.

315
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:50,817
But if you're not careful,

316
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,650
he'll use you till
there's nothing left.

317
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,775
[HOKUTO]
Tomoe, sir!

318
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:57,483
[HIYORI]
Oh? Hidaka?

319
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,983
That's your name, yes?

320
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,983
I thought you looked
familiar somehow.

321
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,317
Aren't you our teacher,
Mr. Hidaka's son?

322
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,817
Your teacher?

323
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,858
[HIYORI]
He is your dad, right?

324
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:10,608
He's incredibly busy
with his career as an idol,

325
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,567
but he still finds
the time to drop by

326
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,608
Reimei Academy to teach.

327
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:17,525
[HOKUTO] Even though Yumenosaki
Academy is his alma mater,

328
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,025
he teaches at its rival school.

329
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:23,442
Which means that you, literally
the son of a former top idol,

330
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,400
will perform with his students.

331
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:26,900
Perform?

332
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,942
No, I think the SS will be
more like a fight to the death.

333
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,192
[HOKUTO grunts]

334
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,650
Well, we were bound
to compete someday.

335
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:37,317
But that would just be
a major pain, so no thanks!

336
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,567
I only want to think positively!

337
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,150
I seek out that which is pure
and essential to my own success!

338
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:46,817
That's ideal,
the perfect Hiyori!

339
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,483
Sorry, I don't get it.

340
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,525
I suppose it's inevitable, then.

341
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,275
If we must compete,
we'll give our all.

342
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:56,400
And we will surely win.
I have no doubt.

343
00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:59,317
[HIYORI]
I almost forgot!

344
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,233
I brought some lovely quiches!

345
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,733
I got so many different kinds,

346
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,400
why don't we
enjoy them together?

347
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,400
Eichi, how about
a nice pot of tea?

348
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:07,942
Oh, and the salmon is
my absolute favorite,

349
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,233
so don't get any ideas.
I will not share!

350
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:15,025
Yes, of course. As you
like it, right, Hiyori?

351
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,858
[HOKUTO]
What's with this guy?

352
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,983
Is he for real?

353
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:22,608
But he's a former fine
member, so it makes sense.

354
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,817
[MAKOTO] Man, I guess
I got really into it!

355
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,775
Ya know, you're more aggressive
than I would've expected.

356
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,983
Oh, really? That's funny.

357
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,108
You're a lot more polite
than I would've guessed.

358
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:38,067
Did you call me polite?

359
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,067
Guilty.

360
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,775
Our school's pretty serious
about proper decorum,

361
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,192
so if you're not polite, you
get singled out very quickly.

362
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,358
This other guy in
my group, Ohiisan,

363
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,900
I guess you could call
him a handful. [sighs]

364
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:55,525
I'm basically at his
beck and call 24/7.

365
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,983
Today felt almost like
a vacation from all that.

366
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,442
I could relax.

367
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,317
Heh. Hey, listen, I'm sorry
for actin' weird earlier.

368
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,358
No sweat! It turned
out great in the end!

369
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,275
And, well, I'm glad I
could be of help somehow.

370
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,733
Yeah, you really were.

371
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:13,442
Ya know, it's not very
often that I play games.

372
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:14,775
He told me to play a little

373
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:17,733
and then post about it
on social media and stuff.

374
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,275
But you made it more fun.

375
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,192
Oh, so you mean you were doing
that to help with publicity?

376
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,775
Good for you! That's
what I call commitment!

377
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,275
[MAKOTO]
What a relief.

378
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,608
I was a little unsure
of him at first.

379
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,525
But I think we'll
get along just fine.

380
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,525
[ANZU] Meanwhile,
over at the theme park.

381
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,525
[BOTH]
Here we go!

382
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,442
I hope we can get along!

383
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:42,942
Yeah, I hope so, too!

384
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,442
Who would have thought?

385
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:45,900
I can't believe
we got the chance

386
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:48,400
to do a concert
here with Ra*bits!

387
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,817
Oh, wow, so sweet and delicious!

388
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,567
Here, try it, Tomoya.

389
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,358
Ahh.

390
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,567
This makes me feel
a little bit awkward.

391
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,567
Why? Nothing weird here.
Hurry, before it melts.

392
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,567
That's so good!

393
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,858
Quick, you try it!

394
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:08,692
[TOMOYA, HAJIME gasp]

395
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,442
Wow!

396
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,275
[TOMOYA] Aw, man.
You ate almost the whole thing.

397
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,317
Your unit gets along so well.

398
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,650
It's really nice.

399
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,150
Well, 2wink seems to be
just as close as they are.

400
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,900
I mean, you are twins.

401
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:20,733
[YUTA]
I guess.

402
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:22,233
But it gets old sometimes,

403
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,567
how Big Bro always accepts
gigs that sell us as a twin act.

404
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,442
We even did a live
performance recently

405
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,692
that had us doing a silly
"cloning technique."

406
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:34,233
[laughs] I guess 2wink
has its share of troubles.

407
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,275
If we keep coasting
on the twin thing,

408
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,317
we won't reach
our full potential.

409
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,275
That's it!

410
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,858
At the next concert,

411
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,525
I'm gonna open a whole
new frontier for 2wink!

412
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,900
That's right, Yuta.
And as your brother,

413
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,025
I'll be rooting for you
every step of the way.

414
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,567
Hey, want some bread?

415
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,775
Big Sis went out of her way
to bring it here to all of us!

416
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,650
[HINATA]
Thanks, but no thanks!

417
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,483
You okay?

418
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,067
Is something the matter?

419
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,817
I was just wondering
if Jin Sagami is around.

420
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,233
Are you a big fan
of Mister Sagami's?

421
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,858
He retired from idol
life a while back.

422
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:14,275
But he was one of the
top idols for a long time!

423
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:15,233
Oh!

424
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:16,942
Hey, you two, what's up?

425
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:20,275
Ukki! Oh, uh, and
who's that with you?

426
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,608
He's Sazanami Jun, from Eve.

427
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:25,275
I happened to run into him
in front of the station.

428
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:26,692
[JUN]
Hi, nice to meet you.

429
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,275
[SUBARU laughs]
Same to you!

430
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,067
Our joint lesson is gonna
be in here, isn't it?

431
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,942
[MAO]
Yeah, supposedly.

432
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,442
But I don't think we
should interrupt right now.

433
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,608
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

434
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,108
[HOKUTO]
Something feels off.

435
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,650
Like he's trying to
mess me up on purpose.

436
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:49,108
And also, this choreography is
supposed to be for four people,

437
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,608
but here I am,
dancing all alone.

438
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:54,525
It'll look weird,
like something's missing.

439
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,442
Does dancing alone
always feel so bad?

440
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,358
I can tell just by watching.

441
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,067
Trickstar uses their
friendship as a crutch, huh?

442
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,942
[HOKUTO grunts]

443
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,525
If you can't stand on your own,

444
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:08,275
then you'll be a failure,
no matter what you do!

445
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:09,108
[HOKUTO gasps]

446
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,733
Not that you can help it.

447
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,192
You're still in the process
of evolving as a performer,

448
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,817
so I'll cut you some slack.

449
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,650
[HOKUTO] He adjusted
my movement while dancing

450
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:17,942
and didn't miss a beat!

451
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:21,608
So here's to unity!
And to teamwork!

452
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:25,067
The power of friendship!

453
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,775
Those words sound
beautiful when said aloud,

454
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,067
but there's nothing more
hideous than weak creatures

455
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,317
turning into parasites
of one another.

456
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,275
And you'll find no
greater meaning than when

457
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,025
each individual member strives

458
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,150
to be the best
version of themselves!

459
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,567
[HOKUTO] He's eccentric,
to say the least,

460
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,942
but he does have a point.

461
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,483
And, besides, his performance
hasn't lost energy,

462
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,858
even though he's been talking.

463
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,900
The direction of his body
and gaze, his presence--

464
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,983
his entire being is reaching
toward the audience.

465
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,275
This is Tomoe Hiyori's world!

466
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,233
Is this what the former star
players of fine are like?

467
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:01,025
It's no wonder they made it to
the top of Yumenosaki Academy.

468
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,400
What's the matter?

469
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,567
Come at me with
everything you've got!

470
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,108
Whether you're an underling
or just a side character,

471
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:10,608
I don't discriminate.

472
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,942
If you're onstage, I'll make
sure to use you efficiently.

473
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:17,400
Do your best! Do your worst!
Come on, Trickstar!

474
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,067
Hokke isn't the only member
of Trickstar, ya know!

475
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,108
Whoopsie!

476
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:24,192
--[SUBARU yelling]
--[crash]

477
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:25,858
You've got lots of energy!

478
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,067
Akehoshi, are you all right?

479
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,317
Jun, you're late!

480
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,733
How dare you?

481
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,650
I cannot believe that you
forced me, your superior,

482
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,358
to break into enemy
territory all by myself!

483
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,192
What on earth were
you thinking?!

484
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,733
If I remember correctly,
you're the one who ditched me,

485
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,608
because you went shopping
and lost track of time.

486
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,733
And this isn't enemy territory.

487
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,692
We came here to work, remember?

488
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,233
You should be on your best
behavior, in my opinion,

489
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,775
Ohiisan.

490
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,525
Are we all finally here?

491
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,942
Then now's the time.

492
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,192
[SUBARU]
Mm?

493
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,567
Let's start the lesson
after we do one song.

494
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,733
[HIYORI, JUN]
Hmm?

495
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,108
[HOKUTO]
Tomoe.

496
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,192
You're about to witness
Trickstar's real potential,

497
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,317
now that all four
of us are together.

498
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,858
Take notes, and feel free
to point out anything

499
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:08,275
that doesn't meet
your standards.

500
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,192
We're not so weak that
we'll allow ourselves

501
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:13,067
to be destroyed by our
own refusal to evolve.

502
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,067
We'll make you recognize that
we're equals and colleagues!

503
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,442
We'll compete,

504
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:21,483
even if we're up against
the reigning top idol group.

505
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,275
[HIYORI] Heh. You're
acting so much tougher

506
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,942
now that your three friends
are here to back you up.

507
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:29,608
I'm dying to see your
true abilities, Trickstar!

508
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:32,108
Show me what you've got!

509
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:35,067
Now, we'll sing! All together!

510
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,817
I want to see your love! I want
to feel the love in your music!

511
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:18,567
[ANZU] Meanwhile, in a place
yet unknown to the rest of us.

512
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,192
[applause]

513
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,567
What did ya think, Leo?
How was it?

514
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,192
Do you feel a little better now?

515
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,608
I do.

516
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,150
Thank you for that, Mikeji Mama.

517
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:34,567
For a genius like me to not
present my new composition,

518
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,483
and instead waste
my time on pranks

519
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,900
is a huge loss for
the entire world!

520
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:44,983
[LEO laughing]
