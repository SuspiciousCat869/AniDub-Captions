00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:22,900
...Valkyrie.

160
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:26,525
This show invites the audience
to bask in Teach's world.

161
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,233
No flirting with or
flattering the audience.

162
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:33,400
Raw performance,
without compromise.

163
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,525
[SHU] Focus, Nito.
You're not concentrating.

164
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,775
You're always point-four
seconds behind everyone else.

165
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,025
This is a prerecorded song.

166
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,108
All you have to do is dance.

167
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:45,275
This isn't like you at all.
What's going on tonight?

168
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,858
[NAZUNA gasps]

169
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,733
[SHU] I am the creator of all
things, a god holding the end

170
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,733
of every puppet string
in this world.

171
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,067
I wonder...

172
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,567
Why is it that people
do not realize that dolls

173
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,108
are far superior to humans?

174
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:00,525
[NAZUNA] Ever since my
voice started changing,

175
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:03,358
I haven't been able to sing in
the range that Teach expects.

176
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,817
So he stopped
considering me a singer.

177
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,567
He has me lip-sync
through every concert.

178
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,775
I've been forbidden
from signing on stage.

179
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:14,483
And now, I'm nothing
more than a marionette.

180
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,817
Teach pulls the
strings and I dance.

181

[KEITO]
Itsuki Shu, second year.

182
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,192
He's an absolute leader.

183
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,983
He conceptualizes and
reviews everything himself

184
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,567
from the unit's
songs and costumes

185
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,233
to their choreography
and set design.

186
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,692
Nito Nazuna, second year.

187
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,525
He was discovered in a choir.

188
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,942
A soprano with a voice
like an angel's.

189
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,567
He's the main
attraction of the unit.

190
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,192
Kagehira Mika, first year.

191
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,942
He draws people in with
his mismatched eyes.

192
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,692
Other than that, he has
no special skills.

193
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:49,025
This is Valkyrie.

194
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,275
They are currently the unit

195
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,067
reigning at the top
of the school.

196
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,025
Although, They may be faltering.

197
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,692
[MIKA] I thought we killed it
during that show, didn't you?

198
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,900
I turned on the hot
water for the bath.

199
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,067
After today, we all need one--

200
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,692
I'm going up to
fix our costumes.

201
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,442
Everyone stay out.

[ARASHI]
Mika! Hey!

204
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,567
You scared the crap
outta me, Naruchan!

205
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,817
I think my heart may have
stopped for a second.

206
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,358
You look okay to me!

Oh, ew! I take it back!

208
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,483
Looks like you're bleeding!

209
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,608
[MIKA] Am I? Wonder
how that happened.

210
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,108
It's my fault! I'm sorry!

211
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,233
It's fine, I'll just
suck on it a little.

212
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,817
That won't work!
You need a doctor!

213
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,817
[SAGAMI]
There. How do you feel?

214
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,317
Better. Thank you so much!

215
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,942
We couldn't have done this
without you! Mr. Kunugi!

216
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,233
Huh?

217
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,608
All right, please get back
to your classes now.

218
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,358
School isn't out just yet.

219
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,858
He's so indifferent and so cool!

220
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,983
Hey, uh. You okay there?

221
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,942
[ARASHI] I wanna buy you
dessert for what happened.

222
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,108
Get whatever you want.

223
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,025
I've been meaning to ask you.

224
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,275
Did you get invited to join

225
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,442
some crazy-extreme
unit recently?

226
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,108
I wouldn't call them extreme,

227
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,608
but they are really
passionate about their work.

228
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,233
They remind me
of the Shinsengumi,

229
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,567
because they'll cut
you left and right

230
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,650
if you mess with them
or their members!

231
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,317
That's considered violence
in some countries.

232
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,733
I don't like living by
other people's rules.

233
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,150
So I may actually
lay low for a while.

234
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,108
'Kay, but if you ever
need anything out there,

235
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,358

Now. Let's get you
something delish!

my own, actually.

[ARASHI]
Is that candy?

240
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,275
[MIKA] Mm-hm! Teach is always
saying it's part of his duty

241
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:44,275
to make sure I stay
healthy so I can perform

242
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:45,650
the way he wants me to.

243
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,442
He expects nothing less
than perfect performances.

244
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,942
So he makes food for me.

245
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,900
Which is how he ensures that
I'm always in good health!

246
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,233
[ARASHI]
Oh, my!

247
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,942
It's also why I can't grab
some dessert with you,

248
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,817
even though that sounds amazing.

249

[ARASHI]
Aw.

250
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:02,317
Also, I just remembered
that sweet Big Bro Nazuna's

251
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,358
birthday is coming up soon.

252
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:07,067
He's an upperclassman
who's in Valkyrie with us.

253
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,483
Oh, my!

254
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,942
[MIKA] I've been making
him a birthday present

255
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,150
but it's taking me longer
than I expected.

256
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,192
Turns out I'm not
that good at sewing.

257
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,525
But it's the thought
that counts, isn't it?

258
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,775
You really love being
in that unit, huh?

259
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,608
Valkyrie, I mean.

260
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,567
I do, so I wish I was better.

261
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,525
I feel like I hold
them back sometimes.

262
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:26,858
But Big Bro Nazuna is perfect!

263
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,317
He can move exactly
the way Teach

264
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,275
tells him to every time!

265
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,108
That may be. But I
wonder if he's happy.

266

Is that all you wanted to say?

[KEITO]
Kiryu, wait.

268
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,317
If you want me to be
like everyone else,

269
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,275
that's not how I roll, man.

270
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:52,275
I'm guessing this means you're
in some kind of trouble.

Itsuki's unit, right?

and I'm the one they
call a cheap thug.

Itsuki and I have
known each other

since we were little brats.

Come on. Man, I'm-- I'm sorry.

Huh? Oh, this? It's a
uniform for our school.

289

They asked me if I could
make an extra one.

290
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,358
Sewing is a talent of mine.

291
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,775
Itsuki's pretty good
at it, too, of course.

292
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:25,275
But my mom's the one who
taught us how to do it.

293
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,692
She'd give us lessons all
the time back in the day.

294
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,900
Before you go, can you pass on
a message to Itsuki for me?

295
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,192
Tell him he should be careful.

296
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,483
There's some shady
stuff goin' on.

297
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,775
[KURO] You both need to
look out for each other.

298
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,858
He's easy to misunderstand,

299
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,358
but trust me,
he's not a bad guy.

300
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:53,775
[KURO]
What's wrong with that kid?

301
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:57,025
Why's he bein' all quiet
and weird? Oh, right.

302
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,858
I wonder if it's because
his voice changed

303
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,900
since the last time
he sang with Valkyrie.

304
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:04,400
I mean, it didn't sound bad.

305
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,775
It was almost seductive.

306
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:10,817
His voice has that kind of
energy that draws people in.

307
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,442
At least to me. Maybe
Itsuki hasn't noticed.

308
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,233
[NAZUNA] It wasn't long after
that the concert system

309
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,025
endorsed by the
student council started

310
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,858
to make itself known.

where units compete

312

on the same stage to see
who's talent is stronger.

313
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,442
Those who were weak had
to leave the school.

314
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,900
And our group, Valkyrie,

315
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,567
was suddenly drawn into
the growing dramatics.

316
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:41,233
[SHU] Kind of unusual for you
to be awake during the day.

317
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,067
Is this a bad omen?

318
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,692
Are you trying to act
like an upperclassman?

319
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,858
If this was anyone else, I
would've hung up already, Rei.

320
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,900
fine? Tenshouin's boys?

321
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,817
I'm not worried about it--
they're no match for Valkyrie.

322
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,733
You can't make a performance pop
just by tossing cash at it.

323
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,650
The stage is where
artists like myself

324
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,692
showcase their sublime works.

325
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,567
Where I can offer up
my very essence

326
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,317
to the rest of the world.

327
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,608
That blueblood has no
right to the stage.

328
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,567
People shouldn't use
wealth to trespass

329
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,733
in a place that's
meant for true art.

330
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:16,483
After all, as idols, they're
only third-rate, right?

331
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,400
So dumb. Anyway,
I appreciate the warning.

332
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm being careful, believe me.

333
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,858
You have a good night.
Thanks again.

334
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,150
[sighs]

335
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,733
[NAZUNA] As of right now,
we are still the top unit

336
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,858
of Yumenosaki Academy.

337
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:37,483
But if something doesn't change,

338
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,733
people are gonna lose
interest in Valkyrie soon.

339
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:43,442
Since we can only use
previous recordings

340
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,358
of my voice before it changed,

341
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:48,442
Valkyrie won't be able
to release any new songs.

342
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,108
There's also a limit to
the arrangements we can do.

343
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,692
[NAZUNA]
That's why...

344
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,400
...I need to train my new voice
until Teach will approve of it.

345
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,233
If he allows me to sing again,

346
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,025
then Valkyrie can continue
to grow and evolve.

347
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,525
We'll stay strong.

348
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,233
And, if that can happen for me,

349
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,900
then maybe there's
a chance that Teach

350
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,192
might start to see Mikachin

351
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:12,233
as more than just
a backup dancer.

352
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,775
He came to this school
because he wanted

353
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:17,233
to be an idol, just
like the rest of us.

354
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:19,775
For now, I might
just be the puppet

355
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:24,358
with a forgotten voice, but
I'll show him I can change.

356
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,692
I have to.

357
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,608
Hey Big Bro, Surprise!

358
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,483
I know it's already May, but
here's your birthday present!

359
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,525
So, happy late birthday!

360
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,192
I made it all by myself!

361
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,108
Thank you.

362
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,442
[MIKA] I know you're used to
wearing clothes made by Teach,

363
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,192
so this probably won't compare,

364
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,942
but tears were shed over it.

365
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,150
Those are padparadscha
sapphires.

366
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,317
[MIKA] The sapphire's your
birthstone, isn't it?

367
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,900
These ones are just
imitations, obviously.

368
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,150
But you can't tell
by looking at them.

369
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,650
I thought they'd be kind
of a good luck charm.

370
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:00,775
[NAZUNA]
Mika.

371
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,817
Huh?

372
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,067
[NAZUNA, crying]
I'm so--

373
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,525
Thank you. I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.

374
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,483
[MIKA]
I'm so sorry, Big Bro Nazuna!

375
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,025
Please forgive me!

376
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,400
[MIKA] I promise I didn't
mean to make you cry!

377
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,692
Are you feeling better?

378
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,858
[door clicks]

379
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,317
[SHU]
What's all the noise about?

380
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,983
Oh, you finally gave it to him?

381
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,192
Can't believe you had
the nerve to gift that

382
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,108
to someone as
a birthday present.

383
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,900
[SHU laughs]

384
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:33,942
I was trying to
hide it from you!

385
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:36,150
What gives? How'd you see?

386
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,483
I'm so embarrassed!

387
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,275
If you didn't want
anyone to see it,

388
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:40,858
then you shouldn't have
left it lying around

389
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,067
in such an obvious location.

390
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,525
You've no one to blame but
your own carelessness.

391
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,442
I know you're right, okay?

392
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,608
Aw... Now that I think about it,

393
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:50,608
there were times
when it looked like

394
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,525
someone else was
sewing it with me!

395
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,733
Oh, my gosh, it was
you, wasn't it?

396
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:57,025
It took you this long
to figure it out?

397
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,317
Did you think you had a fairy
godmother or something?

398
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,025
[MIKA] Aw! It was supposed
to be my birthday present

399
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,692
to Big Bro Nazuna,
and now it's ruined

400
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,650
because I didn't
actually make it myself!

401
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:06,775
This is all your fault!

402
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,067
That was so stupid, Teach!

403
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,817
--Stupid, stupid, stupid!
--[NAZUNA chuckles]

404
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,692
Hey look, he's smiling.

405
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,650
[gasps] I missed it!

406
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,983
It's because you were blocking
my line of vision, you idiot!

407
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,400
[MIKA]
I wasn't blockin' anything!

408
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,067
[SHU] Then how would you
describe what you were doing?

409
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,567
Nito! Did you really
smile for us?

410
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,400
Show it to me, one more time!

411
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,483
Come here.

412
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,192
Show me that beautiful
smile of yours!

413
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,650
I swear, it could
purify the world!

414
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,817
[SHU] Great. You're back to
your usual expressionless self!

415
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,983
This is your fault,
Kagehira! You did this!

416
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:42,192
As punishment, you can go
sell all of these tickets!

417
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,817
Wait, these are all for
our concert? For real?

418
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,150
We've never had to sell
our own tickets before.

419
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,608
Things change, don't they?

420
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,275
I'm not thrilled
about it either.

421
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,067
But we aren't always
going to be at the top,

422
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,275
so we need to learn how
to promote ourselves.

423
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:57,108
Sell every single one of those.

424
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,900
We need to show everyone
what it means to be idols.

425
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:03,067
Go on now. You'd better
get started soon.

426
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,108
[NAZUNA grunts]

427
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,608
I agree. Let's do it together!

428
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,108
All three of us.

429
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,858
Don't be an idiot! Let go!

430
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,900
A real artist doesn't
have to walk around town

431
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:20,233
begging to sell
his work! Unhand me!

432
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:20,983
[NAZUNA laughs]

433
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:21,858
[gasps]

434
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:24,108
[laughing]

435
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:25,733
Nito.

436
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,650
[gasps]

437
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,775
[MIKA]
Hurry, let's go!

438
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,192
[SHU]
You morons! Stop pulling me!

439
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,817
I'm the one who is
supposed to tell you

440
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,400
which way to move!

441
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,567
[NAZUNA]
I still remember that day.

442
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,733
It was nice and sunny,
with a refreshing breeze.

443
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,025
It felt good to
spend time outside.

444
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,483
We ended up selling tickets
to our concert all day,

445
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:49,233
until the sun went down.

446
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,275
I love looking back
and remembering a time

447
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:55,192
when Teach and Mikachin
were always by my side.

448
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:59,483
[CROWD chattering]

449
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,900
[CROWD cheers]

450
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:07,858
[NAZUNA] We were happy.
We hadn't realized yet

451
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:11,275
that a cruel time was
creeping up on us,

452
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,025
when the marionettes'
strings would be cut.
