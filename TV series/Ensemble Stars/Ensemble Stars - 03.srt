00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,608
[ANZU] A week after the
tragic S2 performances,

2
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,733
the student council's grip on
the school had grown tighter,

3
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:18,025
and all anyone at
Yumenosaki Academy

4
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:19,942
could talk about was AKATSUKI.

5
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,942
[STUDENT 03A]
AKATSUKI really is strong!

6
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,150
[STUDENT 03B]
You'd have to be an idiot

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:24,358
to go up against those guys.

8
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,150
[gasps, laughs]

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,108
[SUBARU] Hokke and Ukki
should be finished

10
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,233
with their training
today, right?

11
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:35,192
It'll be so exciting to see
how much better they've gotten!

12
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,067
Right? Ms. Producer?

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,442
Yeah.

14
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,400
Huh?

15
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:44,483
[SUBARU]
Hm?

16
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:48,733
[SUBARU]
A challenge?

17
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:21,192
He called you out?

18
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,108
And he's a member
of AKATSUKI, too.

19
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,108
They're going to be
tough opponents.

20
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:28,150
They might not even wait
until the S1 to crush us.

21
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,317
I don't think the Student
Council has any reason

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,775
to be watching us, though.

23
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,483
It would still be wise for
all of us to stay on guard.

24
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,067
If I could...

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,900
...I would like to go with you
after school and protect you.

26
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,525
Me too, but Sakuma
specifically asked all of us

27
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,775
to meet with him
at the same time.

28
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,108
Guys, I think I have an idea!

29
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,317
Heh, heh...

30
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,442
[TETORA]
Heads up, tea coming through!

31
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:54,192
[gasping]

32
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,983
[sighs]

33
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,858
[KURO] Seriously, do you even
know what "chill" means?

34
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,275
You should try being
a little more stoic.

35
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:03,608
Of course I know
what "chill" means.

36
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,483
I don't think I've heard "stoic"
before, but I'll look it up!

37
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,483
For sure!

38
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,983
[SUBARU growling]

39
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,025
[ANZU laughs]

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,067
What's with those getups?

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,817
It's called "protection!"

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,192
--[SUBARU growls]
--[ANZU gasps]

43
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:22,733
We're not looking for a fight.
I wanted to return this.

44
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,567
This young lady helped me out
when I was in trouble.

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,358
Thanks for that, miss.

46
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,400
We're enemies, aren't we Kiryu?

47
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,942
So why wait? Isn't this
your chance to attack?

48
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,650
Enemies?

49
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:41,942
I'm a member of AKATSUKI

50
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,275
with the student council
Vice President.

51
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,942
That's true enough.

52
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,900
But it doesn't mean I
have to go along with him

53
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:49,858
and defend a system
I don't believe in.

54
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,025
[SUBARU]
Uh?

55
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,942
If you guys are planning
to try and breathe

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,983
some new life into the academy,

57
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,567
I'm rooting for ya.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,817
Heh.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,108
[ANZU]
Um. This isn't...

60
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:03,858
I screwed up the important part.

61
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:07,067
Sorry, I must have grabbed
my little sister's by mistake.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,983
Wow, your little sister must
be really good at embroidery!

63
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,233
The chief's the one
who embroidered it!

64
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,400
[ANZU, SUBARU]
Huh?

65
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,942
[TETORA chuckles]

66
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,233
The chief made AKATSUKI's
special stage clothes

67
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,692
and the costumes for
my unit, RYUSEITAI.

68
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,567
And he does everything
by hand, too!

69
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,150
That's awesome!

70
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,067
Uh...

71
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,192
[chuckles nervously]

72
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,650
I believe that it's
better if a member

73
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,775
can make the outfits
for their own unit.

74
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,442
The best costumes are those
made with love and care by

75
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,358
someone who really
understands the people

76
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,067
who are going to
be wearing them.

77
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,942
[gasps]

78
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:38,733
Huh? What is it?

79
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,150
[KURO]
Huh?

80
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:45,317
[SUBARU] I didn't think you'd
make a request like that, Anzu.

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,525
I'll cheer you on!
Let's both do our best!

82
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,692
Hokke and the others
are gonna be so surprised!

83
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:51,525
[phone chimes]

84
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,567
[BOTH]
Huh?

85
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,733
Who's this?

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,483
[SUBARU]
Wow, good timing!

87
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,900
Yoo-hoo! Sally!

88
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:03,900
Hey.

89
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,275
You're here! Ha, ha, ha!

90
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:06,567
[gasps]

91
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,900
But how? Did you quit
the student council?

92
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,483
Sorry, but no.

93
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,442
I just had some
free time to spare.

94
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,567
All right, we're finally
together again! Yay!

95
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,567
[MAO]
I'm sorry for not

96
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,900
introducing myself
the other day.

97
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:20,567
My name's Isara Mao.

98
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,775
I'm in the basketball
club with Subaru,

99
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,525
student council Treasurer,

100
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,775
and a member of Trickstar.

101
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,275
Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,983
Yeah! And if you want,
you can call him Sally!

103
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,983
Don't worry about him being a
student council officer, though.

104
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,150
We know he's a
friend we can trust.

105
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,150
I skipped out on
individual training,

106
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,858
but I promise not to miss
any unit practices.

107
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,775
I hope that'll make up for it.

108
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,525
[door opens]

109
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,817
[SUBARU]
Oh my gosh, it's huge! Ya-hoo!

110
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,608
How'd we snag this room?

111
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,650
Sakuma managed to get it for us.

112
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,317
[HOKUTO] He told us to
switch to practicing

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,817
as a unit starting today,
for some reason.

114
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,192
I can't help feeling
he's up to something.

115
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,650
I just know he's pulling
strings behind the scenes.

116
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,858
And how did things
go for you guys?

117
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:07,608
Kiryu was just giving back
something he'd borrowed,

118
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,233
and one other thing.

119
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,650
Hmph. You'll see.

120
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,108
Anyway, let's practice, guys!

121
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,858
I'm so excited
that we're all here!

122
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,317
But first, we need to
bring Isara up to speed.

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,442
A lot has happened recently.

124
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,275
The four of us will be
competing at the S1 next week

125
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:27,650
against the unit AKATSUKI.

126
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:28,942
They have the full power

127
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,900
of the student council
backing them.

128
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:34,192
And they use that to monopolize
the students' votes.

129
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:38,275
That's why the whole audience
walked out on Ra*bits last week.

130
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:42,608
But at the S1, their school
authority doesn't matter.

131
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,233
Because this time,

132
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:47,442
the people watching us will be
members of the general public.

133
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,317
[MAO] The student council
won't have any influence

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,817
over this crowd, so we can
win the audience over

135
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,150
and get them to vote for us.

136
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,108
It's a little bit awkward
that I didn't ask you

137
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,983
this already, but... Isara...

138
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,650
...are you sure you want
to go through with this?

139
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,067
What are you saying?

140
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,983
I am still a member of
Trickstar, after all.

141
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,567
[BOTH laugh]

142
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,192
Then let's show
the student council

143
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,650
exactly what we're made of.

144
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,983
We'll give it
everything we've got.

145
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,192
And we'll make
our dream come true.

146
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,900
When Yumenosaki Academy
is dark and stagnant,

147
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:20,317
Trickstar will shine
a light to brighten it!

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,733
--[SUBARU] Yeah!
--[MAKOTO] Right!

149
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,150
[MAO exhales]

150
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,275
[MAKOTO sighs]
I'm exhausted!

151
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:30,275
Good work. You have a
lot more stamina now.

152
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:32,233
Yeah, and you looked
more relaxed.

153
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,817
I could see it in
your expressions.

154
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,692
[MAO] Hey. Where'd
the transfer student go?

155
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:37,942
She messaged us to say she'd

156
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,483
make us a late snack
at Garden Terrace.

157
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,025
What's the matter, Sally?

158
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,108
[MAO]
Uh... Bathroom.

159
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,817
[MAO]
Hey, you here, transfer student?

160
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,650
Hey.

00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,025
Oh, excuse me.

Hold up.

There's only one man allowed in
Garden Terrace, and that's me.

00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,733
Shoo, now.

165
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:04,483
Sorry, but did a girl just come
through here a while ago?

166
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,150
The new one who enrolled in
the production course, maybe?

167
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,817
Oh, she did, and she
was a cutie, too!

168
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,858
I only got a quick glance, but
for these eyes, that was plenty.

[MAO]
Hakaze Kaoru.

170
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,692
He's a member of UNDEAD,
like Sakuma.

171
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:21,817
And he's known to be a
real hit with the ladies.

172
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,942
He's a bit of a slacker when
it comes to his idol classwork,

173
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,442
but he's still a
top-class talent.

174
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,567
They say that when it comes
to their live shows,

175
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,733
he and Sakuma are UNDEAD's
two biggest attractions.

176
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,983
She is the single flower
that blooms in the desert!

177
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,983
So I have to pick
her very carefully

178
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,400
before anybody else has
a chance to defile her!

[KAORU grunts]

181
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,317
Well, well I was wondering
where you might be,

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,067
and of course here you are,
chasing girls.

Ugh, it's Sakuma.

184
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:54,192
Perfect timing. I just
remembered I have a date.

185

Bye, now.

Here and there like a summer
breeze, befitting his namesake.

188
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,108
But he is a member of my unit,

189
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,067
and it seems he was
a bit rude to you.

190
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,483
My apologies.

Oh, no. Not at all.
It's fine, really.

Why, you're too kind.

expect no less...

You may not know this,

228
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,525
but Makoto used to be a model

00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,900
until he had some
setbacks in his career.

[ANZU]
Hm?

231
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,025
[MAO]
Maybe because of that,

232
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,358
he tends to overthink
things sometimes.

233
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,650
He starts feeling like
he's not good enough,

234
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:07,150
or he gets so scared of failing
that he can't even try.

Makoto has everything it takes.
He has so much potential.

And he's as important to
Trickstar as any of us.

He just...

the way we all believe in him.

so why don't you give up
the song and dance.

00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,858
[REI]
Let me tell you an old story.

349
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,775
A tale from a time
when we were called

350
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:24,025
not the Three Eccentrics,
but the Five Eccentrics.

351
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:26,942
We were known as the
incarnation of evil.

352
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,025
Our power was unchecked.

353
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,358
We turned Yumenosaki Academy
into a churning cesspool

354
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,733
of corruption for
our own benefit.

355
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,442
[REI] And the ones who
finally brought an end

356
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,650
to our reign were
the student council.

357
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,858
Those students who felt
lost amid the violence

358
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,983
saw them as saviors.

359
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,150
After that,
they enforced the laws of

360
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,358
Yumenosaki Academy
with an iron fist

361
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,983
and brought peace
back to the campus.

362
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:55,483
But it has since become an
oppressive place of study.

363
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,942
[REI]
We rested on our laurels

364
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,442
and abused the power
that we held as idols.

365
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,400
Our own foolishness
brought this on.

366
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:06,692
And now the school is
paying for our mistakes.

367
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,567
That's why I need you
to believe me.

368
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,317
I hold no grudge against
the student council.

369
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,525
But I have to set this right.

370

I want to see what
Yumenosaki Academy can become.

of the old.

the bumbling administrators
