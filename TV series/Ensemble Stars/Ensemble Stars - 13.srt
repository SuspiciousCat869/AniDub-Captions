It's gonna be so
good for RYUSEITAI.

6
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:25,483
We're gonna create our own

be able to watch us perform

Right, then.

[gasps] What? Why?

00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,233
Chiaki, I need you to calm
down for just a moment

23
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,483
and think about
your position here.

Yes, it's cute.

28

I get that RYUSEITAI's
concept is inspired by heroes,

but you're still just

I know, but so what?

00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,400
So, sorry if I'm not being
completely clear here.

32
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,942
Your request goes against
student council policy.

33
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,858
I can't fund an official DreFes

34
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,233
so you can pretend
you're heroes.

You've got it wrong!
It's not like that.

We just wanna do
a concert in the theme park!

prepping for it.

The one I wrote
originally was crap,

Now you know why I asked
her to help me rewrite it.

Writing good proposals is
a skill producers need to hone,

so it's a win-win.

way that makes it sound amazing.

have to build it ourselves.

Okay, Kanata, I have
a favor to ask of you.

Well...

pretty impossible for the kids.

155

I can see that.

156

would work with just me and you?

158
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,483
Don't you think it's unfair
for you to underestimate us?

159
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,442
We're members of
RYUSEITAI, too, ya know?

160
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:49,567
Did I just hear you recognize
yourself as a part of RYUSEITAI?

161
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,192
Thank you, Nagumo! Thank you!

162
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,192
[TETORA]
Stop! What're you doing?

163
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,775
Oh! I wasn't trying
to underestimate you.

164
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,983
On the contrary, I'm
currently making adjustments

165
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,942
to help you shine
at your brightest.

166
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,442
We should probably head to
the meeting at the theme park.

167
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,608
I'm gonna do everything I can
to make sure I'm in top shape!

168
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,983
If I were you, I'd do the same!

169
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,150
See ya later!

170
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,233
What was that all about?

171
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,733
Man, I really thought
he'd be bummed

172
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,817
when the proposal was
rejected the first time.

173
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,817
Oh, he is. He's just
very good at faking it.

174
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,067
You know him--

175
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,400
forever wanting
to be the cool guy.

176
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,942
Hey, Nagumo, what's the deal?
You're into this idea now?

177
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,692
You used to say pretend
hero stuff was dumb.

178
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,192
But all of a sudden,
you're willing to participate?

179
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,025
Well, that part hasn't changed.

180
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,025
I still think
it's pretty stupid,

181
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:35,483
but I don't really
have a choice.

182
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,858
I didn't get into the
Chief's team, AKATSUKI,

183
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,567
so I'm making the best of this.

184
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,233
I originally joined RYUSEITAI
'cause it was all that was left.

185
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:47,692
I didn't want to, and
<i>tokusatsu</i> was so immature.

186
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,067
But after giving
it some thought,

187
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,775
I realized being a hero
could lead me to my dream

188
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,942
of becoming the
manliest man among men.

189
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,150
So now, I'm gonna
give it my best shot!

190
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,442
And I'll stay
if it's working out!

191
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,858
You don't need to make
up your mind right now.

192
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,233
Take your time.

193
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,150
You are all still children.

your experiences

and don't be in such
a rush to grow up.

196
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,692
Not to say it
isn't bothersome

197
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,942
for us to care for you
until you're grown,

198

protect you along your journey.

[ANZU]
Good work, you guys!

471
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,983
Right back atcha! Thank you!

472
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,692
Yes, thank you, Anzu.

473
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,942
It's because of you that
Supernova was such a huge hit!

474
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,692
I loved seeing how
happy it made the kids.

475
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh, yeah, you never said.

476
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:53,692
Do you like heroes, Kanata?

477
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:54,942
[KANATA]
Hm?

478
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,483
I was just wondering,
if I hadn't dragged you

479
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,317
into helping with
RYUSEITAI, would you--

480
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,608
I mean, would any of you have
ever entertained the thought

481
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:04,858
of becoming heroes, or that
you might already be one?

482
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,692
They wouldn't have stayed
around if they disliked it.

483
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,692
They'd drift off like seafoam.

484
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:13,400
Me, too, but I'm here.

485
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,900
I don't know what
heroes have to do

486
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,775
or even what it
takes to become one,

487
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,025
but I'm fairly certain I could

488
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:20,775
come to love this
special unit very much.

489
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:22,358
And that includes
you, of course.

490
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,983
I'm loving you all
more and more each day!

491
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:28,733
Really? I feel the same way!

492
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:30,608
Hey, you see that shooting star?

493
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,442
What should I wish for? Right!

494
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:36,025
I wish for a cute girlfriend
to make my lunches!

495
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,483
[KANATA laughs]

496
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,692
[KANATA]
This is when most people

497
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,192
would've wished for
world peace, hero!
