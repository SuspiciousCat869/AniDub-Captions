00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,067
[ANZU]
It was a remarkably clear day,

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,400
especially for the rainy season,

3
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:16,358
when something sprang
up out of the blue.

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,983
[EICHI]
Hello there, transfer student.

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:18,983
Uh.

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:20,858
So RYUSETAI's show
the other day.

7
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,233
Quite impressive.

8
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:23,858
[ANZU]
Oh, thanks so much.

9
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,233
[EICHI] I was wondering
if I could ask for a favor.

10
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,650
Uh, sure.

11
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,817
Well, a producer's job
entails much more

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,358
than just looking after
idols and their units.

13
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:35,442
They have to plan and oversee
events sometimes, too.

14
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:36,275
Don't you agree?

15
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,025
Yeah, absolutely.

16
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,275
[EICHI] Well, that
brings us to my request.

17
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:43,150
Would you be in charge
of running the next DreFes?

18
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,400
Uh...

19
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,733
What?!

20
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,608
[ANZU]
A DreFes.

21
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,858
And it's an S1 at that.

22
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,233
I don't even know
where to start!

23
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:32,233
[HAJIME] Isn't this the
perfect day for doing laundry?

24
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,025
[TOMOYA]
Yeah, it's been raining nonstop,

25
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,733
so the clothes were
really piling up.

26
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:36,858
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:37,942
I know you don't want to spend

28
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,192
this gorgeous day
hanging clothes.

29
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:41,567
Oh, no worries.

30
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,233
Mitsuru likes
to run in the rain.

31
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:45,358
His clothes get dirty fast.

32
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,775
He doesn't seem like the type

33
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,025
to let a little rain get
in the way of his fun.

34
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,233
This is the best
day ever! [laughing]

35
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,525
[NAZUNA muffled grunting]
I made a mistake!

36
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,817
--[NAZUNA] Someone help me!
--I got ya, friend!

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,775
Here I come to the rescue!

38
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,608
Stop wiggling.
You're making it worse.

39
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,192
Jeez.

40
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,317
That's what happens when a tiny
person hangs up a huge sheet.

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,650
[NAZUNA]
You shut your mouth!

42
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,567
[KAORU] Do you guys have
to be so loud? Seriously.

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,025
[HAJIME, TOMOYA, MITSURU]
Huh?

44
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,858
[KAORU] I'm trying to have
a little sun nap over here,

45
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,317
so hush up.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
[NAZUNA]
Is that Kaoruchin?

47
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:17,900
Don't just sit there.
Come help me!

48
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:20,233
[KAORU]
Oh, fine.

49
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,608
[gasps, sighs]

50
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:25,358
Fresh air never
tasted so delicious.

51
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,900
You shorties always
seem to be having fun.

52
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,275
Don't you call me shorty!

53
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,483
[HAJIME]
Uh...

54
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,358
Oh. I know this one
may look a little scary,

55
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,025
but he's not a bad guy.

56
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,108
Hey, Kaoruchin!

57
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,608
Since you're free,
we need your help!

58
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,067
Nah, as a rule,
I only help girls.

59
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,525
Okay, suit yourself.

60
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,400
I'll tell the whole
school how you hit on me

61
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,608
'cause you thought I was a girl.

62
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:47,817
Eh! Man, am I ever gonna
live that one down?

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,650
[ANZU]
'Scuse me.

64
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:49,900
[ALL]
Hmm?

65
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:50,942
[NAZUNA]
Anzu.

66
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,192
Oh. I assume you're
here to see me?

67
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,233
Uh, sorry, no.

68
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,317
This just fell off
the clothesline.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,233
Huh? Is that...?

70
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,400
Ah, man, now it's dirty again!

71
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,275
Thanks for giving it back.

72
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,733
[ANZU]
'Course. Well, see you later.

73
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:06,233
Oh. Hey, wait up. I'll join.

74
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,983
Wait. That's right!
I wanted to ask,

75
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,650
what would you all want
the ideal DreFes to be like?

76
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,025
What do you mean?

77
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,692
Huh. That's a good question.

78
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,858
Easy. I'd want an enormous stage

79
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,608
so I can run as much as
I want when I get the zoomies!

80
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,150
I'd like for it to be
focused on beautiful singing.

81
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,025
And I'd really
appreciate a point system

82
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:27,317
that didn't put new units at
such a massive disadvantage.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,150
We know units that have
been around the longest

84
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,733
are gonna have some natural
advantages over new ones.

85
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,192
But in the DDD, it's rough,
since you're knocked out

86
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,233
of the running after
your first loss.

87
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,275
Why are you asking about that?

88
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,192
Are you writing
a report or something?

89
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,525
No, as a matter of fact,

90
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,317
I've just been put
in charge of the next S1.

91
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,358
[ALL]
What?!

92
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:50,650
[ANZU]
First of all.

93
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,858
I need to decide how
big this event should be,

94
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,400
then I'll pick a theme
and put together a budget.

95
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,442
[KAORU]
Hey, Anzu?

96
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,775
Once that's done,

97
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,608
I'll start designing
and constructing the stage.

98
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,525
Oh, and I also
can't forget about--

99
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,608
Is anyone home?

100
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,692
[ANZU gasps]
Yeah? What is it?

101
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:06,650
I think you need to delegate
some responsibilities.

102
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,025
Like, enlist help?

103
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,775
Yup. You need a few
energetic assistants

104
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,400
who won't say no to
doing your dirty work.

105
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:14,692
[ADONIS panting]

106
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,233
[SOUMA panting]

107
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:22,108
Well played. Just like I
imagined, I'm no match for you.

108
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,608
And to add insult to injury,

109
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,483
you're not even
winded right now.

110
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,733
I am. I'm just a whole lot
better at concealing it.

111
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,525
Here. It's important
to stay hydrated.

112
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,108
You're too kind.

113
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:37,775
Hits the spot.

114
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:38,858
[KAORU]
Hey, guys!

115
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:39,983
Huh?

116
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,817
Hope you guys aren't
working too hard.

117
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,358
[ADONIS] Oh, look.
It's Anzu... and Hakaze.

118
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,567
This is no place for
weaklings like you,

119
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,442
marine life club disgrace!

120
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,483
How dare you show
your face around here?

121
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,567
Oh, Souma, still not showing
respect to your elders?

122
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,108
Can't say I'm surprised.

123
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:58,067
However, Otsukare knows
how the hierarchy works.

124
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,233
Um, Hakaze, my name isn't
Otsukare. It's Otogari.

125
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,483
We're in the same unit,

126
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,025
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd remember that.

127
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,317
Anyway, did you need something?

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,150
[SOUMA] You okay?
Did this ruffian abduct you?

129
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,108
Actually, I was about
to ask if she'd like--

130
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:13,858
--Not a chance, buddy.
--[KAORU chuckles]

131
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,983
Can I tell you guys something?

132
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,442
--[SOUMA] What?!
--[ADONIS] What did you say?!

133
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,233
Okay, what is this?

134
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,775
Ya tryin' to take over
my dojo or something?

135
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,275
Sure, that's it.

136
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,567
No, but here's the thing--
we are definitely going to need

137
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,733
an exclusive
outfit for a DreFes.

138
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,150
Exactly. We decided
to seek your counsel

139
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,525
before doing
anything, Sir Kiryu.

140
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,525
Wait, back up.

141
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:38,608
I'm not actually following yet.

142
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,483
[ANZU]
I'll cut to the chase then.

143
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,025
[KURO]
What?

144
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:49,275
[KEITO]
What in the world are you up to?

145
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,317
[EICHI chuckles]
She's in league with Trickstar,

146
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,275
who dared bare its teeth
to the student council.

147
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:58,692
So I gave her a project
that I knew would crush her.

148
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,608
Is that what you
thought I'd say?

149
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,900
Not that extreme, but yes.

150
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:07,150
[EICHI] That girl is this
Academy's one and only producer.

151
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:10,483
So if she keeps getting better,
then everyone will benefit.

152
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,775
[knocking]

153
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,192
[SOUMA]
Pardon me. Sir Hasumi?

154
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,608
What now?

155
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,775
--[SOUMA] May I come in?
--[EICHI] She's already begun.

156
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,233
Impressive.

157
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,275
[knocking]

158
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,358
I'll leave the rest to you.

[door opens]

160
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:26,692
A moment, please.

161
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,650
What is it, Kanzaki?

162
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,733
[SOUMA] Lady Anzu
requests your instruction.

163
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,608
It's in regard to DreFes
planning and management.

164
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,525
If I'm going to
create a new DreFes,

165
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:37,692
I need to know as much
information as possible

166
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,525
about all the past events.

167
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:44,942
Anzu?

168
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,275
Isara.

169
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:47,817
What's going on?

170
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,817
[KEITO]
Perfect timing, Isara.

171
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,192
Would you help Anzu carry
these documents to the library?

172
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,275
That way she can peruse
them to her heart's content.

[MAO]
There ya go.

00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,275
That's the last of 'em, right?

176
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,608
Sure is.

177
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,567
This is such
a pleasant surprise.

178
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,858
I can't believe you're
planning the next Drefes.

179
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,692
I know, it's crazy.

180
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,358
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

181
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,775
I'd be happy to help.

182
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,192
And not just me.

All of Trickstar's here for you.
We're just a call away.

00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,483
Aw, thanks!

185
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,775
It would seem that
our work here is done.

186
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,400
For the time being at least.

187
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,483
She needs to brainstorm
about it on her own.

188
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,608
If there's any heavy lifting,
you guys can help her with it.

189
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,858
And since I'm the one who
enlisted you as assistants,

190
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,567
I'll score major
points with her too.

191
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,608
You're a scoundrel,
you know that?!

192
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,775
[ANZU]
I see.

193
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,275
Before the current
Drefes ranking system,

194
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,067
they did it in
a number of other ways.

195
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,483
Huh.

196
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,650
[NATSUME]
You worried about something?

197
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,525
[NATSUME]
Hey, kitten.

198
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,358
Doesn't the moon
look beautiful tonight?

199
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,858
[ANZU]
Uhh...

200
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:00,442
[NATSUME chuckles]
I know what you're thinking.

201
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,067
"The moon isn't even out yet."

202
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,692
But why not indulge in a flight
of fancy every now and then?

203
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:09,025
True beauty comes not from
the eyes, but from the mind.

204
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,567
Right.

205
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,983
[NATSUME] I get the feeling
you might not remember me.

206
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,942
I am one of your
classmates, you know.

Oh, that's right,
your name's Sakasaki.

209
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,358
You're the one who ditched

210
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,400
when we were both on
class duty the other day.

211
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,650
Embarrassing.

212
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,650
Wish you remembered me
for something better.

213
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,692
Well, anyway, as
I'm a skilled magician,

214
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,358
I can help assuage
all your anxieties...

215
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,733
...using my magic.

216
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,233
Your magic?

217
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:42,608
[NATSUME] That's what I said.
But only on one condition.

218
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:43,942
[gasps]

219
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,608
I want you to agree
to go out with me.

220
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:17,483
[ALL panting]

221
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,983
Yeah! That was perfect.
Right, kitten?

222
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,483
[SORA]
Woo-hoo!

223
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,733
Well, I personally think

224
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:25,192
we looked super cool
that time around!

225
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,650
[TSUMUGI]
You totally nailed the lighting

226
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,483
with just a few
minutes of practice.

227
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,358
That was amazing!
Thanks so much for doing this!

228
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,108
Oh, it's nothing, really.
I'm happy to help!

229
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,317
[TSUMUGI]
Because of you,

230
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,442
we're ready to perform
for the B1 today.

231
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,983
I was scared we
wouldn't make it!

232
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,400
To say that I panicked when
the original lighting person

233
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,900
canceled at the last minute
would be an understatement!

234
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,900
He was freaking out.

235
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:48,650
But because you were
willing to help Master,

236
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,233
everything is
gonna work out now!

237
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,692
Exactly.

238
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,108
You must've been
pretty surprised

239
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,108
when Natsume asked
you out, right?

240
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:55,983
What a dork.

241
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:57,275
I sure was.

242
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,400
I didn't ask her out.

243
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,275
Just if she'd come
with me for the day.

244
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,233
There's no ulterior motive.

245
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,650
Of course there isn't.

246
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,858
But you better stay
for class duty next time.

247
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:08,567
I'm never gonna live
that one down, am I?

248
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,233
I'm curious, why me?

249
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:11,817
For concerts at the academy,

250
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,483
shouldn't you ask the student
council or broadcast committee?

251
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,692
The B1's an unofficial
free-for-all competition.

252
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,317
We aren't technically supposed
to ask the school for help.

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,275
We were trying to
think of a replacement

254
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:23,775
and then I remembered
that you helped out

255
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,233
with RYUSEITAI's
hero show recently.

256
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,400
But he was worried that you
might not agree to help,

257
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,817
even if we asked.

258
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,608
I told him that you might,
but he didn't believe me.

259
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,567
--Heh.
--But we're fine now!

260
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,942
At the end of the day,
you were worrying for nothing!

261
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,025
Yeah.

262
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:39,608
[NATSUME]
You really were, Tsumugi.

263
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,483
In the chaotic world we live in,
being anxious about the future

264
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,025
is a sign of intelligence,
but when it prevents you

265
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:48,025
from living your life,
it's dysfunctional.

266
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,150
In other words,
you're kinda useless.

267
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,400
That's why you decided
to ask Anzu yourself.

268
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,608
Because you knew I couldn't
bring myself to do it.

269
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:57,358
He may be a little weirdo,
but he's our little weirdo!

270
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,775
[NATSUME grunts]

271
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,400
Ugh! What self-respecting
magician punches somebody

272
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,025
instead of casting
a hex on them?

273
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:06,150
I would, but, for some reason,
you seem to be immune to magic.

274
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,358
[SORA]
Woo-hoo!

275
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,025
The concert is about to begin.

276
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,192
We better head to
the dressing room!

277
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:13,192
We put a lot of effort
into publicity.

278
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,817
So I'm sure we'll
have an audience.

279
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
[EICHI] Yes. I have
a question regarding that.

280
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,108
[ALL]
Huh?

281
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,608
[TSUMUGI]
Eichi?

282
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,192
[EICHI]
Well, Tsumugi,

283
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,525
care to tell me
what this is about?

284
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,983
For some odd reason,

285
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:29,150
it shows that fine is also
performing at the B1 today.

286
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,150
Well, um, that's
actually 'cause...

287
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,442
He asked for a tiny, little
favor from an old pal, you see.

288
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,692
Wataru.

289
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,733
I have a weak spot for
him when he looks at me

290
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,317
and begs with those
big ol' puppy dog eyes.

291
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,442
I am like a big brother
to him, after all. [laughs]

292
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,567
Don't go thinking that
you've paid your debt now.

293
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,192
You're still very
much on the hook.

294
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,483
I haven't forgiven you
yet for joining fine,

295
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:54,775
and I'm still not sure if
I ever will, Big Brother Wataru.

296

[WATARU]
Mm-hm, mm-mm.

[EICHI]
Oh, I see what this is.

298
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,192
You want to take
Wataru for yourself.

299
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,192
Best of luck.

300
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,942
Just listen to yourself.

301
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,900
You're talking as if you
actually believe that

302
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,108
Big Brother Wataru
belongs to you.

303
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,358
He isn't wrong.

304
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,900
The fact of it is that
I belong to one and all,

305
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,817
for I am everyone's
Wataru Hibiki.

306
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,400
Eichi. It's our first B1.

307
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:18,858
Switch has never performed for
the school in this way before.

308
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,525
So I was thinking
that fine could help

309
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,108
brighten up our performance.

310
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,108
That's right.

311
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,233
Even though you
forfeited the DDD,

312
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:28,317
you retain your
reputation as the top unit.

313
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,275
There's no better unit
to support us in this.

314
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,733
So we would love for you
to give us your blessing.

315
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,525
And what exactly would
compel me to do such a thing?

316
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,983
[TSUMUGI]
I can think of one good reason

317
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,817
off the top of my head.

318
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,358
Since I'm part of the
reason that fine exists,

319
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:45,900
it's only natural that the group
would want to support me now.

320
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,983
At any rate, this is my plan.

321
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,650
So if you're dissatisfied,

322
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,358
you can direct your
complaints to me.

323
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,358
I've never been
dissatisfied with you.

324
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,775
Though I will say this.

325
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,442
If you're trying to
impress people tonight,

326
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,942
you should cut all
that hair off your neck.

327
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,692
And those glasses
do you no favors.

328
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,775
Do you always have
to be so critical?

[ANZU giggles]

Transfer student, do you have
time to be involved with this?

331
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:13,233
I assumed that you'd be focused
solely on writing your proposal.

332
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,525
I, uh...

333
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,442
Never mind.

334
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,358
Wataru, are Tori
and Yuzuru here, too?

Indeed, they're already changing

in the dressing room
just over there.

337
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,233
Very well.

338
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:28,233
Out of respect for our past,
I'll go with your plan.

The lonely dictator recovers

all the accoutrements
he forfeited in the past.

So much has happened.

Eichi, Natsume, and I
have quite the history.

356
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,442
Things got messy. We fought,

00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,525

[TSUMUGI]
Natsume,

368
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:17,150
this performance
really is like magic!

369
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,067
You complained that
magic doesn't work on me,

370
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,525
and I know it was a joke.

371
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:23,358
But still, it isn't true.

372
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,775
Your magic's been working
on me this whole time!

373
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,358
After I burn this to
ashes once and for all,

374
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,483
my work will be done.

375
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,108
A nobody like me helped
start a revolution,

376
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:39,858
and if that's not good enough,
I don't know what is.

377
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,858
I'm proud of myself.

378
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,567
Thank you for that, Eichi.

379

really are a good person.

How long have you been there?

00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,775
Long enough.

384
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,775
So long as your burning things,
could you throw this on, too?

385
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,608
I don't mind, but what is it?

386
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:01,150
[NATSUME] A pipe dream
that never came true, sadly.

387
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,233
I held onto it because
I couldn't give it up.

388
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,483
But now that I think of it, that
was just an escape from reality.

389
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,483
So hurry up and burn it.

things to go back?

probably shouldn't burn it.

Maybe someone else'll
find it someday--

396

someone who could actually
make that dream come true.

397
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,067
No, it's not like that.
I never want to go back.

398
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,817
I see.

399
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,317
I plan to move forward.

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,108
Dwelling in the past doesn't
help to improve the present.

401
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:40,483
Eichi ended it with the least
possible amount of sacrifice.

402
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:45,692
[TSUMUGI] Still... we had
to forfeit many things.

403
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,025
So from here on out,

404
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,233
I wanna do all that I can
to recover those things.

405
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,650
And I wanna make amends
to all the people we hurt

406
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,817
to compensate them somehow.

407
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,733
Where do you plan
to go from here?

408
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,817
The Five Eccentrics
have been dispersed,

409

leaving you with nothing
but your own talent.

410
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,400
You talk like you're
discussing the weather,

411
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,483
but a lot of this
was your doing, right?

412
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,817
Eichi and I did
have a hand in it.

413
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,275
And that's part of why
I'm so worried about you.

414
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,317
Look, I'm fully aware
that I have no right

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,733
whatsoever to ask this of you,

416
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,650
but, if you're interested
and available,

417
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:20,233
I would be incredibly honored
if you would help me out.

418
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:23,150
You have the gall to say
that to someone you crushed?

419
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:26,067
You really are the worst,
man, you know that?

420
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,192
[TSUMUGI] If you're still
angry with me, punch me again.

421
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,858
I mean, that's better
than walking away

422
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,442
without saying anything.
Don't you think?

423
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,317
[NATSUME] I'm never
gonna thank you for this.

424
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,692
Can't stand the thought.

425
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:42,275
But it's not like I have
anything better to do.

426
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,650
So, okay.

427
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,150
What? You mean it?

428
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,942
If I'm around you all the time,

429
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,275
then the guilt will torment
you even more, right?

That's gonna be
my sweet revenge.

I'll whisper all your
worst fears to you.

Well, then I'm gonna get
the best sleep of my life!

434
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,817
Because you have an amazingly
soothing voice, Natsume!

435
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,192
Heh.

436
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,525
Even if it takes a lifetime,
you'll repay your debt.

437
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,067
I'll stay at your side,
until death do us part.

438
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,233
Wait a second.

439
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,317
Now it sounds like
I'm proposing to you.

440
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,358
[laughs]

441
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,317
[ANZU] At the time, I didn't
even know this had happened.

442
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,692
It wasn't until a little
while later that I learned

443
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:21,608
about this conversation
between Aoba and Sakasaki.

444
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,775
But as I sat up in the booth,
watching their concert,

445
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,650
even though I knew they had
almost given up at one point,

446
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,942
I felt an enormous
respect for them,

447
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:32,692
because they chose to
pick themselves back up

448
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,650
and try again.

449
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,067
So then, what do you think?

450
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,400
You want a Tanabata
Festival event. I see.

451
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,775
So we could keep
this up annually.

452
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,358
Your idea to use paper strips

453
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,108
instead of light sticks
is quite clever.

454
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:58,317
Wishes will be written
on the paper strips,

455
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,358
and the winning team makes one
of the fans' wishes come true--

456
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,108
a unique premise.

457
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:07,692
Though, I think the highlight
of this proposal lies elsewhere.

458
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,358
[NAZUNA]
Hey, guys! Listen!

459
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,025
So when two units compete,

460
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,900
the winning unit gets to stay
on stage no matter what.

461
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,900
But if the losing
unit feels like it,

462
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,442
they can get on a waitlist.

463
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,942
Once their name comes up, they
can re-enter the competition

464
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,608
and try to do better.

465
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,150
Uh, Big Bro?
What does all of that mean?

466
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,275
Basically, it means that
as long as there's time,

467
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,900
we can get onstage and
perform as much as we want.

468
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,567
Even if we lose, we can
still try to make a comeback!

00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,025
You guys, the Tanabata Festival!
We'll challenge AKATSUKI there.

471
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,233
And, the best part is,

472
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,150
this'll give us a chance
to keep improving!

473
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,275
--[HAJIME, TOMOYA] All right!
--[MITSURU] Heck, yeah!

[EICHI chuckles]

475
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,567
These rules have a
slight hint of defiance.

476
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,358
Is this proposal your
attempt at revolution?

477
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:50,483
I've never been
quite that ambitious.

478
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,733
I just thought, this way,

479
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,067
everybody could
give it their all

480
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,192
without worrying about
getting eliminated.

481
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,817
[EICHI]
Anzu.

482
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,858
This proposal's great.
I am approving it.

483
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,733
I did it!

484
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,692
You were right about that girl.

485
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,733
Yes. She's done well.

486
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:15,025
[EICHI]
Better than expected.

487
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,108
She might have influenced
me a little, too.

488
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:22,233
There's something I'd like to
try now after that last DreFes.

489
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:02,775
[MIKA]
Aww. Hey, Teach, wait up!

490
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,608
Why do you always leave
performances in such a hurry?

491
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,567
Don't you wanna interact with
the audience at least a little?

492
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,150
We know there's
nothing to be gained

493
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,817
from flattering the commoners.

494
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,817
So why pretend otherwise?

495
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,192
I perform well.

496
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:18,275
That's all I owe them,
and that's all they'll get.

497
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,317
[MIKA]
How'd I do at today's concert?

498
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Good, huh? I felt like I really
nailed the choreography.

499
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:24,858
You had your moments,

500
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,025
but there's plenty
of room for improvement.

501
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,317
You have good instincts,
but you lack precision.

502
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,192
Aww. Come on, Teach, you don't
have to be so mean all the time.

503
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:34,358
[SHU gasps]

504
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,108
Hello, it's been
quite a while, Itsuki.

505
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,567
Sorry...

506
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,400
...Valkyrie.
