I assure you.

00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,233
Yes, but I try not
to acknowledge it

314
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,067
unless I absolutely have to.

315
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,733
Unfortunately,
he's the president

316
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,317
of the theatre club I'm in.

317
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,108
[WATARU grunts, laughs]

318
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,483
Amazing!

319
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,400
[CROWD cheers]

320
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,608
Ugh, why did the president
bring in the creepy guy

321
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:22,900
with the long hair?

322
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,108
It's been said many
times that Master Hibiki

323
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,400
possesses extraordinary talent.

324
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,317
And with his
inimitable personality,

325
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,858
he's earned his place among
the Three Eccentrics.

326
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:34,275
In terms of raw ability,
he may even be a match

327
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,567
for the president himself.

328
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,442
[TORI]
You take that back!

329
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,567
[EICHI]
It's been too long.

330
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,567
Tori, Yuzuru, and you, Wataru.

331
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,942
Finally the awaited
hour has come.

332
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:54,317
Our Eichi makes his triumphant
return to the stage!

333
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,817
Now then, without delay.

334
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,317
Let's Begin!

335
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:15,525
[CROWD cheers]

336
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,317
[HOKUTO]
They're incredible.

337
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,942
It's like I can hear
a whole orchestra

338
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:33,275
on stage with them, playing
a beautiful symphony.

339
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:35,358
His name was Fushimi, right?

340
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,900
He's a great talent.

341
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,608
A natural support player
who can bring

342
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,775
the other members' strong
personalities together

343
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,692
to form a top-class unit.

344
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,192
Himemiya. Even though
he messes up a lot,

345
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,775
you can barely see
the mistakes through

346
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,275
the shine of his character.

347
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,442
But most impressive of all

348
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,650
is the student council
president, Tenshouin Eichi!

349
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,567
Every note and step
is beyond perfection.

350
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,525
And he just got out
of the hospital?

351
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,942
He's truly a top idol!

352
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:06,733
Maybe it's actually
for the best.

353
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,567
I'm proud of what
we've done. I am.

354
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,567
But would it really be so wrong

355
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,483
if we accepted the
president's offer?

356
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,817
Isara, you can't--

357
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,817
[MAO]
It would be a huge step up.

358
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,483
We would all be reaching
new heights in our careers.

359
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,400
And with the student
council's backing,

360
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:26,650
we can still make a difference,
even if Trickstar goes away,

361
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:27,983
we could work from the inside

362
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,525
and change the system
for the better.

363
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:34,150
Wait. Are you serious?
Isara, please.

364
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,650
Yeah, I mean it.

365
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,192
I'm not saying this as
a student council member.

366
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:39,775
Just think about it.

367
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:44,108
[CROWD cheers]

368
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,442
[EICHI]
Thank you.

369
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,817
I'd like to make a brief
announcement to all of you

370
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,858
as your student council
president, so please listen.

371
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:55,733
As I'm sure you all know,
there is an important event

372
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,400
in the idol industry
that takes place

373
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,275
at the end of every year.

374
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,192
Of course, I'm
speaking of the SS.

375
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,858
Idols from all
across the country,

376
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,692
professional and amateur alike,

377
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,150
compete to
distinguish themselves

378
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,108
as the best in the nation.

379
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:14,233
This is the ultimate
DreFes. The SS.

380
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,483
Anybody attending this school...

381
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,733
Anyone who chooses
to be an idol...

382
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,608
...would wish for the
opportunity to compete

383
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,942
on this stage and win.

384
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,942
And so I hereby proclaim!

385
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:29,358
Every unit in Yumenosaki
Academy is invited

386
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,442
to compete for the
right to represent us

387
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:35,067
at the SS in a DreFes!

388
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,733
We call this
competition the DDD.

389
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,733
A competition to determine
which unit should

390
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:43,942
carry our school's banner on
the industry's biggest stage.

391
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,233
This is a chance for all
of you to put your abilities

392
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:50,025
as idols on full display
and shine your brightest.

393
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,233
I hope to see everyone
participate in the DDD.

394
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,817
And needless to say,

395
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,108
we of fine will also
be taking part.

396
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:02,067
So reach for your desires,
harness your passion,

397
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,108
and face this challenge.

398
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:07,525
I want to hear your
voices resound!

399
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,192
Ensembles, give us your all!

400
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,025
[SUBARU] I can't believe
it's only two more weeks

401
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:48,400
until the DDD!

402
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,983
That's not much time
for something so big.

403
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,733
We'll have a lot of
special training again,

404
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:54,358
but I know we can take on fine,

405
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,067
just like we did with Akatsuki.

406
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,775
We're Trickstar!
Nothing can stop us!

407
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,067
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,608
Hokke? Where you going?

409
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,983
Hey, hold on!
You can hear me, right?

410
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,775
I know you can, I'm right here.

411
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:17,483
Hokke! Why are you ignoring me?

412
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,567
Friends don't do that!

413
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't just walk away from me!

414
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:22,775
Hokuto!

415
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,025
[HOKUTO] I never expected
to hear you call me

416
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,108
by my real name
at a time like this.

417
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,567
[gasps]

418
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,525
[gasps]

419
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,608
[HOKUTO] I'm going to go
talk to the president

420
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:44,942
about his offer.

421
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:48,942
About my future.
And Isara and Yuuki.

422
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,275
I'm sure they'll do the same.

423
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:51,650
[gasps]

424
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:58,942
[HOKUTO]
It really was fun. Thank you.

425
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:01,025
Working with you
was the first time

426
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,733
I actually liked being an idol.

427
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,358
Huh?

428
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:09,358
You showed me the
light of hope,

429
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,233
and I pray that you'll
keep it shining bright.

430
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,067
[SUBARU]
What was that?

431
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,692
It sounded like a real goodbye.

432
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:28,150
You shouldn't joke
around like that.

433
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:33,442
I'm not laughing.
This isn't funny!

434
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,483
Hokuto. Makoto. Mao.

435
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,025
If I can't have all
of you beside me,

436
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,983
what am I supposed to do?
