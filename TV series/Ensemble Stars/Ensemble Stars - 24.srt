No, not yet.

All we know for sure is that
someone hijacked the network.

And their sole motive
was to air that footage.

17
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:03,275
[MAKOTO] They wanted to expose
Akehoshi's dad's criminal past.

Though the accusations
were never really proven.

And as if that
wasn't bad enough,

[SUBARU] It's okay.
I'll tell you what I know.

I can't say for sure what kind
of person my dad really was.

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,150
But to me, he sparkled
like a shooting star.

54
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,983
I thought he could do no wrong.

55
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,817
You could say he was my idol.

just an accident.

climbed up on the stage.

and they died in the end.

there thought that

Akehoshi's dad had pushed them.

--[thud]
--[gasps]

beginning of the end for him.

Dad wasn't charged with murder,

but the investigation turned
up plenty of other things.

78
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,817
Eventually,
he was arrested again.

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,442
Illegal contributions, violence
towards his colleagues...

80
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,483
Evidence just kept surfacing.

81
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:51,608
[SUBARU] They started calling
him the worst idol in history.

82
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,900
I had to hear that
about my own father.

83
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,233
The name Akehoshi became
synonymous with crime.

84
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:02,733
And, as for me and mom, we were
pariahs shunned by society.

85
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:06,275
Dad never got the chance
to vindicate himself either.

86
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,817
He passed away in jail.

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,983
That's when I decided
I would go to Yumenosaki Academy

88
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:15,358
and become an idol
just like my dad.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,567

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,067
something sparkling
and precious.

91
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,192
Something good to hold on to.

That was all my dad wanted...
and it became my dream, too!

00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:33,358
But after this,
I'm afraid of going onstage.

parents had been disgraced,

95

this fight together!

00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,108
You will never stand alone.

100
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,608
We'll be at your side!

101
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:49,733
Yeah, that's right!

102
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:52,400
I mean, I'm afraid
of being on camera,

103
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:55,733
but with you guys supporting me,
I'm able to do it!

And look at me.

106
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,900
Back in middle school,
people suggested

107
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,358
that I might make
a good idol, and I listened.

108
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:06,233
So I figured
I'd try my luck here.

109
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,442
Plus, it would
give me the chance

110
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,317
to hang out with Ritsu more.

111
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,108
But now I'm kinda relieved
to just be an average guy.

112
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:16,692
And if you're scared to
be onstage, don't worry.

You can count on me,

Didn't I tell you to call
on us if you needed help?

119

I don't know what
jerk did this to you,

120
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,442
but they're a no-good,
dirty, cheater!

121
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,358
They tried to drag your
name through the dirt,

but they won't get away with it!

Yeah, this kind
of thing makes me sick.

keep Akehoshi company for now?

So, Hokuto, what's the plan?

129
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:04,442
I'm gonna go visit Eden.

130
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,567
Really? Do you
think they did this?

Please don't beat them up.

132
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,733
No way. You don't really think
they're to blame here, do you?

[HOKUTO grunts]

134
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,525
[MAO]
Then, who is?

135
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,858
We don't know yet,
but I don't think it's Eden--

136
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,650
that video went too far.

137
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,900
[HOKUTO] I don't think
they did it either.

138
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,275
For one thing,

139
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,900
as Isara and Anzu discovered
during the Autumn Live,

140
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:29,442
things are pretty complicated
on Eden's end, too.

141
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:32,900
That said, if they really
see themselves as idols,

142
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,233
they may help us
fight our common enemy.

143
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,525
[IBARA groans]

144
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,442
And they've gone and done
it again. Those idiots.

145
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,525
[HOKUTO]
And what's more,

146
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,317
we might be able
to turn the tables.

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,483
We just have to use
what I gave Anzu.

148
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,692
[MAO]
Huh? What'd you give her?

149
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:53,733
[EICHI] So... you plan
to open Pandora's box.

150
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,025
With this, we can
root out the corruption

151
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,900
that's pervaded our
industry for years.

00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,358
Where are the others?

153
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:03,317
As far as I know, they're
talking to Eden as we speak.

154
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,483
Very well. I'll take
action immediately.

155
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,150
Listen, if there's
anything at all I can do...

156
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,358
[EICHI]
This is my responsibility.

157
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,775
And regardless...

158

315
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,650
My dad... he was framed.

316
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,608
The allegations are
false. I can prove it.

317
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,983
My friend's father secretly kept
several documents from the time.

318
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,775
They'll clear my dad's name.

319
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,983
Therefore, I plan
to make them public.

320
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,983
In order to prevent foul play,

321
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,067
the Tenshouin Financial Group
and the Tomoe Foundation,

322
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,650
among others, have approached
the police pre-emptively.

323
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,483
Everybody, freeze!
No one make a move.

324
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,608
[SUBARU]
The whole truth will be

325
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,525
brought to light
in the New Year.

326
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,025
That's right, your colleagues
are quite capable, Yuzuru...

327
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:20,608
[SUBARU] But still, I don't
know how it will all turn out.

328
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:23,900
And even if my father is
cleared of all charges,

329
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,442
I know nothing will
bring him back.

330
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,358
It's all just so heartbreaking.

331
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,567
He's been struggling
with this all along,

332
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,858
and I never had a clue.

333
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,692
Yeah. You still have
a lot to learn. We all do.

334
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,483
To tell the truth,

335
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,400
my father has always
been a hero to me.

336
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,817
I'm so happy!

337

that's what I've lived for!

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,025
I met some wonderful friends,

and made it here
to the SS stage.

342

Honestly, I don't have
a single thing to hide.

I don't have anything
to be ashamed of!

I remember.

Back then, when I was a child,

00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:02,233
he stretched out his hand to
infinite sparkling lights.

And both my father and I,
we loved him deeply.

was a heartless tyrant,
but I knew better.
