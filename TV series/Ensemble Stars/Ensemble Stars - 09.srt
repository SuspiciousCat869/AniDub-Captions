Come on.

3
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:19,733
There are better
places to watch from.

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,108
[KEITO]
My apologies.

00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,358
[gasps]

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
[KEITO] I know council
work is the last thing

7
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,025
you wanted to do
on your day off.

8
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:33,525
It's fine.

9
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:38,233
[KEITO] Almost every student
at the school is participating.

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:40,608
So there aren't enough
left over to work.

11
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:43,233
That's why we didn't
have a choice.

12
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:46,567
The later it gets, the more
units will be eliminated.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,108
Things should get easier
as the day goes on.

14
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:51,150
I didn't think
about this before,

15
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,942
but you could have
participated without me.

16
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,525
It was my choice to
prioritize council work.

17
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:57,567
I was selfish.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,525
Don't be ridiculous, man.

19
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,067
Friends are the ones
who want to trudge

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,942
through the mud with you.

21
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,233
Isn't that who we are?

22
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,067
The kind of unit we wanna be?

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,275
He's right!

24
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,400
We will live and die
with you, Sir Hasumi.

25
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:14,525
Isara?

26
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,608
Huh? Yes?

27
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:20,692
[KEITO] I'm not saying this
as a student council leader

28
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,942
or as AKATSUKI's leader.

29
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:27,650
This is just me, Hasumi
Keito, thinking aloud.

30
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,150
I think you're
both a strong idol

31
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,567
and a strong member
of the student council.

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,900
However, it's because you're
good at so many things

33
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,150
that you don't know what
you should be doing.

34
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,358
[gasps]

35
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:41,817
[KEITO] I also used to let
ambition and drive rule my life.

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,108
But, all that brought
me was regret.

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,608
Don't be like me.

38
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,483
I wanted to share this with you,

39
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,650
while you still know
how to be a true friend.

Gross! Go away!

43
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,025
I noticed that
you've been looking

44
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,692
kinda pale recently. You need
to take care of your health

45
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:34,983
and get a proper nutrition.

46
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,108
Then let me go so I can!

47
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm sorry, I can't.

[sighs]

49
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,983
[IZUMI] Do you know
what day it is today?

50
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,942
It's the day of the DDD.

51
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:50,192
It started several
hours ago, in fact.

Isn't it time to give up
and be honest with yourself?

What you really
want is to go back

to being a doll,
and being pretty.

C'mon, we can
model together, Yuu.

Fine. Do what you want, then.

I can't give up.

like a listening device.

back here and release me!

going to open the door, then?

been filled by Trickstar!

going up against Knights

But, why, Sally? I don't get it.

Nothing major. Really.

that we spoke before I forgot.

Oh?

154
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,108
Trickstar will be defeated,

155

and AKATSUKI will do
it out in the open.

I'm sure they
appreciate your support.

He wanted to win the DDD,

Which was great. That
meant we could sleep.

319
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,275
Gotta watch our stamina!

320
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,233
Wait, so you guys lost?

321
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,858
We were asked to for
the sake of victory.

322
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,275
Sakuma said it was
part of his strategy.

323
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:36,108
So we agreed and
volunteered as tributes.

324
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,442
We are following
RYUSEITAI's instructions.

325
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,483
What do you mean by that?

326
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,358
[YUTA] At least we
weren't the first to go.

327
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,900
RYUSEITAI went up against
fine in the opening match.

328
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,108
Apparently, it was
a fierce battle.

329
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,317
There were some people
who felt like

330
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,650
it may as well have
been the finale.

331
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,108
[panting]

332
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,525
[TETORA]
I can't move anymore!

333
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,067
Tetora, you're
too heavy! Get off!

334
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,692
[laughing]

335
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,942
[panting]

336
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:09,733
[CHIAKI] Nice work, Takamine.
I'm proud of you.

337
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:13,483
Thank you. Where'd you
get all this energy?

338
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,525
From not training
the same way you do.

339
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,942
[laughs]

340
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,983
[EICHI]
Good match, everyone.

341
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:23,150
But eventually,
someone has to go.

342
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,858
Try not to take it to heart.

343
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,900
Enjoy it while you can
because next time,

344
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,983
we're winning!

345
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,275
Are you?

346
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,275
Time to withdraw!

347
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:36,317
[CHIAKI]
Just wait.

348
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,608
All you saw were
the opening moves!

349
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,567
What you don't know is that
we're taking advantage

350
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,108
of your only weakness:
the fact that you're

351
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:45,317
awful at taking care
of your health.

352
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,442
So, we'll make you
use up all your energy,

353
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,608
then hand you over
to the next unit!

354
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,358
That's what's called
a bulletproof strategy!

355
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,608
Chiichan came up with that?

356
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,942
It feels like a plan
that's going to work,

357
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,275
and it's easy.

358
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:01,442
Every unit is doing their
best to wear fine out.

359
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,608
You should've seen the way
we mowed 'em down!

360
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,400
[YUTA] You may have
overdone it, Big Bro.

361
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,817
I mean, spider-jumping on

362
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,358
the student council president
was a little too much.

363
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:10,775
[HINATA]
What do ya expect?

364
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:13,483
We were havin' such a good time,
I couldn't help myself!

365
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,942
Anyway, you're everyone's
inspiration for this.

366
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,233
You guys have given us all hope.

367
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,150
If it wasn't for you,

368
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,942
the wind of revolution
may have never

369
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,775
blown toward our school.

370
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:27,192
We know you'll do something
great at this DDD.

371
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:29,358
Be sure to kill it
in the semifinal!

372
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:30,608
'Kay!

373
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,442
You're about to see the
most amazing performance

374
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,025
Trickstar's ever given!

375
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,983
Man, you sure rallied quickly!

376
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,150
Practically had to scrape
you off the floor earlier!

377
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,608
Guys!

378
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,358
Let's combine all our energy
and make a miracle happen!

379
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,108
[MAO, MAKOTO, SUBARU]
Yeah!

[ALL gasp]

382
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,650
You guys are wunning so wate!

383
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,608
You think you're so special
that you can show up

384
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,067
for a match whenever you want?

385
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,233
Wait, what?

386
00:17:58,317 --> 00:17:59,358
Does this mean you guys

387
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:01,525
are our opponents
for the semifinal?

388
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,358
I hope the four
of you are pwepawed!

389
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:05,692
If we're goin' to do this,
we're gonna win!

390
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:08,067
Guess he still hasn't learned
how to speak clearly.

391

Akehoshi, it's you!

392
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:10,608
Shinonon!

393
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:11,858
I'm glad you're okay.

394
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,900
It was getting so late,
I was worried about you!

395
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:17,400
So your unit made it all the way
to the semifinal, too, huh?

396
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,942
That's great!
I'm proud so of you!

397
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,067
[laughs]

398
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,150
When I heard that you guys

399
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,108
were working so hard,
I was inspired.

400
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,900
It showed me that I really
should be working harder, too!

401

[MITSURU]
Hey! It's almost time to go on!

402
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,567
No regrets. Let's make
this a fair fight!

403
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,025
Agreed! No funny business!

I don't care if it's God or
the Devil. I need an answer.

Please, I'll do

feeling to stop.

this pain in my heart?

Hokuto! Is that you?
