1
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,775
[ANZU] This was something that
happened six months ago,

2
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:16,108
before Akehoshi and the others
had formed Trickstar.

3
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:17,942
Before they were anything.

4
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,858
They performed in the Venus
Cup for the first time.

5
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:23,608
[SUBARU laughing]

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:24,983
[HOKUTO]
C'mon, stand still!

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,150
You're gonna wrinkle
your jacket.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,692
[MAKOTO] It's so funny
that there's basically

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:29,608
no one in the audience.

10
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,858
What do you expect?

11
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:32,775
When you throw together
two students from each

12
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,567
first-year class to make
a unit, the odds of them all

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,233
actually being a good fit
are not very good.

14
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:41,983
Another reason it's dead is
that no one knows who we are.

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,650
[MAKOTO]
You're right. People make plans

16
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,442
to see acts they know,
like the <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> play.

17
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,442
Or the fine versus
Valkyrie concert.

18
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:50,108
They're probably not
interested in much more.

19
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,525
Speaking of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> ,

20
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,608
aren't you going to be playing
the prince in that show?

21
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:55,108
[SUBARU]
Hey, Prince?

22
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:57,025
Don't ever call me that again.

23
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,067
[SUBARU sighs]
Then what do I call you?

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,775
You don't seem to like it
when I call you by your name.

25
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:03,108
[HOKUTO grumbles]

26
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,067
I could be wrong,
but for some reason,

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,525
I thought you were
like me and tired

28
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,650
of riding your
parent's coattails.

29
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,817
And, if so, I figured
having that in common

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,317
might lead to us
becoming better friends.

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,692
When you're an idol, you
don't need to have friends.

32
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,442
Both of our fathers were super
idols and made it to the top

33
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:22,817
without anyone by their
side before or after.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,275
Which is why...

35
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,942
...I've lived my
entire life believing

36
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,400
it's only natural to be alone.

37
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:30,358
Hey, me, too!
But, you know what?

38
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,192
[buzzer sounds]

39
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,442
It's not important.

40
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:36,067
Let's focus on having
a great time out there!

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,733
It's not like anyone's gonna
be paying attention to us.

42
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,233
So, we can do whatever
we want on that stage!

43
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:42,858
This is our moment!

44
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:44,442
"Do whatever we want?"

45
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,567
Right. That is such
a trickster move.

46
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,275
What do you mean
by "trick-star"?

47
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,483
You know what I meant.

48
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,275
The character that
causes trouble.

49
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,400
Like changing the routine
onstage at the last minute.

50
00:01:55,483 --> 00:02:00,775
Oh? So like a trick
being played by stars?

51
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,608
That's exactly what this is!

52
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,567
You're still not
saying it right.

53
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,650
You're saying "star"
when it's "ster."

54
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,150
But it doesn't matter,
you get it.

55
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,233
I agree with you.

56
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:11,567
We've got nothing
to lose by putting

57
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,483
everything we have
into this performance!

58
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,025
Sing like the entire
world is listening!

59
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:18,317
Like we've already won!

60
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,525
[HOKUTO] You were about
to say something earlier.

61
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,900
I feel like I know what it was.

62
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,233
It's true.

63
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,442
I've always done
everything alone.

64
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:36,275
I thought I liked it that way.

65
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,233
But in this moment,
on a school stage

66
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,483
with an insultingly
small audience,

67
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,650
I feel like I could
do this forever.

68
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,067
It's like I'm home.

69
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,150
I don't ever want
this moment to end.

70
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,400
[MAO] I know this concert
is basically a charity

71
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:52,983
put on by the student council,

72
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,817
and the "donation" is getting
to be more popular at school.

73
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,150
But, for me, this performance
is so much more than that.

74
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,442
Up until now, I was satisfied
working behind the scenes--

75
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,858
that's the path I was on.
Then something changed.

76
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:07,692
I don't understand why or how,

77
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:10,317
but I'm having so
much fun up here.

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,858
[MAKOTO sighs]
These guys are amazing.

79
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,025
They're not afraid to just
let go, be bold, and dance!

80
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,317
I need to calm down
and stop freaking out.

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,608
I came to Yumenosaki Academy
because I wanted to change.

82
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,400
That's not gonna happen
if I keep running

83
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,067
from things that scare me.

84
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,233
[SUBARU]
Don't worry!

85
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,442
Even if you mess up,
we'll cover for you!

86
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,983
[HOKUTO] Yeah, we're all
in this together!

87
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,608
[MAO] If you're having fun,
you're doing it right!

88
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,233
[MAKOTO]
Okay!

89
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,942
[SUBARU] Nobody's perfect,
so we shouldn't

90
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,942
be stressing about
a perfect performance.

91
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,317
If we're all doing our best,

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,775
we're putting on the
best show possible!

93
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:45,108
[ANZU] This performance
was one of the main reasons

94
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:49,650
their unit was formed and,
eventually, named "Trickstar."

95
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,275
[ADONIS]
What's the matter with them?

96
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,275
Uh--

97
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,733
Kanzaki, have you
heard anything?

98
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,233
I think it's exactly
what Sir Hasumi said.

99
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:35,817
The student council president is
just a bitter, vengeful hater.

100
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,150
Hope they don't
dwell on it too much.

101
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,733
It's not worth it.

102
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,733
[coughs]

103
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,400
[CHIAKI]
Quit slacking, Takamine!

104
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:49,525
I need you to step it up
and be strong, like me!

105
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,067
[MIDORI]
Yes, Captain.

106
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,275
But I can't if I choke from
being slapped on the back

107
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,358
while drinking water.

108
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:55,817
Aren't you funny?

109
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,483
I noticed that Akehoshi and
Isara weren't here today.

110
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,442
Have you heard anything
or happen to know why?

111
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,858
[MIDORI]
How would I know their life?

112
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,192
You should ask a second-year
student that stuff.

113
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,108
[SHINOBU] I know why
they weren't here today.

114
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,692
[CHIAKI]
Hey, Sengoku.

115
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,608
I heard they got in trouble
with the student council

116
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,025
and were told they couldn't
perform together anymore.

117
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:15,525
The student council wants
Trickstar cancelled.

118
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,858
Seriously? There's no way.

119
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,733
They would never do
something like that.

120
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,983
I hope you're right,
but the guys have already

121
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,358
been separated, so, I mean,
it kinda looks like

122
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,942
they're already doing it.

123
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,275
Oh, man.

124
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,317
[CHIAKI]
I can't believe them.

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,733
[thudding]

126
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,150
[HOKUTO]
It really was fun. Thank you.

127
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,400
Working with you
was the first time

128
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,733
I actually liked being an idol.

129
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:51,775
But, why?

130
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:53,692
What's the point
of becoming an idol?

131
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:56,442
[CROWD cheering]

132
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,358
[SUBARU]
Wish I could ask my dad.

133
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,483
He'll always have a special
place in my heart.

134
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,192
Whenever he was on stage,

135
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:06,733
he always shone brighter
than anyone else.

136
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,442
So much that I thought
I could actually

137
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,275
touch that shine.

138
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:13,442
That's why I always desperately
followed behind him.

139
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:17,400
And why I'm here
at Yumenosaki Academy.

140
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,067
But I did it wrong.

141
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,525
I insisted on doing
it all on my own.

142
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,608
And before I knew it,
I'd pushed everyone away

143
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,150
until there was no one left.

144
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:34,317
[CHIAKI]
Akehoshi!

145
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,233
[SUBARU]
Huh? Captain Chiichan?

146
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:38,692
Wait what did you just say?

147
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,483
Please don't use a title
when you talk to me,

148
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,025
"Captain" sounds so formal!

149
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,567
We're still friends, aren't we?

150
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,150
[sighs] Why are you still here?

151
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,567
I thought all the
club activities

152
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,025
ended a long time ago.

153
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,733
What's with the awkward
small talk, Akehoshi?!

154
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:53,900
Just relax and think of me

155
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,983
like an older brother,
or a father even!

156
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,650
It's me, your pal
Morisawa Chiaki!

157
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,192
I've got a big heart,

Besides, only units
with two or more people

Be honest. Do you
really think you can

175
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,275

until the end?

No worries. You don't
have to answer now.

178
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,442
[HOKUTO] Unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do.

179

We're going to be
crushed mercilessly.

180

We hesitate.
We depend on others.

The president--he knows it.

182
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,692
That's what he's
expecting us to do.

183
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,192
I just...

184
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,025
I don't wanna stand by and
watch Trickstar be destroyed.

185
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,067
I have good memories of us.

186
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,900
And I wouldn't want any
of them to become tainted.

187
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:25,608
I understand. Being part
of Trickstar was a dream.

188
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,858
It gave me hope.

189
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,442
So, to see it all be
erased would be like

190
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,858
watching the light slowly
dissolve from my life.

191
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,317
But at the core of this,

192
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,858
I might just be running
away in general.

193
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:41,567
From the status quo,
from my painful thoughts.

By the way, have you heard
anything from Makoto?

I haven't seen him since

him for some reason.

He was absent today.

just happened.

Doesn't being constantly
on edge ever exhaust you?

You've always been
this way, Akiyan.

Thank you all for coming out.

The DDD is an event that
determines who will represent

336
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:15,108
our school in Japan's greatest
idol festival, the SS.

337
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,358
Those chosen as our
representatives will perform

338
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,442
in that concert at
the end of the year.

339
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,942
All we ask of you is that
you enjoy the show tonight.

340
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,400
For those of you
who have never been

341
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,733
to a DDD competition before,
I'll explain how it works.

342
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,942
If you were to take a
walk around the campus,

343
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,692
you'd notice newly
constructed outdoor stages.

344
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:35,317
On those stages, each of
the units that our school

345
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,692
has selected will perform under
the battle of the bands system.

346
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,525
The way you will vote
is with glow sticks.

347
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,692
They're color coordinated
with each band.

348
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,483
Light up the
corresponding glowstick

349
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,942
in front of the unit
of your choice. Then...

350
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,400
Based on those results,
the last unit remaining

351
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,567
at the end of the show will
be our school representative.

352
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,608
They will go on to
participate in the SS.

That is incredibly noble of you.

469
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,650
But you really don't
have much time

470
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,650
before the first match begins.

471
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,817
Besides, how do we know
that Yuuki wasn't already

472
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,608
forced to turn in the paperwork
required to change units?

473
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,525
Still feel like you should go?

474
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:31,400

I do. And I'm not gonna give up!

475
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,942
Until this point, everyone
has been rescuing me.

476
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,358
They've been constantly
supporting me.

477
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:39,192
That's why, this time,

478
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,567
I'm gonna be the one
who rescues them!

479
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:52,608
[SUBARU] I see it. Trickstar.
The star of hope.

480
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,567
It isn't gone yet!

481
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,817
[STUDENT 08A] Hurry!
The concert's about to start!

482
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,817
[STUDENT 08B]
Okay, wait for me!

483
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:37,608
[IZUMI]
I apologize, Yuu.

484
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:40,150
That took much longer
than I thought it would.
