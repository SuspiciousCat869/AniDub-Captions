Aw, hey, come on, Teach,

00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:12,442
you don't have to be
so mean all the time.

[SHU gasps]

00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:19,275
Hello. It's been quite
a while, hasn't it, Itsuki?

5
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:20,817
Sorry...

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,067
...Valkyrie.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,567
You've fallen so far.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,025
I remember a time when you were

9
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,483
known as Yumenosaki
Academy's Emperor.

10
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:33,233
Now here you are performing at a
pitiful concert venue like this.

11
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,025
It's pathetic, isn't it?

12
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:37,442
Yeah, why don't you
mind your own business?

13
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,608
I'm the student council
president at our school,

14
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:41,150
in case you've forgotten.

15
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:44,733
So when units are unmotivated,
it's my job to lecture them.

16
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:46,858
You think we're not motivated?

17

[EICHI]
Oh, dry your eyes.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,025
Why don't you
participate in a DreFes?

19
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:53,317
I'd love for you to show
everyone what you can do--

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,358
to see you on a shining stage.

21
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:58,483
Is that what you came here
to talk to us about?

22
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,233
I'll get to the point.

23
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:03,358
There are people in favor
of disbanding Valkyrie.

24

[gasps]

25
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,108
It's the underground venues
at which you perform.

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,692
Makes funding your unit
seem like a huge waste.

27
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,108
And just who do you
think you are, man?

28
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,567
Can you be quiet
for a minute, please?

29
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,817
You want us to disband,

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,275
that's your opinion and
you're entitled to it.

31
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:19,525
It's not like the school ever

32
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:21,733
offered us very much
assistance anyway.

33
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:25,067
However, I will be the one to
decide if and when that happens.

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,233
I won't take orders
from you. Got it?

35
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,025
[EICHI]
You've heard of Ra*bits, right?

36
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:34,275
Of course you have,
it's your dear Nito's unit.

37
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:37,275
They remind me of a family
of newborn bunnies.

38
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,192
They'd get blown away
with one breath, right?

39
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,775
Nito's no longer a concern
of mine, so what do I care?

40
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,108
Maybe you don't,

41
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,025
but the fact remains
they're up against AKATSUKI

42
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,817
at the Tanabata Festival after
being defeated by them once.

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,025
I bet those bunnies'll
end up skinned and skewered.

44
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:56,942
And in the most brutal
possible way, too.

45
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:57,900
Heh.

it gets worse and worse!

You're killing me!

00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,733
[WATARU] To not let you
live, nor to let you die

49
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,317

That way it can rebuild

Sorry, you just had me worried.

doing with those things?

there are a few who haven't.

156
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,650
[SHU]
<i>Trés bien!</i>

157
00:07:58,733 --> 00:07:59,817
[ANZU, MIKA gasp]

158
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,567
[MIKA] What's going on
over there, Teach?

159
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,442
[SHU] I've come up with the
most perfect Festival plan!

160
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,942
The Tanabata Festival is
still a week away, right?

161
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,400
You will have everything down
perfectly by then, understood?

162
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:13,442
Hitting me with sorta short
notice this time, aren'tcha?

163
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,192
Know your enemy as
you know yourself,

164
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,150
and you shall not
fear a hundred battles.

165
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,733
And our enemy
doesn't know a thing

166
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,525
about the current Valkyrie.

167
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,150
That boy is such a fool.

168
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,358
He's been sitting on my throne
ever since I've been gone,

169
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:26,733
and I think it's
time to kick him off.

170
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,942
Later.

171
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,442
Hey, wait, where are you going?

172
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,817
--[sighs]
--[crash]

173
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
So... what were you saying?

174
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,608
[ANZU]
Really?

175
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,400
[ANZU] And so, with tons
of students volunteering

176
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:41,775
their time to help,

177
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:45,275
preparations for the
Tanabata Festival continued...

178
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:53,233
[ANZU] ...until finally,
the day of the festival arrived.

179
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,483
[WATARU] Amazing! Ladies and
gentlemen, I hope you're ready!

180
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,983
Let the Tanabata Festival begin!

181
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,067
And even though
nobody bothered to ask me,

182
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,650
I will still be your
MC this evening!

183
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,942
Give it up for...

184
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:09,650
...the one and only
Hibiki Wataru!

185
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,108
Let's celebrate Orihime and
Hikoboshi's romantic meeting

186
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,275
with a little song and dance.

187
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:18,192
Great. You can hit the
lights first, then the music.

188
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,733
[WATARU]
What a glorious night!

189
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,483
A night of miracles together!

190
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:25,900
May it be amazing with love,
blessings, and more miracles!

191
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,525
I need someone
to bring me my bow.

192
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:31,317
It's time to shoot down the
embarrassments of our school.

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,025
This is hardly the time or
place to be thinking about that.

194
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,942
In the Tanabata Festival, the
winner's the one who stays in.

195
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,525
We've gotta stay focused.

196
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,275
Of course.

197
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:43,233
Then AKATSUKI will have to
keep the stage all to ourselves.

198
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,442
[NAZUNA]
Don't you sound confident?

199
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:47,317
Anzu created this stage.

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,525
And her vision was that everyone

201
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,942
would share it with
a smile on their face.

202
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,067
So that goes for you,
too, grumpy pants!

203
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,192
I think we'll start by
kicking you off first,

204
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:58,483
then we'll make our way
straight to the top.

205
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,775
We're not the same
as we were before!

206
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:03,067
[WATARU] What makes this
Tanabata Festival unique

207
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,025
is that you can show
off your own performance

208
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,317
whenever you'd like,
even if that happens to be

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,067
in the middle of
an opponent's song!

210
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,483
The first match
will be between...

211
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,775
[CROWD cheering]

212
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:17,317
[WATARU]
...AKATSUKI and Ra*bits!

213
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,567
[WATARU]
Ladies and gentlemen!

214
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,775
The first match of
the Tanabata Festival

215
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,942
has gloriously come to an end.

216
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:39,317
And the winner is... AKATSUKI!

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,608
[CROWD cheering]

218
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,192
Aw, they beat us again!

219
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,442
How strange. I thought
we did pretty good.

220
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,067
This is terrible, you guys.

221
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm really sorry, Big Bro.

222
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,483
It's okay.

223
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,733
At least people got to see
what we're capable of.

224
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,067
So I would say that
was worth it for me.

225
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,275
AKATSUKI! Congrats.

226
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,525
Yeah, thanks, man. You guys
put up a pretty solid fight.

227
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,192
[NAZUNA]
Hm.

228
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,733
[WATARU] And now, in one of
the most exciting traditions

229
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:09,108
of the Tanabata Festival,
we will grant the wish

230
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,775
of someone in our
amazing audience

231
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,900
who voted for
the winner tonight!

232
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,067
And the lucky person who will
have their wish granted is...

233
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,233
...you! Right there!

234
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,775
[STUDENT A]
No way! What?!

235
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:19,900
[WATARU]
I'm waiting, Keito!

236
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,150
Shoot me with
your big, scary bow!

237
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,775
Well, get on with it.

238
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,108
You fool.

239
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:26,983
Don't try to make it
sound like it's easy to do.

240
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,817
[WATARU] Okay, well maybe add
a little "bang" sound effect.

241
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,983
[KEITO] That's not the
sound you make for an arrow.

242
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,942
Okay, fine.

243
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,692
B-Bang!

244
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,108
[CROWD screams]

245
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,400
Wonderful! That's what
I call an entertainer!

246
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,525
[SOUMA]
That was excellent, Sir Hasumi.

247
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:51,317
[KEITO] Kanzaki, I need you
to end my life right now!

248
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,150
That was actually pretty good.

249
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,900
Who's ready to see the next unit

250
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,067
AKATSUKI will be
competing against?

251
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
[TSUMUGI]
Excuse me!

252
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,525
What's this?

253
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,025
[TSUMUGI] Sorry, can I
please have a quick moment?

254
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,983
[whispering] Hear me out.
We've run into a bit of trouble.

255
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,025
What?

256
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,692
Something's going on with
our plans for the venue.

257
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,900
Trouble with the
workers we hired.

258
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,358
It's unclear. So I have
to go check it out.

259
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,650
If you're sure about that,

260
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,067
then AKATSUKI's gonna
have to leave the stage.

261
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,108
There are other
representatives here.

262
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,150
Sir Hasumi, I feel that
we should have a say in--

263
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,067
Can't you take a hint, Kanzaki?

264
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,067
Uh, hold on.
What does that mean?

265
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,067
We yield the right to stay
on stage and pass it to you.

266
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,025
[CROWD]
What?!

267
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,733
[KEITO]
Listen, I know this won't

268
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,067
erase all the hardships
we've caused.

269
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,400
But we'd like to do our
best to make it up to you,

270
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,108
even if it's just a little.

271
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,983
Because of where you are now,

272
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,608
we can leave the rest
to you without worry.

273
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,483
You mean it? I'm grateful.

274
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,733
All right, Ra*bits,
you better fight a good fight.

275
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:53,025
Do you guys still
have it in you?

276
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:55,983
I'm more warmed up now than I've
ever been! So let's do this!

277
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,900
To be honest, I'm actually
pretty tired, friends,

278
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,233
but I'll do my best!

279
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:03,358
I have no problem
continuing. I'm in.

280
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,900
[NAZUNA] We've become so
strong through all this.

281
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,192
So why don't we celebrate
with a winning round?

282
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,817
[ALL]
Yeah!

283
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,650
It doesn't matter who our
opponent is! We won't lose!

284
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,150
[EICHI]
Such a bold new attitude, Nito.

285
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,692
--[NAZUNA] Hm?
--[CROWD cheering]

286
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,442
[NAZUNA]
Tenshouin?

287
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:21,858
Does that mean our
next opponent is fine?

288
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,275
[WATARU]
Oh, my! It appears that fine

289
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,942
has already declared
themselves the next opponent!

290
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:30,067
Well, I suppose my job here
is done then, isn't it?

291
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,817
You're correct, Wataru.
Hurry up and get down here.

292
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:37,192
[EICHI]
Dinner is about to begin.

293
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,650
And the main dish
is fresh bunnies.

294
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,317
[NAZUNA]
What'll we do?

295
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,275
How are we up against fine?

296
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,108
I can't be utterly
defeated by him again!

297
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,983
Don't do anything! Stop, fine!

298
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:53,358
Your opponent is Valkyrie!
Or did you forget?

299

[MITSURU, TOMOYA, HAJIME gasp]

300
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,650
Hey, Teach! How long're you
gonna fiddle with that outfit?

301
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,108
Don't rush me, Kagehira. Sheesh.

302
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,233
That crowd was making me dizzy.

It's Tea-- Itsuki.

304
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,983
Kagehira? What brings
you guys here tonight?

305
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:11,358
[SHU] Don't you dare talk
to me so casually, traitor.

306
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,192
Hmph.

307
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,983
I guess this means
another worthless show

308

How horribly deplorable!
Real art is dead!

Oh, you're just in time, Itsuki.

311
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,483
I suppose there's
no longer any need

312

pathetic rodents.

[NAZUNA] I am truly
grateful they came to help,

316
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,108
but Itsuki and
Kagehira can't perform

317
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,108
in front of a huge
crowd like this.

318

[SHU] Are you trying to think
of something insulting to say?

Try not to push
beyond your limits.

That goes for you, too, fine.

321

These days it seems
you've gotten carried away

Let's just enjoy it...

Hey, Itsuki--

00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,942
I think you're the perfect
person to leave this with.

You're on the broadcast
committee, right?

330
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:08,733
So this should be
a smooth transition.

331
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,650
Are you sure, Wataruchin?

332
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,483
Isn't Itsuki your friend?

333
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,983
That doesn't matter.

334
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,900
It's not the first time this
turn of events has happened.

335
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,567
Turning pain and
stubbornness to pleasure.

to dance while smiling!

The second match
tonight will be fine,

led by the Emperor, against
the former top unit, Valkyrie!

341
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,400
This is a match between
the current and former suns--

342
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,275
a battle between old and new!

343
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,483
Who will come out on top?

344
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,900
All right, Teach. Let's go.

345
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:52,358
[SHU] Hmph. Don't ruin
this for me, Kagehira.

346
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:55,358
I'll offer you high praise
you if you perform well.

[TORI]
Whoa, that choreography!

348

Why did you choose
such complicated moves?

349
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,025
[MIKA]
I dunno.

350
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:29,067
I'm just applying the
lessons that Teach taught me.

351
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,525
And even if I fail at this,

352
00:16:30,608 --> 00:16:34,233
I'm still his one and only
doll when I'm on stage.

353
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,400
And that makes me happier
than anything out here.

[YUZURU]
I do not approve.

Your body does not have
the strength to hold up.

356
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,900
You're making a
choice to sacrifice

357
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:45,692
any possibility of
a future as an idol.

358
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,567
[MIKA]
If Teach will see me as useful,

359
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,233
I'll happily trade
anything to help him.

360

My future, my life, everything!

I don't care what happens to me.

I've never seen
Valkyrie live before.

amazing, aren't they?

What is this?

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,858
This performance goes beyond

fine's best songs
and dance moves.

It takes you to
a higher dimension.

We blindly searched to
advance our performance,

but Itsuki, you...

370

[SHU] You finally remembered,
Tenshouin. Good job!

You know who the top idol of
Yumenosaki Academy truly is!

[KANATA] I know it
hurts to lose in general,

389
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,942
but it's worse when it comes
right after such a huge triumph.

390
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,067
The performances we put on are
better rehearsed and designed

391
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,233
and far more creative
than anything fine does.

392
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,358
And yet more fans
would rather watch them

than appreciate real art.

It shouldn't be a shock
that we lost with fewer votes.

Those artless philistines
couldn't comprehend

what they were seeing
when we were on stage.

They have no clue
what we've accomplished.

That may be true.

But even without
artistic intelligence,

They knew they were watching
something special and amazing.

Even if they can't describe it,

The ones who understand this
best are the members of fine.

Oh, right, the butler

that he has escorted
the princess home

and he wanted me
to let you know.

He seemed to be in a little
more shock than usual,

00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,442
For us, you seem like
a terrifying mess,

464
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,733
yet we love you.

465
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,275
That make sense?

466
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,358
It's actually pretty confusing.

467
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,567
People like you can
drive out monsters.

468
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,567
But you've also
driven out magicians.

469
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,525
You're arrogant and sinful.

470
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,650
Traits people gain
from allowing themselves

471
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,358
to be controlled by their anger.

472
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,150
Anger you find
yourself filled with

473
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,567
when what you thought was
magic turns out to be skill.

474
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:33,608
And sometimes you're as
innocent as a small child.

475
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,400
You live your life
to the absolute fullest.

476
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,567
Amazing.

477
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,358
Someone like you
should have secured a spot

478
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:41,608
for themselves in Heaven.

479
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:45,442
But you decided you wanted
to explore Hell instead.

480
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:48,192
Even though a reality much
more beautiful than dreams

481
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,192
is always present in this world.

482
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,608
I just remembered
who taught me that.

483
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,317
It was you.

484
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,525

That year, the Tanabata Festival

485
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,858
lasted long into the night.

486
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,983
It was as if all our
wishes gathered light

487
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,942
to be placed beneath
the beautiful stars...

488
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,192

...until the end of time.
