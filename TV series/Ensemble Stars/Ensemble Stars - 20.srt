Hey, Jun! Look at

Not really. We're kinda

There's one about
a crazy businessman.

He basically ruled the
entire entertainment industry,

42

and because of that,

43

he could buy or demand
anything he wanted.

of his secrets were revealed.

[GROUP gasps]

[HIYORI]
That boy was Nagisa.

48
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:38,942
He should have
been in middle school

49
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,442
at the time he was rescued.

50
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,692
But instead, it appeared
that all he ever did

51
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:46,983
was sit in a beautiful room
dressed just like a doll.

52
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:50,400
He never had a chance to
receive a formal education.

53
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,483
My family took
him in for a time,

54
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,817
and he told us his dream
was to become an idol.

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,567
I actually started
to have the same dream.

56
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,442
We would sing and dance in
my room late into the night.

57
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,108
We spent so much time together

58
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:06,608
being happy, laughing,
and having fun.

59
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:09,275
But in accordance with
his agency's business strategy,

60
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:12,358
the school is now drastically
changing their policy.

61
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,942
They've been merging
with other schools, for one,

62
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:18,442
and treating their non-honor
students like low-class slaves.

63
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,692
That was more of Ibara's
doing, though, right?

64
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,233
He was the one
that took over part of

enterprise, remember?

66
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,108
[HIYORI] That's true,
but Nagisa was in isolation

67
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:34,275
during some very
critical developmental years.

68
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,525
There's a high chance

69
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,358
that he still follows
orders without question.

His mind is forever
caught in a hole

in to guide him toward an exit.

hasn't it?

And you're the same

The same, crude, battle-hungry
dog who salivates for drama.

you've changed quite a bit.

162

Speaking of dogs,

163
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,858
congrats on becoming
Himemiyas' personal lapdog.

164
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,025
I found a path that lead to
the life I've always wanted.

165
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:08,608
Not one where I'm forced
to live a certain way.

166
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,233
My life is my own.

Whatever you say,

168

at the Autumn Live.

I show mercy to no one,
not even old friends.

170
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,817
[SUBARU] Did you happen
to get the message, Hokke?

171
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,650
The one that Sally sent for you?

172
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,025
Yeah.

173
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:28,400
He said that Isara went
to Reimei Academy with Anzu.

174
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,817
And apparently they
heard a lot from Eve.

175
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,358
We can count on them!

176
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:33,525
It would be great if I could

177
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,733
count on all of us
to rehearse together,

178

but someone's always busy.

Are these separate lessons
meant to bring us down?

part of their strategy?

00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,900
Probably.

Great! I knew they were sneaky.

183

Just pretend to
fall for their traps

so we can keep tabs on them.
Seems to be working so far.

All we can do is
trust in the end

for the same thing.

Interesting.

195
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,692
Isara and the
others didn't just go

196
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,858
to Reimei Academy
for information.

[SUBARU]
Hm? What does that mean?

198
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,817
Another goal they
had was to contact

Hey there!

Just as the statement suggested,
I'm Hocchan's father!

Thank you for taking
such good care of my son.

Seriously?

211

You never even came to parents'
day at school because of work!

[SEIYA] I wish you all
could've seen how cute he was

00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,650
when he was little.

214
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,692
[SEIYA]
I remember coming home,

215
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,775
and he would jump into my
arms the minute he saw me.

Can you be quiet
for just a second?

Nobody here wants
to know about that crap!

Wow, he is so grouchy.

the story, Hokke's dad?

232
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,150
What brings you here?

00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:33,192
Actually, I was
invited here by them.

Huh?

our opponents are
in for a big surprise.

I love how pumped up you are!

It's because your dad
came to support you, right?

00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,817
[HOKUTO]
It was Anzu.

252
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,650
She asked my dad for this favor.

253
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,358
Does this mean he's
part of their plan?

We're supposed to be taking
revenge for the Summer Live,

255

but apparently, there's no
winner at the Autumn Live.

256
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:45,275
Just because there's
nothing official

00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:46,900
doesn't mean we can't compete.

258

We can still find a way to

259

gather up a bigger crowd
than Adam. Then we'd win!

It felt like they actually
wanted us to join CosPro.

And maybe they wanted
to mentor us and take us in.

but I'm gonna burn brighter
than you've ever seen!

315
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:15,775
I'll become a star
just like you!

316
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,650
Yes!

317
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,275
[TRICKSTAR MEMBERS laughing]

318
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,608
[MAO]
You guys! Calm down!

319
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,817
I need you all
to standby, please.

320
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
[ALL]
'Kay!

321
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,275
[MAKOTO]
No way.

322
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:35,150
This is a pretty big crowd for
the away team, don't you think?

323
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,108
I just figured
everyone would ignore us

324
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,025
since we're an outside
unit they don't know.

325
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,775
I think I get it now.

326
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,192
What do you mean by that?

327
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,567
[HOKUTO]
Long story,

328
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,525
but remember when Anzu
asked my dad for a favor?

329
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,317
He must've ended up
telling all his students

330
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,025
at Reimei Academy to show up,

331
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,525
as well as its
affiliate schools.

332
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,525
[MAKOTO]
I see, so that's why I don't see

333
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,358
any Shuetsu Academy
honor students here.

334
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,733
[HOKUTO]
It's possible that word about

335
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,817
Yumenosaki Academy's
revolution has surfaced.

336
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,317
Oh, that makes sense.

337
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,483
And now, it's our turn!
Time to get revenge!

338
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,650
At least we know
that part's not a dream!

339
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,358
As long as we're together...

340
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,400
...there's no way we can lose!

341
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,650
All right. Listen up, guys.

342
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,817
We'll get on that stage
and gain some new fans!

343
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,567
Ready? Let's go!

344
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,317
[TRICKSTAR MEMBERS]
Yeah!

345
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,567
Yeah!

346
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:31,692
[CROWD cheering]

347
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,567
[CROWD cheers]

348
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,025
I don't feel like
following the script today.

349
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:01,942
[IBARA]
Huh?

350
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,817
It's useless anyway.

351
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,858
You have a problem
with the script?

352
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,567
How 'bout this part? [laughs]

353
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,192
That'd be sad.
Guess it isn't on-brand

354
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,025
for someone as kind
as Your Excellency.

355
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:17,317
[NAGISA]
That's not the issue.

356
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,942
Why aren't they still
sulking over their loss?

357
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:24,275
They're revolutionaries,
just like the rumors said.

358
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:28,067
No, they're Trickstars,
just like their name.

359
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,525
[NAGISA chuckles]

360
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,400
[NAGISA] It's been a while
since I've been this happy.

361
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,442
[IBARA] Those little
brats figured out our plan,

362
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:36,150
and now it's completely
backfired on us.

363
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:39,650
[NAGISA] I remember the one
who taught me to sing.

364
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:45,067
[IBARA] Ah, yes, it was
Akehoshi's father, wasn't it?

365
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,192
[NAGISA] It feels like destiny
gave me this opportunity--

366
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,692
a chance to compete
against his son.

367
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,608
God was being quite
cruel today, too.

368
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,942
The world is full
of perplexing things--

369
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:59,567
things that lead us astray.

370
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,525
Listen. Let's refrain from
acting as the imposing kings,

371
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,150
if only for today.

372
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,650
[IBARA] Right. Well, the
crowd on Trickstar's side

373
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,400
is full of non-honor students.

374
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,817
So, unfortunately, their
scores won't be very high.

375
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,483
They won't trust us if
we act as oppressive rulers,

376
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:16,733
so let's lay low.

377
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:17,733
[NAGISA]
But the crowd could

378
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,525
change its mind
if we don't hurry.

379
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,942
Now, let's go back in time.

380
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,525
Back to paradise,
before original sin--

381
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,483
before God turned against us!

382
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,775
Your wish is my command,
Your Excellency.

383
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,025
[CROWD cheers]

384
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,733
[CROWD gasps]

385
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,358
[CROWD chattering]

386
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,025
It seems like something's
wrong with this crowd.

387
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:42,025
That's what I was thinking.

388
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:44,400
Look at the stage over there!

389
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:51,483
[CROWD cheering]

390
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:58,983
[IBARA] I will annihilate
my enemies at all costs!

391
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,400
Mark my words.

392
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:03,775
Infiltrate! Charge in! Conquer!

393
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,525
This is my reason for living!

394
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:08,483
The hell of this world
feels like heaven to me!

395
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,983
[IBARA laughs]

396
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:15,067
Fun fact: No one will ever
love me as much as I do!

397
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,983
So enlightened.

398
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,483
Such pleasure.
It's the devil's trap.

399
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,233
But then again, we're no angels.

400
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:25,067
Father, when you became God,

401
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,567
you went to Heaven and left
your flesh and blood behind.

402
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,650
[NAGISA]
You had a passion for idols,

403
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,442
and you dominated the
entertainment business.

404
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,775
The idols you brought into this
world were iconic and unrivaled.

405
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,733
You loved them.

406
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,108
So if I become an idol,

407
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:45,067
maybe I'll finally
understand what love's like.

408
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,983
Oh, Father, that's all I want.

409
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:50,942
It's the only thing
I've ever longed for.

410
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,317
[HOKUTO]
When Adam--

411
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,817
I mean, when Ran Nagisa
started singing,

412
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,525
he changed the direction
of this entire game.

413
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:40,775
[SUBARU]
I hate to admit it,

414
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,025
but they're all
extremely talented.

415
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,733
[MAKOTO] Adam might
have the advantage now,

416
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:48,775
sure, but it's still
a close competition, right?

417
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,733
[MAO]
Watch out, Adam.

418
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:53,483
I may just be an
average flashlight,

419
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:57,442
but I'm still shining so
brightly, I could blind you.

420
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,025
[MAO]
One thing I know for sure,

421
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:04,650
no matter how this turns out,
I'll never bow down to you.
