1
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:12,233
[HIYORI]
Hokuto! Are you awake?

2
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:15,067
Try not to look like
a mountain of sadness, please.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,192
[grunts]

4
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:17,608
[ANZU]
It's summer.

5
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:20,525
Trickstar is rehearsing
nonstop for their next event--

6
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:22,358
the Summer Live.

7
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:25,317
So the rest of us have
to work just as hard.

8
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:27,983
[ANZU]
Change it?

9
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,150
Well, yeah, since
we're in a theme park

10
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,983
and since Ra*bits
is performing with us.

11
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,817
Don't you think it makes sense
to try something different?

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,983
[RA*BITS MEMBERS]
Mm-mm!

13
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,525
[WATARU]
Very well.

14
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:41,483
Then, instead of twins,
why don't you become triplets?

15
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,358
What the heck?

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,025
When'd he get here?

17
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:45,608
Become triplets?

18
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,233
I'm delighted that
you're so intrigued!

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,775
What do you think of this?

20
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,900
How about a dance battle
between both of these teams?

21
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,983
Well, Producer?

22
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,150
It's brilliant!

23
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,358
What are we gonna
call our teams then?

24
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,192
[sighs]

25
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,733
I know!

26
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,192
How 'bout something easy, like
"Pink Team" and "Blue Team"?

27
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,108
And you'll still be
able to tell us apart

28
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:11,983
because we're wearing our team
color headphones and hairpins.

29
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,983
That'll be easy for
people to see, too!

30
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,942
Sorry, Big Bro, there's no
way I'm gonna lose this match!

31
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,733
Don't apologize!
That's what I wanna hear, Yuta!

32
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:21,483
Tomo won't even be able to talk

33
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,525
when he gets a load
of our dance moves!

34
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,150
Wait a minute, why are
you only mentioning me?

35
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,442
'Kay, let's do it! Sounds fun!

36
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:32,358
[WATARU] Amazing! Fabulous!
Fantastic! Phenomenal!

37
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:04,983
[ANZU]
And just like that,

38
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,858
it was the day
before the Summer Live.

39
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:10,275
Time flew by quickly, didn't it?

40
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,608
Yeah, but this is
how it's always been.

41
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,150
Remember the S1?
And then the DDD?

42
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,067
Felt like we barely
had any time to prepare.

43
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,275
It's all so intense.
It's been a while.

44
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,608
What do you mean?

45
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,192
[HOKUTO]
I mean since we were chosen

46
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:27,900
as the representatives for the
SS, I thought we had made it.

47
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,858
But that's not the case.
We're still on this journey.

48
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,275
We can't stop moving forward

49
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:35,483
just because we gained
satisfaction from one challenge.

50
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,108
[HIYORI]
Yeah, you're right!

51
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:40,275
You should soak up everything
you can from me while I'm here.

52
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:42,025
Not every day that
you have the opportunity

53
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:43,650
to share the stage with me.

54
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,775
[HOKUTO]
What's this about?

55
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,358
Look, I don't care
how we get results,

56
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,900
as long as you and your
group aren't holding me back.

57
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,650
That cool?

58
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,858
[HOKUTO]
Yeah, fine.

59
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:54,442
Look closely and
prepare to be surprised.

60
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,067
Ahh!

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,233
--Wow. What's happening?
--What in the world?

62
00:03:58,317 --> 00:03:59,108
Okay?

63
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,900
You're showing us a jaunty pose?

64
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,608
Isn't this what you
wanted us to do?

65
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm trying to get more
in tune with the other guys,

66
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:05,900
since I'm usually so serious.

67
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,483
So, yeah, I thought it
would help me fit in.

68
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,650
Well?

69
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,233
Are you going to say anything?

70
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,025
It's not that bad, to be honest.

71
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:15,317
But I'd have to deduct points
since you're blushing.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,608
Your timing felt
kinda awkward, man.

73
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,442
I was surprised you struck
such a cheerful pose.

74
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,733
You're saying it sucked?

75
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:24,192
It was a really good effort.

76
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,025
Come on, it's time
for our lesson!

77
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,358
[HOKUTO]
Today's the last day we...

78
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,400
[MAKOTO] Why do I feel
so uneasy all of a sudden?

79
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,817
[MAO] I'm hoping Tomoe
will have some...

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,483
[knocking]

81
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,817
Hey, anyone here?

82
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,108
Yes, who are you?

83
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,650
That's not our school's uniform.

84
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,858
Wait, are you one of the kids
who's here for the Summer Live?

85
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:46,275
I need to submit some documents
I was told were required.

86
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,650
Oh, that's right.
Here. I'll give 'em a call.

87
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:54,067
Hey, there, Akiyan?
Yeah, hi, it's Jin.

88
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,692
[JUN]
Jin?

89
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,442
A student from Reimei
Academy just walked in.

90
00:04:58,525 --> 00:04:59,650
Can you come talk to him?

91
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,317
--[JUN gasps]
--[SAGAMI] Thank you.

92
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:04,317
[JUN]
Are you the former super idol,

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,233
Jin Sagami, by any chance?

94
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,317
Huh?

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,275
I almost didn't recognize you.

96
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,025
Yeah? You saying you're
a fan of mine or something?

97
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,650
I didn't think any
of the younger crowd

98
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,150
these days knew who I was.

99
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,525
That's flattering, actually.

100
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,942
[growls]

101
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,150
Hey, if you wanted an autograph,
you could've asked me.

102
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,067
I'm just kidding.

103
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,233
Goddamn!

104
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,358
[gasps]

105
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,275
I'm surprised you
don't recognize me.

106
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,775
I'm Jun Sazanami.

107
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,608
Sazanami?

108
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:33,733
My dad was your rival when
you were still an active idol.

109
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:36,525
Any of this ringing a bell?

110
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,775
For as long as I can remember,

111
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:42,150
my dad's lived his
life as a broken man.

112
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,275
He never treated
me like a human.

113
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,317
He's never said he loved me.

114
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
I'm not here to
help seek revenge

115
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,817
for someone as twisted
as that, don't worry.

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
But I was curious
about something.

117
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,733
After watching old videos,

118
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:57,233
I guess I found some
respect for you.

119
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,483
[JUN] I thought that
maybe my dad was happy

120
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,983
to have been beat out by
such an impressive performer,

121
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,192
so I accepted that.

122
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:08,150
But I couldn't have
been more wrong.

123
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,150
My dad's life was ruined by
a useless guy that looks like

124
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:14,233
he doesn't get that happy hour
typically happens after work.

125
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,483
And apparently completely
forgot how to shave his face!

126
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:21,150
I don't care what
you think of me,

127
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,567
but don't interfere
with my students.

128
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,275
Here's the thing, Jin.

129
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,608
My dad raised me to
seek revenge for him.

130
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,358
That's why he enrolled
me in Reimei Academy.

131
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:34,733
However, my dad and I
are two different people.

132
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,233
Although, now
that you mention it,

133
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:39,483
beating your students
might make me feel better.

134
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,442
I appreciate the suggestion.

135
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,608
[door opens, closes]

136
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,650
I was only doing this
whole Summer Live thing

137
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,233
'cause they made me.

138
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:53,108
But as of right now,
I'm feeling much more motivated.

139
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,775
[HIYORI]
Guess Jun's running late.

140
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,942
[TORI]
I knew it! Master Hiyori?

141
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,233
Huh?

142
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,317
I'm so glad I caught you.
Do you remember me?

143
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,858
[HIYORI]
Oh! Uh, you must be--

144
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,858
Sorry, but I have no idea.

145
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,858
[TORI]
I didn't think so.

146
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:15,317
It's fine. I suppose.
I was a kid when we first met.

147
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,775
Wow, it's been a while since
I've seen the young master

148
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,233
feigning innocence in this way.

149
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:23,567
Are you the Master Hiyori
of the Tomoe Foundation?

150
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,233
I'm surprised you know that.

151
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,692
Social events are
usually my brother's thing.

152
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,442
I'm not actually
seen in public much.

153
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,025
[YUZURU]
When I was a child,

154
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,692
I introduced myself to you along
with Master Tori Himemiya here.

155
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,067
It was a long time ago.
I'm sure it's hard to recall.

156
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,317
Oh!

157
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,817
You're from that nouveau
riche Himemiya family--

158

to Eichi like a suckerfish.

I can't believe that
you're considered well bred.

ill-mannered way you speak.

The president said he
asked some old friends

to join the Summer Live, too.
Can you believe it?!

They're competing
against Master Hiyori?

[YUZURU]
Mm-hm.

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,983
Trickstar is the opponent

00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,067
who put an end to
our winning streak.

I hope they get crushed.

[HIYORI]
Of course!

I'm honestly more stressed about

stepping into such an
unpleasant role at this point.

Everything Eichi asked us
to do here is nonsense.

Not going easy on Trickstar?

220
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:15,317
Like, the whole purpose of an
opponent isn't to crush them.

It's just like
the concert's name--

Now, we'll all be
performing in groups of three.

So are you feeling
okay with this?

00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:57,733
Well, since you asked,
it does feel a little awkward.

235
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:01,317
So why don't we just split
between Trickstar and Eve?

236
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,358
Because we all
agreed to do it this way

237
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:04,733
and this is what we rehearsed!

238
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:07,025
No reason to keep
bringing it up.

You really think a group
of four and a group of two

onstage is going to
look good? Come on!

I wouldn't mind if it made us
look more balanced in general.

00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:15,942
But it's pretty much impossible

243
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:19,483
for me to get this unruly
lot together, you know?

I'm sorry about that.

You better check your
own actions, Akehoshi.

Trickstar's strength is
being able to go all out.

homework for him.

are only beneficial for Eve,

to use that popularity

to advertise today's

a revolution together.

you all as friends for life.

00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:51,608
they were each able to find
a special light all their own.

470
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,150
And these days,

471
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,775
the halls sparkle
like never before.

472
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:58,108
[LEO]
Ahh! It's spreading!

473
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:00,900
The infinite cosmos is
spreading before my eyes!

474
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,067
I'm really doing it!

475
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,983
I can compose a masterpiece now!

476
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,317
[LEO laughing]

477
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,608
--[ANZU] Uhh...
--[IZUMI] Seriously?

478
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,775
You okay, King? What's going on?

479
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,150
So you're back now?
And still annoying?

480
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:20,233
Huh? Hey, Naru!
And Ritsu and Sena?

481
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,108
It's so great to see you!

482
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,775
How are you, my Knights?

483
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:24,983
His Knights?

484
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,358
That's right.

485
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:28,608
This is our leader.
He's just been away for a while.

486
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,942
For a very long while, actually.

487
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,442
Tsukinaga Leo.

488
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:35,442
Also known as King.

489
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:37,025
What the heck?

490
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,983
There's someone
I don't know here.

491
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:42,150
You must be an alien,
am I right?

492
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,817
[LEO chuckles]
Outer space!
