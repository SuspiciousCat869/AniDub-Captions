1
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,400
[ANZU] We were all so
certain that Trickstar

2
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,442
had been permanently separated.

3
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:17,108
But then Yuuki and Isara
found their way back.

4
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:20,233
And the three of them performed
together at the DDD.

5
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,983
[ANZU] As for Hidaka, It looks
like he will be joining

6
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,817
Tenshouin's unit, fine.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,275
[CROWD]
Trickstar!

8
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,567
[ANZU] Will we ever see all
four members of Trickstar

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,275
together on stage again?

10
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:40,400
[WATARU]
Hokuto!

11
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:41,775
It's Hibiki Wataru!

12
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,567
So good to hear from you!

13
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:47,400
No one called you,
you Masked Pervert!

14
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:50,858
Ah! That's not the
only way I'll appear!

15
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,150
[WATARU]
Hm.

16
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,692
It's not worth it.

17
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,317
I don't have the time or energy
to deal with you right now.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,317
Amazing!

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,317
I have a hard time believing
you're that tired, though.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,233
For one thing, you
didn't even bother

21
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:08,108
to perform with
the others today.

22
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:11,233
[SORA] Woo-hoo! Hey, are you
guys seeing what I'm seeing?

23
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:12,692
It's a blimp!

24
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,233
So cool!

25
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,483
How strange that it just
came out of nowhere.

26
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,442
Hey, Master, is this
what magic looks like?

27
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,817
Yes. Every move a magician makes

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,858
results in some kind
of magic. Just watch.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,275
[TSUMUGI] Yeah, seems like
he's just as over the top

30
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,775
and out there, as usual.

31
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,608
Wait, is that Hidaka with him?

32
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,108
[NATSUME]
It appears to be. Makes sense.

33
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,358
There's a rumor out there

34
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:37,775
that he's planning to
transfer to fine soon.

35
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,275
Is he?

36
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:42,108
If so, then that means Eichi
must really believe in him.

37
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,817
How can you say that
when it's so obvious

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,733
he's just trying
to weaken Trickstar?

39
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:47,442
Even if that was the case,

40
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,150
Eichi recognizes his talent.

41
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,983
It sounds like you're
speaking from experience.

42
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:55,275
Is that how it was?
Y'know, before all this.

43
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,025
When you were a member of fine?

44
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh, not at all.

45
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:02,400
It wasn't really
like that for me.

46
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:05,942
I hope he's well.
I still think about him.

47
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:10,442
[EICHI]
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,525
We appreciate your support.

49
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,108
[ANZU] At the time,
I still had no idea.

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,233
But of course,
I'd find out later

51
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:21,900
that Tenshouin had his own
hidden feelings and agendas.

[ANZU]
One year ago, everything about

54
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,108
Yumenosaki Academy
was different.

55
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,358
Things weren't like
they are now.

56
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,942
Can I ask you something?

57
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,233
[STUDENT 10A] Anyway,
I get that he's desperate,

58
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,692
but he didn't have to be
so pathetic over a class.

59
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,192
[STUDENT 10B]
He works hard. Who cares?

60
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:12,733
[STUDENT 10C]
Yeah, what does...

61
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,442
[EICHI] That's not going to be
enough to change the school!

62
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,192
[KEITO] We have to take
time to carefully lay out

63
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,650
all of the instructions--

64
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,567
[EICHI] No we don't, Keito.
We have to find something

65
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,442
that inspires them
to demand change!

66
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:24,483
And then we need everyone
to move at once!

67
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,650
[KEITO]
Aoba?

68
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,567
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

69
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,650
Ah, no worries.

70
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,525
We were just
talking about school.

71
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,775
[TSUMUGI] That's not what
it looked like to me.

72
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,442
I'm sorry to make you come
all the over way here to get it.

73
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,150
But here's the list
of books we have.

74
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,567
Thanks so much.

75
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,233
I feel bad having you reorganize
that list by yourself.

76
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,733
Let me know if I can help.

77
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,775
It's no problem, I promise.

78
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,900
[EICHI]
I see, so you and Keito Hasumi

79
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,650
are both on the
library committee?

80
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,317
I can't believe he's
come up with a reason

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,483
for you to do so
much by yourself.

82
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,317
It's fine, he's busy running
the student council.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,817
Let me help you. Say when.

84
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,817
Wow, that would be great!

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,150
Wait, you shouldn't
have to do that.

86
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,942
You just got out
of the hospital!

87
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:11,775
Yeah, but I can still
help out a little bit.

88
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,192
[TSUMUGI] You and Keito
have known each other

89
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,567
since you were kids, right?

90
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,900
[EICHI]
That is true.

91
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,192
But it's like I have his
phone number or anything.

92
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,775
[TSUMUGI]
Interesting.

93
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,275
Actually, we went to Hasumi's
family temple for consultation.

94
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:25,108
My grandfather's about
to pass and they've done

95
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,983
our funerals for generations.

96
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,442
We've got a long history.

97
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:29,608
I see.

98
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,942
[EICHI] When I got there,
for some reason,

99
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,733
we started talking about
the future of the school.

100
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,858
[TSUMUGI]
What's going on with it?

101
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,983
[EICHI] The value of this
school in the entertainment

102
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,067
industry is declining.

103
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,025
When we tried to find the cause,

104
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,733
there was only one
conclusion we could reach.

105
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,608
[REI]
Hey there, Tsumugi.

106
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,733
[TSUMUGI]
Rei? I thought you transferred

107
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,608
to the sister school
in New York?

108
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,150
Yeah, I did,
but I just got back.

109
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,817
I leave for Shanghai tomorrow.

110
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,775
Man, I can't keep up
with your global lifestyle.

111
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:00,983
Neither can I!

112
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,942
I have no idea what's
going on at school.

113
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,233
Catch me up when we
get a chance to talk.

114
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,025
[TSUMUGI]
Absolutely!

115
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,733
Sorry to interrupt.

116
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,108
You're fine.

117
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,942
Okay.

118
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:15,858
Guess that means you're
friends with Sakuma Rei, too?

119
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,733
Yeah, sure. He's still someone
I admire and respect very much.

120
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,150
So, can you tell me
what you discovered?

121
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,692
What caused the school
to change so much?

122
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,983
[EICHI] The cause isn't
worth dwelling on.

123
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,108
What's important is changing
the way the school is now.

124
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,525
And in order to do that,
we have to be proactive,

125
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:38,733
so Hasumi and I
came up with a plan.

126
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,942
[TSUMUGI]
Oh.

127
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,650
[EICHI] We'd take three
people who represent

128
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,150
Yumenosaki Academy,
and then place them

129
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,317
high above everyone else.

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,900
Patterned after the
"Three Deities"

131
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:50,567
of Japanese mythology,
the "Three Eccentrics."

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,983
What a cool name.

133
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,108
And at least we'll know exactly

134
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:55,067
who's representing us
in the industry.

135
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,900
I think it makes a lot of sense.

136
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,733
We've already decided
who they are.

137
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,358
Wataru Hibiki as Amaterasu,
Kanata Shinkai as Susanoo,

138
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,400
and Rei Sakuma as Tsukuyomi.

139
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,108
[TSUMUGI]
All three of them fit perfectly!

140
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,650
Rei really has adopted
the character of Tsukuyomi,

141
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:15,025
god of the night.
He can't stand the sun.

142
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,317
But that could also
be a problem.

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,942
They might fit too well.

144
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:22,733
I want to create a tear to
find out who they really are.

145
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,483
Um, what do you mean?
Make a tear?

146
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,608
Don't you think they'd
be more appealing?

147
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:28,858
I think I understand.

148
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:30,358
In that case, why
don't we find a way

149
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,483
to add a few more people?

150
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,400
[EICHI] I was just thinking
the exact same thing.

151
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,400
What do you think of
the "Five Eccentrics"?

152
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,775
[TSUMUGI]
"Five Eccentrics."

153
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,150
If there's a larger
cast of characters,

154
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:45,483
then the importance of each
individual is lessened.

155
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,483
I have a question.

156
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,983
Actually, it's more of a favor.

157
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,400
[TSUMUGI]
What is it?

158
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,608
You seem to know
a lot of people, right?

159
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,317
This would go a lot
quicker if we could

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,067
use your connections.

161
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,483
[TSUMUGI]
Wait.

162
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,525
I feel like you're asking
me to do something scary.

163
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,567
[laughs] I hope not.

164
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,525
But would you be able
to suggest two people

165
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,192
to create the Five Eccentrics?

166
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,317
If you're just wanting two,

167
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,650
I think I could probably
help with that.

168
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,817
Let me think for a sec.

169
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,817
First one that comes
to mind is Shu Itsuki

170
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,525
based on how polished Valkyrie's
performances always are.

171
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,108
Then for the second one...

172
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:23,150
--[beeping]
--What is that sound?

173
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,067
They call it an "Eichi Gauge."

174
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,858
My doctor put it on me.

175
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:30,567
It stays silent as long
as it can detect movement.

176
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,150
When it starts getting
close to zero,

177
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,567
it notifies someone at home

178
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,400
and I'm retrieved whether
I like it or not.

179
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,983
As expected for
the son of a large

180
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,733
financial conglomerate.
I bet they really love you.

181
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:44,108
[EICHI] It's not love, they
just don't want anything

182
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:47,400
to happen to their
precious successor.

183
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:51,108
They couldn't care less
about me as a person.

184
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,400
Anyway, I have to go.

185
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,192
But can I point something
out to you first?

186
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,608
Several volumes in the
collection that pertain

187
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:01,067
to specific fields
seem to be missing.

188
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,733
[TSUMUGI]
What? Seriously?

189
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,400
I bet some students
forgot to return them

190
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,150
before they graduated.

191
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,692
[EICHI] There's quite
a large number missing,

192
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,525
so I doubt it's something
as simple as that.

193
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,442
If I had to guess,
I'd say they're hidden

194
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:13,983
somewhere in a secret room.

195
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,567
But where would
a secret room be?

196
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,900
I know where everything is.

197
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,150
Anyway, will you keep me posted?

198
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,525
About the other Eccentrics.

199
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,358
Right! Yes.

200
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,983
Thank you, Eichi. Call you soon.

201
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,775
Yeah, I'm walking toward
the front gate now.

202
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,567
Please tell me you're not coming
to get me in a limousine.

203
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,275
Because I don't want to draw
that kind of attention.

204
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:39,900
[sighs]

205
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:41,525
[WATARU] "And though
you try to plow through

206
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:44,817
all the deception
and seek pleasure,

207
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,525
you did not know that the
pleasure you were seeking

208
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,317
was no more than deception."

209
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,108
[EICHI]
Hibiki's just so beautiful.

210
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,650
[WATARU] "When you
forgot me, your soul..."

211
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,275
[EICHI] It's like he's wrapped
in a mysterious brilliance.

212
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,733
[gasps]

213
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,858
[EICHI] He's still so far.
I can't reach him.

214
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,108
But I promise I will fill in
the unbearable distance--

215
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:16,067
The gap between high and low.

216
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,692
[EICHI]
I will get to you one day,

217
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,025
no matter what I have
to do to get there.

218
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,650
[REI]
A secret room? Yeah. I guess so.

219
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,358
It's a basement stack room.

220
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,900
For real? That's awesome!

221
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,400
It might be a little
hard to find, but,

222
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,942
I know it's in the very
back of the reference room.

223
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,483
Thank you so much!

224
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:49,650
I knew if anyone would know

225
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,733
what I was talking about,
it would be you!

226
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,483
[REI]
Heads up.

227
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,900
Whoops-a-daisy!

228
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:58,442
Uh... Is this really the
key to the secret room?

229
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,525
But why?

230
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,400
It just felt right.

231
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:05,150
[TSUMUGI]
Okay. You're so confusing to me.

232
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,067
[REI] Well, I'm off
to Shanghai. Take care.

233
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,567
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Be careful out there.

234
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:13,525
Tsumugi.

235
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,733
[TSUMUGI]
Yes?

236
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,108
[REI]
Don't spend all your energy

237
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:20,233
doing things for other
people. Believe in yourself.

238
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,233
You can do anything if you try.

239
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,150
[TSUMUGI]
You're the only one who's

240
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,192
ever said that about me.

241
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,108
It means more than you know.

242
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,775
[TSUMUGI]
There really is a secret room.

243
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,108
So many books that
don't look like

244
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:40,192
they were ever checked
in to the library.

245
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,358
Like these.

246
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,942
They look like
classified documents.

247
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,775
They smell like danger.

248
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:51,192
[TSUMUGI] Now there really
is a strange smell.

249
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,233
Seems like it's coming
from behind this door?

250
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,233
[VOICE screams]

251
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:04,358
[NATSUME] Abracadabra.
And a little hocus-pocus.

252
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,400
There!

253
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,317
[TSUMUGI]
Huh?

254
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,275
What are you doing here?

255
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,275
And more importantly,

256
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,233
who let you into
this secret room?

257
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,817
Talkin' to you, Aoba Tsumugi.

258
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,942
I don't think I ever
told you my name.

259
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,608
[NATSUME]
You're so responsible and always

260
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:23,067
working so hard,
I should learn from you.

261
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,733
Even if you don't
work like a slave,

262
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,275
everyone loves you.

263
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:29,400
Now that is a recipe
I've been dying to learn.

264
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,692
C'mon, stop!

265
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,817
I'm not like,
famous or anything.

266
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,483
Odd. Guess my magic
wasn't strong enough.

267
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,983
Well, it's obvious
I need more training.

268
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,900
Master is not going to be proud.

269
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:46,275
Wait a minute, I think
I may have heard about you.

270
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:47,483
[NATSUME]
I'm sure.

271
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,567
I am the magician
of Yumenosaki Academy,

272
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,317
Sakasaki Natsume.

273
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,650
And for a nominal
fee, I will make

274
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,900
every stress and worry
you have disappear.

275
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,483
[TSUMUGI]
Uh.

276
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:01,942
[NATSUME chuckles]

277
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,858
[TSUMUGI grunts]

278
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,567
What the...?

279
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,483
I think I know you.

280
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,692
Don't you remember me, Natsume?

281
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,150
[NATSUME]
Hm?

282
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,442
[TSUMUGI] Your mother's a
famous fortuneteller, right?

283
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,108
Yes, but everyone knows that.

284
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,025
I'm not sure what
you're trying to prove.

285
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,233
When you were a kid,

286
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,775
you liked to wear girls'
clothes, didn't you?

287
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:20,775
What?!

288
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,692
I'm Sakasaki Natsume.

289
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:26,067
You can call me
Little Namie! Hi there!

290
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,400
Not that it even
matters, but yes,

291
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:30,942
I was made to act like
a girl when I was little!

292
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,442
You were also going
to a dance school

293
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,025
at that time, weren't you?

294
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,317
I think I did, but
just for a few weeks.

295
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,442
I assume you're talking
about the shady one?

296
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,858
With the bad management?

297
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:43,442
[laughs] That was
managed by my mother.

298
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,567
Awkward.

299
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,900
But I remember her
coming to my mom

300
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,900
about some trouble
she was having.

301
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:51,483
She couldn't pay the fee,

302
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,775
so she waived
my monthly tuition.

303
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:57,233
I remember that was a pain.

304
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:58,900
Mom always talks
about the little girl

305
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,275
dance prodigy and how
beautiful she was.

306
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,150
You're basically like
a hometown legend.

307
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,942
Yeah thanks, I remember now.

308
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,608
Please stop telling that story.

309
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,108
Now that I think about it,

310
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,775
there was a mean little
boy at the school, too.

311
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:14,150
He was called
Big Brother Tsumugi.

312
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,525
That was you, wasn't it?

313
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,567
For what it's worth,
you seem different.

314
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,900
[TSUMUGI] After that, my
parents filed for bankruptcy,

315
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,608
divorced, and remarried.

316
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,567
A lot has changed since then.

317
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,692
Yeah. That must've
been pretty rough.

318
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,692
I'm glad we got to see
each other again,

319
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,775
Little Namie.

320

[NATSUME]
The next time you call me that,

321
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,317
I will turn your face
into a hideous mess,

322
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,025
but I won't use magic to do it.

323
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,775
Okay, please stop!

324
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,983
[TSUMUGI] What kind of
experiment are you doing?

325
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,942
Nothin' much, just killin' time.

326
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,233
Seeing what different
elements can do.

327
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,442
Master likes to practice
fantastical magic.

328
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,567
But I'm more into
alchemy and sorcery.

329
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,275
The classics, ya know?

330
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:55,942
That's so cool!

331
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,400
It looks just like
fairytale magic!

332
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:01,900
It "looks like" magic,
because that's what it is.

333
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,567
But it's not a fairytale.

334
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,317
Show's over. Time for you to go.

335

'Kay, if you say so.

336
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,733
Can I stop by here
again sometime?

337
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:14,650
Maybe we reconnected after
so long for a reason?

338
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:17,733
I'd like to try to be
friends if you would?

339
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,483
You're sort of a little
weirdo, aren't you,

340
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,817
Big Brother Tsumugi?

341
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,233
That's fine, but we can't
be like, best friends.

342
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,650
If a normal person like you
associates too closely

343
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,900
with magicians, you'll end up
miserable and unhappy.

344
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,900
Got it! Later!

idea what I'm talking about.

[WATARU]
I'm very sorry, Hidaka Hokuto.

350
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,108
But it's like I told you before,

351
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:56,108
you have the dignified looks
required to play a prince.

352
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:57,692
But you have no
talent for acting.

353
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,483
Makeup and masks only go so far.

354

Therefore, I cannot
allow you to join

355

the theater club. I'm sorry.

356
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,525
I understand.

357
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,650
And I believe I've
uncovered your real game.

358
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,733
You said that just
to see how I'd react?

359
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:14,067
No, that was my
actual criticism.

Hi, can I help you?

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,442
Did you come here
to talk to me?

364

Or were you looking for Hokuto?

No, uh. Please excuse me.

My heart's still pounding.

Right now, I may be just
another random student to him.

369
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:45,108
But, if you give me a chance,
I can open your eyes.

370
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:48,900
I will carve my existence
into your heart, Hibiki.

It won't be long now.

Hey. What's up?
Everything all right?

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,442
I just found the perfect one!

00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:04,192
The fifth person for
the Five Eccentrics.

377
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,983
His name is Sakasaki Natsume
and he's a first year!

378
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,817
I just talked to him for a
little while and I'm sure of it!

379
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,192
He's exactly what you want
at the top of this school.

380
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:13,150
You'd love him!

00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,358
Okay.

382
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,817
Well, I'm convinced,
let's reach out.

[TSUMUGI]
Oh. Really? That's it?

You don't have to think
it over for a few days?

385
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,233
If he made that big of
an impression on you,

386
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,775
he must be exceptional.
I trust you.

I'm sure he won't disappoint!

Thank you!

No, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

While you're here,
there's something else

I wanted to ask of you.

we could be like them?

[STUDENT 10F] I could never
put on a concert like that.

[STUDENT 10G] Who the hell
are these "Five Eccentrics"?

404
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,942
[STUDENT 10H] The school
is pushing them extra hard.

405
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,400
[STUDENT 10I] They're making
it impossible for us

to ever have a chance.
It's not fair!

407

[TSUMUGI]
It's so amazing.

408
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,775
Everyone in school's
talking about

409
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,150
the Five Eccentrics right now.

410
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,983
It seems like everything is
going according to your plan.

411
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,233
Don't forget, you had a lot
to do with this success, too.

412
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:27,650
Nice work.

413
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,108
And Sakasaki Natsume was
a wonderful recommendation.

414
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:33,775
[TSUMUGI] Giving a few
names is hardly anything.

415
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:37,608
But um, I was just wondering.
Is this what you wanted?

416
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:38,858
[EICHI]
What do you mean?

417
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,942
I feel like they
could be doing more.

418
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,525
From what I've seen,
the Five Eccentrics

419
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,942
aren't really leading the
school in a good direction.

420
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,150
It's the opposite.

421
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,567
Students seem to be
losing motivation.

422
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,108
I think it's okay.

423
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,442
We're still just
at the beginning.

424
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,942
This journey's long.

425
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,567
It'll be a while before
we see changes.

426
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,442
[TSUMUGI] Well, in the
meantime, have some tea.

427
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,358
I'd love to.

428
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,025
[TSUMUGI] By the way,
how is putting together

429
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:09,025
your new unit coming along?

430
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,400
It's going quite well, actually.

431
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,858
Your list had several
fine candidates.

432
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,400
And I had some good interviews
with a couple of them.

433
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,900
What? Out of the entire list?

434
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:22,233
You interviewed Ran Nagisa
and Tomoe Hiyori?

435
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,775
[EICHI]
Why? Should I not have?

436
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,942
[TSUMUGI] Oh! I'm sorry,
it's nothing like that,

437
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,650
they're both extremely talented.

438
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,525
I wouldn't have put them
on the list otherwise.

439
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:30,650
I'm just surprised.

440
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,275
But they're also, um...

441
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:36,108
How do I say this? A little hard
to handle in their own ways.

442
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,150
[EICHI] Ah. Yeah, I can
definitely see that.

443
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:42,775
Especially Ran. He just
seems difficult in general.

444
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,233
I can't believe you
convinced him at all.

445
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,983
How did you manage that?

446
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,233
Full frontal attack.

447
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:52,108
I explained that it'd be a
step up for him as an idol,

448
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,233
and suggested a possible
partnership with him

449
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,025
and our family businesses.

450
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,483
I thought about offering cash,

451
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,442
but then realized
it wasn't necessary.

452
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,442
[laughs] That's such a different
world from what I know

453
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,108
and it's making me dizzy
trying to understand.

454
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,483
Well, even if you're
finished gathering

455
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,358
the contracts, I think
it'll take a lot of time

456
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,150
and work to bring
everyone together.

457
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,275
Make sure you're not
pushing yourself too hard.

458
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,900
I think I'll be all right.

459
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,567
Because of a certain member.

460
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,108
I've chosen him to
help me with that.

461
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,567
So now, I should probably ask

462
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,983
if you'll be the
mediator for my unit?

463
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,192
What?

464
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,733
You're talking about me?

465
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,775
But what do I know
about any of this?

466
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,733
I forgot to tell you.

467
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,608
I found out some information.

468
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,025
I now know why the school's
value is declining.

469
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,025
[TSUMUGI]
Okay?

470
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:39,983
[EICHI] It's because of the
way this school is run.

471
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:43,025
Only those with exceptional
talent stand out,

472
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,817
and those without
it are forgotten.

473
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,692
Wow.

474
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,400
[EICHI] My goal is to make
a point with this unit.

475
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,942
That even if you
aren't prodigies like

476
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,942
the Five Eccentrics, you
can still shine like them.

477
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:59,233
No, you can shine more than them
if you're willing to work.

478
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,942
We have to make changes
and overhaul the system.

479
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,025
In order to do that,
we'll have to move

480
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,358
in a lot of
different directions.

481
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,692
That's why I wanted to ask you.

482
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:12,442
I need someone suitable
to represent this unit.

483
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,025
[gasps]

484
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,275
[EICHI] And someday, we will
defeat the Five Eccentrics.

485
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:22,108
Huh?

486
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,650
I meant to say.

487
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,275
I hope we'll be good
enough to surpass them.

488
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,150
That's my goal.
But I can't do it alone.

489
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:33,192
I need you, Tsumugi.
What do you say?

490
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:46,067
[TSUMUGI]
I say let's do it.

491
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,192
I would love to work
on this with you

492
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,858
and be a partner in
pursuing your dream.

493
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,275
I'm grateful. That means a lot.

494
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,692
[EICHI]
We'll be a good team.

495
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,525
Let's bring a revolution
to this Academy.

496
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:08,817
[EICHI]
Our unit will be called fine,

497
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,317
and we will put
an end to an era.
