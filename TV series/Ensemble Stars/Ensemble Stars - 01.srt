Welcome to Yumenosaki Academy.

2
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,900
The name means "academy
where dreams bloom,"

3
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:16,692
and that's the goal
for all the students

4
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,317
who attend school here.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,775
What is your dream?

6
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,817
Are you the next celebrity idol?

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,692
An actor? Or maybe a singer?

8
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:27,900
[ANZU]
Right now the production course

9
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:30,067
is still in development.

[SAGAMI] I'm Mr. Sagami,
your homeroom teacher.

12
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,775
Please come to the staff room
in the Idol department

13
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:41,025

Come on, you guys!

00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,150
"You guys?" That was Hokke!

17
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,900
You're so rude! I was
doing my part right.

18
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,567
It seems you're the only
one who doesn't know

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,483
the choreography, yet. Akehoshi.

20
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,233
Huh? Yes I do!

"Step, bam, on the floor!"
Then "whee" around!

Don't speak with sound effects.

00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,983
Especially when I explained
things to you so logically.

25
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,650
Hey, guys, you don't
have to fight about it.

26
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,150
Oh, crap.

27
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,233
Hate to bail, but I gotta
head back to my own classroom.

28
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:47,900
I forgot that I have class duty!

Wow, is that the time?

you're having fun, don't they?

What're you doing in
an idol course classroom?

00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,858
Uh--

37
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:06,317
Wait, that's right.
I've heard about you.

38

Hello there!

00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,817
You're the transfer student

Welcome to Yumenosaki!

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,942
Where dreams come true!

42
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:48,817
[HOKUTO] People have
been talking about you

43
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,150
for quite a while.

44
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,817
Mr. Sagami, our homeroom
teacher mentioned that

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
you're in the Production Course

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,650
that was established
recently, but...

47
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,442
...unfortunately there aren't
any classrooms for you yet.

48
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,525
Huh?

49
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,358
Hopefully they'll
be available soon.

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,192
But for now, you'll
be able to attend

51
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,483
some of the idol courses
with us for credit.

52
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,650
Consider yourself a temporary
member of class 2-A.

53
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,233
The three of us
are your classmates.

00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,525
Just you?

55
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,567
Uh, sorry, you guys.
I gotta get to class duty.

56
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,900
Thanks for handling
the clean up!

57
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,400
So hey, uh... [chuckles]

58
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,358
What's your name, newbie?

That's great! My name's

Nice to meet you!

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,608
Sorry about him.

63
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,900
I'm Hidaka Hokuto, the class
representative for Class 2-A.

64
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,567
Our homeroom teacher
instructed me to look after you.

65
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,067
His name's Hokuto, but
you can call him "Hokke"!

66
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,192
Oh! And that one with the
glasses is Yuuki Makoto,

67
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,483
so call him "Ukki!"

68
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,692
There's more to me
than glasses, you know.

00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:47,817
But I guess it's fine. Uh, hi!

Maybe they'll make
me memorable, Right?

Yes, my name is Yuuki Makoto,
and... I'm glad you're here.

Uh! I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

74
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,650
I'm just not very
experienced with girls.

75
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,483
[coughs] Right.

76
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,775
Since our school specializes

77
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,775
in training only
male idol groups,

78
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:09,233
it can feel a lot like
attending an all-boys academy.

79
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,400
I imagine being surrounded by
so many boys might be difficult.

80
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,525
But I'm here to make
you feel comfortable.

81

Same thing goes for these guys.

for you, transfer student?

gonna get my ten yen!

squirming about over there?

to go to the bathroom, 'least

I meant what I said.

162
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,567
Seek me out if you have
any trouble at all.

163
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,942
[MAKOTO chuckles] I'm available,
too, if you need me.

164
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,275
I'm on the broadcast committee,

165
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,067
so I'm good at
finding information.

166
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,192
That tends to come in handy.

167
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,942
You can always talk to me, too!

168
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,900
And I know this is kinda sudden,

169
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:20,900
but can I please
borrow some money?

--[giggles] Pretty please?
--[ANZU] Uh...

If you haven't figured it out
yet, this guy's an idiot.

172
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,942
I wouldn't advise getting
involved with him.

173

Hokke, what are
you saying? Stop!

[whines]

177
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:36,525
We're getting off topic here.

178
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,108
I'll start again
from the beginning.

179
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,983
This is Yumenosaki
Private Academy.

180
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,150
A school that grooms
future idols.

181
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,775
[MAKOTO]
There is also a standard course

182
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,150
for more traditional students.

183
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,608
[HOKUTO]
Not everyone who studies here

184
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,108
is currently working.

185
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,358
There are those who have
already made their debut,

186
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,025
but don't have continuous
jobs as idols.

187
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,525
You're part of
that group, right?

188
00:08:56,608 --> 00:09:00,233
Yeah, but that's kind
of a sore spot for me.

189
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,608
I'd be so grateful if you
wouldn't talk about it.

190
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:07,358
Uh-- Of course.
I'm sorry. Anyway.

191
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,025
At this school, all the
resources that are needed

192
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,400
to improve your skills
and talents as an idol

193
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:13,942
are part of the curriculum.

194
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,567
As students in the idol course,

195
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,733
we spend our days
training intensely.

196
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,567
This school was created
for idols, by idols.

197
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,733
We work extremely hard
becoming better idols

198
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,400
than we were the day before.

199
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,608
[ANZU]

[guitar strums]

201
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,608
Sounds like a guitar.
Wait, does that mean...?

202
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,192
[SUBARU]
Totally!

203
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,733
That's why no one's
here right now!

204
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,608
I knew something was weird!

205
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,775
I see.

206
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,942
Then, this might be
a good opportunity.

207
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,067
All right, transfer student,
now's your chance

208
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,858
to witness what this
school is really like.

209
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,233
Hold on, what does that mean?

210
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,483
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

211
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,858
Let's go.

212
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:54,400
We'll show you Yumenosaki
Academy's famous DreFes.

213
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,817
'Sup, yo!

214
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,317
Competition belongs
in a man's world!

215
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,942
Backstage, the blood's boiling.

216
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,442
And our competitors are
ready to throw down!

217
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,400
Ready to watch two guys
in a battle of wills?

218
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,358
[TETORA]
I forgot to introduce myself!

219
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,692
I'm Nagumo Tetora,

220
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,983
host for the DreFes
Ryuu-ou-sen match!

221
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,817
I'm also a first year
in the Karate Club!

222
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,358
Yeah, boi! I love
weight training!

223
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,775
I love eating <i>kalbi</i> .

224
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,400
And my dream for
the future is

225
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:32,525
to become the manliest
man of all time!

226
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,733
[STUDENT 01A]
No one asked you!

227
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,525
[SUBARU]
Ah!

228
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:37,900
You gotta be kidding.

229
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:41,275
It feels like this DreFes
is turning into a riot.

230
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:42,775
What's "DreFes" mean?

231
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,108
I can explain that.

232
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,775
As part of the Yumenosaki
Academy idol course,

233
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,567
we regularly have sudden,
pop up events

234
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,108
called "Dream Idol Festivals,"
or "DreFes" for short.

235
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,442
You can think of it as
a competition to see

236
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,733
who has superior idol skills.

237
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:02,233
These work like tests
at traditional schools.

238
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:05,192
If you win, your rank
goes up, you get rewards,

239
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,192
and the school
treats you better.

240
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,483
It teaches us how
to handle competitions

241
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,692
and inspires students
to work harder.

242
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,608
That's its original purpose.

243
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:19,233
In the DreFes, we're
ranked from SS to B1.

244
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,150
This is the lowest level, B1.

245
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,775
For various reasons,
events that are ranked A1

246
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,525
and higher have become
DreFes in name only,

247
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,692
so you'll find that these shows
are the most free and lively.

248
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,442
"Various reasons"?

249
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,942
Look. This is the B1
Ryuu-ou-sen title match.

250
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:39,983

say it like the name
of an ultimate move?

253
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,442
Anyway, the purpose
of this DreFes

254
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:49,442
is to find the strongest
person in the school.

255

all been waiting for

I'm ready to sink my claws
into the souls of fools!

a nickname, Akehoshi!

00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:43,733
I feel bad. Your
first day was ruined.

474
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:44,983
But that's not all.

475
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,067
There's one more thing

476
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,608
that I need to apologize
to you about.

477
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:52,192
I'm afraid that lied
to you earlier today.

478
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,983
This academy isn't
really a school

479
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:57,983
made for idols,
by idols, like I said.

480
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:02,650
More precisely, this is a school
for the chosen, elite idols.

481
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,942
Outcasts like us who aren't
singled out as being superior

482
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:09,150
will never see spotlights
from the stage.

483
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,650
It's true that this school
does continue to turn out

484
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:14,025
a large number of celebrities.

485
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,733
But they're trained like
livestock in this place,

486
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,317
with no sense of human kindness.

487
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,692
The student council is
what rules over the academy

488
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:25,567
and keeps that system in
place. They're unbending.

489
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,608
That's why...

490
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:31,567
...somehow, we must bring
about a revolution.

491
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,525
In order to tear down
the student council

492
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:36,233
and reform this school,
we'll fight to the end,

493
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,900
risking our lives.

494
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:41,275
And you might turn out to
be the one to lead the way.

495
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,525
I have a hunch
that'll be the case.

496
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:46,858
No. I want it to be true.

497
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,150
That's why we pray
that your heart

498
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:52,275
will resonate with ours,
transfer student.

499
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:54,900
So, you see,

500
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:57,608
you're the shining hope
we've been wishing for.

501
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,150
The one who will help
us change this school.

502
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,025
[BOYS gasp, laugh]

503
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,400
[ANZU]
It was on that day,

504
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:12,358
the revolution they'd
longed for quietly began.
