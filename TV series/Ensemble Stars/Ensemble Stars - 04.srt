1
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,567
[ANZU] It happened a year ago,
right around the time

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,775
when everyone had first
arrived at the Academy.

3
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:19,817
So, um, if I remember
correctly, you're class B?

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,067
Isara Mao. And you are?

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm Yuuki Makoto.
Isn't this funny?

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,733
How'd we all end up
somewhere like this

7
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,317
--at the same time?
--[SUBARU] Hey, guys!

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,108
Why do you all look so sad?

9
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:34,108
You need to relax!
I've got a great idea!

10
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,275
Since we're out here
in the woods,

11
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:36,692
let's find something fun to do!

12
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:38,983
Except, we don't really
know each other

13
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,525
so that might be weird.

14
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:41,983
You guys go ahead.

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,067
I've got some things
to do tonight.

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,900
[SUBARU]
Cool! Guys!

17
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:46,692
If you stand right
here and look up,

18
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,150
the stars in the sky
look just like

19
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:51,233
sparkly cherry blossom petals!

20
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,150
My dad told me about this tree!

21
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,233
There's a legend that says
you can tell it your wishes

22
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:56,775
and it will actually listen!

23
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:58,275
And if you bring something
important to you

24
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,233
and bury it at its roots,

25
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:02,317
your wish is supposed
to come true!

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,983
You have too much free time.

27
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,108
Why not invest some
of it in your studies?

28
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,608
Lighten up, Hidaka!
Life's way too short!

29
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:09,942
C'mon, guys!

30
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:12,608
[HOKUTO] Wishes and dreams
don't just "come true."

31
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:15,525
They're achieved with
consistency and hard work.

32
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,150
Well, sure.

33
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,233
Yeah, I guess
you're right. Look!

34
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:21,525
Is there a problem?

35
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:23,317
I may have imagined it,

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,317
but I could've sworn
I saw a bud blossom

37
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,317
into a flower just now,
as if it was listening

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,483
to what we were saying
and giving us a sign!

39
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:33,067
[SUBARU]
Wow!

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,858
[ANZU] That was the night
they met, and the moment

41
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:39,025
fate planted the
seeds of friendship.

42
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,525
[SUBARU, MAO, HOKUTO, MAKOTO]
Ooh!

43
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:16,317
Oh, my goodness! Those
costumes're for us?

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,233
[MAO] Cool! Those will
look amazing on stage!

45
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:22,483
Anzu, You made all of
these in only a week?

46
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,817
[ANZU]
Yeah.

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,775
That's what I call
a great surprise!

48
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,733
Hey, guys. Remember when
she was called out

49
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,192
by Kiryu the other day?

50
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,358
So here's the deal.

51
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,567
I always return
any and all favors.

52
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,900
So in exchange for letting me
borrow your handkerchief,

53
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll teach you the
basics of sewing.

54
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,025
[BOTH gasp]

55
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,692
Huh? Awesome! It looks so shiny!

56
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,442
[MAKOTO]
And there are four stars!

57
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,525
I love it!

58
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,442
[MAO] Do those symbolize
the four of us?

59
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:52,733
They do.

60
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,692
Thank you, Anzu. They're great.

61
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,817
--[door clicks]
--[HAJIME] Excuse me.

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,733
Sorry to bother you
before you go on.

63
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,358
I wanted to tell you something.

64
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,858
Shinonon!

65
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,817
I heard that you're all
taking action for our sakes

66
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,858
after the performance
the other day.

67
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,900
Thanks, you guys.
It makes me so happy.

68
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,400
Is everyone okay?

69
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,358
Everyone from Ra*bits, I mean?

70
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,900
We are. Promise we didn't
mean to worry you.

71
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,733
Break a leg out there today.

72
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,817
I believe we could all learn
from watching the way you work.

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,233
I hope your sparkles will light
the path meant for us, too.

74
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,983
It's official.
The battle's begun.

75
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,692
Let's start this
revolution with our music.

76
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,858
Today is the day we
change Yumenosaki Academy

77
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,358
by sending out sparkles of hope!

78
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,858
Trickstar!

79
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,442
[SUBARU, MAKOTO, MAO, HOKUTO]
Yeah!

80
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,358
[KEITO] To the demons
who have crawled out

81
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,692
from the darkness. I will
bring judgment and justice

82
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,317
down on you.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,900
With the blood of you fools,

84
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,650
I will dye this night the
color of AKATSUKI's moon!

85
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:03,775
[CROWD cheers]

86
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,400
[KEITO]
What's with that smug look?

87
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,567
Must have something
up his sleeve.

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,900
[KEITO] Does it have
something to do with

89
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,692
the pamphlets he passed out?

90
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,275
The rules for scoring
points were added

91
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,525
to the battle of
the bands system.

92
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,067
But they're not
anything unusual.

93
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,483
Let me think. During DreFes,

94
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,442
the audience can score
the units performing

95
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,150
by waving light sticks
that have points

96
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,358
assigned to each color
during the tally.

97
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,942
No. That can't be it.

98
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:40,108
[REI] It looks like he's
figured it out. That's right.

99
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,358
The two units performing
in the battle of the bands

100
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,900
must now compete for only
a limited amount of points.

101
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:49,150
Meaning that, if half of the
audience votes for UNDEAD,

102
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,442
then AKATSUKI can then
only receive points

103
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,858
from the remaining half.

104
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,233
However, if the next
unit isn't performing

105
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,858
under the battle
of the bands' rules,

106
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,317
they then can receive points

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,275
from everyone under
the normal rules.

108
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,858
Which makes sense,
since there won't be anyone

109
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,650
to fight over the points with.

110
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,108
Hm.

111
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:12,733
[KEITO] In the S1, the
points each unit receives

112
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,442
is what determines
their ranking.

113
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,025
AKATSUKI and UNDEAD
are competing

114
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,192
under the battle of
the bands system,

115
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,817
so they will each
score more points

116
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,733
against a unit
performing on their own.

117
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,650
[CROWD cheers]

118
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,608
[KEITO]
UNDEAD was a decoy!

119
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,733
[KEITO]
This was your plan, wasn't it?

120
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,692
You mean this new
unorthodox way of scoring?

121
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,025
Of course. Now you know what

122
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,858
the Three Eccentrics
are made of.

123
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:40,025
Doesn't this take
you right back?

124
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,650
Looks like the plan worked!

125
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,317
And now for the main event
we've all been waiting for.

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,650
Please give it up for two
of our good friends, 2wink!

127
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,317
We jumped as soon as
you called our name!

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,900
Ta-ta-ta-ta-dah!

129
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,733
It's one sabotage after another.

130
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:53,942
[HINATA, YUTA]
Hey there!

131
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,442
[KEITO] Those twins must
be the Aoi Brothers.

132
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,483
The first years
in the Band Club.

133
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,025
[HINATA]
That's enough.

134
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,233
Haven't you had it with this
battle-manga competition stress?

135
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,775
Get out there and rock it out!

136
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,733
No one likes an opening act
that's too slow, right?

137
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:07,317
Oh, we're the opening act?

138
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,650
[HINATA, YUTA]
Sounds like someone's ego

139
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,442
is getting bruised!

140
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:11,733
I hope you're ready!

141
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,275
Because the
headliners of this S1

142
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,067
are about to blow your mind
and shake your soul

143
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,233
with their performance!

144
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:18,067
But first, I hope you'll
let us warm you up

145
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,817
with one of our performances!

146
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,692
We're 2wink!

147
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,275
I'll admit, your plan
threw us off a little.

148
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:30,108
But I bet there's one thing
you haven't considered yet.

149
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,942
And that's everyone
who could be voting.

150
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:34,567
Votes aren't limited
to those watching

151
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,192
here in this auditorium.

152
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,608
There are students
who are watching

153
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:38,983
in their classrooms.

154
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:41,900
They can vote instantly
from their devices.

155
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,358
Help me! I'm freaking out
and I don't know what to do!

156
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:48,608
All right, Shinobun!

157
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,275
It's about time to cut
off the online voitng!

158
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,192
Also, can you please check
the live broadcast?

159
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,400
[SHINOBU] Ah! How am I supposed
to do both things at once?

160
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,067
That's impossible!

161
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,317
Why can't someone
be nice and teach me

162
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,567
how to clone myself?

163
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,983
[NAZUNA]
C'mon, don't cry.

164
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,150
We're going to need everyone

165
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,150
in the broadcast
committee fully functional

166
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,525
to manage the media
during the S1.

167
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,942
[NAZUNA] Trickstar,
I guess I'll have to watch

168
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:12,608
your performance from
the shadows backstage!

169
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,150
Do you think Akehoshi
and the others

170
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,317
have a chance to win?

171
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,942
They've all been
working so hard.

172
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,900
It's tough to imagine
anyone from Trickstar

173
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:20,858
giving a mediocre performance.

174
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,400
Besides, you remembered
to elaborate

175
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,983
on those explanations
in the pamphlets,

176
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,108
didn't you, Hajime?
That should help a lot!

177
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:30,858
So true! Why can't we
all be like Hajime?

178
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,733
There's nothing he
can't do right!

179
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,983
Gross. Don't talk
with your mouth full!

180
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,733
[CROWD]
What?

181
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,942
[HINATA, YUTA] Okay! That was
it, at least from us, for now!

182
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,608
[CROWD]
What?!

183
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,733
[BOTH]
Because you've been so patient,

184
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,150
here comes our main attraction!

185
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,692
[YUTA] This up-and-coming
idol unit always excites

186
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:52,275
with their cloak of mystery.

187
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:53,483
These supernovas are

188
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,733
the Revolutionaries of
Yumenosaki Academy!

189
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,733
[HINATA, YUTA] Please welcome
Trickstar to the stage!

190
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:04,775
[CROWD cheers]

191
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,233
[KURO]
Protect her feelings.

192
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,233
Don't let them go to waste.

193
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,317
[HINATA]
Allow us to introduce you!

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,358
He's so calm, chill, and cool:

195
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,817
he's known as The Freezing
Prince. Hidaka Hokuto!

196
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,108
[CROWD cheers]

197
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,733
Boo! There! That's much better--

198
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,483
you were starting to
look a little stiff.

199
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,233
Smile! This is fun, right?

200
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,817
Remember your special training!

201
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,192
I got it!

202
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,150
[HOKUTO]
They're so excited.

203
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,858
I'm definitely feeling
the pressure now.

204
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,900
The next amazing
member is a total

205
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,567
supernova super genius.

206
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,817
Please welcome to the stage,

207
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,775
--Akehoshi Subaru!
--[HOKUTO] Already?

208
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,692
Ya-hoo! Hey there!

209
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,275
Are you all havin' a good time?

210
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,900
[HOKUTO] He always puts his
whole heart into performing,

211
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,150
and his joy is infectious.

212
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,900
That's Akehoshi for you.

213
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,400
Trickstar's first star!

214
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:01,192
[BOTH] And the next member
we'd like you to meet is...

215
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,358
[YUTA] ...known as the
ever-changing magician.

216
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,692
Isara Mao!

217
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,025
[HOKUTO]
Isara works just as hard

218
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,358
as a student council officer

219
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,733
as he does as a
member of Trickstar.

220
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,692
He's also a fast learner
and can catch up

221
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,900
in a short amount of time
if he misses rehearsals.

222
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,858
Trickstar would've never
become the force

223
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,108
that it is without him.

224
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:23,608
Last but not least...
is, uh, the glasses guy!

225
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,233
I love the glasses guy!

226
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,692
What's his name? I forgot!

227
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,900
Doesn't really matter--
here he is!

228
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,942
Why is my name the only
one they can't remember?

229
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:35,025
I'm Yuuki Makoto.
I do stuff, too.

230
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,692
Thanks for coming!

231
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:38,567
[HOKUTO]
He knows what he's doing.

232
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,650
It helps to have that
comic relief who can make

233
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,525
the audience laugh
and loosen up.

234
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,358
We never worry about
the audience being

235
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,650
too uptight because we have him.

236
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,608
Thank you, Yuuki!

237
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:55,233
Looks like we've got
a good crowd out there.

238
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,858
That kind of energy
deserves everything

239
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:59,317
Trickstar has to offer.

240
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,358
[CROWD cheers]

241
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,525
[CROWD cheering]

242
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:22,442
[SUBARU giggles]
Here we go!

243
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,108
This is our song of revolution!

244
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,317
[SUBARU, HOKUTO, MAO, MAKOTO]
"Rebellion Star"!

245
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:43,567
[CROWD cheers]

246
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:54,442
[CROWD cheering]

247
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,942
My goodness! This is so amazing!

248
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,817
The melody is just as
hard as the harmonies,

249
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,275
but they're singing
it perfectly!

250
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,483
Man, why can't you two
ever be in the audience

251
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,983
when I'm performing?

252
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,275
[TOMOYA] I can't believe you're
still stuffing your face!

253
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,358
[STUDENT 04A]
Wow.

254
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,692
[STUDENT 04B]
It's like a starry sky.

255
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,067
[STUDENT 04C] These guys
are actually pretty good.

256
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,317
[STUDENT 04D] They're really
killing it out there.

257
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,525
[STUDENT 04E] I think
they're hot, don't you?

258
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,733
How's the show goin'?

259
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,150
Is your guy crushin' it?

260
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,400
I have no idea what
you're even talking about.

261
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:19,275
Come on, Izumi. Be real.

262
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,567
Didn't you stay
late the other day

263
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,233
because you were worried
about how nervous

264
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:23,775
he was getting
during a rehearsal?

265
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:26,608
Uh, no. What's wrong with you?

266
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,900
[ARASHI] You're not gonna
stay to see how it ends?

267
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,608
[IZUMI]
Why should I?

268
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:32,817
[ARASHI sighs]

269
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,858
[NAZUNA] We've finished
counting all the votes!

270
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,108
Everyone, please turn your
light sticks off for now!

[ALL panting]

272
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,233
That was so fun!

273
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:50,483
[CROWD cheers]

274
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,483
And from now on,
we'll keep shining

275
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,692
at this academy, 'cause we
are Yumenoskai idols!

276
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,025
And if you're watching
us from class, thanks!

277
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,483
Mwah! Mwah!

[HOKUTO]
Hold on!

280
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,900
--[SUBARU] What?
--The leader of each group

281
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:04,567
needs to wait. They're
gonna announce the results

282
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,317
and you'll have to represent us.

283
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,567
If we win, you'll have
to accept for us.

Aren't you the leader?

285
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,233
I'm much more comfortable

286
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,692
serving as a right-hand
man or a copilot.

287

Yeah, I think I'll pass, too.

[SUBARU]
Okay, then how about you, Ukki?

289

[MAKOTO] No, no, no, no, no!
I can't! Please don't make me!

they're nervous at all.

Oh, I think they've decided.

[NAZUNA] Sorry to keep you guys
in the dark for so long!

I will now announce
the S1 results!

It's so good to see you all,

I'm the broadcast
committee chair

and leader of Ra*bits.
My name is Nito Nazuna!

301
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,942
He managed to sneak
his own unit's name

302
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:06,400
into the introduction.
Pretty smooth move, kid.

303
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:07,775
Let us know if you
rigged the votes

304
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,192
so we don't take it personally.

305

How dare you accuse
me like that!

306

Even if I had a gwudge
because of what happened

307
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,400
during the S2, I would
still do my job pwoperly!

You better stop makin' fun
of me 'cause I'm little!

309
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:21,733
Not worth it.
I did my best here.

310
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,942
I'm fine with whatever happens.

311

Are you guys ready?

Ta-dah! There she is!

Wow! I didn't see
that one coming!

And by the way...

00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,442
Here's how the
votes were divided:

328
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,817
The first round came from
our audience here tonight.

329
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,733
The second round
is a student body vote!

330
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,275
No way. When you add
those together...

331
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:13,650
It's very close.

332
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,525
It looks like we just
barely won by a hair.

333
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,775
So what?

334
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:18,817
See how many votes we
got from the students?

335
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,150
Pretty awesome to know
that they support us.

336
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,650
That's true.

337
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,442
Especially since we're going
against the student council.

338
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,858
I think we should
consider this win

339
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,983
our first step
toward a revolution!

340
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:32,025
It's a small move,
but a very big step.

341
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:37,025
I haven't suffered hardship
like this in a long time.

342
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:41,275
The bitter taste of defeat.
It's just too much.

343

[NAZUNA] The student council's
legend of invincibility

has been overturned!
This is crazy!

perform one more song

Your hard work is
finally paying off!

There's no way we could
ever be grateful enough!

Every smile you've sent
our way, every cheer.

you're standing there?

Uh... You sure it's all right?

This was my fault for being
too confident and comfortable.

And now I've sullied the
prestige of the student council.

Well, being soft is not
gonna solve anything!

for a vice president!

Honestly, the only reason
I appointed Himemiya

383
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,817
as a student council
officer was so that
