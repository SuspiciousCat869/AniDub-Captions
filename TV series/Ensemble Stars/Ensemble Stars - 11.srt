[STUDENT A]
They're here! It's fine!

2
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:12,525
[STUDENT B]
That's Aoba and Tenshouin!

3
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:15,025
[STUDENT C] You guys were
amazing at the DreFes yesterday!

4
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,442
Thanks so much,
we appreciate it!

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:18,983
We're grateful for your support.

00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,608
[STUDENTS screaming, chattering]

7
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:24,525
[TSUMUGI] Goodness! fine's
gotten really popular, huh?

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,483
You're part of the unit, too.

9
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:28,442
I know that, but
the main reason fine's

10
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,608
become this big of a deal
is because of you, Eichi.

11
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,442
First, you took over as
Student Council President.

12
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:35,817
Then you created the DreFes,

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,192
allowing the audience
to give points to the idols.

14
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,858
And you beat the Five
Eccentrics, fair and square.

15
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,983
[EICHI] I wanted to make
the vague concept of an idol's

16
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:47,233
strength into something like an
interactive game with points,

17
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:49,275
and somehow people
believed in it.

18
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:52,108
But you're even responsible
for the numbers.

19
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,483
I'm surprised
nobody's noticed yet.

20
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:58,692
[EICHI] Well, the finishing
touches still aren't quite done.

21
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,608
Uh...

22
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:02,817
[ANZU] This is what took
place about six months

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,025
before I enrolled as
a student at Yumenosaki Academy.

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,567
It's the untold story of how
an ambitious revolutionary

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,733
became a lonely emperor.

26
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:46,525
[ANZU] At the time,
the school was overflowing

27
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:49,150
with an almost electric energy.

28
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,900
The idea that anyone could have
their moment to shine as long

29
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,275
as they worked hard enough
filled the students' hearts

30
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:57,150
with hopes that their
dreams would come true.

31
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,608
However, that hope only felt
realistic after the geniuses

32
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:04,233
called the Five Eccentrics were
suddenly made into villains.

33
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,650
[TSUMUGI]
That's right.

34
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,692
If you don't come back
by tomorrow, then--

00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,817
--[click]
--Hello?

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,150
Are you there?

37
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,400
Where'd Nagisa fly
off to this time?

38
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,858
He said something
about a Kitora Tomb.

39
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:19,025
Is that in another country?

40
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,942
And Hiyori is out living
it up with your money--

41
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,942
taking a bunch of fangirls
out and celebrating.

42
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,275
[gasps]

43
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,983
[TSUMUGI] Oh, wait,
the Kitora Tomb is in Nara?

44
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,817
That's actually not far away.

45
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,650
I'll go ahead and
have Hiyori come back

46
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,108
in exchange for
an increased stipend.

47
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,983
You're getting good at this.

48
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,942
[TSUMUGI] Why, thank you,
but I'm just doing my job

49
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:42,358
as the mediator of fine, and
I've been trained by the best.

50
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:44,983
You're still the genius
who's calling the shots.

51
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:49,150
I craft the orders from a safe
distance, and you give them.

52
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,942
Do you think that
makes me cruel?

53
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,233
No, you're just savvy and smart,

54
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,150
because in the unlikely event
something happens to fine,

55
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,525
you could just let me go

56
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,067
and continue with the
unit completely unscathed.

57
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,442
You're a strange
one, you know that?

58
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:07,025
Whether we're talking
casually, or about business,

59
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:09,067
your tone always
seems to be this light.

60
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,900
Because it's still me talking.

61
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,942
The brain produces
the same amount of chemicals

62
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,900
for any subject I speak about.

63
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:18,233
The thing is, you treat it
like it's not your problem.

64
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,400
Why do you criticize
everything I do?

65
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,567
I'll end up hating
you if you don't stop!

66
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,067
Crap, I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean it. I could never hate you!

67
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,525

Hey, come here.

68
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:28,817
Isn't that...?

[TSUMUGI]
Oh! Yeah, that's Rei, I think.

[TSUMUGI]
Rei! Is that you?

Tsumugi. Hey.

00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:42,775
[TSUMUGI]
I can't believe it!

73
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,567
I didn't know you
were back from England.

74
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,858
Looks like you've been
keeping pretty busy, yourself.

75
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,317
I always knew you would
make it big if you tried.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,983
Thanks! I owe it all
to everyone in fine!

You know what's weird?

00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:57,358
I'm so used to English
I can't read kanji anymore.

Look.

00:04:58,358 --> 00:04:59,233
What's that say?

school right now, isn't it?

87

trouble and being exposed

88

to things that could
be considered evil.

that there's nothing left
inside of you to hurt?

94

If you can't feel pain,
it's the same as being dead.

95
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,692
I wouldn't say that exactly.

Excuse me, sir.

[BOTH grunt]

98
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,775
[EICHI] The school rules
were recently amended.

99
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,358
That is now considered
an act of violence.

100
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,108
He didn't mean it that way.

101
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,442
Oh, is that so?

102
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:46,067
Don't you dare smile
at me like that, bastard.

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,108
So you're in a position
to make rules at will now?

104
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,483
You must think that makes
you some kind of god.

105
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,067
Aren't we bitter?

106
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,650
You had the power and the
qualifications to prevent this,

107
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,733
but you failed to act.

108
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,858
You've sinned
against your peers.

109
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,983
You swooped in
soon as I left.

110
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,858
That's the move of a coward.

111
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,733
[EICHI] People always want
the reason for their discontent

112
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,817
and worry to be anything
other than themselves.

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,858
I gave the source
of that unsightliness

114
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,358
the name of the
"Five Eccentrics."

115
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,650
And that is all I did.

116
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,817
Yeah, I don't believe that.

117
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,150
There were several incidents

118
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,775
that popped up at sister
schools around the world.

119
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:28,108
Those were your doing, right?

ones that only you can
truly resolve, you're here.

You'll be crushed to death by
the weight of your own empathy.

130

You're being cut to pieces
and poisoned to death by love,

131
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,775
and you don't even
realize it, Mr. Hero.

Maybe you're right--

133
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,900
there isn't anything
left for me to do here,

134
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:05,525
in which case, my only option
is to leave you with your curse.

00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,733
So be it.

You've already been
doing this for so long.

You look a little pale.

I need you to
stay back, Tsumugi.

Eichi!

00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,192
[SAGAMI] They said an employee
would come to get him.

147
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:51,775
Wasn't someone supposed
to come automatically?

148
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:55,108
They had to have seen that
Eichi's gauge was getting low.

149
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,983
[SAGAMI] He might have turned
off the transmission function.

150

I know he's supposed to perform
at DreFes with you tomorrow,

but I wouldn't recommend it.

Not sure how to prevent that.

with your own life like that?

I wonder why the

[TSUMUGI] I'm sorry,
the door was left open.

171
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,608
I figured that meant
it was okay to come in.

172
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,525
It was open?

I must've gotten distracted.

I'd love to know what it is
that you've been working on!

You're the enemy, remember?

00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,400
I was excited just thinking
about talking to you

00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,817
because we haven't
in such a long time.

I saw how busy you were.

I'm sure being one of the Five

[NATSUME] Please don't

Seriously? Are you that dumb?

It's not just that
fine was the unit

196

to finally beat us in matches.

They're also the ones

Wait, are you talking
about everything

that went on with Valkyrie?

200

Because it was all caused
by some crazy fine fan.

And that's the most repulsive
thing about you guys--

you never want to get
your own hands dirty.

I think it's kinda like magic,

and Eichi's actually
pretty good at it.

If you knew and
didn't try to stop it,

then you're basically
an accomplice!

[NATSUME]
You think that's all it takes?

You say it's a "noble cause"

and suddenly we should be
grateful you stepped on us?

Eichi's trying to save

Where are Nagisa and Hiyori?

Being on stage
is all I care about!

[NATSUME] Is it true
what Big Brother Rei said?

Are you planning
to lose, Master?

298
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,608
Firstly, why do
you call me "Master,"

299
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,150
but call Rei "Big Brother"?

anything, so it's confusing!

Because even though
you're not trying,

302
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,942
I am learning a lot
by watching you.

No.

306
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,025
You're observing carelessness
in the spirit world.

307
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,275
Someone cast an
evil spell on me.

308
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:31,192
Now please be a dear and
close that envelope, will you?

309
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:34,275
[NATSUME] You're only able to
act according to the script.

310
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:36,692
Since that's the case, then
all I had to do is prepare

311
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,900
an outline where the
Five Eccentrics beat fine.
