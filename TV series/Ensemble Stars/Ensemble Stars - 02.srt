the main act at DreFes
today was AKATSUKI, right?

00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,442
Are you depressed after
seeing the overwhelming

420
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,942
difference between them and us?

421
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:20,317
[SUBARU] That's not it.
AKATSUKI doesn't matter.

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,692
We knew the student
council was strong.

423
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:26,275
The problem is what came after.

424
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,817
They played. And we
were waiting excitedly

425
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,650
for Shinonon's unit
to take the stage,

426
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,733
but something weird happened.

427
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,817
The instant AKATSUKI's
turn was over,

428
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,400
that was it.

429
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,025
[SUBARU]
Huh?

430
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,150
[SUBARU] The audience
just got up and left.

431
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,275
It was like the tide
was pulling out.

432
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:45,567
At an official DreFes,

433
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,900
the higher-ranking
unit performs first.

434
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,317
So in order to raise your grade,

435
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,525
you're only required to review
the higher-ranking unit.

436
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,067
Watching what plays
after can seem

437
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,483
like a waste of time.

438
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,775
But Shinonon worked
so hard for this.

439
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,525
He saved up all the money
he earned from his jobs.

440
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:03,233
He wanted to shine during
his first performance.

441
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:06,483
But, his hard work
didn't pay off.

442
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,067
There's definitely something
wrong with the system.

443
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,567
I can't allow it!

444
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,858
Up until now, this felt like
someone else's problem.

445
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,775
I never really
understood why you guys

446
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:50,025
wanted to fight the
student council. But...

447
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,025
If it's because of them and
because of the messed up

448
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,358
structure of Yumenosaki
Academy that sweet

449
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,483
and gentle kids are made to cry,

450
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,692
then I'm all in now.

451
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,317
I wanna see this whole
system destroyed!

452
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,942
[ANZU]
When such intense emotions

453
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,108
came pouring out of Subaru--

454
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,608
someone who's usually
so cheerful and silly--

455
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:13,817
I knew it was a moment
I would never forget.
