00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,275
[ANZU] The leaves are beginning
to change all around us.

2
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:14,608
It feels like
autumn is setting in.

3
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:16,817
Fueled by their loss
at the Summer Live,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Trickstar is on
a nationwide pilgrimage

5
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:22,108
to hone their skills for
a comeback performance.

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,733
[ANZU]
Mm.

7
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,108
[EICHI]
Have you seen it yet?

8
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:00,442
The proposal for
Trickstar's Revenge Match.

9
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:01,942
I was under the impression

10
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:05,275
that you requested a competition
with Reimei Academy's Eve.

11
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,983
[EICHI]
I did, but

12
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,317
we received a rather strange
offer from Cosmic Production.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,775
That's the name of Eve's agency.

14
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:14,108
Oh, wow.

15
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,650
[TORI]
Shuetsu Academy?

16
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,900
Which is known as an affiliate
school of Reimei Academy.

17
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:22,025
They replied inviting
Trickstar to participate

18
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,483
in their Autumn Live.

19
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,775
[YUZURU]
Does that mean their opponents

20
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,525
would then be Adam
instead of Eve?

21
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:29,483
Right.

22
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,150
That is a strange offer.

23
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,692
[TORI]
Hm?

24
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:34,858
Trickstar doesn't
think it's that odd.

25
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,483
They're jumping
at the opportunity

26
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:37,983
and planning to accept.

27
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,567
I'm a little worried.

28
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,942
You-know-who goes
to Shuetsu Academy.

29
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,525
What?! Who does?!
What are you talking about?!

30
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,775
Please calm down. I'll tell you
the whole story in due time.

31
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,150
On a different note,

32
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,942
I also have a proposal,
dear President.

33
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,983
[MAO panting]
Sorry I'm late, guys!

34
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,442
You okay, Sally?

35
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:04,108
Ritsu refused to wake up
this morning, as usual,

36
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,733
then I had to make him breakfast
and get him dressed, too.

37
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,317
He can be such a pain!

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,692
I'm surprised you
made it here at all!

39
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,067
All right, let's go!
To Shuitsu--

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,317
Uh, uh, I mean,
to Shuetsu Academy!

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,983
--[MAKOTO] Aw, yeah!
--[GROUP] Yeah!

42
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,400
[SUBARU] Can you believe
we'll be staying there

43
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:23,692
for a whole week?

44
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,858
I'm amazed that they
bothered to arrange hotels

45
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:27,650
for every one of us, y'know?

46
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,650
It feels like a school trip!

47
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,525
I can't wait to play games and
have pillow fights every night!

48
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:35,483
You do realize we're going
out there for work, right?

49
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,400
Adam will also be
there. Get ready.

50
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,150
Yes, but that doesn't matter.

51
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,442
My proposal was
a rematch with Eve.

52
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,942
Apparently, there was
some political interference.

53
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,400
But Adam is on par with Eve, so
that's who we're battling now.

54
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,942
Talk about short notice.

55
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,108
Look closely at
the edited proposal.

56
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,025
It doesn't say if it's
a real rematch or not.

57
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,900
What do you mean?

58
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,150
Shuetsu Academy's
affiliate school idols

59
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,192
always attend the Autumn Live.

60
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,025
So we could be featured
as the guest performers.

61
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:06,567
Well, if that's the case,

62
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,025
then it's not actually a fair
rematch of the Summer Live.

63
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,400
This all feels like someone
is enjoying watching us

64
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:14,192
dance in the palm of their hand.

65
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,900
But we're already
on our way there,

66
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,275
so we may as well
try to have fun, right?

67
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,608
I can't wait to see what
the members of Adam are like!

68
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,567
I'm so excited!

69
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,275
Slow down. Let's focus on
the concert ahead first.

00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,358
I've been waiting for you.

Is that really you, Ao, sir?

77
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,650
What are you
doing at this school?

78
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,733
Nobody told you, I guess?

79
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,900
I've been sent here
to support you guys.

80
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:51,317
A few others from Yumenosaki

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,358
will be there to
cheer you on, as well.

82
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:58,192
He... I mean, Nagisa used
to go to school there, too.

83
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,525
We were in the old
fine unit together.

84
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,025
Anyway, we're friends,

85
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,942
so I figured I'd make myself
available to help if needed.

Thank you very much!

[SUBARU]
This place is gigantic!

00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,233
Look at the pretty, shiny floor!

89
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:16,733
The members of Adam all have
their own reception offices?

90
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,817
Shuetsu Academy must be
a highly ranked school.

91
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,483
Yeah, I think I know why.

92
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,692
I heard that they only
accept honor students

93
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,608
from all the affiliate schools.

94
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,358
And since honor
students can have

95
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:30,692
multiple reception offices
and practice rooms, they do.

96
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,900
Must be nice to
be a student here.

97
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,775
Yeah, unless you're
not an honor student.

98
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,817
Then you'd be stuck
maintaining the facility

99
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,775
and other exciting chores.

100
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:40,733
Even though they're students?

101
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:43,525
Sazanami said they're
not considered equal.

102
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,817
He said that non-honor
students of Shuetsu

103
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,567
are basically
treated like slaves.

[TSUMUGI]
Looks like this is it.

105

Weird. It's locked.

To have such a talented

We are quite fortunate indeed.

I have to say,
I am a huge fan of yours!

Nice to meet you, Saegusa.

Is Nagisa around somewhere?

131
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:59,192
Oh, His Excellency was
finishing up an excavation

132
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,442
and got carried away.

133

He's not quite fit to
be seen at the moment.

But I'll have him introduce
himself a little later,

know that you're most welcome!

you meant me, right?

[IBARA] A tablet we
distribute to all the students

172
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,608

temporary CosPro members.

Students from Shuetsu and
Reimei Academy all belong to it.

178
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:52,942
They rep affiliate students,
too, but it's mostly exclusive.

There are many benefits.

You'll receive training
and management as well.

181

you as affiliate honor students

Okay. I've got a question
I'd like to ask you now.

226
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,025
[NAGISA]
All right.

227
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:05,358
I wanna know what
that rock thing is.

228
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,483
I've no clue.

229
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,942
And that is why it intrigues me.

230
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,192
It's something I excavated
from an ancient layer of earth.

231
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:17,108
How riveting. Still,
I'd rather you look at me.

232
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,275
[NAGISA]
Would you?

233
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:20,358
I realize, from your
worldly perspective,

234
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,150
that thing is more important.

235
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,525
But by not looking,
you're assuming I'm harmless.

236
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,358
Know what I mean?

237
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,608
I was just kidding!
It felt right at the time!

238
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,275
[NAGISA]
It's all right.

239
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,900
Though, I admit,
what you say saddens me.

240
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:37,483
Why?

241
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,275
[NAGISA] It reminds me so much
of something Eichi would say.

242
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:44,192
None can doubt you are
a Yumenosaki Academy student.

243
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,608
No desire to improve,
but you'll fight each other

244
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:50,150
and struggle to find
an optimal solution.

245
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:51,650
You repeat this several times

246
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,067
hoping it'll make
you a better person.

247
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,400
It's the innate desire
of all living creatures.

248
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:02,108
But it makes me sad
because stagnation equals death.

249
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:05,317
And if killing each other is
the duty of living creatures,

250
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,358
well then, I want
deliverance from that.

251
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:12,692
What I desire most is a
world free from conflict.

252
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,650
When I look at the living,

253
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,483
what I see are
God's failed creations.

254
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:21,692
To live is torture.
Life is divine punishment.

255
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,942
Life is the original sin
that cannot be forgiven.

256
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,650
Is it wrong to long to be free?

257
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:31,358
Do you blame me for wanting
to be released from that trap?

258
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:35,108
Heh. You will
not get in my way.

259

If you try to keep me imprisoned
here, you will certainly fail

260
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,108

with me instead.

nothing to do with idols.

it doesn't mean I can't go
