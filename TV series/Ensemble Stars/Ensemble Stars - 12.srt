[SAGAMI]
Welcome to the DDD semifinal!

00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,733
For the second match,
we have a showdown between...

3
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,483
...the unit, UNDEAD!

What do you think, Tenshouin?

5
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,983
This is pretty ironic, isn't it?

6
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,858
Everyone thought I was buried,

7
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:32,608
but I rose from
the dead like a demon,

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,733
and you, once known as Emperor,

9
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,983
are on your way to becoming
a dweller of the underworld.

10
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,692
And fine!

11
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,650
Is that so?

we're in an old Victorian drama.

I agree!

They've been waiting!

16

This is like a battlefield

18
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,025
that will send us to Valhalla!

Dancing a bloody waltz
with a former friend

20
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:01,942

Stand up. You're still on stage.

00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,983
You must show
dignity at all times,

or at least until
the curtain falls.

What about you, Mr. President?
Are you feeling any better?

I'm not so sure.

It's kind of late to ask,

341
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:31,817
but why did you
decide to have the DDD?

342
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,233
Couldn't fine have represented
the school at the SS

343
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,942
without you pushing
yourself to such extremes?

That's a very good question.

I don't know for sure.

00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,942
I suppose I wanted
to see a miracle happen.

347
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,775
There's power in the
way you shine on stage.

348
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,317
It could change a fate
that was set in stone.

349
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,317
I was born with
this weakened body.

350
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,692
I cursed God many times.

351
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,358
And yet, if there are still
miracles in this world--

352
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:03,692
if there are hopes, and
dreams, and love left here...

353
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:06,983
...then maybe I can
also accept my fate.

354
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,942
You cannot become an
idol with just love alone,

355
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,275
but without that love
you won't succeed.

00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:18,192
Honestly, all I wanted
was to simply be an idol.

I think I understand

I also want to be an idol in
the purest sense of the word.

Everyone in the idol course
at Yumenosaki feels that way.

It's not over yet.

the stipulation is that there
will be an overtime match.

more votes than Trickstar, true,
