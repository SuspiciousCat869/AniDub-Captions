[HOKUTO] Not bad, but there's
always room for improvement.

I think the chorus choreography
could use a little work.

it does need something.

that vampire

He fought so that his dear
friends could enjoy their youth.

point of that work

up his energy.

as the first-aid office

00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,150
They told me I could keep half
of the profit after the event.

159
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,358
That's called easy money.

160
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,567
You're supposed to be conserving
your energy, remember?

161
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,233
Not wasting it on cupcakes!

162
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,733
[RITSU] Thing is, people didn't
like these ones very much,

163
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,025
so I tried a new recipe.

164
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:23,567
You have a performance later.
Go get some rest.

165
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,650
Hey, why don't you taste
test the ones I brought?

166
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:31,150
If I know someone's tried it,
I'll be able to rest.

167
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,025
What if Anzu tries it?

168
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,233
Ugh. You can't serve these.

169
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,192
They don't look safe
for humans to eat.

170
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:42,733
How very rude and uncultured.
These are quality desserts.

171
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,150
Here.

172
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,233
Say, "ahh."

173
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,275
Ahh...

174
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,817
[groans] No, stop!

175
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,025
Get away it from me!

176
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,942
[KOGA screams]

177
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,317
[RITSU] Corgi looked
so funny, didn't he?

178
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,317
It was so nice of him to help
me transport the desserts.

179
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,608
[KOGA panting]

180
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,608
You know, Sakuma, apart
from the appearance,

181
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,900
your desserts were pretty
yummy! You did a great job!

182
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,858
It's unfortunate that Ogami
didn't like them so much.

183
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:13,275
Nah, it's fine. I know the
Corgi doesn't like sweets.

184
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:14,650
And by the way,

185
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,567
I don't like being called
by my last name ever.

186
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,108
Please call me Ritsu.

187
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,817
Okay. Sorry, Ritsu.
I think that's it over there.

188
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,358
[RITSU]
The music room?

189
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:33,983
Now where is it? I'm not seeing
a bed anywhere around here.

190
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:37,775
Whenever I'm here, my favorite
thing to do is play piano.

191
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:38,983
[ANZU]
You can play?

192
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,900
[piano plays]

193
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,400
[RITSU]
In the beginning,

194
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:45,442
Mr. Kunugi would get mad
at me for playing so much.

195
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,400
Now he lets me stay
here as long as I want to.

196
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:51,025
Sometimes he even
gives me lessons.

197
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,317
But then Nacchan found out
and got pretty upset with me.

198
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,692
Who's that?

199
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,733
[RITSU] Narukami Arashi.
He's also in Knights.

200
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:02,192
When I first met him, I always
used to call him Nakkun,

201
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,608
but now he prefers
to be called Nacchan.

202
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,692
I don't get what
difference it makes.

203
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,358
I used to let little things
like that annoy me a lot.

204
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,983
But, then recently, I'm
finding that I'm okay with it.

205
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,692
I'll tolerate a lot
to not have to be alone.

206
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,317
It's strange.
I never thought I'd be one

207
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,650
of the ones who felt this way.

208
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,733
But still, I need to make
sure I have boundaries.

209
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,067
I don't want to be like brother

210
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,483
and lose everything
important to me.

211
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,317
I really am low on energy.

212
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,942
By the way, what is that?

213
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,442
[ANZU]
Oh!

214
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,817
That's it!

215
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,817
[RITSU]
Hm?

216
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,442
It's a special bed
just for you!

217
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,692
--[ANZU gasps]
--[RITSU] Hmm.

218
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,233
[RITSU[ It does kinda look
like a bed, doesn't it?

219
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:47,525
[ANZU]
Yeah.

220
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:48,900
[RITSU]
But if I sleep here,

221
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,858
I'll be like brother,
and that's not what I want.

222
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,983
[ANZU gasps]
I'm sorry!

223
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,275
I was told you also
lived like a vampire,

224
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:57,775
so that's why
I designed it like this.

225
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,817
[RITSU]
You designed it?

226
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
I did.

227
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:01,150
[RITSU]
Something about your reaction

228
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,317
earlier tells me otherwise.

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,983
Yeah, well...

230
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,817
It doesn't matter.

231
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,233
The fact remains that
I'm still quite tired.

232
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,608
I'll sleep here and
let you know what I think.

233
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,233
Yay! It's so soft.

234
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,775
Fascinating. I wonder why he
doesn't like his older brother.

235
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:30,817
[SORA] Woo-hoo!
He doesn't actually hate him.

236
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,692
[gasps]

237
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,108
You're being rude.

238
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,275
That's information you
should keep to yourself, Sora.

239
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:38,525
Pardon us, we
couldn't help overhearing.

240
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,275
But I could tell
it was about Rei.

241
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,442
So, of course, I was curious.

242
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:46,025
Look at that.
It's a little morbid,

243
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:48,942
but clearly a lot of
love went into making it.

244
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,317
What a complicated
and beautiful color.

245
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,692
[ANZU]
Huh?

246
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,650
Sora's good at
reading that stuff.

247
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,567
He's very talented
at a lot of things.

248
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,733
[KOGA] So what was
the point of that work

249
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,275
if his own brother collapses?

250
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,233
Why did he bother going
through all of that trouble.

251
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,900
You know what I mean?

252
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:10,483

his big brother really feels.

Is that Maakun?

Anzu asked me to come
in here and wake you up.

261

Did she now?

262

She lies and she's
not very good at it.

Okay?

266
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,442
It could just be me.
There is a lot of light around.

If so, I'm very grateful to you.

You and everybody in Knights.

Thank you for the
warm rays of light

that you shone
right into my soul,

It shone in me, burned in me,
until I was almost ash.

274
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,317
But amazingly,
I didn't mind it at all.

275
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,567
I wouldn't want you to turn to
ash even if you begged for it.

276
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,650
[RITSU chuckles]
I wonder if my brother

277
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:33,025
ever experienced a feeling
like this way back then.

278
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,733
Oh, like last year?

279
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,567
When the student
council president's unit

defeated the Five Eccentrics?

281
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:42,025
During those earlier times,
brother was quite fond of

282
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:44,275
anything that was
bright and warm.

283
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,025
He tried so hard
to protect them,

284
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,817
even though he
knew it was impossible.

285
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,275
In the end, he lost everything,
including what he already had.

go get ready for the concert.

time you want. I mean it.

Is it a Halloween costume?

Yeah, I'm taking in one of his
spares just in case he needs it.

Ah...

315
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,025
What was I thinking?
I suppose you're right.

316

[ANZU sighs]

317
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,525
It's been a long time since

318
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,650
I've been able to feel
the warmth of a human.

319
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,942
It's absolutely invigorating!

320
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:10,108
Allow me to carry you to
the concert site as an apology.

[ANZU yells]

322
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,067
M'lady,

323
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,400
I see you've been successful
in making Ritsu sleep.

324
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,233
[ANZU]
It's nothing!

325
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,400
As his brother, I thank you.

326
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,358
I'm grateful for your time
and dedication to this.

327
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,192
[ANZU]
I just--

328
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,692
You are a rare one.

329
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,317
Perhaps I should lock you
away in my treasure room.

330
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,025
Come along, my beloved children.

331
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:29,942
The pandemonium's
about to begin.

332
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,275
We don't want to miss a minute!

333
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:33,817
[HINATA, YUTA]
Okay!

334
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,442
[KAORU]
All right, what's going on?

335
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,775
Isn't that supposed to
be the role I'm playing?

336
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:41,858
[REI]
It's just the way it turned out.

337
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,567
What happened with
the old vampire?

338
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,233
Did he do anything weird to you?

339
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,150
No, not really.

340
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,150
I wonder if the thing that

341
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,900
happened earlier
counts as weird?

342
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,650
That was a pretty
scandalous situation.

343
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,567
Interesting costume.

344
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,650
Are you dressed
as a priest, Kaoru?

345
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,025
They are enemies
of vampires, you know.

346
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:00,442
[KAORU] Yes, but it's
not what you think.

347
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,983
I'm the bad priest
that gobbles up girls.

348
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,317
I'm an ally of monsters!

349
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,483
If you don't believe
in God, it's okay.

350
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,275
You can still believe in me.

[ADONIS]
The kids gave these to me.

355
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:19,900
Usually when I go into town,
they all run away in fear,

356
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,608
but they seem to like
me in this costume.

357
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,067
Hakaze was so gracious
to help me out with it.

358
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,317
Thank you, sir.

359
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,067
Don't be silly,
all I did was encourage them.

--[DOGS barking]

Did you just cut?

00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,192
You have to wait your turn!

00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,983
I'll get to all
of you, I promise.

364
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,692
Wow, that's a lot of dogs.

365
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,775
There're so many, I can hardly
tell which one is our puppy.

366
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,858
I'm sure you can
if you try a little harder.

367
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,608
Those puppies are
having so much fun!

It's funny. He's an idol, too.

369

Though, at the moment, it seems
like only dogs are interested.

Let's go, Puppy.
Time to hit that stage.

[KOGA]
Huh?

You think you can just
show up and make me leave?

We figured we
should go on first.

Bats are like
our familiar spirits.

Although, that doesn't
mean we're the opening act.

Be sure to stay on
guard if you don't want us

to rip the carpet
out from under you.

planning to destroy us.

Very well, then.
I wish you luck.

rare celebration where monsters

and humans intermingle,
granting each other grace.

No, he just finished performing,

right. I agree.
