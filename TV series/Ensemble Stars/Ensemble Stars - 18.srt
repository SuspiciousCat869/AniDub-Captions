Yes.

25
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,692
I had ideas
about Knights' Leader.

26
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,567
That he'd become
some magnificent guy,

chivalry, you know?

But, instead,
he's a total weirdo.

29
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,483
You have a history. Knights
was one of the three powers.

30
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:46,650
And Tsukinaga wielded his sword
valiantly from the front lines.

31
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,983
But in the end,

32
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,567
nobody could understand
the way your leader acted.

33

You almost disbanded, right?

00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:53,858
But as I recall,

35
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,858
Knights took a long hiatus
and got back together.

36
00:02:56,942 --> 00:03:00,150
The Knights as you are right now
are little more than wreckage

37
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,442
of the dream that
Tsukinaga destroyed.

38

Don't talk like that!

we kept fighting to
protect Knights from harm!

[KEITO]
Of course you did.

42

I meant that's what
Knights means to Tsukinaga.

43
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,983
Oh. Sorry, that was rude.

44
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,983
So now that our Leader is
suddenly back out of the blue,

45
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,567
does that mean we're
destined to go through

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,608
the same hardships
we had to endure before?

to stand against our president?

Why don't we try the library?

I happen to believe that Knights

That's why I endured

00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,400
You're just the youngest
sibling in the bunch.

320
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:29,400
Let your big brothers spoil you
once in a while, little brat.

321
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,025
[CROWD cheering]

322
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,108
[KURO] Nito, right now
we're Knight Killers.

323
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,567
Try to toughen
up your baby face.

324
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,608
[NAZUNA]
That's right.

325
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,692
I'm a bad guy today.

326
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,317
[NAZUNA sighs] But I can't
let my good little Ra*bits

327
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,775
see me like this! It's not me!

328
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,275
[IZUMI] I know what I said to
Kasa, but get ready, King.

329
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:12,525
Because I'm gonna drag you out.

330
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:15,108
I'll find out what your
real intentions are.

331
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,150
Knights still exists now,

332
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,025
but only because you
fought tooth and nail

333
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,817
to keep them alive through
the war with the Emperor

334
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,942
and the tumultuous times
that war brought about.

335
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,942
You abandoned so many things,

336
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,567
and fought until you
were black and blue.

337
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,692
I have no idea what kind
of creature you've turned into,

338
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,692
or who you've grown to be.

339
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,150
But I do know this:

340
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,192
I don't want to believe that

341
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,192
you've become
some kind of tyrant

342
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:42,775
who's sacrificed everything
to fulfill his selfish desires.

343
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,275
Because then,

344
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,358
you'd have turned into the
very thing that you hated most.

345
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,733
You'd be just like the Emperor.

346
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,067
[ARASHI]
Izumi.

347
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,483
I don't really know.

348
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,942
I don't think Setchan will lose.

349
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,483
But things certainly
aren't looking good this time.

350
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,025
What do you mean by that?

351
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,233
[RITSU]
Knight Killers' advantage

352
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,233
is that King's on their side.

353
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:03,442
They have an infinite number
of songs at their disposal.

354
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,650
Essentially, our opponents
have a limitless supply

355
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,358
of ammunition in their
repertoire to use against us.

356
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,858
And we've just got
a few makeshift songs.

357
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,733
We're going to run
out of ammo very soon.

358
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:17,108
So, like I said,
it doesn't look good.

359
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,525
We should've come
out fighting with

360
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,858
our whole team from
the very beginning.

361
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,192
Sorry.

362
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,692
I was responsible for
coming up with a strategy.

363
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,733
Don't be so hard on yourself.

364
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,525
It's okay.

365
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:32,108
You and the rest of Knights
are arrogant and composed.

366
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:33,192
But I know why.

367
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,692
It's grown out of
the pride you feel

368
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,900
from winning all
the time, hasn't it?

369
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,567
You always seem to be
proud and full of confidence,

370
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,775
but underneath all that you
have real skill to back it up.

371
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,192
Which is why

372
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,900
I look up to you guys more
than you could ever know.

373
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,650
So keep your chin up.

374
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,983
Stop acting as though
you've already lost this fight.

375
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:53,275
Knights will win today.

376
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,108
We'll bring it home
the same way we always do.

377
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,400
Isn't that right?

378
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,650
Is that what you
actually think of us?

379
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,233
I'd no clue.

380
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:05,150
But I'm honored to know that you
look up to us as much as you do.

381
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,442
Well then, talk about pressure.

382
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:10,233
I've got a lot to live
up to from now on.

383
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:13,192
Better wake up
and give it my all.

384
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,025
Ritsu, sir!

385
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,650
[RITSU]
So that's that.

386
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,608
The first match
will be ending soon.

387
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:22,108
And our next opponent
will probably be...

388
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,067
I'll get a win for us.

389
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,733
I'll at least bring
it up to a tie.

390
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,567
You know why?

391
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,108
Because I'd die
before breaking a promise.

392
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:35,608
After me, you'll go
head-to-head with King.

393
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,442
Make sure you win.

394
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:40,025
Or else this will
have all been in vain.

395
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,233
I want you to rise
far above us.

396
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,067
Reach high and grasp the future.

397
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,317
See ya. I'll be back.

398
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,317
Yes, sir! Break a leg!

399
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,483
[TSUKASA]
Why is it that,

400
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,067
in such a seemingly
hopeless situation,

401
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,358
I feel strangely invigorated?

402
00:18:56,442 --> 00:19:00,358
It feels like today's the first
time Knights is truly a unit.

403
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:04,275
We face death and will fight
bravely to the bitter end.

404
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,983
We're like a well-made sword.

405
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,275
We'll be proud knights!

406
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,358
Wanna know somethin', newbie?

407
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:20,900
I like that
expression on your face.

408
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:23,608
Ritsu, Sena, and Naru
have each fallen.

409
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:24,817
That's not all.

410
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,067
Everyone else on
my side is out, too.

411
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,400
[TSUKASA]
Leader.

412
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,692
Tell me, how much of this
was part of your plan?

413
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,192
At the start,

414
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:37,692
this Judgment was about an
argument between the two of us.

415
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,192
And look what happened.

416
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,775
It turns out we're
fighting one-on-one.

417
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,525
So answer my question.

418
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,525
Did you have us in your
grasp this whole time?

419
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,942
You give me too
much credit, newbie.

420
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:52,442
It's not like I'm some
all-knowing, all-powerful god.

421
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,525
I mean, I am a genius and
God loves me for that, sure,

422
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:59,817
but I'm by no means omniscient.

423
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,692
A while back, I had
the wrong idea about that.

424
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,150
I did whatever I wanted.

425
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,817
I manipulated and
hurt so many people.

426
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,483
I made some irreparable mistakes

427
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,775
and by the time I realized
that, it was too late.

428
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,692
I lost it all and had to run.

429
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:18,108
It's totally pathetic,
I know. I admit that.

430
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:21,358
I was blind to what
even a child could see.

431
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,942
I was just like the proverbial
emperor with no clothes.

432
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,442
I looked like such a fool.

433
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,067
I don't deserve loyalty.

434
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,358
How could Knights wait
on me and swear fealty?

435
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:32,608
You see?

436
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,858
That's why, if you win,
I'll walk away quietly.

437
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,108
I felt a lot of guilt
for leaving you,

438
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,608
so I just wanted to drop by.

439
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:44,400
But now I see. I never had
anything to worry about!

440
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:45,817
Knights belongs to all of you,

441
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,483
so do what you want,
with my blessing.

442
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,983
That is your final
order from your King.

443
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,483
Though he's incompetent.

444
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,567
[TSUKASA] You don't have
to be so selfish, you know.

445
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,858
Huh?

446
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:59,067
I won't let you just
walk away like that.

447
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,400
Not after you manipulated us.

448
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,650
That's not how
this is gonna work.

449
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,400
You say you're our King,

450
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:08,317
but I still don't know
anything about you.

451
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,192
At the very least,
you have to regale us

452
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,775
with your war stories.

453
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,650
Tales of your heroism.

454
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,608
Though you might
think they're foolish,

455
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,025
I know this much--

456
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,608
they would definitely
make the rest of us proud.

457
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:25,025
[chuckles] I really doubt you'd
find any of it interesting.

458
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:28,442
But I guess,
I might consider it.

459
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:30,858
Come on! Let's compete!

460
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,858
No.

461
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,317
Let's have some fun, newbie!

462
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,233
[TSUKASA laughs]
Yes, Leader!

463
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,192
One last thing though.
You said you'd do whatever

464
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,233
we say if we won, right?

465
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:45,192
You better believe I'm not
gonna let you take that back!

466
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,442
So then, if I win this,

467
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:48,900
my first order--

468
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,275
you'll use my name.

469
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:53,067
Don't call me newbie again!

470
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,483
Let's start over
with introductions.

471
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:59,400
O prodigal King of Knights
who's finally returned.

472
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,233
Now, you'll hear my name,

473
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:04,317
and repeat after me--
Suou Tsukasa!

474
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,192
Hello, sir. I'm honored
to make your acquaintance!

475
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,567
[chuckles]
