[TRICKSTAR, EDEN MEMBERS]
Coming to you live!

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,692
The Pre-SS Special,
Trickstar versus Eden!

5
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,567
And a hot discussion!

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,233
Keep your eyes on us! We're
the frontrunners in this game!

7
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:30,983
[SUBARU]
We'll be going till morning!

8
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,692
Wait, how long did you say?

9
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,858
I can't stay in character
without a script until morning.

10
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,442
We're live.

11
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,067
Please keep comments like that
to a whisper, Your Excellency.

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,108
Excuse me! Can we cut?

13
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,900
Please edit that last part!

14
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,108
Wait. Like, cut it out?

15
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,650
[ANZU]
Shh!

16
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,067
[ANZU] There were only
a few days left in the year,

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,692
and on that day I was helping
out with the production

18
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,983
of the televised SS pre-show.

19
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:59,442
[ANZU] Question one:
Why did you become idols?

20
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:01,442
I guess somebody's ready
to begin questioning!

21
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,983
Well, excuse me! [sighs]

22
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,567
I should've arranged to have
more of our own staff here.

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,358
Sit down. You're being
a little much right now.

24
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,483
I have to agree with Nagisa!

25
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,483
Yumenosaki Academy's
hosting the SS, aren't they?

26
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,817
So then why would you want
to put their reputation at risk?

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,567
This is a battle field,
and we're all here to fight.

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,400
Don't you think pretending
to be best friends

29
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:26,358
and shaking hands is a bit
hypocritical at this point?

30
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,942
Nothing can be gained
from creating conflict.

31
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:32,150
However, this world is Hell.

32
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,108
Only a handful of
people can survive

33
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,817
without devouring
the flesh of others.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,233
I'm sorry?

35
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,150
[NAGISA] Normally,
one solely talks to God

36
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,525
at a place of worship.

37
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:44,400
Occasionally, they'll
go out and give to charity,

38
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,150
share some hopeful
thoughts and prayers,

39
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,525
and receive a
few smiles as a reward.

40
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,233
However, here in
modern day Japan,

41
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,317
the only way to
lead that ideal life

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,733
of being someone's dream
is to become an idol.

43
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,775
Well, that was my reason.

44
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,733
My father wished it as well.

45
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,983
Do you have any stories
about him? What was he like?

46
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,275
He was quite similar
to your father actually.

47
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:09,317
[SUBARU]
Huh?

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,025
They were more
like father and son.

49
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,275
One could say
they had twin souls.

50
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,608
But by some unexpected twist,

51
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:18,150
both of them ended up
with opposite fates.

52
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,567
Question is,

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,150
will you choose to walk
the same path as your father?

54
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,525
My dad has nothing
to do with this!

55
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:26,942
He may have been
the initial reason

56
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:28,608
I wanted to become an idol.

57
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,317
But now there are others.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Since I've been at Yumenosaki,
I have met many who inspire me.

59
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,983
Becoming an idol is
more important to me now

60
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,775
than it ever was before.

61
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:43,233
I could do this forever with
the kind of friends I've made.

62
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:47,483
What's that look?
Mind blown? [chuckles]

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,817
[EICHI]
Yes. I see.

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,317
That's what I'd
expect from Eden.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,608
They seemed used
to this kind of thing.

66
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,775
Not the same at Yumenosaki.

67
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,400
We tend to go down
the concert artist path.

68
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,192
But Eden does better
in terms of media strategy.

69
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,900
Their production
company, CosPro,

70
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,150
is building a campaign
to split the power of

71
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,650
Yumenosaki Academy and
the idol industry in two.

72
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,692
If this contest's outcome
was determined online,

73
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:51,858
their institutional might
would surely destroy us.

74
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:55,317
However, the SS is
a live concert event.

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,442
And what's more, we'll have
the academy's full support.

76
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,567
I'm counting on Trickstar.

77
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,025
If anyone can bring us
a miracle, it's them.

78
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:07,525
Speaking of, how are
those guys doing?

79
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,608
Are they out training
for the SS now?

80
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,650
No, they're off today.

81
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,525
[MAKOTO]
I've done everything I can.

82
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,108
There's no reason to stress
about it at this point.

83
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,525
Besides, I need to find a way
to recharge before the match.

84
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:23,442
She's starting to turn into a
real producer these days.

85
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,733
I'm proud of her.

86
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,150
[MAKOTO gasps]
Hey! What are you doing?

87
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,775
Snatching people's things
is theft, you know!

88
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,025
Wait! You have such a pretty
face, you shouldn't hide it.

89
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:35,025
Let me take some shots of you.

90
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,900
Come on, give us
a smile. [chuckles]

91
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,567
You're being especially
cheery today,

92
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,317
and it's kinda creeping me out.

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,150
So what is it? What's going on?

94
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,567
[IZUMI]
I don't understand.

95
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,275
Do you expect me to be a
grouch when we're out on a date?

96
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:50,692
I'm having so much
fun just the two of us.

97
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:53,150
And look! You're even
wearing the scarf I gave you!

98
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,692
Why wouldn't I want
to capture the moment?

99
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,775
You'd complain
if I didn't wear it!

100
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,483
Oh, don't give me that!

101
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,233
I hate how you're always
so shy, Yuu. [chuckles]

102
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:02,650
That's fine.

103
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,608
Honestly, you can think
whatever you want to, Izumi.

104
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,567
Here. Got you a
Christmas present.

105

[IZUMI gasps]

106
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,192
Y'know, for the scarf.

107
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,817
--[IZUMI] Whoa, what?
--And to say thank you.

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,025
[laughs] I recognize these!

109
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:18,692
We used them when we
were child models together!

110
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:21,317
Cosmetics designed for
elementary school boys.

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,983
It was really innovative
for its time, wasn't it?

112
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,650
I can't believe they're
still selling these!

113
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,192
You and I have been through
a lot, haven't we, Izumi?

114
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:31,692
I'm grateful for all
you've done for me.

115
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:37,192
[scoffs] I can tell
you're being cheeky.

116
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,650
Whatever. Boys who
work hard grow up

117
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,025
to become the treasures
of this world.

118
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,192
Thanks, Izumi.

119
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,733
[RITSU]
Get a room.

120
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,775
No one here needs to
know all of your business.

121
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm sorry!

122
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:53,275
What's with Isara?
He still asleep?

123
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,483
Yeah. Looks like.

124
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,608
He said being busy
helps him relax.

125
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,817
I guess he's feeling
overwhelmed.

126
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,775
Anyway, I decided
to force him to sleep.

127
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,108
How did you
manage to do that?

128
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,567
[RITSU]
You're not really interested.

129
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,942
You're here for another reason.

130
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,067
[MAKOTO]
Oh. Yeah.

131
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,775
What's he talking about?

132
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:14,025
Hold on. Eden's doing
a concert here today.

133
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:17,275
Because this is Yumenosaki
Academy's hometown,

134
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:20,067
they're trying to get as many
people from enemy territory

135
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,733
on their side before
they perform in the SS.

136
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,733
Wow. That's a lot of effort.

137
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,233
Everyone knows
they're number one.

138
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,108
It's strange they'd go that far.

139
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:32,233
Why should they be complacent?
Just 'cause they're strong?

140
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,483
[RITSU chuckles] Okay, I guess
I'll be the one to carry Maakun.

141
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,775
I mean, we don't want a repeat
of the Summer Live, right?

142
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,233
We'll spy discreetly.

143
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:43,483
[IBARA] Well. Well, well, well,
who do we have here?

144
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:47,942
I knew it. It's Trickstar's
very own Yuuki Makoto!

145
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:50,150
Cameraman, I'm going
to stand next to him.

146
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,483
Follow me and get some shots

147
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,483
and make sure you
get our best angles.

148
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,483
Tch! Just you two?

149
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,983
Oh! Oops!

150
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,942
I'm sorry, cameras are so
traumatic for you, aren't they?

151
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,525
[IBARA laughs]

152
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,067
What's up with this guy?

153
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,358
Somehow he figured out
that we came here to spy,

154
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,775
and now he's trying
to provoke us on camera.

155
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,775
I'm not buying his act.

156
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,650
Hey, I'm an idol, too, ya know!

157
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,358
You don't need to be concerned
about me and cameras.

158
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,942
[IBARA]
I beg your pardon. Forgive me.

159
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:21,442
Well, as a fellow idol, I hope
you will join me in an alliance.

160
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,483
I have a favor to ask of you.

161
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm sure you wouldn't
refuse a special request,

162
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,900
especially on camera.

163

[HIYORI]
Thank you, everyone!

164
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,733
We're so happy to
have you all here today!

165
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,317
We've had such a good time

166
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,733
and we hope you'll
support us at the SS, too!

[CROWD cheers]

168
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,525
What's going on?

169
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,025
How did we manage
to get roped into

170
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,567
performing here all of a sudden?

171
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,233
Sorry, I guess I fell
for his provocation.

172
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,525
They're trying
to make us look bad

173
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,192
in front of everyone
before the SS.

174
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:55,733
They have four people,
we only have two.

175
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:58,525
We don't even have
our outfits with us.

176
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:01,150
Just then, the magnificent
backup group entered!

177
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,817
Hey, good morning, Ritsu.

178
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,817
Just a minute.

179
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,608
What are you doing
in that outfit?

180
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,733
[RITSU chuckles] We brought
one for you, too, see?

181
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:10,483
And one for Yuu, as well.

[MAKOTO gasps]

183

sells uniforms. Cool, huh?

Hurry up and get changed.

[MAKOTO, MAO]
Okay!

We've got surprise guests!

[CROWD cheers]

188
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,983
I really don't care if
they're Eden or <i>oden</i> .

189
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,275
Rampaging in our hometown

190
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,358
is completely over
the top and uncalled for.

191
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,400
Let me handle this for you.

192
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,025
It's the least
I can do to repay you

193
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,983
for taking care
of me every day.

194
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,900
Did you honestly think
backups would be allowed?

195
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,358
What are you scared?

196
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,358
I've heard you're one of
the strongest units there is,

197
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,192
but this is pretty tragic.

198
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:46,192
If I'm afraid of anything,
it's clueless commoners like you

199
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,442
disrupting such
a professional event.

200
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,942
Are you trying to
work us up or something?

201
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,942
Well, that is
unfortunate because

202
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,400
Trickstar is way more annoying

203
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:57,817
than you could ever even
hope to be, so, there! Heh!

204
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,150
Damn! What the heck?

205
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,150
That is way too brutal,
even for someone like you!

206
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,525
Let's stop the madness
and start singing.

207
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,400
Otherwise, our audience
is going to fall asleep.

208
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,317
Don't you agree, Nagisa?

209
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,983
[NAGISA]
Mm-hm.

210
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,858
Okay, I guess it's fine.

211
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,650
I will allow them
to join with us.

212
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:18,775
Trickstar and...
you other guys...

213
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,400
...from some unit
that no one knows about!

214
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:24,108
That's not true.
You know who we are.

215
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,400
If you don't, we'll show
you that we're real idols

216
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,358
from Yumenosaki Academy, too.

217
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:31,150
It's my fault that Knights
can't participate in the SS,

218
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,858
but they sure deserve to.

219
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:35,900
Did you just
mention the Knights?

220
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,275
So I guess that
group still exists.

221
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,650
Wow.

222
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,692
Well, I guess that
makes sense... for you.

223
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,275
You're acting like you know me.

224
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,525
But we didn't talk when
you were at Yumenosaki.

225
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,025
Now you think you know
what makes sense for me?

226
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,858
Hold on. Did you shrink?
You look a lot shorter, Sakuma.

227
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:57,733
What? Are you mistaking
me for my brother Rei?

228
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,650
How could you possibly
believe I'm him? I'm not.

229
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:03,192
If so, I'm gonna
be extremely annoyed.

230
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,358
You're wrong if you thought

231
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,025
you were gonna get
a shot with just Yuu!

232
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,150
Awkward.

I'm counting on you, sir!

something interesting, Hokuto!

Not fair to keep all
the excitement to yourself.

No, it's totally fair.

Do me a favor and
be quiet for a second,

about something.

[WATARU gasps]
No way. Is that a safe I see?

00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,358
Looks like it to me.

I have to find
a way to open it up.

Let me do it! These kinds
of things are my specialty!

Oh! How very complex
and mysterious

with the countless gears
and nested boxes all over.

252

Whoever had the honor of making
this was quite the monomaniac.

Don't talk about my dad
like that, Wataru.

254

[gasps] Are you saying
you know who made this?

255

Yeah, my dad made it.

256
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,608
[WATARU] Naturally, I have
to ask where you found it?

257
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,192
[HOKUTO]
It was on campus.

258
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:33,317
I heard that he hid it
somewhere before he graduated.

259
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,067
So I asked him where
it was, then I dug it out.

260
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,442
[WATARU]
What?!

261
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,525
Why didn't you invite me
to help with the digging?

262
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,150
I don't know. I didn't
give it that much thought.

Bless your heart.

You're not very good at
using others, are you, dear?

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,900
It must be the way
you were raised.

00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:50,817
What are you saying?

267
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,025
That reminds me of something

268
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,650
I forgot to tell
you the other day.

269
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,525
[HOKUTO]
So tell me.

270
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,067
You're a thoroughbred
of the entertainment business.

271
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,358
You were born into perfection.

272
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:04,400
But that comes with some
rather harsh realities.

273
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,025
Despite that, you're a human.

274
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,358
So you're still
going to make mistakes.

275
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,983
But it's different for you.

276
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:13,775
You've set high expectations,
so you'll face more ridicule.

277
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,567
I wanted to help
you gain the strength

278
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,400
needed to endure that life.

279
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,900
Meaning what?

280
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,942
[WATARU] That's the reason
I had you come onstage with me--

281
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,817
onto that tortuous
hell of a stage.

282
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:28,192
[WATARU] I had so much
I wanted to teach you.

283
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,692
But our relationship could never

284
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,233
truly be defined as
teacher and student.

285
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:35,733
We were barely comfortable
enough to chat once in a while.

286
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,650
But just those few moments
brought so much joy,

287
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,608
so it wasn't entirely for you.

288
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,608
Now, having you taste tragedy

289
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,942
that people rarely get
a chance to experience--

290
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,442
that was for no one
else's benefit but yours.

291
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:48,608
I see.

292
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,192
Well, we're about
to go up against Eden,

293
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,775
our greatest opponent,

294
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,400
and, apparently, there's
a schemer among them now.

295
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,567
So I guess that experience
might come in handy.

And then,

315
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,192
just like that, the day
of the SS had snuck up on us.

316

What a great way
to open the show!

That was Eden!

We'll see you

[SUBARU grunts]
Know what's weird?

322
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,067
After they got
finished with their act,

323
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,900
Eden referred to the
SS as the Winter Live.

324
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,817
[MAO]
CosPro probably told them to.

325
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,608
Maybe so it would match with
Summer Live and Autumn Live.

326
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,150
Sounds like they're trying to
take ownership of the concert,

327
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,483
so they can incorporate
it into their events.

328
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,400
Wow. I think it's better as SS,

329
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:29,108
since that's what Yumenosaki's
been calling it for years.

330
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,942
[HOKUTO] Truth is,
Eden will probably win.

331
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,483
If they do, then CosPro
will officially take over

332
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,733
the biggest national idol event

333
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:39,025
even though it was established
by Yumenosaki Academy.

--[phone buzzes]
--[SUBARU] Mm?

335
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,525
Barry's messaging me.

336
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,025
He says he has something to tell
me, but it has to be in private.

Be careful.

We just barely got
through the mall concert,

340

without Izumi and Ritsu.

341

You don't have
to go talk to him.

342

All you'll be doing is
helping him out with his plan.

343
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,567
I agree. It sounds like a trap.

Believe me, I know it's not.

350
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:23,358
I've been in love with the
SS ever since I was a kid,

351
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,233
so I'm feeling the pressure.

352
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,858
I get kind of emotional
thinking about it,

353
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,525
since it was so
important to my dad.

354

[HIYORI chuckles]
There, there.

355
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,317
All right, you're suffocating
me. I don't like this.

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,858
Let me go, already.

357

In this cruel world, you should
be grateful for my kindness.

My goodness, you two
get along well, don't you?

00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:45,192
Oh? If you're feeling
a little jealous,

I want you to be there for Jun,

just like you were there
for me many years ago.

act like you don't remember

Okay, okay!
As the oldest one here,

I love all of you very much

[NAGISA] Hm? What's with

shower you with affection.

No thanks, I'll refrain.

373
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:15,817
What you don't understand is

374
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,858
I don't have the right
to accept human joy,

375
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:20,233
but you'll be the first
to know if that changes.

376
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,567
No right?

377
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,983
It's my bloodline.

378
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,317
I'm related to a magnate

379
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,775
who once ruled over
the entertainment business.

380
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,650
It's not publicized,
but I'm his direct descendant.

381
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,650
Are you talking about my father?

382
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,400
Yes, he wanted me to
call him Mr. Godfather,

383
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:35,983
or something like that,

384
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:39,400
and out of respect, that's the
way I've always referred to him.

385
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,983
But in my mind, he was much
more like a great-grandfather.

386
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,775
[IBARA] My parents
were probably deep in debt,

387
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,608
and they abandoned
me on the street one day

388
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,983
when I was just a baby.

389
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,233
Because of that,

390
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:55,192
I spent my hellish
childhood in an orphanage.

391
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,067
When the aforementioned
Mr. Godfather passed away,

392
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,025
they found his will,

393
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,067
and I received a part
of his inheritance,

394
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,900
which proved to be quite
beneficial later on.

395
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,858
[IBARA] What I'm saying is,
that I became an idol

396
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,942
simply because it's the
best way to successfully

397
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,858
utilize the company and the
connections that I inherited.

398

[NAGISA grunts]

399
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,108
[IBARA]
Which is another reason...

400
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,317
No matter what happens,

401
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,733
we absolutely cannot
fail this Winter Live!

402
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,025
If we win this,

403
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,317
it'll also solidify
Eden's position in CosPro!

404
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,692
I know, you're right.
We're with you.

405
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,067
So is that why you're taking

406
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,108
special precautions
against Trickstar?

407
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,567
Yes. They're not quite our
greatest enemies, of course,

408
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,525
but they should be
prepared for battle.

409
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,900
You know, in case we end up
having to deploy a weapon

410
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,108
with immense destructive force.

411
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,483
[sighs]
And, to be perfectly honest,

412
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,692
I'm praying that
we won't have to

413
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,733
resort to those
kinds of measures.

414
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,858
I would've liked
to talk with Subaru.

415
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,025
I would have asked
him to withdraw.

416
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,650
[IBARA] But alas,
no matter how we struggle,

417
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,775
we won't be able to
stop it from getting bloody.

418
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:05,525
[ANZU] Meanwhile, downtown,
the SS prelims were being held.

419
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:08,858
All the students were doing what
they could to help the staff.

420
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,317
They were getting
people fired up

421

by advertising
Trickstar's competition.

422
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,983
When visitors from
different parts of the country

423
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,442
would come in for the show,

424
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:17,775
they'd be sure to
let them know that

425
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:21,067
they were in Yumenosaki
Academy's hometown.

Hidaka's dad became

They made sure everything
ran as smoothly as possible.

429
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,108

also doing their best

Mom... Daikichi...

00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,858
Dad, are you
watching from Heaven?

471
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:29,567
I did it. I'm an idol!

Ah... What the...?

473
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,608
Maybe it's... um,

What? Criminal?

Removed from the idol industry?
