there're less than six months

I do see a little
inflammation back there.

15
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,733
Good news is that it's not
bad enough to see a specialist.

16
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:23,108
Just rest it for a while.

You don't have to be

This is an opportunity to add

00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,692
some new textures and
tones to your songs.

23

I wonder if he could
tell I've secretly

27
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:53,858

I finally got a ticket
to the DreFes!

Wow! Lucky!

31
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,900
[NAZUNA] It feels like this
school has completely

32
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,567
turned upside-down
in the past six months.

33
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,275
DreFes is more than
just a competition now.

34
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,483
Our grades are controlled by it.

35
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,567
If we don't wanna fail,

36
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,983
we have to attend
the competition

37
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,400
and vote for the
top-ranking units

38
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,900
if we want to ensure that
our grades get better.

39
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:18,233
This new DreFes system
forces the entire

40
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:22,483
student body to help the
strong become even stronger.

41

The new policy is
the reason our unit

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,525
Valkyrie fell in rank.

43
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,817
Which means there's a new unit

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,900
reigning over the
school in our place.

45
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:35,275
It's not that we're doing
anything differently.

We still strive to give
flawless performances

Putting any foreign

It's not like that.

It just looks that way
because of how screwed up

the DreFes system is now.

101
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,108
Since we don't perform
in the competitions,

our achievements are
no longer being archived.

We never lost a single time
before the corruption!

Valkyrie was,
and continues to be,

the best idol group
this school's ever seen!

I can discuss.

I'm too involved to be
comfortable talking about it.

112
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,942
We didn't anticipate those
with evil intentions

113
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:10,442
would take advantage of the
new structure like this.

00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,275
That's why we lost.

something to change it.

promise that I'd protect you.

[SHU] We were kids then;
it doesn't count.

But if it makes you feel better,
picking me up off the floor

121
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,275
and letting me vent
was a big help.

to my life span.

one, aren't you?

not gonna give those bullies

me back down and cry.

Valkyrie deserves
your absolute best!

160
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,400
We are going to win this,
no matter what it takes!

161
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,275
Those fools don't
know our power!

162
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,900
We'll show them!

163
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:09,317
[NAZUNA] The pride of
Yumenosaki Academy's Emperor

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,192
was on the line.

165
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:14,567
And it was something Teach
couldn't stop obsessing over.

166
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,233
He eventually lost himself.

167
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,650
We all did.

168
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,692
Did we really need
to win that badly?

169
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,775
[MIKA yelps]

170
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,692
[NAZUNA] Was it worth
throwing away our humanity?

171
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,192
And becoming another
cog in the machine?

172
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,108
[NAZUNA]
But even if we won,

173
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,983
would it be of any real
significance to us?

174
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,900
We did it all to
fuel Teach's ego.

175
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,858
What about the things I wanted?

176
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,525
What about Mikachin?

177
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,067
[NAZUNA] It was finally here.
The day of DreFes.

178
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,817
[HOKUTO]
O! What beauty is this?

179
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,400
She sleeps! But I shall
wake her with a kiss!

180
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,192
[NAZUNA] Is the act before
ours already finished?

181
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,275
I heard that one of the
Five Eccentrics was planning

182
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,983
to do some kind of
strange, must-see

183
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,442
"theatrical" performance.

184
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,567
I better hurry.

185
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,108
Teach will freak out
on me if I'm late!

186
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,317
I told you it would
be amazing, didn't I?

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,567
Now do you understand why

188
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,275
I wanted you to see it
as soon as possible? Hm?

189
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,400
[HAJIME]
Mm...

190
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:21,983
Are you okay, Hajime?

191
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,692
Oh, yeah. And yes,
it was amazing.

192
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,775
I loved it. Especially
the princess.

193
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,150
Yeah, me, too!

194
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,275
I couldn't believe the
princess was actually human.

195
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,442
She seemed like she
was from another world.

196
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,025
Like a real-life goddess!

197
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:37,233
Agreed. But the princess
was played by a man, right?

198
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,400
Almost forgot to ask.

199
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:39,525
How were you able to get these

200
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:42,775
Yumenosaki Academy
uniforms for us?

201
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,483
[yelps]

202
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,067
I had a friend of a friend of
a friend make them for us

203
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,108
so they look real
but they're not!

204
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,733
But we get into DreFes
free by wearing them!

205
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,442
I dunno, maybe we should
just pay for the tickets.

206
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,317
Excuse us!

207
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,233
Uh! What are you doing?
We were the ones in the way!

208
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:04,233
He's right, we're sorry.

209
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,858
That girl had such
a pretty face,

210
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,608
don't you think so?
I kinda have butterflies.

211
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:15,067
Me, too.

212
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,983
But, why was she wearing
a boy's uniform?

213
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,775
Maybe she likes to dress up?

214
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,233
Or maybe she wants
to be an actor

215
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,983
and play opposite genders
like the princess

216
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,608
in the show we just saw.

217
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,067
This is cooler than I
thought it would be!

218
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,608
There are so many different
kinds of people at this school!

219
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,358
I'm so excited!

220
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,942
I can't wait to study
for entrance exams!

221
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,192
[HAJIME]
I know what you mean!

222
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,067
After seeing how talented
everyone is here,

223
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,858
I hope I get into
this school, too!

224
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:42,900
And when you and I become idols,
we're gonna make a ton of money!

225
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,025
You won't have
to be poor anymore!

226
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah.

227
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,983
I appreciate you always
looking out for me, Tomoya.

228
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,108
You're a good friend.
It means a lot.

229
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,525
It's because I don't
want to do it by myself.

230
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:56,400
So there's no
reason to thank me.

231
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:59,025
I'm more excited knowing
you're going to be there.

232
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,817
I wish we could start
today! I can't wait!

233
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,108
It's gonna be so much fun!

234
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,692
[KURO] Valkyrie's first
DreFes performance.

235
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,067
Don't worry.

236
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,858
I'm going to be watching
you very carefully, Itsuki.

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,275
[NAZUNA]
What's with this atmosphere?

238
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,067
Something's wrong.

239
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,358
I think it's that the audience

240
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:38,858
didn't come here
to support Valkyrie.

241
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,358
In fact, there are tons
of fans of our opponents

242
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,942
hoping to watch us fail.

243
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,067
There are people in the audience
who think of us as the enemy.

244
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,317
They must see us as
some kind of obstacle.

245
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,942
That's definitely not something
any of us were anticipating.

246
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,900
Since we're not used to DreFes,

247
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,567
we'll be doing our
signature performance

248
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,650
to avoid nerves.

249
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,900
Funny. For those who
aren't huge fans of ours,

250
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,317
this act is probably
painful to watch.

251
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,900
I can feel their
impatient stares on me,

252
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:12,067
screaming to hurry
up and finish!

253
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,900
And at this rate...

254

[NAZUNA]
Is this a new light cue?

257
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:38,067
I'm pretty sure this
wasn't supposed to happen.

258
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,650
Wait, the sound is off.

259
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,942
Please, no. Is the
equipment broken?

260
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,233
[NAZUNA]
It hasn't been that long.

261
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,983
We can still make the audience
think it's part of the act.

262
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,317
They have to believe
that the music

263
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,608
will still play at any
minute. I have an idea.

264
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,233
But I'll have to sing.

265
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:01,525
It's the only way.
I'm so scared.

266
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:05,067
What if it just makes
Teach mad again?

part of the performance?

You, too, huh?

274
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,525
[NAZUNA]
You wanted to sing.

275
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,025
You must have been
practicing, like me.

276
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,233
We've been told
that we're useless.

277
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:09,192
That we can never
get anything right.

278
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,317
And still, we push. We dream.

279
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:18,192
[NAZUNA] I don't want
that dream to end here!

[SHU] Kagehira. Nito.
What are you doing?

281
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,608
[SHU]
I see now.

282
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:51,275
[SHU] This is what
you've been waiting for.

283
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,775
[KEITO] I don't claim to have
the best judge of character.

284
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,733
But no one standing
on that stage

285
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,775
got there without
working hard for it.

286
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,567
I underestimated you, Kagehira.

287
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,317
I'm embarrassed by
my blinding ignorance.

288

[SHU]
What is happening?

289
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,692
Have I become
the disposable one?

290
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:48,983
I was protecting
them from failure,

291
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:52,025
because to me, that was love.

292
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,692
But I realized too late,

293
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,733
that I was only
holding them back.

294
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,817
The strings were so tight,
that struggling to break free

295
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,192
would cause them to become
tangled and tied down.

296
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,275
That was beautiful. What was it?

297
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,817
I have no idea.

298
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,775
I didn't recognize the main
singer, but he's amazing.

299
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:10,108
It's like he knew my heart

300
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:14,983
and was singing right to it.
Tomoya, I want this.

[TOMOYA] I know, so do I.

using our real voices.

315
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,150
[NAZUNA] Teach didn't leave
his house after that.

316
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,775
[SHU]
Tenshouin. Tenshouin. Tenshouin.

317
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,817
[NAZUNA] After they
completely defeated Valkyrie

318
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,400
a final time,
fine continued to show

319
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,025
their true colors and crushed
their opposition one by one.

320
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,192
The "Five Eccentrics"
lost members

321
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,067
and became the
"Three Eccentrics."

322
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,108
fine became the rulers
of Yumenosaki Academy

323
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,150
in name and in reality.

324
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,525
And I became a
third-year student.

325
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,192
[NAZUNA]
Valkyrie never recovered,

326
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,900
and they declared
a permanent hiatus.

327
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:46,275
Since I was basically just
a doll that Teach controlled,

328
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,775
I didn't think I had any real
talent to join another unit.

329
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:50,692
Which is why...

330
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,025
[TOMOYA]
Leave me alone! Stop it!

331
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:55,900
I didn't do anything!
Why are you chasing me?

332
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,317
Are you sure you don't
know the reason?

333
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,817
Try harder.

334
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:04,567
[panting]

335
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,608
[gasps]

336
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:07,775
[WATARU]
Think about it a little more

337
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,608
before you start asking others!

338
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:13,233
You should be excited!
I'm so amazing!

339
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,692
[NAZUNA] I think he's one
of the Five Eccentrics.

340
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,858
Oh, wait, I mean
the Three Eccentrics.

341
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,483
Get away from me! Gross!

342
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,442
I thought you were a
goddess, but you're not!

343
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,983
Why would you want
to trick people?

344
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,275
Gah, only perverts
do that stuff!

345
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:29,192
[sighs] You look so adorable
when you're scared!

346
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,233
Getting to see that face
was the best reward!

347
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,608
But...! You're wrong,
I didn't trick you.

348
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,483
I cast a spell on you!

349
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,650
Now it's a magic show time!

350
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,275
[laughs] I'm amazing!

351
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,358
[TOMOYA, NAZUNA]
Uh...

352
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,608
Well, what do you think?

353
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,775
Oh, wow. What's this? My, oh my!

354
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,733
How very unusual.

355
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,233
Take a look at this, Tomoya.

356
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:55,067
It seems the doll is walking
around on his own two legs.

357
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,275
Oh. I see you're doing
a little marketing

358
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:02,108
for the broadcast committee?
These are some nice posters.

359
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,567
Are you hoping that by joining

360
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,692
the broadcast committee,
you might avoid

361
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:08,442
suffering another
humiliating incident

362
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,150
with the sound equipment?

363
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,400
I haven't forgotten
how well you recovered

364
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,275
from that technical error
during the match

365
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,775
between Valkyrie and fine.

366
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,358
But I have to wonder.

367
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,275
Was it truly an accident that
the accompaniment stopped?

368
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:22,650
[gasps]

369
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,733
[WATARU]
Eichi used to fight dirty.

370
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:27,567
Back then, he would
stop at nothing to win.

371
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,692
Oh, well, I suppose it's too
late to uncover the truth.

372
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:32,817
More importantly,

373
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,150
we have an exciting
future to discuss!

374
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,900
[WATARU]
After all, I can't have Valkyrie

375
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,483
crushed for good
after just one loss.

376
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:43,567
Shu's a friend.

377
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,400
He's the kind of person
I never expected

378
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,442
to encounter in this world,
someone I can say is my equal.

379
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,817
Wait. Teach has a friend?

380
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,067
Whoa! You talk!

381
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,317
Shu is such a brilliant,
unpredictable artist

382
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,692
that he surprises
even me sometimes.

383
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,400
If we allow him to fade away,

384
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,275
this could be a major loss
for the entire world.

385
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,525
That's why... I need
your help, little bunny.

386
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,192
Can I count on you?

387
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,192
Um, me?

388
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,567
[WATARU]
That's what I said.

389
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,483
[TOMOYA yelps]

390
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,525
What was that for?

391
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,817
I will entrust this one to you.

392
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,567
Since he's made it quite clear
he doesn't like me much.

393
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,108
Please do what you can
to train these kids.

394
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,900
These are the performers
who were turned away

395
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,775
from all the other units
and have nowhere to go,

396
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:24,983
nowhere they can belong.

397
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,942
[gasps]

398
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,442
[WATARU]
Smile!

399
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,608
Unless, of course, you're a
doll without that function.

400
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:33,442
But if not, then give your
wounds permission to heal.

401
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,942
Cheer up, and grin.

402
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,400
Even if you're only
wearing it as a mask,

403
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:41,233
it has the power to make others
smile when they see you.

404
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:43,192
Shu told me all
about your smile.

405
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,192
Said it was the most charming
in the whole world,

406
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,483
and that he always loved
seeing it on you.

407
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,817
Huh?

408
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:54,150
Ah!

409
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:00,275
Teach likes when I smile.

410
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,900
So uh, I was just wondering
have we met before?

411
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,358
It's been driving me
crazy this whole time.

412
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,358
[HAJIME]
Um, hi. Nice to see you again.

413
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,608
Do you remember us?

414
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:15,733
We met last fall after
seeing Sleeping Beauty

415
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,275
when we literally
bumped into each other

416
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,942
next to the auditorium.

417
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,608
[BOTH gasp]

418
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:23,192
We took the entrance
exam and got into

419
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:26,150
Yumenosaki Academy for
the spring semester!

420
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,108
[NAZUNA]
I remember now.

421
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:33,233
In order to keep that from
happening in my life again,

422
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:36,067
I need to protect the
happiness of my friends,

423
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,400
and guard their smiles.

424
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,233
[HAJIME]
What's the matter, Big Bro?

425
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:42,608
You went quiet. Are you okay?

426
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,567
[MITSURU]
He might still be tired!

427
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,983
One, two, three, four, five...

428
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,858
[SUBARU] I think it's time
for us to go. See ya!

429
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,942
Hey, Subaru! Be careful
with Tenshouin Eichi.

430
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:58,233
Keep your guard up,
no matter what.

431
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,025
Okay...

432
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,567
[SUBARU]
I wonder what he meant by that.

433
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,192
You heard what Nito
said earlier, right?

434
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:09,525
[sighs]

435
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,442
[BOTH gasp]
