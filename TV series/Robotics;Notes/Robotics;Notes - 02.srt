1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,916
Whoa! How much?!

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,208
Man, those don't come cheap.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,375
Even the less expensive models.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,958
It'd cost a lot
less just to get the parts

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,833
and assemble it myself,
but with two weeks,

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,000
we don't have time for that.

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:29,916
Even with an advance on

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,083
my allowance,
I can't afford these!

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,875
Well, then, I guess
that only leaves one option.

10
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,916
Yeah? What's that?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,083
Forget about
entering ROBO-ONE altogether.

12
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,291
You jerk!

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,541
Come on!

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,666
Not while I'm eating!

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,916
How can you even think of

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,583
admitting defeat so quickly?!

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,333
We hafta fight
for all we're worth!

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,375
What's the point?

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,750
The tournament's
just two weeks away!

20
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,875
And besides, I don't see how

21
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,166
we're gonna take
first place when

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,250
we don't even have
a robot to enter.

23
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,375
That's it!

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,791
What is?

25
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,958
We do have a hobby
robot to work with!

26
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,666
Where?

27
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,958
In the club room!

28
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,041
The Robot Research
Club's "Honorary Chief"!

29
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,208
The Tanegashi Machine!

30
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,458
Come on! Work!

31
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,875
That thing's what,
eight years old now?

32
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,291
Of course it isn't gonna work.

33
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,708
Genki's bravery gave
GUNVARREL strength, remember?

34
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,416
You can do it! I know you can!

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,750
Work, GUNVARREL!

36
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,708
The most likely problem
is that the battery's dead.

37
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
And we don't have a charger.

38
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,625
So buy a new one, right?

39
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,750
They probably cost a lot.

40
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,250
You sure you wanna
dismantle it like that?

41
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,833
It's fine, I'm just
taking out the screws.

42
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,500
Hey, would you do me a favor and

43
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,333
go find a servo
test board for me

44
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,458
in the storeroom next door?

45
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,416
No problem.

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,625
Right after you
beat me at KILL-BALLAD.

47
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,500
Come on, Kai.
I'm not asking much.

48
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,875
Go see the storeroom
and then tell me

49
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,958
if you're not asking much.

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,083
Lazy!

51
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,791
Okay, I'll take care
of finding a test board.

52
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,291
And all you have to
do is be the operator.

53
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,791
The operator, huh?

54
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,208
The one who's in charge of
Tanegashi Machine's controls.

55
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,416
I just figure since you're
always playing KILL-BALLAD,

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,708
you've gotta be
way more used to

57
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,000
that kinda thing than me.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,916
I'd rather play KB.

59
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,583
What if I rig up
a cannon for it?

60
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,791
That'd be cool.
Would you operate it then?

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,708
Why would you want
to add a cannon?

62
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,083
Just for decoration.

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,416
A good appearance is vital

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,583
for maintaining
positive club morale!

65
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,500
I'd love to give it
super-special attacks

66
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,958
and the ability to transform!

67
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,125
Hey, Aki.

68
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,375
What's up?

69
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,416
What's more important?

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
The appearance or the results?

71
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,041
The results.

72
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,125
Yes. Good girl.

73
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,583
Okaaay! I get it already!

74
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,541
I think we can set
all the little stuff aside,

75
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,583
at least for the moment.

76
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,000
The main issue
is the power supply,

77
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,375
and we can't just switch
to a different power source.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,708
What're you gonna do?

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,291
That's simple!

80
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,166
I'm going to negotiate!

81
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,333
Hi! Is anybody home?!

82
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,083
Doc!

83
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:10,833
Hey!

84
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,208
The music! It's really loud!

85
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,208
Can you turn down the music?!

86
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,208
It's bad enough that
you're old and deaf!

87
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,500
Do you have to--

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
Hey there, Doc.
How're you doing?

89
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,166
I already gave you some parts
the other day, little girlie.

90
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,291
I got nothin' else to
sell ya. What about you, boy?

91
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
Too good to say hello?

92
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,208
Oh. It's good to see you again.

93
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,250
Anyway, we didn't
come down here today

94
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,833
to get parts for GunBuild-1.
We're here about this.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,250
Oh? ROBO-ONE, again, huh?

96
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,666
I can tell ya right now,
there's no way

97
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,750
to get a hold of
somethin' this old anymore.

98
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,041
Oh, really?

99
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,083
You gotta go with a
different manufacturer.

100
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,708
How's an Ogawada
S-Plug sound to ya?

101
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,541
Well, uh, how much are those?

102
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,291
A little over eight thousand.

103
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,000
No deal! That's way too much!

104
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,958
That's knocking off
shipping for you!

105
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,208
You and your damn club.

106
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,541
Hey, there's no reason
to get nasty about it!

107
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,125
All right, little girlie.

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
Are there any
other parts you need?

109
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,875
I'll think
about lowering the price

110
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,791
<i>if</i> you make a big purchase.

111
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,250
Really, you will?!

112
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,791
In that case,
I'd like a three hundred

113
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,250
and sixty-degree camera!

114
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,958
You idiot. A camera
isn't even a good decoration.

115
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,375
"I'll be frank, here.
I don't like it one bit."

116
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:34,541
Right. For ROBO-ONE,
you'll want a gyro.

117
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,000
Including the other thing,

118
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,666
I can do twelve thousand.

119
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,416
Or maybe you could
make it ten, instead?

120
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,166
This is pointless. Deal's off.

121
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,333
Please, I don't have any money!

122
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,541
I'm just a poor
little high school student!

123
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,291
That's it! How 'bout
a student discount?!

124
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,791
Forget about it!

125
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,666
I got a livin'
to make here, ya know!

126
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,291
You don't like it,
you can leave!

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,125
Well, do you have a plan B?

128
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,708
He made it pretty
clear you won't be getting

129
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,208
any parts from him unless
you can come up with the money.

130
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,666
What about you?

131
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,666
Maybe you can get an
advance on your allowance.

132
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,250
No problem, just beat me at KB.

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,583
You can be a real
pain sometimes, you know?

134
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,208
Preparing for ROBO-ONE?

135
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,375
Everyone at school's
been talking about it.

136
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,541
About how slim
your chances are.

137
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,708
Let 'em talk!
It's worth the risk.

138
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,083
If we do win, we get
a ton of money for the club!

139
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,458
That's sweet, but it's
never going to happen.

140
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,375
The ROBO-ONE
tournament is prestigious.

141
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,500
Third-rate amateurs entering

142
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,708
at the last
minute is, well, rude.

143
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,833
This is the stuff
that legends are made of!

144
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,500
It all began when I sought
the help of Subaru Hidaka,

145
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,416
who took third place at
ROBO-ONE in junior high--

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
I won't join your club.

147
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,041
Rejected once again!

148
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,833
Why are you
doing this, Yashio?

149
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,083
You know her club is
nothing but a waste of time.

150
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,125
Yeah, I guess you're
right but the club room

151
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,458
is the perfect environment
for playing KILL-BALLAD, so--

152
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,250
What?!
That's why you're a member?

153
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,833
Interesting.
I see that your reputation

154
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,666
as a pair of weirdos
is well deserved, indeed.

155
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,541
Goodbye.

156
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,541
Hold on. You're leaving?

157
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,333
What did you
come here for, anyway?

158
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,666
No reason. I was
just passing by, that's all.

159
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,583
I hope you enjoy the final
days of the Robot Research Club.

160
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,666
You jerk!

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,791
You can't just
say that and drive off!

162
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,291
Well, jerk or not, he kinda
does have a point, you know?

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,541
I mean, spin it
however you want,

164
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,166
but there's
no way we're gonna win.

165
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,250
How can you say that?

166
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,125
What'll happen to GunBuild-1?

167
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,250
There's no reason you can't
keep working on it on your own.

168
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,625
That's true, I can,
but I wanted it

169
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,291
to be something
the club did, you know?

170
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,416
After all, it was my
sister who founded this club

171
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,833
and began work on GunBuild-1
in the first place.

172
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,041
It should be the
club that finishes it.

173
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,666
We'll fight! We just have to!

174
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,125
Robots exist because
of dreams, hopes, and passion!

175
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,291
Ah, man. What's her deal?

176
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,250
And she calls me
a pain in the neck.

177
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,166
You will look out
for Aki for me, won't you?

178
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,958
Thanks for coming in.

179
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,083
Oh, it's just you again.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,708
I'd like a Passion Fruit Bun.

181
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,166
You got it.

182
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,541
All in one go.

183
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,583
I can do this!

184
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,208
Mercy!

185
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,166
The lukewarm dough
conceals a sickly sweet

186
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,916
and sour filling that
explodes after one bite

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,166
and violently
assaults the mouth.

188
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,583
Passion fruit is
delicious on its own,

189
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,083
but preparing it like this.

190
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,916
It's an invention of the devil,

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,125
from the very pits of hell!

192
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,916
There!

193
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,833
All right, then.

194
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,291
We have reached
a Passion Accord agreement,

195
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,666
but can't you at
least pretend like

196
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,125
you enjoy them
a little bit?

197
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,458
No way.

198
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,875
Just keeping 'em
down is hard enough.

199
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, whatever.

200
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,333
The Accord
still stands, anyway.

201
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,791
You can ask me one
thing you want to know.

202
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,291
I wanna know more about Doc.

203
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,750
Doc? The crotchety
old robot man?

204
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,333
Yeah, I was wondering
if he has any weaknesses.

205
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,291
Something that'll make him lower
his prices, no questions asked.

206
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,583
You're gonna
blackmail the geezer

207
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,625
into giving you
a discount? That's hilarious!

208
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,166
Sure, no problem,
I'll see what I can find.

209
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,375
I appreciate it.
Well, I'll see ya.

210
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,875
I've noticed the favors you ask

211
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,791
always have
something to do with Aki.

212
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm curious. What are you
to that girl anyway?

213
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,041
Dunno. A replacement for

214
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,875
her big sister, Misa, maybe?
Now that she's not around.

215
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,375
He's a good kid.
Aki's lucky to have him.

216
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,083
So's Misa, for that matter.

217
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,666
Daitoku?

218
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,458
In the class
next door. You know,

219
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,833
that quiet girl
who's in the Karate club.

220
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,125
Wait, I'm confused.
Isn't Doc's family name Fujita?

221
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,583
She may have a different name,

222
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,875
but apparently
she's Doc's granddaughter.

223
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,208
Granddaughter, huh?

224
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,666
If she'll ask him for us,
maybe we'll get lucky!

225
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,833
Normal people sit
down to eat, you know.

226
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay! You said she's
in Class 1, right?

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,208
Thanks for the information.
It should help.

228
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,916
Stop by if you need anything.

229
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,708
I have plenty of passion fruit
buns just waiting to be eaten.

230
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,500
Oh, one more thing.

231
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,333
I know. I won't
tell Aki about it.

232
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,541
All right. My work
here is done.

233
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,041
Hey, Daitoku!

234
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,791
Huh? My grandfather?

235
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,541
I'm sorry to ask
for something like this,

236
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,416
but I don't know
what else to do.

237
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,750
Our club will get shut down

238
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,291
unless I can get all
the parts we need from Doc!

239
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,083
Pretty please!

240
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,583
I'm sorry, but I can't.

241
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,416
Huh?

242
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,250
It's just that, well I mean,

243
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,000
I haven't even
seen Grandpa Fujita

244
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,166
in years so, you know.
It would be weird.

245
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,291
Oh, really? But--

246
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,541
I'm sorry. Oh,
forget about it.

247
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,750
I was just hoping
for a teensy little discount,

248
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,291
but it's no big deal.

249
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,333
I can't help.

250
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Hey, you know,
I've been trying to come up

251
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,166
with some special attack
techniques for the club robot.

252
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,541
Do you know any
good karate moves?

253
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,416
Something you use
to level an opponent.

254
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,250
I dunno, maybe a move that
you're especially good at doing?

255
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,750
A move I'm good at doing?

256
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,791
Yeah!

257
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,375
There are none. Sorry.

258
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,833
What? So not a single one, huh?

259
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,375
Well, what about a kata? You
must be good at one of those.

260
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,875
Let me see. I'm okay at the
"Suparinpei" kata, I guess.

261
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,666
Whoa! That sounds awesome!

262
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,375
How does it go?
Will you tell me?

263
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,750
Oh, but it's
probably more involved

264
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,041
than what you're looking for,

265
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,458
and I'm not really
all that good at it, anyway.

266
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,000
If all you want
is to knock someone down,

267
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,333
maybe a front kick?

268
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,208
A front kick?
How does it work?

269
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,708
Oh, well, you go like this.

270
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:44,833
Oh! You raise your leg up
like this, and then you just-

271
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,958
Hey, are you okay?

272
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,708
Ow ow ow ow ow.
That's perfect!

273
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,666
A robot can totally
do that! Here, watch me.

274
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,875
Like this, and this!

275
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,000
That's good, um,
but I should tell you.

276
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,416
Your panties are showing!

277
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,666
Huh?

278
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,666
Here you go.

279
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,000
One battery,
complete with charger.

280
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,875
Oooh! Sooooo shiny!

281
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,333
Hope yer happy!
I rushed to get 'em for ya,

282
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,708
then I don't hear
anything for a whole week!

283
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,000
That isn't
my fault. I was busy.

284
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,208
My mom spent the whole
week lecturing me.

285
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,708
The cash?

286
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
Hey. Hey, let go already!

287
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,791
Come on! You can knock
off a little bit, can't you?

288
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,208
You little thief.

289
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,291
Take your goods.

290
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,500
You money-grubbing geezer!

291
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,791
Like I said before,
I got a living to make.

292
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,333
I also ordered you a gyro

293
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,708
and some other parts
I thought you'd need.

294
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,083
If you're really
serious about winning,

295
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,375
you should take all of it.

296
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,166
Oh-ho!

297
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,458
That'll be 15,000 total.

298
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,375
Look, I can't pay you,
but I'll do whatever you want!

299
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,500
That does exclude anything
painful or perverted, though.

300
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,750
Like anyone would bother
with an infant like you.

301
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,833
What are those,
raisins on your chest?

302
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,583
Watch it, old man!
I could sue you for that!

303
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,500
We'll pay you when we get
the ROBO-ONE prize money.

304
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,208
Should be plenty
for those parts.

305
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,500
Does that work for you?

306
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,250
Wow, Kai. I didn't
think you knew how to be cool.

307
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,750
So, what do you say, Doc?
Do we have a deal?

308
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,750
You kids have
no respect these days.

309
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,750
Even so. You guys rock.

310
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,416
Aki started working
like crazy after that.

311
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,666
Sometimes she'd do
research on her own,

312
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,583
other times
she'd ask Doc for help.

313
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,833
She spent every second
assembling Tanegashi Machine,

314
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,125
barely even sleeping.

315
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,750
She worked so hard
I started to worry.

316
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,791
'Kay, I'm here.

317
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,958
You're late.

318
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,333
You dragged me
out of a warm bed

319
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:16,333
on a Sunday morning to
help you. I'd say I'm early.

320
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,791
Is that the
finished product, then?

321
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:27,375
Yep! Behold! The rebirth
of Tanegashi Machine!

322
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,583
I call it
Tanegashi Machine Advance!

323
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,500
Looks like you
found all the screws.

324
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,625
That's the first thing
you say? Yes, don't worry.

325
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,666
I got Doc to order the
necessary replacements for me.

326
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,708
Ah, so some really
did go missing, huh?

327
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,250
Look, all that matters
now is that it's finished.

328
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,625
So, are you ready? It's time
to test the competitor.

329
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
Now that is pretty cool.

330
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,958
Isn't it? I made it so
that when it's turned on,

331
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,791
all its servo-motors
reset to their home position.

332
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,750
Wow.

333
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,083
Okay! It's time to show off

334
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,750
what it's really
capable of! There!

335
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,625
Well, no, that's not it.
Let's see. Oh, urgh-

336
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,375
What's the problem?

337
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,291
Whoa. That's a lot
of switches.

338
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,375
I didn't know
it was so complicated.

339
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,541
Can you do this?

340
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,416
I hear it was too complicated
for most people back then, too.

341
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,041
In fact, my sister
was the only one

342
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
who ever
managed to master it.

343
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,500
But once she had, she beat
one opponent after another!

344
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,000
It was nearly
impossible back then,

345
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,916
and now you're gonna try to
get it down in just one week?

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,250
Well, yeah.

347
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,000
"I can see the enemy waiting.
It's as clear as day!"

348
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,708
There's no way.

349
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,333
Why don't you help
me instead of giving up

350
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,166
like a stupid, stupid coward!

351
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,583
Man down.

352
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,083
There! That's perfect.
Now watch this!

353
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,208
Whoa.

354
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,333
Cool, huh? It's called

355
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,166
Killer Technique:
Tanegashi Accel Impact!

356
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,375
You ripped that off.

357
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:13,958
It got brakes?

358
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,333
Sure doesn't.
Go after it, Kai!

359
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,750
Huh?!

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,125
Aw, man. No use.

361
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,750
Maybe it's time
to give in and call it a day.

362
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,875
Hey. I really think
you should be the one

363
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,583
to operate it
at the tournament.

364
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,583
Won't make any
difference who operates it.

365
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,458
The thing's
way too complicated.

366
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,166
But you've got quick fingers.

367
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,125
You're about
as fast as my sister.

368
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,083
Just because I'm good
at KILL-BALLAD, doesn't--

369
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,583
Wake up, Aki.

370
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,500
Oh, whoops. Sorry.

371
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,291
You feeling okay?

372
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,125
Yeah, I'm fine. Hey.

373
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,291
You aren't fine though,
are you?

374
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,958
Sorry. It's happening.

375
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,541
What should we do?
Wanna leave?

376
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,875
No. Here is okay.

377
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,750
The "Elephant-Mouse Syndrome."

378
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,708
It's like pressing
fast-forward.

379
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,791
Whenever Aki has an attack,
she experiences

380
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,875
five minutes worth of
time in just one second.

381
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,166
It first started
happening after the accident.

382
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,916
Nine years ago.

383
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,375
Kai. Kai.

384
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,375
Hey!

385
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,750
Is it over?

386
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
Yeah.

387
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,625
I'll call your mom
and let her know.

388
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,333
This happens
when you're exhausted.

389
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,708
You need to learn not to push
yourself so hard... Got it?

390
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,458
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,833
You just had an attack,
you don't get to be defensive.

392
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,750
So, Kai. What'd ya say?

393
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,041
Will you please
take over as the operator?

394
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,250
Without me having
to beat you at KB?

395
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,208
Man, you don't play fair.

396
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,583
Fine. I'll do it.

397
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,375
Huh? Really?!

398
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,833
Yeah, really. But only if
you'll change the controller

399
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,708
to be more like KILL-BALLAD.

400
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,583
Is that possible?
I don't see how.

401
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,291
I think we can do
it. I know somebody

402
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,916
who might be able to help.

403
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,500
FRAUKOUJIRO?

404
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,125
He's the creator
of KILL-BALLAD, remember?

405
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,666
Which means he
should have access to

406
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,708
all of the game's
programming code.

407
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,750
There's no harm in asking him
about it, don't you think?

408
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,958
No, none at all!

409
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,583
All right!
Now I'm really fired up!

410
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,083
Whoa. Take it easy.
You're still exhausted.

411
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,791
I'm fine!
We have no time to waste!

412
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,750
Contact him immediately!

413
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,541
Okay, okay.

414
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,625
Aki and Kai head
to Tokyo to compete

415
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,458
in the ROBO-ONE tournament.

416
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,333
Their destination
is a large arena

417
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,750
in the metropolis of Odaiba,

418
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,041
filled with fierce competitors
from around the country.

419
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,625
Bearing the legacy of
Misaki, a former champion,

420
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,125
the two enter
the ring to represent

421
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,875
Chuo Tanegashima High School.

422
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,208
At stake is their right to
continue the GunBuild-1 Project,

423
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,750
but when the Pleiades shine,

424
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,541
something inside Kai
will be set off!

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,666
Episode 3!

426
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,500
Let's hit it off, everybody!

427
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,625
Later days!
