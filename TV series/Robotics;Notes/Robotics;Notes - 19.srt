1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,250
What?

2
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:28,833
Stop it!

3
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,708
Kai!

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,500
Fool! What are you doing?

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,791
Aki! Find her!

6
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,416
Senomiya must be stopped!

7
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,125
Or else the Kimijima
Reports will come true.

8
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,708
It's Kagome.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,541
Wait, Misa!

10
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,416
The center door is an
entrance only. When leaving,

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,375
please use the exit
located on the opposite side.

12
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,583
Oh, no! What is she?

13
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,375
How could you? Why, Sis?

14
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,458
Activate Guild Build 2!
"I have control!"

15
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,541
Please, Sis, why
are you doing this?

16
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,458
Misa!

17
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,000
No, don't! Please
stop! Stop this!

18
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,083
Don't, Misaaa!

19
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,583
Aki!

20
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,708
Oh, no! You okay?

21
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,166
Aki! Are you
having another atta-

22
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,166
She's gone.

23
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,083
My sister. She disappeared.

24
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,375
Oh, Aki.

25
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,916
Breaking news: a new
solar storm has begun.

26
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,166
Its strength is unprecedented.
The storm, which broke at

27
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,125
about 2:50p.m. has caused
electromagnetic interference.

28
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,791
As you see, the storm has
had a worldwide impact already.

29
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,541
It appears large-scale
explosions of unknown cause

30
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,416
have occurred at the expo arena
which has been mostly destroyed.

31
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,458
That bench. Let's sit
you down over there.

32
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,416
That's new. What the?

33
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:10,000
The Grand Obelisk. It was in
the final episode of GUNVARREL.

34
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,958
The orbital elevator.

35
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,458
No way. You're not telling
me that thing is actually real!

36
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,500
Kaito! Aki! There you
are! Are you two okay?

37
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey. Would you mind
watching Aki for a minute?

38
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,333
Sure.

39
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,791
Thank you. I'll
be back soon, Aki.

40
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,375
Both the Haneda
and Narita airports

41
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,625
are currently shut down,
as all air transport

42
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,708
remains in a
state of paralysis.

43
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,541
Yes?

44
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,375
Come in.

45
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,458
♪ Kagome, Kagome. ♪

46
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,625
♪ The bird's in the cage ♪

47
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,583
♪ When, oh when,
will it ever come out? ♪

48
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,750
♪ In the night of the dawn ♪

49
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,083
♪ The crane and
tortoise slipped ♪

50
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,875
What the hell is this?

51
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,833
They're fake. Someone's
spreading fake images.

52
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,625
IRUO says this has
all been destroyed,

53
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,375
but that's clearly not true.

54
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,250
The truth behind the
magic, known as Noah's Ark.

55
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:44,000
An EM wave irradiation device.
It produces AR-like illusions

56
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,083
visible to the naked eye.

57
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,791
What's the matter?
Have you been injured?

58
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,125
The Anemone Mass Fainting
Incident was actually

59
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,333
an experiment meant to
test this on human subjects.

60
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,291
Huh?

61
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,000
What does this mean?

62
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,500
These past few hours, the
whole world has been plunged

63
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,833
into chaos. What do
you think is causing it?

64
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, the solar storm.

65
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,833
No, that's not the cause.
There is no solar storm.

66
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,166
Huh?

67
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,416
A solar storm has
supposedly caused blackouts in

68
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,166
cities everywhere and brought
traffic to a standstill.

69
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,166
It's also destroyed Odaiba,

70
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,583
but from where is all this
information originating?

71
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,416
Where did you first hear it?

72
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,833
It's propaganda. That's
what caused this chaos.

73
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,000
A world panic over something
that isn't even true.

74
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,041
It's all fiction.

75
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,958
That's crazy. Why
would somebody want...?

76
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,125
For Project Atom.

77
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,583
Our first task is to load the
Black Hole Bomb acquired from

78
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,583
SERN into the fully
prepped rocket in the VAB.

79
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,041
We can then move on to the
ultimate goal of this project.

80
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,250
Launching the bomb into
space and detonating it,

81
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,000
artificially
producing a substorm

82
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,958
in the Earth's magnetosphere.

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,250
To this end, we must quickly
secure Points Alpha and Beta

84
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,916
and launch the rocket
before the government

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and police organizations, which
are now in a state of chaos,

86
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,458
precisely as intended,
can take action against us.

87
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,708
If a substorm did indeed occur,
it would wipe out five billion

88
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,833
of Earth's population.
Just as Kimijima predicted.

89
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,125
And you're the mastermind
behind this brilliant plan?

90
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,541
Alright, so that is
how you see all of this.

91
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,375
Exactly as he
intended for you to.

92
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,416
Contrary to what you
believe, I am opposed to the

93
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,875
Committee of Three
Hundred's methods.

94
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,083
You're saying you're
not one of them?

95
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,166
That's correct. I caught wind
of the fact that the Committee

96
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
was assisting the
individual responsible for

97
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,083
conceiving Project Atom.
Misaki Senomiya and I

98
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,708
relentlessly
pursued this person.

99
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,416
Misa did?

100
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,916
Eventually, I made a
surprising realization.

101
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,291
Okay. What did you figure out?

102
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,583
IRUO. The Anemone Incident.
The mysterious reports,

103
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:11,375
the EGI System, Airi
Yukifune, Misaki Senomiya.

104
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,791
I realized that there
was only one individual who

105
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,541
connected all of these
things to each other.

106
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,500
You don't think?

107
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,708
I do. The man who released
information in the form of

108
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,916
mysterious reports. Reports
which directed suspicion

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,916
away from himself and
concealed the fact that

110
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,541
he was actually
the one responsible.

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,166
Arrived at Point Beta.
Securing site now.

112
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,916
Roger that. Point Alpha
has been secured, as well.

113
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,916
Of course there's rain.
There's always rain.

114
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,083
As for Misaki. I think she is
most likely Kou Kimijima's pawn.

115
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
Not Misa.

116
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,916
She created an illusory
version of herself. Using it,

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,333
she was able to keep us
occupied. And meanwhile,

118
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,541
she and the other SUMERAGI
headed for Tanegashima

119
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,875
and the site of the
upcoming rocket launch.

120
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,833
No. He's wrong.
It can't be true!

121
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,125
Aki! Aki!

122
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,750
Good, you're back.

123
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,875
Where did Aki go?

124
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,416
Well, ya see, I just
looked away for a second

125
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,541
and she up and disappeared.

126
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,708
Aki.

127
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,166
We need to go back home now.

128
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,541
We have to track
down Misa again.

129
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,583
I mean it. There's
too much going on that

130
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,416
we don't understand.

131
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,291
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

132
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,708
I don't want to talk
to her or see her.

133
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,166
You don't mean that.
I mean, come on.

134
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,000
This is the time for
ridiculously optimist--

135
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, yeah? Because I'm not
optimistic at all right now!

136
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,250
I don't know that I ever was.
I've always secretly been

137
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,166
scared that my sister
actually hates me.

138
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:47,333
I could never go
see her. I was afraid.

139
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,666
I see that now.
I was always afraid.

140
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Afraid I could never,
ever catch up to her.

141
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,416
That I really was
nothing but mediocre.

142
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,541
Afraid that no matter what
I did or how hard I tried,

143
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,833
she would
never acknowledge me.

144
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,458
I never should've started
building giant robots.

145
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,916
I never should have even
tried catching up to my sister.

146
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,541
I never should've clung so
tightly to this stupid dream.

147
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,500
Misa was right all along.

148
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,250
GunBuild-2 is nothing but
a piece of junk after all.

149
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,791
I see.

150
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,708
I'm disappointed in you.

151
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,250
Misa was right all along.
GunBuild-2 is nothing but

152
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,625
a piece of junk after all.

153
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,625
Hey, Aki. I've decided
I am going to find Misa

154
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,791
and talk to her. I have to.

155
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,291
What for?

156
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,291
I don't like it. I just can't
accept being defeated like this.

157
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,000
I was deceived and
challenged to battle without

158
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,500
even realizing it, and I
won't take it lying down.

159
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,333
How much of our lives have
the two of us spent like this?

160
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,958
Pointlessly chasing
after your sister.

161
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,916
First she rescues us
after the Anemone Incident,

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,958
then she starts pushing
us away for some reason.

163
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,208
I just... Doesn't
that make you mad?

164
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,125
I don't know. Maybe.

165
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:28,250
It makes me mad! I'm sick of
this. Of being outdone by her.

166
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:33,791
More than that! Aki, I'm sick
of you being outdone by her!

167
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,875
Kai.

168
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,833
You came here so
proud to finally show

169
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,458
GunBuild 2 to Misa, right?

170
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,708
Then show her! Don't
let everything you've done

171
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,083
go to waste! Grab
her by her stupid,

172
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,833
pretentious neck,
look her in the eye,

173
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,375
and tell her "see, I am great!
I don't care what you think,

174
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:54,208
I am not mediocre!" Let's make
her say, "you've beaten me!"

175
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,416
Who are you? And what
have you done with Kai?

176
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,125
Huh?

177
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,375
Right now, the Kai I know would
be saying "what's the big deal?

178
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,250
What are you getting
so worked up for?"

179
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,791
Oh. Uh.

180
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:16,416
Thanks for that. And I
take back what I said before.

181
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,375
GunBuild-2 isn't a
piece of junk at all.

182
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,625
We're headed to the
island. Picking up my uncle.

183
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,166
Really? How?

184
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,083
Yeah, Haneda and Narita
airports aren't operational.

185
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,041
They ain't the only
airports in Tokyo.

186
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,291
Haven't you ever
heard of Chofu Airport?

187
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,791
Well, uh.

188
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,708
As it happens, there's a certain
facility right next to it.

189
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,416
This is a special
tip from me to you,

190
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,958
so don't say I never
did anything for ya!

191
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,041
Little place called the
JAXA Chofu Aerospace Center!

192
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,791
w00t! They match exactly!

193
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,916
The company paying
the electric bill for

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Kou Kimijima's cottage
was the company Maguyan

195
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,958
was dealing with.
And it was the company

196
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,041
that financed the studio
when Mom worked on GUNVARREL.

197
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,833
I guess they must have forced
her to work on the show,

198
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,958
just like they forced Maguyan.
She managed to escape somehow

199
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,708
and tried to find a
way to get the truth out.

200
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
Oh, Mom.

201
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,291
Hey Frau, it appears
someone has come to visit you!

202
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,750
Ignoring them
would be impolite!

203
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,541
There's nobody out there.

204
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,625
Freeze!

205
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,916
Agh, get off of me!

206
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,541
This is Priest 1.
Target B is secured.

207
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,500
I repeat. Target B is secured.

208
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,833
What's wrong?

209
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,041
The two who went to the
airport aren't responding.

210
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,083
I wouldn't expect them to.

211
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,041
They're taking a
little nap right now.

212
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,666
Well, that takes care of them.

213
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,458
Do you always have
to drive like a lunatic?

214
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,166
Really. Gimme a sec.
I think I'm gonna puke.

215
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,708
We have no time
to waste on whining.

216
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,875
Especially when things are
about to get even bumpier.

217
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,958
A plane?

218
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,291
Tennoji told me about it.
She said there might be

219
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,208
a terrorist attack soon. If
anything like that happened,

220
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,750
she told me to
go to Chofu Airport.

221
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,000
She had a contingency plan?

222
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,625
Take that along with you. Who
knows, it could come in handy.

223
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,875
Also. One of my colleagues
is staying on Tanegashima.

224
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,666
We've never actually met.

225
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,625
But should you run into
each other, tell S Braun "hi".

226
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,833
Hey, wait a second.
Is S Braun actually...?

227
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,416
We need to get
going. Hurry up!

228
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,250
♪ Kagome, Kagome. ♪

229
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:24,083
♪ The bird's in the cage ♪

230
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,458
I know that voice. It's Airi!

231
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:35,625
♪ In the night of the dawn,
crane and tortoise slipped. ♪

232
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:40,541
♪ Who's in the front,
in the front of behind? ♪

233
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,208
It is her.

234
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,333
You mean the ghost-girl
that haunts Uchugaoka Park?

235
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:55,333
Actually, a real girl was the
model, but that was just an AI.

236
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,375
Made by Kou Kimijima.

237
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,416
Uh, Kai. This one seems real.

238
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,291
I won't allow you to
take off in that plane.

239
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,291
If you insist on going,
you'll have to run me over.

240
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,125
Airi, is that you?

241
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm a living child. Run me
over and my flesh will tear,

242
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
my bones will shatter,
my innards will burst,

243
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,166
and my blood will pour out.
Are you willing to accept that?

244
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,791
Stop it! Who are you?

245
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,083
Very well. You did give me
a considerable amount of help.

246
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,833
I suppose I'll let you
have a glimpse of me,

247
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,125
and I assume you
know how. Go right ahead.

248
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,083
An A.I.?

249
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,458
Not quite. Converting
someone's personality into

250
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,583
data and transplanting
it into a network.

251
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,250
Does that sound familiar?

252
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,791
You're saying?

253
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,875
Airi Yukifune was a test subject
to see if it could be done.

254
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,208
Although it isn't perfect,

255
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,583
I accomplished
what I set out to do.

256
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,833
It was you all along.

257
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,333
As you can see, I am an
individual personality that

258
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:25,250
exists within the network.
One with everlasting life.

259
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,583
When Kai and the others
head for Tanegashima,

260
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,666
they find somebody
waiting for them.

261
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,791
It's Kou Kimijima with
Airi as his hostage.

262
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,208
Aki rails at the man who would

263
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,708
annihilate the world
in his bid for power.

264
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,958
But she is not alone. When
Tanegashima is threatened by

265
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,041
the world's greatest evil,
will its people shy away

266
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,458
or rise to the challenge?

267
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,500
Episode 20.

268
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,166
Let's hit it off everybody!

269
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,625
Later days!
