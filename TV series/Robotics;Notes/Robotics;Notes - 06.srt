1
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,916
Password?

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,541
And how am I
supposed to know that?

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,541
I haven't even met you yet.
Maybe you could just

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,541
tell me what the password is?

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,166
Marco

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,958
Polo?

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,166
R T F M.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,916
Okay, how about ROFL?!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,375
GTFO.

10
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,666
Man, this is
real thirsty work.

11
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,833
Hey, could you go get
me something to drink?

12
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm afraid not.

13
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,166
No one ever told you
to respect your elders?

14
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,458
Please stop acting
like you're my superior.

15
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,875
I don't come out here for
the joy of being bossed around

16
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,083
by older club members.

17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,916
But you know it's
gonna happen anyway,

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,625
so why do you come out here?

19
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,625
I happen to find this
to be an ideal environment

20
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,541
in which to work.
Until now, I had to perform

21
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,208
the M45's maintenance in secret.

22
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,250
Having a masked
alter ego must be tough.

23
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,625
So, you ever get the

24
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,958
KILL-BALLAD control
system installed, or what?

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,250
Not yet. I'm in talks with
Furugori regarding that,

26
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,125
I tried to speak
with her yesterday, but...

27
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,458
Um, hi!

28
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,791
A-Are you Furugori?

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,875
No, dude, that's Daitoku.

30
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,666
Uh, hello, it's nice
to meet you.

31
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,166
Sorry. Am I
interrupting something?

32
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,958
No way, not at all.
I'm glad you came!

33
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,958
Oh, good. Because I thought
about what you told me

34
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,750
the other day.
That I should come out

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,291
and visit the club's
hangar at least once.

36
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,291
Oh, that's Subaru Hidaka,
our club's great hope.

37
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,416
He's in his second year.

38
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,583
Hello.

39
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,666
Sorry, he's unfriendly
to everybody.

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,416
Don't take it personally.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,125
What is this? Has she come
to confess her love for Kai?!

42
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,500
Huh?

43
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,583
What are you yelling
about Aki? You're scaring her.

44
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,500
She's here to check out
the Robot Research Club,

45
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,958
so chill out.

46
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,708
Oh! Is that why you're here?

47
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,833
Wonderful!
I'm so glad you came!

48
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,041
Come on take a look around!

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,166
By the way, the wind out
here gets pretty strong.

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,916
Personally, I like
taking naps on the runway.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,083
Though not necessarily at
this time of year. Too breezy.

52
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,583
Yeah, I think I can
see what you mean.

53
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,416
All right! This one's for
our new club members,

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,666
Subaru and Junna!
To you guys!

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,583
To you.

56
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,541
T-To us?

57
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,375
This is awesome!

58
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,041
I gotta say,
I didn't expect you

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
to join the
club right away, Jun.

60
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:41,041
Yeah, I know. I wasn't
expecting to join either.

61
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,250
And it's thanks to me,
and my willingness

62
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,166
to fall to my knees and beg.

63
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,916
Uh, Chief, that's not really
something I would boast about.

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,291
So, Robot fear conquered?

65
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,500
I seem okay with
GunBuild-1, at least.

66
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,750
Hey, I know what your
first act as a new member

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,000
of the club should be.

68
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,000
You can come out with
us to the Robo Clinic!

69
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,875
I-I can't.
I just can't, I'm sorry!

70
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,000
Uhh. No, no, no
I was only kidding!

71
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,708
Just please don't cry, okay?

72
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,416
I know, why don't you
have another Skal, huh?

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,500
If we're done, it's time
for me to be going now.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,125
Really? It hasn't even been
three minutes since our toast.

75
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,250
Three minutes is plenty of
time for a welcoming party.

76
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
So goodbye.
Thanks for the drink.

77
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,250
Huh? Hey, hold on a minute!

78
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,416
Subaru! Come back here!

79
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,875
Kou Kimijima.
Where did you get this?

80
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,833
Uchugaoka Park. Inside the
abandoned folk museum.

81
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,541
Tell me, have you seen
a girl named Airi?

82
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,000
How did you- do you know
something about this?

83
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,041
Yes, actually I do.
Well, sort of,

84
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,625
but not anything about the
convoluted stuff written here.

85
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,916
I met him a long time ago.
It was back when I was

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
still in high school.
Airi was one of Misa's friends.

87
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,208
That's all, really.

88
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,833
She knew Misa?

89
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,708
Hey Dad, I'm home.

90
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,666
Hey.

91
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,083
Oh, you see,
the scooter's been acting up,

92
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,958
so I was just fiddling
with the engine.

93
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,125
Don't worry,
I'll wash it myself.

94
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,333
Hey! I know you're there!

95
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,083
Well? Are you going
to come out here, or not?

96
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,541
U-Umm, hello? I'm sorry,
but are you speaking to Airi?

97
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,458
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

98
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,166
Sure. May I call you "Brother,"
like I did before?

99
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,958
Yeah, go right ahead.

100
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,708
Okay, Brother! What would
you like to talk to me about?

101
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,666
The weather forecast, perhaps?

102
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,500
Never mind about the weather.

103
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
Oh. Okay then.

104
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,125
Alright, so tell me, do you
know someone named Misa

105
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,125
or Misaki Senomiya?

106
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,625
Of course I know Misaki!
She and Airi are friends!

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,916
Yeah? So you guys,
hang out and stuff, then?

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Oh, yes.
She talked to me a lot.

109
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,791
She'd tell me about
what was going on at school,

110
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,041
and about her friends.

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,375
Let's see if I remember
what their names were.

112
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,875
Mizuka, Keiko,
Mitsuhiko, Yuuichi.

113
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,625
Oh, and she spoke about
Akiho all the time, as well.

114
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,708
And you, Brother!

115
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,125
She talked about me?

116
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,000
She often remarked
about "kicking your butt"

117
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,250
at fighting games.

118
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,333
Then what about
Kou Kimijima? Who is he?

119
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,125
Oh, yes, Kou Kimijima?

120
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,375
He's Airi's master, of course.
The one who created Airi!

121
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,250
There, that noise.

122
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,250
It's dark down here.

123
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,083
Airi, can you see like this,
without any light?

124
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,375
No. I can't see
where you are now.

125
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,958
My visual capabilities rely on
IRUO, so I can't see anything

126
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,583
if you're in an
unmapped location.

127
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,083
That's a big help.

128
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,791
That hurt!

129
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,458
What was that?
Did something open?

130
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,916
Not that I can see.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,125
Hey. What is that? A door.

132
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,750
 Uh. Hidden Hand.

133
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,708
There's electricity down here?

134
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,750
Hey, this looks
like one of those

135
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,750
old music players
that use cassette tapes.

136
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
Wow. What is going on here?

137
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Airi, this tape.
Is it the source of that

138
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,750
"beee-boo-boo" sound?

139
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,958
Do you even know
what I'm talking about?

140
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,333
Oh, you mean, "bee-bee-boo"?

141
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,875
You're right,
what was I thinking?

142
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,208
Is this what causes it?

143
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,416
Airi can't see what
you're referring to.

144
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,375
Please ask Gezi, instead.

145
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,166
All right.

146
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,541
Your access has been confirmed.

147
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,958
Switch to Gezi
mode was successful.

148
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,875
Can you tell me what
this machine is, exactly?

149
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,500
The EGI system.

150
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,500
EGI?

151
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,291
Yes, that is correct.
It emits sounds

152
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,708
with specific wavelengths into
space at regular intervals.

153
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,458
These sounds can be picked up
by PhoneDroid pads, as well,

154
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,791
which play them as audio files.

155
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,458
Can you tell me what
this Kou Kimijima guy

156
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,416
was trying to
accomplish on this island?

157
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,791
That is confidential.

158
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,541
Well then can you at
least tell me how he died?

159
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,208
My master was murdered.

160
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,875
S-Somebody killed him? Who?

161
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,458
Data pertaining to that question
have been deleted from memory.

162
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Excuse me, Frau, it appears
someone has come to visit you!

163
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,333
Ignoring a visitor would
be very impolite, you know.

164
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,375
Boys with glasses are mega hot.

165
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,916
Your breathing sure
is getting heavy.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,833
But that doesn't apply to you,
3-D boy with glasses, oh no!

167
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,791
You annoy me! Now, GTFO!

168
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,000
Hi... I'm Subaru Hidaka...

169
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,583
Will you at least hear what I
have to say? That's all I ask.

170
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:31,333
I've reported you.

171
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,291
Ugh. Curse this griefer!

172
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,083
IANAL, but this is
so lawsuit material!

173
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,666
No! Please, just wait.

174
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,791
I came to discuss the

175
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,666
KILL-BALLAD control
program you wrote.

176
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,666
Nothing else! You and Yashio
know each other, right?

177
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,791
Yashio? Oh. You mean UMISHO?

178
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,875
He and I are going
to enter the ROBO-ONE

179
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,250
world championship together.
I was hoping you would write

180
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,416
a control program for us.

181
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,875
With your help, we have a real
shot at winning the tournament!

182
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,666
Please, you have to help us.

183
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,750
Taiyou Development.
Why would they buy

184
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,875
an abandoned building and
then pay its electric bills?

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,583
And how does
Kimijima fit into this?

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I give up. This is nothing
more than one man's fantasy.

187
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,750
What's the point in
playing along?

188
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,750
I would just be wasting
my time if I kept digging.

189
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,541
I have made an
arrangement with Furugori.

190
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,958
And so, Kona Furugori
is the newest member

191
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,416
of the Robot Research Club!
Let's give her a hand, huh?

192
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,833
Still! Why didn't
you come here in person?!

193
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,541
I'm a shut-in?

194
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,750
Urgh! What is it that
makes all these new members

195
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,708
think they can get away
with being so freaking cheeky!

196
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,958
So you know, I'm including
you in that group, too.

197
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,583
Fine. All I care about
is getting her to do

198
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,500
the programming for the M45
in time for the tournament.

199
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,875
And don't forget the payment.
A full-nude photo shoot.

200
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,458
The glasses can stay on,
but otherwise,

201
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,916
you'll wear nothing
but your birthday suit.

202
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,041
You're- You're posing,
fully nude?!

203
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,875
That is not at all
what we agreed on!

204
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,291
The deal was that Yashio
would help you hunt cheaters.

205
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,000
You can't change it now!

206
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:33,500
A naked photo of you
guys on an African safari?

207
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,666
He said "cheaters," Jun.
Not "cheetahs".

208
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,500
Like as in, highly ranked
KILL-BALLAD players

209
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,000
who find ways to cheat
during their battles.

210
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,375
Can't you do that kind
of thing yourself, Kona?

211
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,833
I mean, you did
create KILL-BALLAD.

212
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,125
I don't like being
called Kona, plzkthx.

213
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,500
All right, then how
about I call you Frau Bow?

214
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,791
Yes, NP. That's A-OK.

215
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm glad that's settled,
but we do need

216
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,083
to meet in person
to discuss things.

217
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,166
I see. You're a pervert!

218
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,333
Huh?

219
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,000
I only just moved here,
and you expect me

220
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,375
to invite a boy from
school into my home?

221
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,958
Sounds like porn to me.
I've got an idea.

222
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,250
Why don't you leave me alone

223
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,541
and spend the night
at Yashio's place?

224
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,958
Something tells me I'm not
going to like that girl.

225
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
She's even harder to
deal with than Subaru.

226
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,083
I have no intention of being
"dealt with" by anyone.

227
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,166
That attitude is exactly what
makes you so hard to deal with!

228
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,750
There's a lot more to
this club than I expected.

229
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,250
You're all so
smart and talented!

230
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,833
We are amazing, aren't we?
Oh, that gets me fired up!

231
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,500
What are you
so fired up about now?

232
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,958
Amazing things can happen

233
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,916
when amazing people
get together, Kai!

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,250
You know, I think it's time to
storm the Space Candy company!

235
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,291
Come on guys, let's go!

236
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,333
After all of that

237
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,333
Jun and I were
the only ones who came?!

238
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,583
What? It's finished already?

239
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,833
Are you kidding?

240
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,916
Seventy-two hour stints
are nothing to me, nOOb.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,625
You worked on it for
seventy-two hours straight?

242
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,791
That's how I operate.
Once I start something,

243
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,625
I don't sleep
until I'm finished.

244
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,833
Don't go thinking
I pulled three all-nighters

245
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,958
in a row just for your sake.

246
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,416
She sounded weird.
What was that?

247
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:32,000
It's nice and smooth.
Pretty responsive, too.

248
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,583
It's almost impossible
to believe. How could she

249
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,000
create something of this
caliber in only a few days?

250
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,166
Hey, how did things go
with the company?

251
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,250
So now you're
pretending like you care?

252
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,083
After the two
of you refused to go?

253
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,250
 Still...

254
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,041
Hi-ya!

255
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,208
That's impaaaaact!

256
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,041
Well done!
You finally found it!

257
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,041
This is precisely the kind of
impact that I was looking for!

258
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,333
He really took a liking
to Jun for some reason.

259
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,291
So. He agreed to sponsor us,
all thanks to her!

260
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,125
Now we can finally work
toward our ultimate goal!

261
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,041
We'll start by putting the
star on GUNVARREL'S waist.

262
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,208
Oh! I almost forgot! I was
thinking it would be really cool

263
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,250
to add an exact replica
of its scarf, too.

264
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,916
You're glowing, you know.

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,166
Huh?

266
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
People who are passionate
about their dreams

267
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,250
have a glow about
them no one else has.

268
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,541
I was like that before
my dream came to an end.

269
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,583
Somethin' wrong?

270
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,625
No. It's nothing. I'm fine.

271
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,833
Now let's get to work.
Could you help me conduct

272
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,833
a test battle with the M45?

273
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,041
Man, that move
is really amazing.

274
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,833
You can be a real jerk
sometimes, but figuring out how

275
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,916
to use the Pile Bunkers like
that makes you okay in my book.

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,500
I had you pegged
as more of a sword

277
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,916
or hammer person
this entire time, actually.

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,791
Sheesh! Can't you be nice
while I'm complimenting you?

279
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,583
You all set down there?

280
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,083
We're ready when you are!
I don't think you boys know

281
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,416
what you've gotten
yourselves into.

282
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I'll kick your butt
in three seconds flat!

283
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:22,375
Don't get worked up. Geez,
you're just a sparring partner.

284
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,458
Robots to your corners.
Ready and fight!

285
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:27,916
Go!

286
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,291
Oh, you're just comin' straight
at me with no fancy moves, huh?

287
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,416
Speed's what counts.
You'll see!

288
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,958
Lemme try again!

289
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,083
Take this! GUNVAL Uppercut!

290
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,750
You're pretty bad at this,
Aki. Wanna keep going?

291
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
You leave me no choice!

292
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,916
As swift as the wind!
As strong as the sea!

293
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,333
Tanegashi Accel Impaaaact!

294
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,000
You just wanted an excuse
to shout that, didn't you?

295
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,791
You dodged it! No fair!
Get it, Jun! Go on, hurry!

296
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
Oh, right!

297
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,333
Wow, she's fast. I guess
it's from all that karate.

298
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,583
I should have her on hand

299
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,875
whenever I practice the
Tanegashi Accel Impact.

300
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,250
C'mon, Aki. Take this seriously.

301
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,750
That's enough. This was
more than sufficient for

302
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,458
a test match. I'm surprised
you were able to master

303
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,875
the M45 in such a
short time. Good job today.

304
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,666
Whoa. A compliment?
From you?

305
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,291
I admit that your skills
as a gamer are formidable.

306
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,458
Asking you to be
the operator was a great dec-

307
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,041
Who's he?

308
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,416
Who are you?! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

309
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,041
Please, Chief.

310
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,625
I would appreciate it
if you would stay of this.

311
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,083
It's okay. This is
between me and my father.

312
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,833
He's your father?

313
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,791
You will explain
what's going on here.

314
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,750
This was my dream.
I couldn't just give it up.

315
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,208
Don't give me that dream crap.
You made me a promise

316
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,500
two years ago that you would
give up this robot nonsense.

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
That you'd follow
in my footsteps

318
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,083
and become a fisherman.

319
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,666
Or were those
just more lies?! Well?!

320
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,041
It wasn't like that.

321
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,916
Oh, yeah? Then what
the hell is this?!

322
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,791
This lousy toy!

323
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,541
No, don't! Don't hurt it!
It may just seem

324
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,541
like a toy to you, but to
us it's a living thing!

325
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,625
It's been brought to life

326
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,875
through Subaru's
passion and hard work!

327
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,791
So please don't hurt it!
If you do,

328
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,375
it's the same thing
as hurting Subaru himself!

329
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,833
Please, Chief. I meant it when
I asked you to stay out of this.

330
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,208
Subaru.

331
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,458
Come on, boy.
We'll talk about this at home.

332
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,416
I have to go now.
And please, dispose of

333
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,458
the M45 however you see fit.

334
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,833
Just throw it away?

335
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,916
It doesn't matter.
My dream has come to an end.

336
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,083
Goodbye.

337
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Such an incredibly
sad thing, having a dream end.

338
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,291
What's happening?!

339
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,875
Are you having an attack?!
Can you hear me?!

340
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,375
Aki!

341
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,541
After Subaru's father discovers
what his son has been up to,

342
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,458
Subaru gives up
everything in his life

343
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,083
having to do with robots.

344
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,875
Refusing to take
no for an answer,

345
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,041
Aki fights to keep
him in the club.

346
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,291
Meanwhile,
Kai pays Frau a visit.

347
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,500
He learns about her
tragic past and the mystery

348
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,166
at the heart of it.
Murder, secrets, conspiracy.

349
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,125
Little does he
know that, for all of them,

350
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,916
the mystery has only begun.

351
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,875
Episode 7!

352
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,708
Let's hit it off, everybody!

353
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,750
Later days!
