1
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,583
This is bad! Very, very bad!

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,500
Since it happened, Subaru
hasn't been to school even once!

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,625
Yeah. I know what
you mean, it was bad enough

4
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,041
to spark one of your attacks,
and it's getting worse.

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,375
Never mind me,
think about Subaru!

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,458
There's only one
thing we can do now.

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,833
Are you with me?

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,625
We have no choice but
to storm the Hidaka house!

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,875
Just leave well
enough alone, Aki.

10
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,375
In the real world, nobody gets

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,583
to hold on to
their dreams forever.

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,083
You know that from first-hand
experience, don't you?

13
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,875
Hang in there, Rozetta!
Your dream doesn't have to die!

14
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,833
As swift as the wind!
As strong as the seaaa!

15
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,166
Hey, Yashio.

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,916
The GUNVARREL anime, huh?

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Yeah, all one hundred
and fifty-five episodes.

18
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,708
Akiho lent them to me, I'm
only on episode seven so far.

19
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,041
Sounds like you've got
a long way to go, then.

20
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,708
Yeah, but at least
it's a good show.

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,583
Besides, the final
episode of GUNVARREL

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,708
is an urban legend
in its own, right?

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,416
So, I figure I should
watch the rest at least once.

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,125
The mysterious
final episode that,

25
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,333
for reasons unknown,
was never aired?

26
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,291
Ah, man, you really are
into urban legends, huh?

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
Oh, that reminds me.
You remember how

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,875
PhoneDroid pads all over the
country froze up the other day?

29
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,625
I was curious to see
if anything like that

30
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,916
had happened before,
so I looked into it.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,375
Yeah?

32
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,000
It turns out that this isn't
the only similar incident.

33
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,083
There've been a bunch. One time,
there was this weird email.

34
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,958
It showed up on millions
of pads at the same time.

35
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,208
That was already creepy

36
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,708
but the message itself
was a little scary, too.

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,041
Scary, like how?

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,708
It was the lyrics
to "Kagome, Kagome."

39
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,916
Is something the matter?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,416
Oh, no, it's nothing. I-

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,083
Tell me when you
plan to keep your end

42
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,791
of the deal and
hunt down cheaters for me.

43
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,708
You should come to my place.

44
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,500
And then, while dressed
indecently in a musty, chilly,

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,166
air-conditioned room,
you can game as hard

46
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,666
as you want and make
boys with glasses

47
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,833
cry out in sweet,
sweet anguish!

48
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,041
It's freezing in here.
You oughta turn down the AC.

49
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,541
This can't be good for you.

50
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,916
You're concern for
me is touching, but STFU!

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,208
And besides,
I like it when it's cold.

52
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,291
Now, come in.
You, you want a drink?

53
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,875
Only if it's something warm.

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,291
Heating water up is for lamers.

55
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,291
Your hospitality leaves
a lot to be desired.

56
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,333
Well, it looks like we won't
be competing in ROBO-ONE now.

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,833
So I got nothing better
to do than help you out.

58
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,083
Sssee the top five
handles on the leaderboard?

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,125
Well, up until last month,
I suspected them all

60
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,750
of cheating during battles.

61
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,666
Well, we know I'm
not a cheater, at least,

62
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,291
and neither is the
fourth place one, TAGIRINGER.

63
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,666
Yeah? How do you know that?

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,833
Oh, trust me, I know.
When you're as good as I am,

65
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,291
you can just instinctively feel
it from the way someone fights.

66
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,916
And besides,
I think TAGIRINGER is...

67
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,708
Nothing. Never mind.
Anyway, the top three

68
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,250
are all using cheats,
I can promise you that.

69
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,041
I've seen them pull
off moves during battle

70
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,500
that no real person would
be able to on their own.

71
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,458
Agreed.

72
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,791
So, how do I hunt for them?

73
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,500
Simple, all you have to do
is challenge them in battle.

74
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,541
I whipped up a scanning tool
that can detect cheats.

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll execute it
during those matches.

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,041
And how do we arrange
for me to battle them?

77
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,750
We just have to wait until

78
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,708
you're matched up
with them, I guess.

79
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,375
Fantastic, I have to sit
here waiting for these guys,

80
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,875
without any idea when
they're gonna show up?

81
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,708
Who's that?

82
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,583
Oh, um, hello.

83
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,708
Hey, what's the deal? You've
been AWOL for awhile now.

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,458
Aki's been really
worried about you.

85
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,291
Wh-What are you doing
here without her, anyway?

86
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,750
I just came from Kona's place.
I've been there all day.

87
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,750
Fulfilling my part of the
agreement you made with her.

88
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,291
Oh, the nude photo shoot.

89
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,541
Hunting down cheaters.

90
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,500
None of them showed
up this time around.

91
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,875
We're gonna give it another
shot tomorrow, though.

92
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,541
Is that...?

93
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,583
Hey, did you patch things
up with your old man?

94
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,166
No, no chance of that.

95
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,666
My dream is over for good.
Tell the Chief I said thanks,

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,625
but she doesn't need
to worry about this.

97
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,458
I'll dispose of the M45 myself.

98
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,208
That will give me a better
sense of closure. Goodbye.

99
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,625
What were you looking at
all those times, Brother?

100
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,625
You've come to visit this
spot over and over again

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,166
during the past nine years.

102
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,208
In fact, you came once
every two days, on average.

103
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,041
Sometimes you'd come
with two other people,

104
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,458
sometimes with one other person,
and sometimes by yourself.

105
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,958
Listen. Years from now,
when you're all grown up,

106
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,791
I want you to be a man
with the "right stuff."

107
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,875
When I was younger,
I wanted to grow up

108
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,583
to be an astronaut someday.

109
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,708
But the Tanegashima Space Center

110
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,250
has never sent
anyone into space.

111
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,291
Yeah, I knew that, but even so,
it's something every little boy

112
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,833
from here thinks about,
at least for a while, anyway.

113
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,083
Is it true?

114
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,125
Are you really quitting
the Robot Research Club?!

115
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,291
That's right. There's no
reason for it anymore.

116
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,458
Why?! What about your robot?!

117
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,625
That old thing?

118
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,250
It's just a giant piece of junk.

119
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,375
I gave that dream
up a long time ago.

120
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,291
There has been
a massive series of

121
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,916
malfunction incidents involving
the latest Powered Suit model

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,958
from Exoskeleton Company.
According to the

123
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,541
Consumer Affairs Agency,
over one hundred similar

124
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,458
incidents have been reported
in the past two years alone.

125
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,500
Many of these resulted
in serious injury,

126
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
including broken bones.

127
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,458
Exoskeleton Company has pledged
to look into all potential flaws

128
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,791
in the product that
could have caused

129
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,708
this recent...

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Excuse me? They tell
me you're the Robo-Doc.

131
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,958
My name is Misaki Senomiya,
and I'm a member

132
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,458
of the Chuo Tanegashima High
School Robot Fan Club.

133
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,208
I was hoping for
your advice on something.

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,000
Here, let me show you.

135
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,083
That a hobby robot?

136
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,416
No. These are
plans I'm working on

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,541
for a full-scale giant robot!

138
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,250
I've seen enough.
Get outta here.

139
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,041
I'm not gonna bother with
some kid's dumb pipe dream.

140
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,875
You can't just kick me out!

141
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,541
I do what I want
in my shop. Now, go on!

142
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,041
 In that case...

143
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,250
Did everything go okay?

144
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, fortunately.

145
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,875
It's such a relief to
finally pay off my tab.

146
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,250
Thank goodness for
our sponsor! And thank you too

147
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,833
for coming here with me.

148
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,125
I just stood here.
I'm really sorry

149
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,166
but I couldn't
bring myself to go in.

150
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,833
Oh, don't worry about it.
Just having you here gave me

151
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,541
the boost of confidence
I needed! Well!

152
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,875
Now that we actually
have money, I'll have to

153
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,208
look through the catalogs and
decide which parts we'll need.

154
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,125
When you get down to it,
robots are nothing but robots.

155
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,166
Terrible news, Kai.

156
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,208
All the malfunctions
they announced yesterday?

157
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,958
Well, that's terrible, too.

158
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,625
But my sister is
handling it, so it'll be okay.

159
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm talking about Subaru.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,541
I noticed that the M45 was gone

161
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,541
when I stopped by
the hangar this morning.

162
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,625
Oh. I guess
I forgot to tell you.

163
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,750
He came and got it. Said he
was gonna get rid of it himself.

164
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,666
You mean you actually saw him?!

165
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,958
Why didn't you
talk him out of it?!

166
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,708
There's nothing
we can do now, Aki.

167
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,333
Seriously, just let it go,
okay? It's out of our hands.

168
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,625
Oh, GUNVARREL.

169
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm so lost. What do you
think I should do about this?

170
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,750
Subaru! Are you there?! Hello?

171
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,958
If you're there,
come answer the door! Subaru!

172
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,125
"Wipe away your
tears and stand tall!

173
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,041
That's the only way
you can see tomorrow!"

174
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,208
We could, you know,
talk about stuff.

175
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,625
I mean, you are the one
who created KILL-BALLAD.

176
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,708
Genius programmer
FRAU KOJIRO, FTW. Ready!

177
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, since I'm just
waiting around to be matched,

178
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,583
maybe you could talk about
behind-the-scenes stuff,

179
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,458
or the programming
quirks of each mech type?

180
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,041
Of all people, you don't
need tips like that, IMHO.

181
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,083
Y-You already have amazing
l33t skills as it is.

182
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,958
Which skills are
you talking about?

183
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,625
Oh, do you mean Slow-Motion?

184
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,916
That isn't actually a fighting
technique, just a spasm attack

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,541
I have sometimes. I don't want
you getting the wrong idea.

186
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,791
Spasms that give you
super-human fighting reflexes?

187
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,291
That's been an anime
cliché for ten years now.

188
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
Look, quit trying
to be funny, will ya?

189
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,041
The attacks get so painful it
feels like I'm about to die.

190
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,916
So maybe you could
do me a big favor

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,083
and stop making fun of them.

192
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,083
In exchange, I'll reveal
a secret of my own.

193
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,958
S-Something personal.

194
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,375
All right, shoot.

195
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,083
Do you know the reason the
much-anticipated final episode

196
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,000
of GUNVARREL never aired?

197
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,791
No, and I haven't
really lost any sleep over it.

198
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,125
Th-The final episode
was never broadcast

199
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,458
because people on the staff died
just before it was set to air.

200
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,375
Not just a single death.

201
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,708
At least thirteen
people died that day.

202
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,875
Then, immediately after,

203
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,208
the director
mysteriously went missing.

204
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,125
Some people think she
killed them all, ROFL.

205
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,666
And you actually
believe that story?

206
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,250
Y-You know my real
name is Kona Furugori.

207
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,500
Which can also be
shortened to Kogori.

208
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,958
Minami Kogori was
the name of the woman

209
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,333
who directed the show.

210
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,416
She was also my mom.

211
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,958
That's who I am: the daughter
of a suspected murderer.

212
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,500
How's that for a secret?
Before she disappeared,

213
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,083
my mom was last seen
on this island. And that's

214
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,083
the reason I
moved to Tanegashima.

215
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,083
That's a pretty heavy story
you decided to dump on me.

216
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,458
I think it's best if
I pretend I didn't hear.

217
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,416
I don't want
to get involved in--

218
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,541
Sweet, finally! It's BOBLEE,
the dude in third place!

219
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,166
ESL!

220
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,916
I was wondering why
you weren't at the hangar.

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,166
What's the deal, you were
with Frau Bow all day?

222
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,041
Yeah, kinda, it was part
of that agreement Subaru made.

223
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,791
Wasn't very productive,
though. We didn't find

224
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,166
any signs of the guy cheating.
Which just frustrated Kona.

225
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,250
You were alone at her place?

226
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,583
Well, she lives by herself.

227
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,708
Maybe I should start
calling you "Casanova Kai."

228
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,041
Yeah? You think so?

229
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,000
Not really.
Gaming's the only thing

230
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,208
that gets you hot and bothered.

231
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,666
What about you? It's a
weird time of night to be out.

232
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,500
Where were you?

233
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,458
Subaru's place. But don't worry,
I didn't cause any trouble.

234
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,041
Nobody was home.
I just went over to drop off

235
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,916
some stuff he
forgot at the hangar.

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
Stuff? What stuff?

237
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,333
Just something
I saw lying around.

238
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,958
I think he'll treasure it,
no matter what happens.

239
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,083
Even if he does have to
quit the Robot Research Club.

240
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,916
What was it?

241
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,791
A piece of the M45.

242
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,625
As you know,
summer break begins tomorrow.

243
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,875
But, college entrance exams
are only half a year away.

244
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,875
So make the most
of the time you have.

245
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,291
I'm sure you all have plenty
of work to do. Good luck!

246
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,583
The expo is coming up fast.

247
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,791
This summer break is
gonna be crucial for us!

248
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,541
Did you hear anything
the teacher just said, Aki?

249
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,708
To make things worse,

250
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,541
Subaru still hasn't
come back to school.

251
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,375
The rest of us are gonna have
to work extra hard without him.

252
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,250
Good to see you, Yashio. Chief.

253
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,291
Subaru! This is fantastic!
You smoothed things over

254
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,916
with your dad, after all?

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Unfortunately,
my father isn't one

256
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
to let things go that easily.

257
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,958
I'm not here for the club.
This just happens to be

258
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,041
a nice, quiet place to study.

259
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,791
Yeah, that's pretty thin.
Do you really think

260
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,125
your dad is going
to buy that story?

261
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,583
Don't worry about it.

262
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,333
I dismantled the M45
while my father watched.

263
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,958
That should be enough.

264
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,333
Of course, that means our plans
for ROBO-ONE are cancelled.

265
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,708
It was unavoidable,
Yashio. I apologize.

266
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,125
No, that's totally fine by me.

267
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,333
Now I can spend all summer
vacation playing KILL-BALLAD.

268
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,541
That must have been so hard.

269
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,416
Wha--?! I, hard, no.
I'm huh?

270
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,291
I'm so sorry. I can't imagine
how much that must have hurt.

271
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,666
The M45 was your partner, almost
like an extension of yourself.

272
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,166
To take it apart
with your own hands.

273
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,833
So what do you say, Subaru?
Shall we race forward?

274
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,000
Huh?!

275
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
Oh you know!
Toward the ultimate triumph!

276
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,750
What? No way!

277
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,083
Whaaaaa--?!

278
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,500
But, Chief.

279
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,333
Well, you tried to protect
the M45 when my father came,

280
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,125
and you returned
the final piece of it to me.

281
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:16,000
So... So I want to
thank you berry much!

282
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,458
"Berry much"?

283
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,708
Wow! Subaru's finally
opening up to us.

284
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,083
Isn't that nice?

285
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not like I'm baring
my soul to you or anything!

286
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,250
Like I told you before, I just
came here to study and, umm...

287
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,291
And, maybe, occasionally,
to give you a hand

288
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,125
with the remaining
construction on GUNVARREL.

289
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:37,958
Huh?

290
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,166
Hello, Doc!

291
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,458
Whaddya want today? I see
you got Mr. Pleiades with ya.

292
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,500
How did you know?!

293
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,000
What, did ya
think I was blind?

294
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,416
Anyone can see through
a lousy disguise like that.

295
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,666
It's just a stupid mask.

296
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,458
Anyone?! Oh no! This can't be!

297
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,041
So, what brings you to the shop?

298
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,625
I'm here for parts, of course.

299
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,291
For another hobby robot?

300
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,416
Not this time.
I need parts for GunBuild-1!

301
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,500
In that case,
how about we make a bet?

302
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,958
On what?

303
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,750
I bet you that the Robot Fan
Club will win the ROBO-ONE

304
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,166
tournament this year.
If I can make that happen,

305
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,166
you have to promise to share
your years of expertise with me?

306
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,625
What do you say?

307
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,958
What do you think?
The parts for GunBuild-1!

308
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,250
And it's all
thanks to the money

309
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,500
your company so
generously gave us!

310
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,541
Oh and we're in the process
of developing a sticker for it.

311
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,666
A sticker?

312
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,250
A big ol' giant of a sticker!

313
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,750
With "Space Candy Company"
written across it!

314
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,333
Boing-a-boing!

315
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,416
Cool, huh? Just stick it right
on the robot, so it's like POW!

316
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
You know what I mean, dontcha?

317
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,375
Always gotta
have impact, my girl.

318
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,416
O-kay. But, sir...

319
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,541
And you know what would be
even better for advertising?

320
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,000
If Junna here rode in it.

321
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,500
Oh, please, no!
I can't do that!

322
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,458
Umm, we were planning
to have Kai pilot it.

323
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,958
He's good at that sort of thing.

324
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,083
No, think about it: a cute
karate girl who rides around

325
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,916
in a giant robot.
Impact, all the way!

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,416
Chesty, chesty! Impact!

327
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
Boing, boing, boing!

328
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,791
So very tired.
Dealing with that man

329
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,875
is a truly
exhausting experience.

330
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,000
I see the parts have arrived?

331
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,500
It's about time
you showed up, Subaru!

332
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,708
Just to be on the safe side,
you should check them.

333
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,416
Make sure they weren't
damaged by the solar storm.

334
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,666
What do you mean?
What solar storm?

335
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,833
Oh, it's been trending
on Twipo since this morning.

336
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,625
Apparently there was
a big solar storm earlier.

337
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,500
I hear it knocked
out a ton of machines,

338
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,541
all along the west coast
of the United States.

339
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,916
Large-scale solar storms
will occur in succession

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
in twenty-twelve,
twenty-fifteen,

341
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,375
twenty-nineteen,
and twenty-twenty.

342
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,541
The twenty-fifteen
solar storm in particular

343
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,291
will have serious
effects on the Earth

344
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,875
and its magnetosphere,
and no one will see it coming.

345
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,416
Wow. So do you think
it's going to be like

346
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,583
the 2015 Crash all over again?

347
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,833
It's not that bad yet.
But it does sound like

348
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,666
there could be a
stronger storm later on.

349
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,541
Scientific evidence
indicates that the sun

350
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,916
is on the verge of explosion.

351
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,208
It's "Kagome, Kagome".

352
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,666
Weird. What's going on?

353
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,125
I don't know, but it's
coming from my pad, too.

354
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
Hello.

355
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
Sorry. Are you the members of

356
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,500
the Chuo Tanegashima High
School Robot Research Club?

357
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,083
Um. Yes, yes, we are.

358
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,583
Excellent. I know this
is sudden, but I'd like

359
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,583
to speak with
you about something.

360
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,291
If you would
kindly come with us.

361
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,416
Following their abduction
by a mysterious woman,

362
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,291
Aki and friends find
themselves presented

363
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,041
with an unexpected offer.

364
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:07,041
Later, Kai endeavors to learn
more about the Kimijima Reports,

365
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,916
and what he
discovers is shocking.

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,458
The Committee of
Three Hundred, Project Atum,

367
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,916
a devastating storm.
The Reports are filled with

368
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,416
conspiracy and catastrophe.
How has Kai landed himself

369
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,083
in the middle of this tempest?

370
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,750
Episode 8!

371
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,375
Let's hit it off, everybody!

372
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,625
Later days!
