1
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,791
It was a totally ordinary life.

2
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,416
An average family
on an average day.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,583
Ah! Why do I
always do this?

4
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,458
I've gotta run. See you
later! Have a good day!

5
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,000
You too! Bye, Mom.

6
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,166
That was it. She
left that morning

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,166
and never made
it back home again.

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,083
It's so cold.

9
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,583
If I stay long enough,
maybe it'll freeze me

10
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,208
and preserve my
body for all eternity.

11
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,416
Man, I'm lame. Talk about
epic delusional poetry.

12
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,166
As November rolled around,
temperatures dropped,

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,583
and the wind grew chilly.

14
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,291
The Mark 2's construction
is progressing

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,958
at a fairly decent
rate, I guess.

16
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,333
Amazing.

17
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,708
The real robot still has a ways
to go. That's just the AR.

18
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
Yeah, we have to decide
on a drive system soon.

19
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,416
We can't do much more until
then. I wish we could use

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,750
the mono-- I mean I wish we
could find some totally awesome

21
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,916
new material to
use for the motor.

22
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,375
Hello, all! You're up early.

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,541
Nae returned from her Tokyo
trip last month. Now when we

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,333
use this place she's always
there to supervise our work.

25
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,875
Good morning, Nae.
Don't leave me hangin!

26
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,041
I'm not really
big on high fives.

27
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,916
Hey, it's the weekend,
right? Don't you have some

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
wild parties to go to today?

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,375
You should know better than to

30
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,291
tease your elders by
now, Kaito. Be careful!

31
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,625
Because bad kids like you get
the dreaded tickle punishment!

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,208
Uh. Hey, Nae, when
you're done with that

33
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,416
we've got a little
present to give you!

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,750
Huh? A gift for me?

35
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:03,833
Yes! Ready? Happy birthday
to our dear friend Nae!

36
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,166
Come on, you guys! Sing!

37
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,500
I-I can't, I'm sorry.
I would be too embarrassed.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,375
The same goes for me.

39
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,416
Sorry. I can't sing either.
I've been tickle-punished.

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,208
I can't believe it. You
guys knew it was my birthday?

41
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,041
That's incredibly sweet of
you. And a total surprise, too!

42
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,833
Here you go. It's
something from all of us.

43
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,208
Thank you so much!
I don't know what to say!

44
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,625
May I open it right now?

45
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,083
Of course! Go ahead!
I hope you like them.

46
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,125
Kai picked 'em out.

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,250
It's a pair of
cycling sunglasses!

48
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,833
I needed some of these!
And they're cute, too!

49
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,916
I'll take really
good care of them.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
They look nice
on you. Very hip.

51
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,333
Where's Frau Bow?
It's been a long time.

52
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,875
Well, I doubt she'll show
up today. We've been talking

53
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,041
a little bit on Twipo
but I haven't really

54
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,416
seen her in the last
two or three months.

55
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,541
Hey, Doc, what's
that you're working on?

56
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,541
What does it look like to you?

57
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,541
Seems to be a dish antenna.

58
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,791
Four eyes and you're still
blind? It's a Vernier thruster.

59
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,500
Built it myself. It'll
attach to your Mark 2--

60
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,333
It most certainly will not! The
blueprints we have don't call

61
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,375
for GunBuild-2 to fly or jump!

62
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,791
Doesn't have to be for fancy
stuff like that. You can just

63
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,958
use it for fuel injection.
By the time I'm done,

64
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,458
it's gonna be loaded
with ten thrusters in all.

65
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,666
How many on the back? Six?

66
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,375
Heck no. Four in back.

67
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,166
We can also add
hover capabilities.

68
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,125
Like, "Hey, did you
just step on me?" Right?

69
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,416
And we can paint it
black and purple, too!

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,416
What in the world are the
two of you talking about?

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,166
Black Tri-Stars, of course.

72
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,291
Nonsense, in other words.

73
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,041
Y-Yeah! Total nonsense!
Doc, we are not gonna attach

74
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,041
any thrusters, ya got that?

75
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,750
Bah. You kids don't
know how to rock at all.

76
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,916
You've gotten too
spunky for your own good.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,708
You did just check
out of the hospital.

78
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,041
Well, what'd you guys
come here for, anyway?

79
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:28,041
Oh, yeah! I, uh, I
have a favor to ask you.

80
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,833
What is that thing?

81
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,500
It's a monopole. Do you
think you could use it to make

82
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,166
a high-tech
motor for the Mark 2?

83
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,125
All right! This
could get interesting.

84
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,416
I keep reading it, but
I still don't understand.

85
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,958
Messages. A robot
uprising and Project Atum.

86
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,166
Say that again?

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,166
I summarized it
in three phrases.

88
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,291
That doesn't make
me any less confused.

89
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,791
I mean, the idea of a robot
uprising is ridiculous.

90
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,208
Finally! There you are.

91
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,458
Yeah, what's up?

92
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,208
What were you looking at?

93
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,666
Oh....

94
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:29,000
It's nothing. So, did
Doc agree to do it, then?

95
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,875
Yeah. He's gonna look into
some stuff first, he said,

96
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,875
which just leaves us with
the motor control program.

97
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm counting on you to
persuade Frau Bow, 'kay?

98
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,666
You know the rules.
If you want something,

99
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,500
you have to beat me at KB.

100
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,250
I thought you might say that.

101
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,958
Nae's doing really well. She's
shot to the top two hundred

102
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,750
in the KILL-BALLAD
rankings. Impressive, huh?

103
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,333
Four months left until
the expo! We're gonna do it!

104
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,166
We will finish GunBuild-2!

105
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't forget that there's
a preliminary screening

106
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,666
next month. Will we
be ready for that?

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,375
I'll personally fill out the
entry form. It'll be perfect,

108
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,166
you'll see! And the theme'll
be "May Love and Justice bring

109
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,750
Peace for all Humankind!"
Well, what do ya think?

110
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,500
Sound like it's
from robot anime?

111
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,583
It sounds like nonsense.

112
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:26,416
Yes! Woo-hoo!

113
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,333
She can't say I didn't try.

114
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,458
Yashio? That you?

115
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,958
Yeah. You're not sounding
so good. Feeling okay?

116
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,916
I'm hungry. Need food.

117
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,750
You're in luck. I brought
provisions. Some yummy

118
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,166
Kagoshima sweet
potato-flavored Pocchy.

119
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,500
No! This is no time
to worry about food!

120
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,666
Just forget what
I said before, okay?

121
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,250
I-- I have a
favor to ask you.

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,250
Look, I need you, okay?

123
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,083
Uh, what kind of favor?

124
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,916
I-I'm not asking much, really.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,208
I just want to lick your
fingertips, that's all!

126
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,625
You're more perverted
than I thought.

127
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,750
No, it's not like that!
This is about human instinct!

128
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,375
Our fundamental identity!
All mammals do it!

129
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,750
Babies suck their
thumbs, you know?

130
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,125
Why do you think that is?

131
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:28,666
"Because he's a little
boy." Solo comedy, HY.

132
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,708
You seem to be in pretty high
spirits. What's going on?

133
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,916
Have there been
new developments with

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,375
the cheater stuff
or something?

135
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,750
No, no more info. My associates
Chuchu and Sumasa said

136
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,708
the police aren't taking
them seriously but--

137
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,791
But what?

138
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,708
About Kimijima
Report Number Four,

139
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,416
the one you
uncovered the other day.

140
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,125
Did you find something out?

141
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,583
I realized there was something
similar between the report's

142
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,958
content and the final episode
of GUNVARREL that was leaked.

143
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,833
Like what?

144
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,125
Like a password. A dark
past. Subliminal stuff.

145
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
You don't have to summarize
it in three phrases.

146
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,625
Feel free to give details.

147
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,666
I see what you're getting at.
You want to stretch out our

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,125
time together for
as long as possible!

149
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,541
All alone, just us two.
Our own little erotic game?

150
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,416
This would go faster if you'd
stop changing the subject.

151
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,166
I just had to look more
closely at the final episode.

152
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,375
It was only four minutes
and thirty-one seconds long

153
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,708
to begin with and the
editing was tera-rough.

154
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,958
But after analyzing it,
I discovered there were

155
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,375
cryptic images inserted in
nineteen spots throughout.

156
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,000
So, I isolated the
images, de-noised them,

157
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,958
and then adjusted their color
levels. That's when I found the

158
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,125
subliminal messages that
were hidden even deeper.

159
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,208
Here, this is an
example of what I mean.

160
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,166
It's not clear where it is,
but have a look in this area.

161
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,750
Okay, I see what you mean.
It looks like the letter B.

162
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,083
Correct! Lemme lick
your fingers now!

163
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,333
Hey, stay away from me,
you freaking pervert!

164
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,541
That was just one of them, as I
said, eighteen other pics were

165
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,916
hidden inside the subliminal
images embedded in the episode

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and every one of them
seems to be a photo of the

167
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,000
same abandoned building. All of
them have this in common, too.

168
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,875
Each one has a
letter drawn onto it.

169
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,500
Were you able to
arrange them in a way that

170
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,333
spells anything meaningful?

171
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,458
No, I wasn't. However-- 

172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,250
What's this?

173
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,833
The dark past.

174
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,000
A homepage that my mom
set up in high school.

175
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,166
She abandoned it
twenty-plus years ago.

176
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,000
Kinda hard to
believe it's still up.

177
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,583
It had comics my mom drew,
angsty poems she wrote,

178
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,250
and a message board
for contacting her.

179
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,708
Whoa, hold on a sec,

180
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,166
are you saying your mom
posted a message there?

181
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,833
Looks like it's dated
October 4th, twenty-fifteen.

182
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,125
Two weeks after GUNVARREL's
last broadcast was cancelled.

183
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,625
That's when it was posted.

184
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
What's at that address?
It needs a password.

185
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,375
"Yes!" "Those letters in
the pictures were actually

186
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,666
a password!" "Oh, my!
They were? Really?"

187
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,666
Solar storms hitting
and Project Atum.

188
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,583
Odd request. You're telling
me you wanna borrow a bow from

189
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,375
an old archery club member
and why exactly would that be?

190
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,916
Oh, you know how it is.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,208
Fine. Finish that bun and
I'll stop asking questions.

192
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,541
Although--

193
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,791
I would like some
reassurance that you're not

194
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,708
looking into those
Kimijima Reports again.

195
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,166
Kimijima Report Number
Five's flags are as follows.

196
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,583
Are you ready?

197
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,750
"Flag one, find and read
Kimijima Report Number Four."

198
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:59,208
Message from Gezi. This flag
has been successfully cleared.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,333
"Two. Go to the old
Tanegashima Airport runway.

200
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,333
Run from Point A to
Point B, as indicated,

201
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,041
in under five minutes."

202
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,416
I got creative and cleared
flag two by taking my moped.

203
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,291
"Three. Go to Nakatane Central
Sports Park. Complete a lap

204
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,333
around the track there
in under sixty seconds."

205
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,166
For flag three, I moved
from moped to bicycle.

206
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,333
"Four. Hit a bull's eye
on one of the targets at

207
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,166
Chuo Tanegashima High
School's archery range."

208
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,250
Good thing you never
said how far back from

209
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,291
the target I had to stand.

210
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,833
All right, Gezi, I've
cleared all the flags now.

211
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,875
And I'm here at the
school. You think this is

212
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,500
where the fifth
report is hidden?

213
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,125
Yes. Please retrieve
it as soon as possible.

214
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,916
That guy is so weird.

215
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,250
I looked. And finally,
I found the report

216
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,791
in front of the school.

217
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,666
Man, these things are always so
long and I don't get half of it.

218
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,208
I could reread this
a dozen times, Gezi.

219
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,208
Could you just
give me a summary?

220
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,583
It says that solar activity is
now at its peak. Because of

221
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,791
this, Earth's magnetosphere
has become unstable.

222
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,583
The Committee of Three
Hundred is attempting to

223
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,000
use this instability
to artificially induce

224
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,833
something akin to a
coronal mass ejection.

225
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,458
Are you telling me that
mankind will be destroyed?

226
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,333
Yes, that is correct.

227
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,875
Never thought I would say
it but I really think we should

228
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,041
go public with
this information.

229
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,250
Uh-oh.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,875
Great, more cleanup to do.

231
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,125
Yes, exactly! Just
like that! Good job, Jun!

232
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,875
Let's try that other
one now, okay? Superinpei!

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,916
This pad seems to be
acting up for some reason.

234
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,750
Hello, yes-- What's that?
An explosion?

235
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,166
Doc, we--

236
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,625
Hey, what's up, Robot Girl?

237
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,916
Well, we heard there
was some kind of explosion.

238
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,000
Ol' Goh told ya, did he?
That nosy, loud-mouthed jerk.

239
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,958
Please, Grandpa Fujita.
You're not fully recovered!

240
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,333
Y-You should really
be more careful.

241
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,958
Oh, um. I am sorry for
getting you all worried, Jun,

242
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,041
but this is the kinda thing
a man waits his whole life for

243
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,416
and you can't afford to
be timid if you're gonna go

244
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,875
messin' with something
like a monopole.

245
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,083
I was prepared to blow
up the whole island.

246
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,583
I have no regrets.

247
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,416
Then you might
consider getting some.

248
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,708
I didn't realize the monopole
was in danger of exploding.

249
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:20,208
For now, I went ahead and cut it
in half. All's still well, so--

250
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,833
What do you mean, "for now?"

251
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,041
Check it out.

252
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,625
Interesting.

253
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,041
Like monopole fillets.

254
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,208
How dangerous are they?
Can they be touched?

255
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,000
You'll get a little
jolt, but not enough to

256
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,333
get burned or anything.

257
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,416
We've truly entered
the realm of the unknown.

258
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,083
Don't have to get all
mystical about it, boy.

259
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,041
Doc.

260
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,666
I want you to give
it to us straight, okay?

261
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,833
Are these things safe
or safe enough, at least?

262
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,291
What do you think?
Can-- Can we use them?

263
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,208
That look in your eyes.
Just like your sister's.

264
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,583
R-Really?

265
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:04,000
Yep. You're a chip off
the same block, all right.

266
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,875
Now I'm fired up!

267
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,375
A text?

268
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,958
Sounds more like an
earthquake alert to me.

269
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,083
Neither. It's a solar storm.
It appears the Kanto region

270
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,000
has taken a direct hit.

271
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,375
Earlier today at approximately
4:30 p.m., the Kanto region

272
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,916
was hit by a
massive solar storm.

273
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,458
Hey.

274
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,958
I'm worried. Things
are going crazy in Tokyo.

275
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,583
You haven't been able
to get a hold of Misa?

276
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,791
No.

277
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,666
Complete blackout! Tokyo, said
to be a city that never sleeps,

278
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,625
is totally dark. Is that a
fire in one of the buildings?

279
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,291
It appears to be
a residential street.

280
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,291
Several homes have caught fire!

281
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,125
Dammit!

282
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,916
I'm thirsty, Genki.
I need a drink plz.

283
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,083
Don't let a little thing
like thirst get you down!

284
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,416
Keep your spirits high,

285
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
and I just know we'll
get through this together!

286
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,458
You're a big help.
Genki bot, mute on.

287
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,750
Absolutely! Enabling
mute! Talk to you later!

288
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,250
It appears the capital remains


289
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,250
in a state of
complete paralysis.


290
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,583
There are also reports
of robots malfunctioning--

291
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,708
Apparently, according to
witnesses, going berserk.

292
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,333
The government
is working quickly...

293
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,583
What a screwed-up
world we live in.

294
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,125
That's Kona.

295
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,125
A massive solar storm
in twenty fifteen disabled

296
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,125
electronic devices
everywhere, what is

297
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,291
commonly known
as the 2015 Crash.

298
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,208
Huh? Who's that?

299
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,833
It's Hanjuro Hattori.

300
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,708
Right, answer call.

301
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,041
H-Hanju! U OK, d00d?

302
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,416
You psycho! Quit this
crazy crap right now!

303
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,916
Taking over the RI robots'
OSes is way more than a prank!

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,916
Huh? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,833
Could you make
more sense, plz?

306
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,458
You've got robots going
nuts and attacking people,

307
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,291
and you want me to make
sense? Don't try to deny it!

308
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,041
You posted about it on Twipo.

309
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,083
I did? On Twipo?

310
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,000
"You know how all those robots
in Tokyo are malfunctioning

311
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,916
and attacking people? Yeah,
you got it, that's me."

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,041
No, I didn't do that.
I didn't post this.

313
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,000
Someone's hijacked my account.

314
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,916
Man, it's cold!

315
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,791
Kona?

316
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey, Kona, are you in here?

317
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,666
Oh, no, Kona!

318
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,041
You're alive!

319
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,208
It's being defiled. GUNVARREL.

320
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,916
Someone is defiling GUNVARREL.

321
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,875
You have to do something,
Yashio. Do something.

322
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,166
The solar storm
hits and before long,

323
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,500
robots are running
amuck through the city.

324
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,000
Desperate, Kai and
Frau turn to KILLBALLAD

325
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,125
in the hopes of
finding a solution.

326
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,500
The enemy seems invincible,
almost superhuman.

327
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:14,083
Robots everywhere are going
berserk. What can Kai do?

328
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,750
Will he be able
to turn the tables

329
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,416
when things spiral
out of control?

330
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,250
Episode 14.

331
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,750
Let's hit it off everybody!

332
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,208
Later days!
