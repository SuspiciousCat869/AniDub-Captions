1
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,958
Sounds like they're
heading your way this evening.

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,541
They're gonna be
spending the night there.

3
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,041
Oh.

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,875
You agreed to meet up with
them while they're there, right?

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,416
Have you called Aki?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,750
Come on, Misa.
She really misses you.

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,791
How hard would it be
for you to see her?

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,166
I mean, really. It's not like
you've got a man or anything.

9
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,500
Look, just call her, alright?
She's your kid sister.

10
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,958
Whoa! There are ads everywhere!

11
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,833
We're in Tokyo,
for sure. Oh hey, Mitchi?

12
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,583
That's "Mr. Nagafukada" to you.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,875
We'll check in first,
but afterwards,

14
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,708
can we go out for a bit?

15
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,791
Go out? Sure, why not?

16
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,500
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

17
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,708
Really?!

18
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,166
Yeah. You wanna know why?

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,583
'Cause we aren't gonna check in
anywhere in the first place.

20
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,250
No way.

21
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,250
Are we seriously gonna spend

22
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,333
the whole night
in this restaurant?

23
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,625
When you got no money,
you got no place to stay.

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,375
That's how it is.
Not a tip from me to you,

25
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,666
just the way o' the world.
You understand?

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,541
Could you be
more useless, Mitchi?

27
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,583
What?!

28
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,666
Hey. Let's get outta here.

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,791
It doesn't matter where
you play your game, right?

30
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,708
No, not up in the city.

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,625
The connection here's
better than on the island,

32
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,958
and there's almost no lag.

33
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,083
Makes the game
way more responsive.

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,958
Then come on.
Go with me to the BYC-DAM!

35
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you mean?

36
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,583
They have a
life-sized BYC-DAM here.

37
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,875
It's on display
in Hamakaze Park.

38
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,541
Well, too bad.

39
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,541
Okay, now watch this maneuver.

40
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,916
Forward, crouch button,
and punch.

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,541
Oh! GUNVAL Uppercut!

42
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,750
And then he can do
this little move, too.

43
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,125
That's amazing!

44
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,333
If I was going to operate it,
I wanted our robot to have

45
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,791
the same controls as KB.
Surprisingly enough,

46
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,458
FRAUKUJIRO,
the game's creator,

47
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,541
quickly agreed to help out
and sent the programming code.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,875
From there, it wasn't too hard.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,875
Despite all my doubts,
we actually pulled it off.

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,500
We managed to
finish Tanegashi Machine

51
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,333
and get it ready
to fight in just one week.

52
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,791
Wow. There are
so many lights in the city.

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,458
I can't see the stars at all.

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,916
Yeah, bummer.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,875
Huh?

56
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,833
But that's still easy to see.

57
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,958
Yeah.

58
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,958
She wouldn't still be at
work at this point, would she?

59
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,083
Well, it is pretty late.

60
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,208
Sister.

61
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,375
Not tonight.

62
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,375
We'll get in touch
with her tomorrow,

63
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,791
after the match is over.
The future of our club

64
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,791
hangs in the balance.
I need to focus on that.

65
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,541
Sure, okay.

66
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:03,000
Now, let's amp things up!
Tanegashi Accel Impact!

67
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,166
Here we go again.

68
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,541
What's up? Is something wrong?

69
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,583
No. It's nothing.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,541
The rules are very simple.
Knock your opponent

71
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,666
to the ground or out of the ring
three times to claim victory.

72
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,958
Your first battle is
against Devil Stronger.

73
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,791
I hope you're ready, Kai.
It was a finalist last time.

74
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,125
Hmm.

75
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,041
What kind of a response is that?
This'll be a tough opponent!

76
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,750
But if you do defeat him,
you're gonna be a hero!

77
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
What's the point
in even worrying about it?

78
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,333
It's all about
taking first place, right?

79
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,583
Nothing else matters.

80
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,666
I guess you can
look at it that way.

81
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:10,541
Ah, man. This is bad, It's even
worse than it was yesterday.

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,750
Chuo Tanegashima High School
to Ring Number 4, please.

83
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,041
Well. Sounds like
it's time for us to go.

84
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,583
Oh, hey, Aki.
Ya got any candy?

85
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,666
Oh, are you talking
about Space Candy?

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,583
Yeah, I think so.
Only one, though.

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,541
Here.

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,875
Mm. That's the stuff.

89
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Ugh, to each his own, I guess.

90
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,541
Well, let's go.
We have a fight to get to.

91
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,958
Okay!

92
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,791
Let's win this.

93
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,625
In the blue corner,
Chuo Tanegashima

94
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,541
High School Robot
Research Club's

95
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,208
Tanegashi Machine Advance!

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,208
And in the red corner, Shizuyama
Maekawa's Devil Stronger!

97
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,416
Surprise, surprise! A finalist
from the last tournament

98
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,291
has finally entered the ring!

99
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,833
ROBO-ONE doesn't
have different divisions?

100
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,000
Not anymore.
Don't worry, though.

101
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,041
It's just like he once said:

102
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,750
"I will tell you very
something important.

103
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,958
A unit's performance
is not solely determined

104
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,958
by its brute strength!" Eh?

105
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,416
Lemme get this straight.
What yer implyin' is that

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,416
yer boyfriend there is
a better operator than me?

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,625
It sounds like the little
lady's controlling you, boy,

108
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,083
and not just in the ring.
If you know what I mean.

109
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,708
Wha?!

110
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,541
It's okay, Aki.
Let this idiot babble.

111
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,833
You don't bother me, pal.
That kind of empty trash talk

112
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,000
is exactly what you expect
from a guy who's about to lose.

113
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,750
What're you saying?

114
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,833
I thought I was
pretty clear, actually.

115
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,833
Hmph. Think you're hot stuff?

116
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,541
I'll slaughter you!

117
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,791
Kai. Destroy him.

118
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,666
Huh?

119
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,166
Crush the jerk!
Justice shall prevail!

120
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,083
Ready. Fight!

121
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,166
Whoa, it's slow!
This should be a cinch!

122
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,125
GUNVAL Uppercut!

123
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,541
Oh! Devil Stronger is down!

124
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,416
What an unexpected turn!

125
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,000
Hey, Aki.

126
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,833
You think you could stop
shouting out the attack names?

127
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,583
Why?! Special moves
are meant to be shouted out!

128
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,708
Yeah, that was
just beginner's luck.

129
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,250
Don't get cocky, kid.
You're screwed.

130
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,125
No way! I can't believe it!

131
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,750
Yes, it's Devil Stronger's
"Double Lariat from Hell!"

132
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,208
Die!

133
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,541
Kai! He's doing
something major!

134
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,333
No big deal. He's got the
robot's upper body spinning

135
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,791
around like crazy. That makes
its lower body unstable.

136
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,458
Which means-

137
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,625
Got him!

138
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,625
No. No way!

139
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,750
That's the match!
Devil Stronger can't continue!

140
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,125
Tanegashi Machine Advance
has destroyed the competition!

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,666
A new ROBO-ONE hero
has been born, folks!

142
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,708
They have some
interesting moves, indeed.

143
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,208
What do they teach at
Chuo Tanegashima High School?

144
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,958
Isn't that your alma mater?

145
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,125
Yes.

146
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,708
It all happened
pretty fast after that.

147
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,875
We passed through
all the qualifying rounds

148
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,166
without a hitch,

149
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,250
and tore through the
championship rounds, too.

150
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,625
Before we knew it, we'd
made it to the final match.

151
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,208
Everyone was talking.

152
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,291
Implementing the KILL-BALLAD
control system was big news,

153
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,416
but not as big as the fact
that Aki was the sister of Misa,

154
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,375
a former ROBO-ONE champion.

155
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,708
Crazy. This almost feels
like a dream, doesn't it?

156
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,708
You're surprised?
You're the one who was so sure

157
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,458
we were gonna win.

158
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,375
Yeah, I know what I said,
but- Mr. Pleiades is amazing.

159
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,375
He already has two
tournament wins under his belt.

160
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
This isn't gonna be
an easy win.

161
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,625
Kai?

162
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,416
You, look rough.
You feeling okay?

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,125
Not exactly. I barely slept
at all yesterday, too.

164
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,208
What's with that
funny look on your face?

165
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,416
Oh, you gotta go?

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
The bathroom's just
down the hall a little.

167
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,416
You jerk!

168
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,708
Hey! What did I do now?

169
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,416
I'm sorry. I realize
this is all my fault.

170
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm the one who
dragged you into this.

171
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,041
Chuo Tanegashima High School.
You're needed onstage.

172
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,250
Yeah, okay. Let's go, then.

173
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,458
There's no point
in thinking about what

174
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,166
we could've done differently.
Ridiculous optimism, remember?

175
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,375
Don't lose that now.

176
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,791
Yeah, you're right.
We have made it this far,

177
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,125
all thanks to you, and we only
have to win one more time.

178
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,625
Then we can return home
with our heads held high!

179
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,375
You're always so confident.

180
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,375
I'm not sure if I'm
really feelin' it this time.

181
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,416
Yes huh!

182
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,458
Oh, all right.

183
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,208
I suppose I can
give it my best shot.

184
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,541
In the blue corner, Chuo
Tanegashima High School's

185
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,666
Tanegashi Machine Advance!

186
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,541
This team has shot
its way straight through

187
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,166
to the finals on the strength
of Misaki Senomiya's legacy

188
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,250
and a revolutionary
control system!

189
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,083
Can the Robot Research Club

190
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,083
recapture the glory
of eight years ago?

191
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,458
Man, big audience.
And they're so loud.

192
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,708
Everyone is really fired up.

193
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,625
In the red corner is
Mr. Pleiades' M45! Ready?

194
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
A mysterious comet
blazing onstage,

195
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,416
destroying everything
in its path!

196
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,166
No opponent in history
has ever escaped his clutches!

197
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
The two-time ROBO-ONE champion!

198
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,916
Mr. Pleiades!

199
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:49,541
Alcion... Electra...
Maia... Tiegeta...

200
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,083
Celaeno... Asterope... Merope.

201
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,125
By the blessing
of the Seven Goddesses.

202
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
I now make my advent
of four hundred light years.

203
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,166
I am...

204
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,958
Mr. Pleiades!

205
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,916
One minute! That's how
swiftly I shall end this.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ooh! Pleiades has
already claimed victory!

207
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,583
That guy looks, familiar.

208
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,916
Victory in one minute?!

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,958
You have to say
something back! Kai!

210
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,666
No need to shout, Senomiya.

211
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,833
Take it from me.
Keep your cool.

212
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,500
Mitchi...! When the heck
did you get here?

213
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,583
Snazzy costume, but, um-

214
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,875
You're actually
Subaru Hidaka, right?

215
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,541
 No. I am not.

216
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,000
Who is this "Subaru"?

217
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,083
What do you
think you're doing?!

218
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,125
Are you crazy?!

219
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,208
Please! It's just so obvious.
They sound exactly alike,

220
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,875
and "Pleiades" is another
word for "Subaru," right?

221
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,125
You think that
cold fish and Mr. Pleiades

222
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,750
are the same person?
There's no way!

223
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,041
That's why I'm surprised.
He's acting so different.

224
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,458
Hey, man, could you take off
your mask for a second?

225
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,625
Oh-ho! The Robot Research Club

226
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,291
comes back with a
challenge of their own!

227
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,250
Contestants, no more talking.

228
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,333
Prepare yourselves!
The final match of ROBO-ONE

229
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,083
will now begin! Ready.

230
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:17,750
Fight!

231
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,083
Time to assess the opponent.
Given its body type,

232
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,125
grabbing and throwing moves
are probably its specialties.

233
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,666
It'll wait for the enemy
to charge and then throw him.

234
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,333
That's bad manners
in fighting games,

235
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,083
and can ruin your reputation.

236
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,083
Ohh! M45's tackle connects.

237
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,541
Tanegashi Machine
is down! That's one!

238
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,875
What's wrong?

239
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,750
Listen to me, kid,
I get that you're rattled now,

240
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,500
but it's important
that you try to-

241
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,041
Hey, nobody
asked your opinion!

242
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,208
What did you say?!

243
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,333
What, do you want
me to say it louder?!

244
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,958
Keep your stupid mouth shut!

245
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,291
I can read his movements.
All I have to do is

246
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,833
hang in there
and look for my opening.

247
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,083
Once you get too close,
there's just no escaping it!

248
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,625
It's M45's patented
omni-directional attack!

249
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,541
There!

250
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:17,875
What?!

251
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,958
He evaded the omni-directional!
And to top it off,

252
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,958
he scored a knockdown!

253
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,416
Alright! That was
an incredible move, Kai!

254
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,875
I suppose your KILL-BALLAD
-style control system

255
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,916
does give you
some advantages. However.

256
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,708
This match is
just full of surprises!

257
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,666
The M45 extended its arm!

258
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,958
A secret trump card saved
expressly for the final round!

259
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,291
What else does Mr. Pleiades
have up his sleeve?

260
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,500
Projectile weapons, huh?
That's really cute.

261
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,208
Tanegashi Machine Advance
has two downs.

262
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,750
M45 has one down.

263
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,458
If the challenger is
knocked down one more time,

264
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,416
that's the end of the match!

265
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,583
Kai, look!

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Uh-oh, something has happened
to Tanegashi Machine Advance!

267
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,500
One of its legs
is malfunctioning!

268
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,333
Such a disappointment. Yashio.

269
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,166
It's happening!

270
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,291
I can see!

271
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,166
Unbelievable! Those were
what I call serious moves!

272
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,291
What was that new technique?

273
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,833
Tanegashi Accel Impact!

274
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,708
Okay! The move we just
witnessed has a name, folks!

275
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,500
Tanegashi Accel Impact!

276
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,500
Stay here and get me a
detailed report of the match.

277
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,791
And you, sir?

278
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,041
I'm going to pay the
committee a little visit.

279
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,833
You're in
charge while I'm gone.

280
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,166
Still obsessed with it, I see.

281
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,666
You keep on fighting,
even though you

282
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,500
don't have the "right stuff."

283
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
That final Tanegashi Accel
Impact did what it was

284
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,458
supposed to do. But it
propelled both competitors

285
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,250
out of the ring. So it counted
as a knockdown for us, too,

286
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,250
and victory slipped
through our fingers.

287
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,791
Frau! Is it really true?
Are you moving here?

288
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,458
Hey, Frau! Frau Koujiro!

289
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,166
Frau who?

290
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,458
Tell us, Frau. Why have you
concealed your identity?

291
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,208
As agreed, the Robot
Research Club is disbanded.

292
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,041
Please remove all of your
things from the club room.

293
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,708
Please, ma'am.

294
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,583
There is nothing more
to say on the matter.

295
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,958
Hey, Aki. If you had the
choice of gracefully accepting

296
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,250
a game-over or
using a continue cheat,

297
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,250
what would you choose?

298
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,958
Use the continue cheat.

299
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,000
I figured as much.
Although I didn't expect you

300
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
to answer that so quickly.

301
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,500
I heard my name, and-

302
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,291
The announcement worked!

303
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,666
I had the Broadcasting
Club call you here.

304
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,125
Perfect! Come on in.

305
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,416
Wha-What's going on?

306
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,208
Oh, it's nothing. I just
got a quick favor to ask you.

307
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,791
I looked all over
but I couldn't find any

308
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,166
that were the same,
so I made my own.

309
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,875
You called me here just
to look at some awesome--

310
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,875
I mean some
totally bizarre mask?

311
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,166
You wouldn't mind putting
it on for a sec, would you?

312
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,333
Huh? Forget about it!
I'm not into--

313
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,416
Come on, it looks good.

314
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,791
Get off! Back off man!

315
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,916
So, by the blessing
of the Seven Goddesses-

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,458
I now make my advent of
four hundred light years!

317
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,916
I am Mister Pleiades!

318
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
Oh no! No fair!

319
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,166
Once I donned the mask,
I couldn't help it!

320
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,583
No way.

321
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,166
You mean they're actually
the same person after all?

322
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,583
Yup and you know
what that means, right?

323
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,333
Chuo Tanegashima
really did win the tournament.

324
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,083
As agreed, the club
gets to stay intact.

325
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,375
Impossible.

326
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,625
No! I do not
bewong to dat cwub!

327
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,666
You look so impressive here,
I thought I'd give this

328
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,541
to the Newspaper Club
and let them know

329
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,625
that the ROBO-ONE champ
is none other than

330
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,208
our very own Subaru Hidaka.

331
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,750
Robot Research Club
will live on.

332
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,750
I just knew we would
do it somehow! Now.

333
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,708
Are you ready, men?
It's finally time for us

334
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,166
to get to work
on our real project!

335
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,250
I didn't agree to this.

336
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
If we're gonna have GunBuild-1
ready for the expo,

337
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,541
we're going to need help
from some professionals!

338
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,583
Pros? Like Doc?

339
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,583
Think bigger.
I mean real experts.

340
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,208
We've got some
right here on the island.

341
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,958
And it's time we got in touch!

342
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,416
No. You don't mean--

343
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,666
Yes! We are going to JAXA's
Tanegashima Space Center!

344
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,625
You gotta be kidding me.

345
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,083
Aki and friends
convince the school to let

346
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,208
the Robot Research Club remain
intact. They head to JAXA

347
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,583
to get GunBuild-1 up
and running again.

348
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,083
Unfortunately, they run
into some complications.

349
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,625
A father who likes
to play it safe,

350
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,375
and a prospective sponsor
who only cares about impact.

351
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,708
Meanwhile, a stranger
has moved to the island.

352
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:18,041
She speaks in Internet slang,
profanity, and lewd suggestions.

353
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,916
Just who in the
world is this girl?

354
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,791
Episode 4!

355
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,375
Let's hit it off, everybody!

356
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,750
Later days!
