1
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,541
You little idiot! What
the hell were you thinking?

2
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,625
Just take a look at what you've
done! Go ahead and look at it!

3
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,041
So many doubts still.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,708
Is this right? Do I really
belong here with them?

5
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,125
At the start of September,
the second school term began.

6
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,208
Forget about Kou Kimijima.
Stop poking around.

7
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,666
What do you mean "forget
about him?" Why should I?

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,333
Just do it. Do you understand?

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,208
Was that supposed
to be a warning?

10
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,541
It just makes me
even more curious.

11
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,250
But at the very least it
does confirm that Misa knows

12
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,083
something about Kimijima.

13
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,833
Kimijima Report Number
Four's flags are as follows.

14
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,958
"Flag one. Locate and read
Kimijima Report Number Three."

15
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,250
You have done this.

16
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,833
"Two. Locate photographs
of rocket launches taken from

17
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,375
the four specified
points on Tanegashima.

18
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,083
Upload them to IRUO."

19
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,208
"Three. Find a
matchlock gun, geotag it,

20
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,500
and test-fire at least once."

21
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,958
"Four. Go to the Robo
Clinic in Tanegashima.

22
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,875
Find Gojiro and activate it."

23
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,291
Activate it? What is "Gojiro?"

24
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,750
Well, if it's
at the Robo Clinic...

25
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,958
Attention! Today we
start building GunBuild-2

26
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
and this is our workspace!

27
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:54,083
Huh? Here? You mean, they're
letting us use this place?

28
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,375
Yes. I don't see any problem
with letting your club make use

29
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,791
of this room as long
as somebody supervises.

30
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,958
It would be a waste
to let it stay empty like this.

31
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,791
There's even a crane here.

32
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,375
Which means that this time
around, we can actually

33
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:13,458
build it standing up!
Isn't it so exciting?

34
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,166
You do realize we haven't even
decided on a drive system yet.

35
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,791
I wish there was a way we
could talk to Doc about that.

36
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:24,250
His advice would be
helpful. And the mono--

37
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,375
There are a lot of
things he could help with.

38
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,500
You are never going
to give up, are you?

39
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,791
When the final episode leaked,

40
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,750
it tarnished
GUNVARREL'S reputation.

41
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,791
It was like everybody just
forgot the true meaning of

42
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,250
the show. I think by
creating GunBuild-2,

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,000
we can repair some
of the damage it caused.

44
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,333
What's the matter, Jun?

45
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,833
Uh. One sec, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,916
Sure.

47
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,125
Hello? Oh, hi, Dad. Yeah.

48
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,041
I'm hanging out
with some friends.

49
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,583
What?

50
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,500
Well, hello. Are you
here to see a patient?

51
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:31,833
Huh? Oh, yes, I am. Mr. Fujita.
This is his room, right?

52
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm his granddaughter, you see.

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
Not here.

54
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:50,166
Get her. Get her
out of here now.

55
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,916
Jun! Doc okay? How'd he look?

56
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,916
I-- I didn't get to see him.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
What do you mean? Why not?

58
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,625
Yeah, are they not letting
him have any visitors?

59
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,708
Oh n-no.

60
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,958
He just didn't wanna see me.

61
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,791
What? You mean you saw Doc?

62
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,583
Well, yeah. I paid him
a get well visit yesterday.

63
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,708
What's the deal? He wouldn't
see Jun the day before,

64
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,291
but he'll see you?

65
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,208
So how'd it look
like he was doing?

66
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,250
Well, he seemed pretty
weak, to be honest.

67
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,166
Not just physically,
weak in spirit, too.

68
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,666
Wha-- How d'you mean?

69
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,833
I think I'll close the
shop when I'm outta here.

70
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,375
Time to call it quits.

71
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,000
That's awful!

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,416
This is a surprise. Don't
see you here too often.

73
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,708
You're not feeling down
on yourself 'cause you're

74
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,875
too scared to visit
the hospital, are you?

75
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,833
No, it isn't like that.

76
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,000
Grandpa Fujita and I were never
really that close to begin with.

77
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,500
Hmm. Then--

78
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,625
Anyway, I think it
might be time for me to

79
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,041
quit the Robot Research Club.

80
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,625
I was afraid you'd say
that. Yeah, well, I guess

81
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,875
it's your call. For now,
though, why don't we go inside?

82
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,875
Man, you can't keep
a secret, can you?

83
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,416
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

84
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,791
You're not poking
that nose of yours into

85
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,041
any more weird stuff, I hope.

86
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,000
Not me. Anyway, did you
get the info I asked you for?

87
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,958
First, you should know that Doc
used to be a NASDA engineer.

88
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,041
NASDA? You mean the
agency that turned into JAXA?

89
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,583
That's correct. And
that's not all, either.

90
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,625
When he opened the Robo
Clinic eighteen years ago,

91
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,500
it was meant for little kids.

92
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,166
Doc would make robots
and then line them up

93
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,208
in front of his shop.

94
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,833
I still remember it
like it was yesterday.

95
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,500
Back then he was
a very different man.

96
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,750
He always said robots were
built to be people's friends.

97
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,500
That's almost hard to believe.

98
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,041
So what happened to those
robots? Where are they?

99
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,750
Asleep, deep inside
the Robo Clinic.

100
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,875
How come?

101
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,500
Because there was an accident.

102
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:45,875
Oh, um, I have to--
Sorry, I have to go. Goodbye!

103
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,833
Jun, what's the matter?

104
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,958
Eleven years ago...

105
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,583
a robot toppled over and
injured one of the children.

106
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,083
That child was Doc's
granddaughter, Junna Daitoku.

107
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,791
Hello there! Nice to meet
you! My name is Yoshiro!

108
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,041
I'm a friendly robot.
Do you want to be friends?

109
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,583
Come on, friend.

110
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:22,541
Go away! You're not my friend!
You're not my friend at all!

111
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,458
Stop talking to me!

112
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,958
You idiot! What the
hell were you thinking?

113
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,833
Just look at what you've
done! Go on and look at it!

114
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,166
So that's why
Jun's afraid of robots.

115
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,791
What now? What d'we do?

116
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,125
I don't think
this is a good idea.

117
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,000
We heard all about Doc's
robots from back in the day.

118
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,958
We should restore them
to their former glory!

119
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,875
That's sure to
bring his spirits up!

120
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,666
Yeah, I don't know.

121
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,458
Doc's losing his will to fight.

122
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,708
You want him to
get better, don't you?

123
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,750
Of course, but
it's not that simple.

124
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,666
We get it, you're
terrified of robots.

125
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,291
Is that the reason you
want to quit the club, too?

126
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,875
What? She's quitting?
You didn't tell me that!

127
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,583
That was a secret, Yashio!

128
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,791
Why do you want to quit, Jun?

129
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,833
I-I only joined on a
whim in the first place.

130
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,541
It seemed like an okay
replacement for the karate club.

131
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,458
Even though I was bad
at karate, I kept doing it

132
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,875
because I liked it. But
when it comes to robots--

133
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,333
They really
scare you that much?

134
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,083
In that case.

135
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,250
I'm afraid I can't allow
you to drop out of the club!

136
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,458
Huh?

137
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,875
I'm not going to let you
go until you find something

138
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,458
you like about robots, and
that's all there is to it!

139
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,291
Now, come on! I'm giving you
an order, as your club leader!

140
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,791
Akiho, wait!

141
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,666
Think we'll still
be able to turn 'em on?

142
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
Ah!

143
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,291
Uh-oh.

144
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,500
What is it?

145
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,375
The cords,
they've all been cut.

146
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:39,000
So they didn't just die. Doc
killed all these robots himself.

147
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,625
Uh-- Where'd Yashio go?

148
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,541
He's inside, working
on the one called Gojiro.

149
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,541
He insists on being
the one to fix him.

150
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,083
Hooray! Hooray! Go Brother!

151
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,458
I'm getting this one fixed up

152
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,125
but would you
mind operating it, Jun?

153
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,625
Huh?

154
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,458
I don't know why, but I have
a feeling this is something

155
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,125
only you can do.
Say you will. Please.

156
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,250
There. It should
be good to go.

157
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,750
You're finished
already? Wow! Good job!

158
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,583
Now we just get some
power going to it, and--

159
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,416
What's this?

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
Hey, this looks like--

161
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,125
Hello. Nice t-- --eet you.

162
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,625
What was that?

163
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,500
My name is Yoshiro.
I'm a friendly robot.

164
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,458
Well, what d'ya think,
Kai? I was able to

165
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,541
get it talking
again. Nice, huh?

166
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,541
If you call that talking.

167
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
Come on, friend.
Let's shake hands now.

168
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,750
What's up?

169
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,708
I'm a friendly robot.

170
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,125
Hello there! Nice to
meet you! My name is Yoshiro!

171
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,041
It's the same one as before.

172
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm a friendly robot.

173
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,458
Aki, shut the robot off!

174
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,541
Huh?

175
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,083
Come on, friend.
Let's shake hands now.

176
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,291
Hurry! Do it!

177
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,416
You're not friendly!
You're not my friend!

178
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,375
Wait, Jun! Come back!

179
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,166
I guess we knew that's
where this was headed.

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,875
Alright. I gotta go.
I got some stuff to do.

181
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,875
Huh? Leaving at
a time like this?

182
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,916
But what do we do about Jun?

183
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
Well, the way we were
approaching it before

184
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,916
wasn't helping at all.

185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,666
"And if pushing doesn't
work, try pulling instead."

186
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,750
Wait a sec. Isn't that
an old proverb about love?

187
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,333
Crummy Girl, watch me!
How's my punch?

188
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,333
Hey. Hey. Hey.

189
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,791
Now, now, I asked you not
to call me that, didn't I?

190
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,958
My kick's way
better than his punch!

191
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,916
Hey, will you make
cookies for us again?

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,916
I'll bring some with
me next time, okay?

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
Really? Yay!

194
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,125
You seemed, I dunno,
different out there.

195
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,875
Yeah. I'm usually
more nervous.

196
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,625
So you're really
quitting the club?

197
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,458
Robots frighten me too
much. I just can't do it.

198
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,625
And as far as Grandpa goes,

199
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,666
he'll cheer up faster
without me around.

200
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,083
Actually, I think
you're the one Doc needs.

201
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,500
You can encourage him
like no one else can.

202
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,083
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I've been avoiding him

203
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,916
ever since the accident.
I'm sure he's still mad at me.

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,708
I'm afraid I'm not a
very good granddaughter.

205
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,000
You know the robots in the shop?
All of 'em had their cords cut.

206
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,666
Why do you think
he would do that?

207
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,083
Here, I found this
in the storeroom.

208
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,625
Think about it some
more before you decide.

209
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,708
It's like I always say,

210
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,041
"robots are built to
be people's friends."

211
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,666
Really? Then that means
I'm their friend, too!

212
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah!

213
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,750
My video of the
GunBuild-1 test?

214
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,375
If that's okay.

215
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,750
Here, all yours.

216
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,291
Oh great. Thank you.

217
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,125
How lame!

218
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,458
It's huge!

219
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,291
Yeah, huge and dumb-looking!

220
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,250
It's got weapons,
right? Where are they?

221
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:07,541
Nobody's scared. They all
seem to be having a good time.

222
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
Man, it's slow!

223
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,500
Can you even call that walking?

224
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
It's like I always say,

225
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,583
"robots are built to
be people's friends."

226
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,500
Doc blamed himself
for what happened.

227
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,583
He said he was being arrogant
for thinking like he did.

228
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,083
That all robots
were people's friends.

229
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,625
It's thinkin' you're always
to blame when something

230
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,875
goes wrong that's
arrogant, if ya ask me. Eh?

231
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,125
Just a tip from me to you.

232
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,833
Oh, you again.

233
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,333
We're worried about you,
Doc. You're looking frail.

234
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,541
Could you come with us
down to the Robo Clinic?

235
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,750
It shouldn't take very long.

236
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,958
I decided to shut that place
down. Shoulda done it years ago.

237
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,541
Place was never worth it.

238
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,041
You shouldn't say things like
that when you don't mean them!

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,625
You love the clinic,
and you know it!

240
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,333
I understand what you're going
through, but I love GUNVARREL,

241
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,833
so I'm gonna finish it,
no matter what! Please, Doc!

242
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,000
It's over. I'm
through with it.

243
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,416
I know you think that, but your
robots are waiting for you.

244
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,750
What did you do?
Don't tell me. You didn't!

245
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,916
It's exactly like it was right
after its grand opening.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,333
Idiots! How dare you!

247
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,000
Just come with us
and see for yourself.

248
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Then decide if we're idiots.

249
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,541
We got your doctor's
permission to take you.

250
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,500
How 'bout it?

251
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,041
No, don't. Stop this now!

252
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,458
It'll hurt her again.
She'll be so scared!

253
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:24,375
My fault, all my
fault. Because of me.

254
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,125
Jun got hurt because of me.

255
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,125
Yoshiro?

256
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,875
Hello there! Nice to meet
you! My name is Yoshiro!

257
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,166
I'm a friendly robot.
Do you want to be friends?

258
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,583
Come on, friend.
Let's shake hands now!

259
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,958
Please! Won't
you shake my hand?

260
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,916
Please, Mr. Fujita!

261
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:16,000
How-- How did you know my name?

262
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:20,500
Because somebody taught it to
him. Your granddaughter, Jun.

263
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,041
She taught Yoshiro
how to say your name.

264
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,083
My granddaughter?

265
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,375
Let's be friends again.
Okay, Grandpa Fujita?

266
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,125
Are you sure? Can
you really forgive me?

267
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,041
I'm the one who should apologize
for staying away for so long.

268
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,375
Sorry, Grandpa. I'm so sorry.

269
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,833
Honestly, they
still scare me some.

270
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,000
But I can learn to like
Yoshiro again, and all your

271
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:09,875
other little ones. You'll
see, I promise I can do it.

272
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:15,208
I'll try hard and I'm sure
we'll be friends but please,

273
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:20,208
you have to get better,
Grandpa! You will, won't you?

274
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,500
Thank you.

275
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,875
Hooray!

276
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,666
Well, we should get going now.

277
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,333
Get better soon. But
don't push yourself, okay?

278
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,875
I ain't so feeble I need
you brats to worry about me.

279
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,958
In this case I'll take your
grouchiness as a good sign.

280
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,250
Hey. You crazy kids
still workin' on

281
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,291
that giant robot of yours?

282
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,916
Of course we are!
We're determined as ever!

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Lemme take a look at
it when I get outta here.

284
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,125
I can tell ya if
it rocks or not.

285
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,875
The construction of
GunBuild-2 continues.

286
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,791
Meanwhile Kai
and Frau head out

287
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,125
in search of another
Kimijima Report.

288
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,083
Frau is also searching
for clues about her mother.

289
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,000
Director Minami Furugori may
have an important connection

290
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,250
to the final
episode of GUNVARREL.

291
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,583
Kai and Frau
uncover a new truth,

292
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:19,208
and a prophecy comes
true, rocking the world.

293
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,666
Episode 13.

294
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,541
Let's hit it off everybody!

295
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,208
Later days!
