1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,208
Predicting the weather.

2
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,666
Forecast for
Tanegashima and nearby areas.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,166
Skies will be cloudy.
Showers are likely

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,000
beginning in the afternoon,
and continuing on into tomorrow.

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:38,583
Airi thinks there's
going to be a storm today.

6
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,291
I don't get what's happening.

7
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,083
Any of it.

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,958
We're somewhere inside
the space center, aren't we?

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,750
But why here?

10
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,708
D-Do you wanna know
what happened to me?

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,791
I went out to get some food
from the convenience store

12
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,458
near my place, and,
and JAXA was there!

13
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,125
I don't have any idea where
they came from, or why.

14
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,041
Everything happened so fast,
it's all kind of fuzzy.

15
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,083
I'm assuming you
were shoved into a van

16
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,750
without explanation, like us.

17
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,125
P-Pretty much, yes.

18
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,666
Okay. I might know
what's going on here.

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,291
I've seen this
sort of thing before.

20
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,833
Hey, Chief, are you
doing a "Gendou Pose"?

21
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,625
Clever boy.

22
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,166
So, where have
you seen this before?

23
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,625
Oh. These abductions happen
all the time in robot anime!

24
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,083
If they follow the normal plot,
it means we've been chosen

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,041
to operate a robot of justice!

26
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,875
You really are full
of nonsense, you know that?

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,583
Uh. Hi.

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,666
You're behind this?!

29
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Hold on, I don't understand,
Dad! What's going on here?

30
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,583
Please. Allow me to explain.

31
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,375
My name is Nae Tennoji.
I am a member of

32
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,125
JAXA ARD's Innovative
Technology Research Center.

33
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,708
Nice to meet you.

34
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,583
And now for the reason
we've asked you here today.

35
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,875
Here it is!

36
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:07,500
Project name: "Let's build
a giant robot with JAXA!"

37
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,250
Huh?

38
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,750
You want us to work with
you on building a giant robot?

39
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,333
Yes, that's right.

40
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,500
The project's officially known
as the Research Support Project

41
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,541
for Technical
Innovation in Robotics.

42
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,458
Basically, we want to
lend what support we can

43
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,666
to people working
on large-scale robots.

44
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,333
Innovative roboticists
like yourselves, of course.

45
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,750
The goal is to have something to
show at next year's Tokyo Expo.

46
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,625
The expo?!

47
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,500
With that said,
our budget is relatively small.

48
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,625
Smaller than the
tears of a sparrow.

49
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,833
Unfortunately, we'll only be
able to support one project.

50
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:46,041
And while I was trying to decide
what to go with, I saw ROBO-ONE.

51
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,708
I was impressed. You really
held your own against

52
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,291
the famous Mr. Pleiades in the
final round of the tournament.

53
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,958
As it happens,
Mr. Pleiades has joined us.

54
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,291
Why can't you keep
your big mouf cwosed?

55
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,583
After the tournament,
I ran across the interview

56
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,916
you gave to the Kaiyomi Times.

57
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,500
You spoke so passionately
about your dream

58
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,166
to build a robot that was
more than ten meters tall.

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,250
I knew I'd found what
I was looking for!

60
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,541
And, at last, you're here.

61
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,625
I had no doubt all
kinds of organizations

62
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,583
and corporations had
already started courting you.

63
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,750
Because of that, I'm afraid I
went to rather extreme measures

64
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,875
to bring you here in secret.
I do regret that necessity.

65
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,166
You think that many people
would be interested in us?!

66
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,458
Don't you know flattery
when you hear it?

67
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,625
So can you be more specific

68
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,750
about the support
you're offering?

69
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,916
We'll provide
developmental funding.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,125
And, you'll have the
benefit of valuable advice

71
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,833
from our engineers
during the building process.

72
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,625
Hooooboy!

73
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,750
There's gotta be a catch. That
sounds way too good to be true.

74
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,416
Well, at this
point all I can really do

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
is ask you to trust me.

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,958
But something else to keep
in mind. If your completed

77
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,916
robot is well-received at
the expo, you might be asked

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,875
to develop other large-scale
robots in the future.

79
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,500
Together with JAXA, you can
build a robot of justice

80
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,541
that will kick all
kinds of bad-guy-butt!

81
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,833
Just like you've always wanted!
Well, what do you say?

82
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,958
Now you're making it
sound like a weapon.

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,750
I'm afraid I can't
condone that type of project.

84
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,541
I was just, um, exaggerating.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,708
I like the picture you're
painting! It sounds amazing!

86
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,958
Here we go; it's like
a dog with a bone.

87
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,375
Oh, really? Fantastic!

88
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,291
We had already planned on
entering the expo, anyway.

89
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,958
So why not partner up with
JAXA to do it? Okay, we're in!

90
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,416
That's incredible news!
Now, about the robot

91
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,750
you guys have already
begun constructing...

92
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,125
Do you think maybe
I could have a look at it?

93
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,416
Yes, absolutely!

94
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:01,750
Unbelievable. You actually
turned down support from JAXA.

95
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,541
I had to.

96
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,791
She wanted us to
put GunBuild-1 on hold

97
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,250
and start on a new robot.

98
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,500
Neat blueprints.
You drew these yourself, Sis?

99
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,875
Is it true? You're really
gonna make a GUNVARREL?!

100
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:27,625
That's the GunBuild Prototype
Mark 1. GunBuild-1 for short.

101
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,833
Completing GunBuild-1,
that's my dream.

102
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,416
But, making another
robot from scratch?

103
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
That's not even an option.

104
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,291
Are you sure, Akiho?

105
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,833
And you, Yashio? What do
you think about all this?

106
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,458
I don't really care.

107
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,916
You won't be getting much
help outta me either way.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,250
Come on, Kai! Are you
really gonna be like that?!

109
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,916
If you want me to help, all you
have to do is beat me at...

110
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
You jerk!

111
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,458
More nonsense!
Does it ever stop?

112
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,916
Stupid boys and their stupid...

113
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,333
Look at this weather.

114
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,291
I imagine you'll want to head
home before the storm hits.

115
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,958
Probably. You know,
I wonder, are you positive

116
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,041
that was the right decision?
Not telling Akiho that this was

117
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,416
all your idea to
begin with, I mean. Sir.

118
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,041
It would have been too
embarrassing to tell her.

119
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,375
I'm shocked by
how it turned out.

120
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,125
In a million years, I never
thought she'd reject the offer.

121
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,125
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,791
Not at all!

123
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,166
It was a really
nice thing to see.

124
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,625
A group of friends
getting together

125
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,083
to create something
they're passionate about.

126
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,000
I admire that kind
of drive and conviction.

127
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,750
So I'm not ready to
give up on them just yet.

128
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,791
Hey, Brother!
A typhoon is blowing in.

129
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, I noticed that.

130
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,500
Airi, tell me something.

131
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,708
What do you know about these
"Kagome, Kagome" phone calls

132
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,416
everyone has
been getting lately?

133
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,916
"Kagome, Kagome"? That's
a song, isn't it, Brother?

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,875
I'm talking about the
ringtone, here, not the song.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,291
Maybe Gezi knows
something about it.

136
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,208
Your access has
now been confirmed.

137
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,333
Switch to Gezi
mode was successful.

138
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,583
So all these
"Kagome, Kagome" phone calls.

139
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,500
Do you know anything about them?

140
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,375
They appear to have
occurred throughout Japan.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,041
And what about
the "Kimijima Reports"?

142
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,666
Is there a whole series of them?

143
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,833
Yes. They go up
to Report Number 7.

144
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,250
Whoa, that's more
than I would've guessed.

145
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,500
Do you have any idea
where the other ones are?

146
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,000
All the remaining reports?
Negative, I'm afraid that

147
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,625
neither Airi nor Gezi knows

148
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,125
where all of the
Kimijima Reports are hidden.

149
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,833
Okay, so, you do know
where some of them are, right?

150
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,750
Yes, Kimijima Report
Number 2 is known.

151
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,583
It is located in
the Uchugaoka Park area.

152
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,333
That puts it right around here.

153
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,291
Yes, but do not
bother searching for it.

154
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,708
The Kimijima Report
AR markers will not appear

155
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,375
on your IRUO
display at this time.

156
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,875
And why not?

157
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,541
Each Kimijima report
has flags attached to it,

158
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,625
conditions that must be met
in order to make it visible.

159
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,125
Conditions, huh?

160
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,666
So, I guess the
"Hidden Hand" password

161
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,625
isn't gonna cut it this time.

162
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,250
Hold on a minute.

163
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,958
Hey, Gezi. In what
year did Kou Kimijima die?

164
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,125
Two thousand and ten.

165
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,625
Did IRUO even exist back then?

166
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,166
An alpha was indeed in
development at that time.

167
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:11,791
Wow. So, Gezi, what are these
flags for making it visible?

168
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,000
Report Number Two flags.

169
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,125
File download
in progress. Please wait.

170
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,875
The requested file has
been successfully downloaded.

171
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,083
First flag: Find and read
Kimijima Report Number One.

172
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,166
Additionally, make contact
with Airi at least once.

173
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,708
Check!

174
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,666
Second flag: Press the green
button beneath the radar dome

175
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,125
located near the old folk museum

176
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,625
and then press it
again one hour later.

177
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,458
Third flag: Compete in
the Uchugaoka Park's

178
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,583
go-kart time
trial and achieve a time

179
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,583
below the
thirty second mark.

180
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,875
Then post and sign your
name on the IRUO geotag there.

181
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,291
Okay, on the fourth and
final flag: Earn a triple-S rank

182
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,708
while playing the arcade mode

183
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,833
of the "Golden Wolf
Fighter IV" fighting app.

184
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,083
Once you have succeeded,

185
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,083
upload your record to
the online leader board.

186
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,833
This is ridiculous!

187
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,083
Why do I have to jump
through all these hoops?!

188
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,500
Only my master knows that.

189
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,708
This is basically one big game.

190
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,125
'Kay, start with the radar dome.

191
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,625
Hey, there really
is a green button.

192
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,833
Whoa! What was that?!

193
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,666
Aw, man.
Why didn't I just go home?

194
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,583
Blast from the past.

195
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,916
Didn't know there
was an app version.

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,083
Everybody I knew was playing
this game about ten years ago.

197
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,041
Misa used to wipe the
floor with me when we played.

198
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,708
Got an hour. And since
I don't have anything

199
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,250
better to do to pass the time.

200
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,500
Send!

201
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,958
Oh heck yeah! Flag cleared!

202
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,541
It's been so long
since I played this;

203
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,458
it was actually pretty tough.

204
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,791
Crap, that's bad.

205
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
I believe Airi
warned you beforehand

206
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,750
of the typhoon's arrival.

207
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,250
Yeah, she did.
Don't blame her.

208
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,291
What the crap was that?

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,208
And what is that thing?

210
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,041
It looks like a
plate from the radar dome!

211
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,208
Typhoons have been
known to damage equipment.

212
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,750
Do you think it's
gonna survive the storm?

213
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,083
There is a risk of
damage to the structure.

214
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,416
And not only to the dome,
but to the antenna itself.

215
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,083
I believe that
opening the dome earlier

216
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,916
may not have been a good idea.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,625
By doing so,
you left it vulnerable

218
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,416
to the wind and the rain.

219
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,458
Great. You're blaming me now?

220
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,333
So? What'll happen
to the second flag

221
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,041
if the dome gets wrecked?

222
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,291
It is possible that you
will be unable to clear it.

223
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,708
Then what? Are you
saying I gotta find a way

224
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,666
to protect the
antenna from the storm?

225
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,166
Beginning shutdown
process for Gezi mode.

226
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,333
How bad is it? Is the tower
going to be okay, Brother?

227
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,125
That's the first thing
you're worried about?

228
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,875
Airi is very worried.

229
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,333
If the antenna breaks,
I'll have one less task to do.

230
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,500
Wait, what do you mean?

231
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,083
My master gave me
various tasks to do.

232
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,500
One of the tasks is to listen

233
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,916
and make sure the
"bee-bee-boo" sound plays

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,708
once every day, as scheduled.
And then, after it goes off,

235
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,333
I'm supposed to look for
anything out of the ordinary.

236
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,958
Really? Is that your job?

237
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,208
Yes. I've been doing
it for about ten years now,

238
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,666
but if something
happens to the tower,

239
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,583
that task won't be possible,

240
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,500
and Airi won't have
as much to do anymore.

241
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,791
Man, I really should've
kept my mouth shut.

242
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,458
That's one way
to wake up from a nap.

243
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,458
Hey, Aki! Do you have
any idea where Kai might be?

244
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,708
Wha?

245
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,916
Apparently he hasn't
come home yet today!

246
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,333
Why am I doing this?
I must be crazy!

247
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,166
Airi's just an AI.
Why should I care if some

248
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,083
overblown operating system
gets to keep her job or not...

249
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,375
Damn!

250
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,875
Thank you so very much
for doing that, Brother.

251
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,875
Now Airi can do the
job her master gave her.

252
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,333
You're hurt! Airi wishes
she could make you better,

253
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,625
but that's not
in her programming.

254
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:36,541
You seem to be
surprisingly calm about this.

255
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,625
Airi's sorry, but she can't
say when the storm will pass.

256
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,250
Airi only has access to
data that has been uploaded

257
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,958
to the IRUO system. So, even
though she wants to very much,

258
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,166
Airi can't comprehend
the pain you must be feeling.

259
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,125
Please, Brother,
you have to stay strong,

260
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,375
just for a little while longer!

261
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:07,166
Kai! Kai! Wake up! Kai!

262
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,166
Is that you, Aki?

263
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,708
Idiot! Why the heck
are you up on the tower?

264
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,208
Why are you here?

265
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,541
When you didn't
come home, I thought you

266
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,541
might be in the park,
so I came to look for you.

267
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,958
Then a girl named
Airi showed up on my IRUO.

268
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,625
She told me
something had happened,

269
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,583
that you needed help,
and I should come up here.

270
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,375
So, how are we
supposed to get down?

271
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:41,208
Huh? Uh, don't worry about it.

272
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,291
We've got plenty
of help down below.

273
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,625
Thank you for coming.

274
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,625
I guess I really
owe ya one now, don't I?

275
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,791
This is kinda like on
the Anemone. Just you and me.

276
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,458
I had to get checked out
at the hospital after that.

277
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,041
And then I spent the entire
afternoon today apologizing

278
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,041
to people for all
the trouble I'd caused.

279
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,125
And telling Aki all
about Airi and how we'd met.

280
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,541
And, as for the final flag.

281
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,083
The go-kart course
was long shut down,

282
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,000
but I solved that
problem easily enough

283
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,458
and cleared the flag by posting
a made-up time to the geotag.

284
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,291
And that's how I netted
Kimijima Report Number 2.

285
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,625
NASA was forced into
their scientific cover up

286
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,375
by a body known as the
Committee of Three Hundred,

287
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,375
a group that controls
the world from the shadows.

288
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,125
They are supporters of
the Human Cultivation Project.

289
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,625
The aims of this program are
to reduce the human population

290
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,583
to one billion people, and to
create a single world government

291
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,833
through the use of propaganda.

292
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,541
Pay heed to "Kagome, Kagome." 

293
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,958
This seemingly
innocent song is a symbol

294
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,583
to the Committee
and their followers.

295
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,083
You are certain
to come across it

296
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,875
wherever they are doing research
or conducting experiments

297
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,750
toward the
furtherance of their goals.

298
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,791
The Robot Research Club
members enjoy summer vacation

299
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,708
and take a break from their
work to attend a local festival.

300
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,250
Meanwhile, Frau asks Kai

301
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,875
if he knows anything
that might help her

302
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,000
learn more about what
happened to her mother.

303
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,958
A celebration, fireworks,
a summer night.

304
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,666
And then, at last,
GunBuild-1 is complete.

305
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,416
A crowd gathers as the
club members wait anxiously

306
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,041
to see how the robot built from

307
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,000
their dreams and
passion will perform.

308
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,625
Episode 9!

309
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,166
Let's hit it off, everybody!

310
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,166
Later days!
