1
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,583
We have now confirmed earlier
reports that Odaiba had been

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,083
submerged under water
were, in fact, incorrect.

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,375
Additionally, it is likely
that other news concerning

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,125
solar storm devastation in
cities around the world was

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,166
actually false information
being circulated online.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,500
Some recent
reports even claim

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,666
no solar storm
actually took place.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,166
The government is hurrying
to verify these assertions.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,125
Soon they'll
realize we're here.

10
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,833
Gather at the launch area. It's
time to abandon this position.

11
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,958
Prepare the rocket
for launch ASAP.

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,750
Just take the
damn stuff off, okay?

13
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,500
But it'll be naked.

14
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,583
We need to lose as
much weight as possible

15
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,125
to increase its speed!

16
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,208
Think of it in boxing terms.
We're cutting weight then


17
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,291
going for a dodge-dodge-counter
approach. Ya get it now?


18
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,083
Sit down.

19
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,500
Dad.

20
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,708
Are you really sure about this?

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,708
She did say Misa's
armed guerillas have

22
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,166
gathered their forces at JAXA.

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,791
Still, we need
to move cautiously.

24
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,000
And Airi's going with you?

25
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,250
Oh yeah. In fact,
she's kind of insisting.

26
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:03,000
I need to. I feel like
it might help jog my memory.

27
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,833
About what?

28
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,791
I don't know.
At least I don't yet.

29
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,666
So this it, the EGI System.

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,333
Yeah. It gives off EM waves.

31
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,000
I figure it might be
connected to this somehow.

32
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,791
Let's see, this looks
like the right button here.

33
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,625
I don't think
you should do that.

34
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,875
Why not?

35
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,833
Something I remember.

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,666
I don't know when, exactly, but
I'm sure I've seen this before.

37
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,500
It fits perfectly.

38
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,083
So now it can be
used to produce illusions?

39
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not entirely
sure, but Sawada said

40
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,541
this N-IV gizmo
should do something.

41
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,250
Looks like the
power's on. So what's that?

42
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,083
Its activation switch.

43
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,708
What is it? What's wrong?
Can you hear me? Kaito!

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,083
It's an attack. But why now?

45
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,041
This thing caused it?

46
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,166
Yeah, that's them all right. The
Kagoshima Prefectural Police.

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,875
Z-Z-Z-ZOMG, it's
the cops! But why?

48
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,375
We've been emailing and posting
about the JAXA situation.

49
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,041
It's taken a while 'cause
of the solar storm craziness,

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,208
but word must've
finally reached 'em.

51
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,041
Taro! Chesty!

52
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,166
I wonder. Maybe we won't need
to roll out GunBuild-1 anymore.

53
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,541
Why don't we just
rest here for a bit?

54
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,958
Stop right there.

55
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,625
I have my orders. My master has
instructed me to dispose of you.

56
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,125
That sounds like Gezi.

57
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,916
The roles I needed you to play
in Project Atum's development

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,083
and execution were only minor
ones, and now they're at an end.

59
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,208
It's time to take a
bow and disappear offstage.

60
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,250
But why? Why do you
want to kill all of us?

61
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,458
Well why else? Because I
want my experiment to succeed.

62
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,791
Okay, but why do you want
so badly for it to succeed?

63
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,541
What an odd question.

64
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,708
An experiment should
succeed for its own sake.

65
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,791
It's true, then. You
really are different now.

66
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,666
You're not the man I knew.

67
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,208
The old Kimijima was
obsessed with experiments, too,

68
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,291
but at least he was
human. He had feelings.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He was reluctant
to put me to sleep.

70
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,458
It was an important
experiment, but he hesitated.

71
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,125
He was worried for my sake.

72
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,750
You, you're not that man
anymore. You're cold now.

73
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,208
All you care about
is achieving your goal!

74
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,791
Indeed, you're right.

75
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,416
I suppose my programming does
come with certain limitations.

76
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
But, because of
those limitations,

77
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,916
I can achieve my
objectives far more reliably

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,083
than any human could
and without hesitation.

79
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,375
Proceed, Gezi.

80
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,958
Understood, master.

81
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,625
Well, later days.

82
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,250
They self-destructed?

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Explain yourself. What
is the meaning of all this?

84
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,875
Answer unknown.

85
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,791
It appears your
programming has been corrupted

86
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,208
by a serious error.
It's time to delete you.

87
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,083
Gezi.

88
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,208
Wait! You're the AI
version of Airi, right?

89
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,041
No. I am not Airi. I am Gezi.

90
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,208
You were awake
while I was sleeping.

91
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,041
You got to see what was
going on in the outside world.

92
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,125
Please tell me. What did
you see? What was it like?

93
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,041
Please, I want to know!

94
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,750
There was snow.

95
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,000
Huh?

96
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,375
Snow fell from the
sky. Airi saw it.

97
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,000
That's amazing! I've never
gotten to see snow before!

98
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,666
Tell me, was it pretty?

99
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:56,500
Yes. Very pretty. Very.

100
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,250
I'm so glad.

101
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:06,875
Yes, it was very pretty.
Later days Airi.

102
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:16,458
"Goodbye. So long.
I will see you later."

103
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:37,083
Goodbye, other me. I'm
so glad I got to meet you.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,208
To think such a simple act could
bring you back to yourself.

105
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
What are you
so worried about?

106
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,333
It was just an unmanned
reconnaissance helicopter.

107
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,916
That's basically
nothing compared to

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,625
the five billion people
you're about to kill.

109
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,875
No, I won't! I refuse!
I won't let you!

110
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,791
With Gezi out of commission,
you're my only remaining pawn.

111
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,041
I won't accept any more
accidents or excuses.

112
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,333
You're going to be
a good little puppet.

113
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you all for your
hard work! Because of you,

114
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,416
we've finally
been able to finish

115
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,958
the necessary modifications!
Give yourselves a hand!

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,750
Please don't start ranting
on about how it isn't "cool."

117
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,500
We really don't
have time for that.

118
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,250
I won't.

119
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,916
In fact, I think
it's really cool.

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,916
You, do?

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Everybody on the island
put this robot together.

122
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,833
How could it
possibly be uncool?

123
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,000
This isn't GunBuild-1 anymore.

124
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,416
What is it then?

125
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I call it... Super GunBuild-1!

126
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,041
Uh, that's ultra-corny.

127
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,500
No, it's a classic-style name!

128
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,125
Hey, Akiho.

129
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,333
Dad, it's you! You're alive!

130
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,041
I'm sorry for worrying you.

131
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,583
You're all right, though?
You're not hurt or anything?

132
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,791
Of course, sweetie, I'm okay.

133
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,500
What about Sis?
You saw her? How is she?

134
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:35,125
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt,
Akiho. There's one more thing.

135
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,708
It's about Yashio.

136
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,000
Kai!

137
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,416
He's already been
examined by a doctor.

138
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,166
He's not in danger of dying
but it sounds like his heart

139
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,750
was under a lot of stress,
more than it could take.

140
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,000
He needs to stay
put and get some rest.

141
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,041
What's wrong with his heart?

142
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,458
I am so sorry.

143
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,500
Me, too. I feel
like this is my fault.

144
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,625
Is there any more news yet
regarding the rocket launch?

145
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,291
No. We haven't
heard much so far.

146
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,583
Well. That gives us time to
talk, then. A little, anyway.

147
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,541
Yeah.

148
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
Judging from where
the helicopter crashed,

149
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,708
the missiles the
SUMERAGI is equipped with

150
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,541
have an approximate
range of twenty kilometers.

151
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,541
This is the SUMERAGI's current
location. So it's range is--

152
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,875
If that's true, there's no
way we can get close to it!

153
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,250
And that's where the program we
got from Mr. Sawada comes in.

154
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,291
It's called DG two nine seven.
It sounds complicated, I know.

155
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,166
But we've learned that
installing this will let us

156
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,750
construct a system that
Kimijima can't control online.

157
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,083
So, you want us to delete
IRUO and use this instead.

158
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,500
That's right. We think it might
also be possible to use its

159
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,708
"AR decoy" functionality in
order to disrupt the missiles.

160
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,083
But there's more.
Aren't you working on some

161
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,208
additional program to totally
own and delete Kimijima?

162
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,541
We are. But there's
no guarantee that

163
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,416
either of these
is going to work.

164
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
Even with the programs
we'll still need to

165
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,166
pilot GunBuild-1
with precise control.

166
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,625
Can Yashio do it?
Is he well enough yet?

167
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,208
The doctor says he
has to stay in bed.

168
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,000
We'll just have to
choose a different operator.

169
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,250
Chief, is that all right?

170
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,875
I figured as much.

171
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,916
I'm not sure why, but I
had an idea this is what

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you guys would
be talking about.

173
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,500
Kai!

174
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,208
I'll do it.

175
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,083
But you're sick!

176
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,291
If there's any reason
to get fired up, this is it.

177
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,125
Kai!

178
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,000
I hate to say it,
but you're in no condition

179
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,750
to act as pilot now.

180
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not like this is
one of your fighting games--

181
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,458
Do you think I don't know that?

182
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,333
Of course.

183
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,500
I'll have to pilot well enough
to dodge the SUMERAGI's attacks

184
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,500
while hitting it
with pile bunkers.

185
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,500
It'll be harder than any game.

186
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,291
Not even I'd be
able to do it normally.

187
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:15,250
Wait. What do you mean by
that? Are you saying you'll...

188
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,958
Yeah. You got it. I have
a cheat move only I can use.

189
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,291
What are you talking about?

190
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,333
Well, you see, I get
these "attacks" sometimes.

191
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,500
They make a single second feel
like it's many times longer.

192
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,625
I call it Slow-Motion.

193
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,875
Wait. You don't mean you'd--

194
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,041
As I recently discovered,

195
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,000
this device can cause
the attacks on demand.

196
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,083
So if I use it,
I'll be able to anticipate

197
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,041
all the SUMERAGI's moves.

198
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,541
Which means it has to be m--

199
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,958
No, you can't!

200
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,750
You heard what
the doctors said.

201
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,125
Your heart's already under
way more stress than normal.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,583
So what? That's how it always
is when I have an attack.

203
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,416
That's not true. You
know as well as I do that

204
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,125
this one was way worse
than your normal attacks.

205
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,750
That thing, that device
must be incredibly powerful.

206
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,291
Yeah, maybe, but it
could be our best shot.

207
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,250
Don't you realize
that you might die?

208
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,208
This is serious, Kai!

209
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,000
What if you do it and
it ends up killing you?

210
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,375
Wait, come back!

211
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:32,125
I just received word.
The rocket's left the VAB,

212
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,458
it's headed for
the launch point.

213
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,500
Launch in X
minus 7 to 8 hours.

214
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,791
I thought I
might find you here.

215
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,750
Hey, ya know when
Misa first left the island

216
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,666
all those years ago, she
told me to look after you.

217
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,500
Yes. I know.

218
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,250
Oh, you do? Well, too
bad I never did anything

219
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,208
but play video games, huh?

220
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,291
No.

221
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,750
No. That's not true.

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,875
Mizuka said something to me one
time. That it was because of you

223
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,791
that the passion fruit
buns were a big seller.

224
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:22,000
She said that you were always
pushing yourself for my sake.

225
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,041
Sure, you'd say mean
things, you'd brush me off,

226
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,125
and it never seemed like you
cared about the club at all.

227
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,916
But when it really mattered,
you were always there for me.

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
You never gave up on the club.

229
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,791
You've done more than
enough. You've done so much

230
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,041
for me already.
Please don't do this, too.

231
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,666
Nope, sorry.
It's not enough.

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,166
There's one more thing,
I swore to myself I would

233
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,833
find a way to
reunite you with Misa.

234
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,875
That's what I worked so
hard for. I won't stop now.

235
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,333
That's why if I
wind up in trouble,

236
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,375
I need you to press this.

237
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,000
Whatever else happens, I want
to make sure you see Misa again.

238
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,625
I don't know.

239
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,875
Please take it.

240
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,083
Please, Aki.

241
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,416
Promise me something,
though. Promise you won't die.

242
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,000
I promise.

243
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,458
No, that's not good enough! I
want you to say the whole thing!

244
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,583
Fine. I promise not to die.

245
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,083
You better not, okay?

246
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,291
Hey, Kai.

247
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,500
Listen. When this is all over,

248
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,375
there's something
I want to tell you.

249
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,583
What?

250
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,291
Well, it's just that I--.
Uh, never mind.

251
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't want to jinx things
with a "death flag," do I?

252
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:10,541
So, uh, listen,
Aki, I like you.

253
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,291
Huh?

254
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
I'm sorry,
did you not hear me?

255
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,041
No, I heard you fine!
Loud and clear!

256
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,166
But the way you
said it, I dunno.

257
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,541
Yeah, well. There's really
no other way to put it.

258
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,791
But it's just like,
well, it's like, you know.

259
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,166
I just mean, I, um.

260
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,041
Hey, uh, Aki.

261
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,375
What is it?

262
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,916
Could you maybe, uh, tell
me what you're thinking?

263
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,416
It's like, you know, are
you really sure about me?

264
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,750
What do you mean?

265
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,375
Well! It's just, you
know, there are other girls,

266
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:51,416
like Frau-Bow, or Nae,
or even my sister.

267
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,166
Why would you choose those
particular names to bring up?

268
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,333
I dunno, why do
you think? Ugh! Ah!

269
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,416
This is all just
so sudden! You jerk!

270
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,458
Oh, really? Maybe I shouldn't
have tried so hard to keep it

271
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,500
to myself all this time, then.

272
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,166
Huh?

273
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,583
So, Aki, got any candy?

274
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,791
Thanks a lot.

275
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,375
Do you think I could have one
more thing... for good luck?

276
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,333
A kiss?

277
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,083
Huh?

278
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,625
Or not.

279
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,500
Yes, okay. Just for good luck.

280
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,916
Kinda tasted like melon.

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,083
That makes sense, I did
have a melon soda earlier.

282
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,041
Take care of my sister.

283
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,625
You will, won't you?

284
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:25,958
Real-lifers! FOAD!

285
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,625
That was unexpected,
and watching it

286
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,791
was pretty awkward, huh?

287
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,916
Hey! Hold on a sec! Did
you have feelings for Akiho?

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,791
Me? What, are you cwazy?

289
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,625
Actually, harboring
secret feelings for Yashio

290
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,583
would be even better, plzkthx!

291
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,458
Oh, come on!
That's just ridiculous.

292
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,750
We all know that you're
the one who liked Yashio!

293
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,125
Say what?

294
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,750
All right! It's time
to huddle up, everybody!

295
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, this is it.
This is a fight we will win!

296
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,000
With our dreams and our
friendship. All together now!

297
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,500
Robot Research Club.

298
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,583
It's time for a Spirit Blast!

299
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,958
Let's hit it off!

300
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,416
Someone said
it was a battle to

301
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,000
save the world
from a cruel fate.

302
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,500
Someone said all hope
for the future of humankind

303
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,625
rested squarely
on our shoulders.

304
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,833
Counting down!
Three, two, one. Lift off!

305
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,000
But I don't care
about any of that stuff.

306
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,083
That's not why I'm here.

307
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,708
Okay, we've loaded
the laser thingy.

308
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,791
Wait, I mean, the
laser turret, right?

309
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,875
I mean it's in
the Thunder Emperor!

310
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,916
System link. Online.

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,458
Okay, Kai, connect
the PhoneDroid pad.

312
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,250
It's the red cable.

313
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,291
The perimeter
map is loading now.

314
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,458
Three meters.

315
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,208
Left and right
laser scanners. All green!

316
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,166
Ten, fifteen, twenty.
Maximum range!

317
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,708
Okay. Topographical
assessment AI ready.

318
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,833
All checks complete. Kai, we're
going into this unrehearsed.

319
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,416
Well, we always knew that was
how it was going to be, right?

320
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,458
We've already come this far,
no sense backing down now.

321
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,958
Thank you.

322
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:15,375
Status report! We're all green!
This is the final call. Go!

323
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,791
GUNVARREL!

324
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,083
Forward!

325
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,375
Kai and the gang prepare to
face Misaki and her cohorts.

326
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,166
They're hit by a
barrage of missiles

327
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,708
and an unexpected
attack by SUMARAGI.

328
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,416
Despite it all,
GunBuild rises.

329
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,375
The Robot Research Club
has fought for this moment.

330
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,958
Everyone's dreams hinge
upon their success or failure.

331
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,666
What will happen in the battle
for the very fate of human kind?

332
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,333
Episode 22.

333
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,875
Let's hit it off everybody!

334
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,541
Later days!
