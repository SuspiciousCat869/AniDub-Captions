1
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,666
Genki! Stay away!

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,500
I'll save you, Rozetta!

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,750
Well, Kona. What do you
think? This scene is thrilling,

4
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,250
isn't it? I know it
sounds kind of sappy,

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,458
but GUNVARREL's
themes are timeless.

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,416
It's about love and courage.

7
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,958
Kona, can you hear me?

8
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,416
Thank goodness!
You had me scared.

9
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,666
Yashio.

10
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,875
With prospects for power
restoration to the metropolitan

11
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,916
area still uncertain,
chaos continues downtown.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,333
Meanwhile, there have been
reports of service robots

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,125
becoming violent
toward humans.

14
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,625
Man, robots becoming
violent? That's a good one.

15
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,125
Here, have some.

16
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,958
T-- TY.

17
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,500
Were you seriously
planning to kill yourself?

18
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,083
Well, the original plan
was to slit my wrists.

19
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,958
But I was already so hungry
and weak and exhausted.

20
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,750
I started to think
I'd die right there

21
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,291
in the water whether
I did it or not.

22
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,250
So, the whole "I took over
some robots and made them

23
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,750
go berserk" thing. Wanna
tell me about that?

24
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,416
No! I-- I didn't do
it! Somebody set me up.

25
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,625
You okay?

26
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,250
Someone claiming to be me took
over the robot OS on RI's server

27
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,458
and then decided to
start bragging about it.

28
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:48,791
RI stands for-- These guys,
huh? Roboratory Industry, Inc.

29
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,041
Yeah. They're
ranked third in the

30
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,416
domestic service robot market.
They use a cloud system,

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,250
which means that if their
server is compromised all the

32
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,125
robots they've distributed
will go out of control.

33
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,708
A-And, BTW, TIL that server
can't be accessed from

34
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,791
anywhere outside
the system anymore.

35
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,500
It's like a lock
placed by the hacker as

36
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,125
a sort of insurance policy.

37
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,500
What do you mean?

38
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,791
I-- It'll make sense
when you see it.

39
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,125
This is the RI server here.

40
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,000
If you try to enter
the OS part, then.

41
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,250
That's KILL-BALLAD!

42
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,250
Yeah. Some bastard has
blocked access to this part of

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,416
the server using KILL-BALLAD.
S-- So in other words,

44
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,250
beating this CPU opponent
in a KILL-BALLAD match...

45
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,958
...is the only way
to stop the hacker

46
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,500
and get the robots
back under control.

47
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:45,000
GUNVARREL's being defiled
by this POS. How could they?

48
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,666
Not GUNVARREL.
My mom's GUNVARREL.

49
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,166
All I have left. What do I do?

50
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,708
All we have to do
is win one match?

51
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,833
I'll play their game
and beat them at it!

52
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,041
Do you see something out there?

53
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,750
Fires in the Shinjuku area.

54
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,541
Initiating a robot uprising
and plunging the world into

55
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,916
total chaos. That's the
objective of Project Mars.

56
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,666
This is nothing more
than a simple practice run.

57
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,333
Is the analysis of the final
GUNVARREL episode complete?

58
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,000
The original source of the
leak remains unknown to us

59
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,250
but a thorough
analysis of the episode

60
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,125
revealed propaganda
images and the melody.

61
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,333
I'm not surprised. There's
no reason to be, really.

62
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,125
After all, Project
Mars was already

63
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,000
in the works
by twenty-fifteen.

64
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,500
Right.

65
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,625
However, while almost all
of the show's production staff

66
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,750
remained in a brainwashed
state at the time.

67
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,916
Minami Kogori's
brainwashing came undone.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,666
Even as her colleagues
were about to kill her,

69
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,083
she managed to
seal the film away.

70
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,500
Kou Kimijima's death occurred
in two-thousand and-ten

71
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,791
and the film was
made in twenty-fifteen.

72
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:17,291
So I guess that's that. There's
no connection between them.

73
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:50,125
Argh! Stupid! Argh!

74
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,250
It's late. Don't you
need to go home soon?

75
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,166
No, it's okay.
I told my folks I was

76
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,708
spending the
night at a friends.

77
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,458
Oh, yeah? That's tera-hot.

78
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,291
Your very first
sleepover with glasses boy!

79
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,291
So, what's the news on Tokyo?

80
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,083
Has anything new
been happening?

81
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,166
It appears that restoration
has begun in some places.

82
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,750
The online user count is
climbing again after dropping

83
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,583
due to the outages. Twipo
posts are also rising in number.

84
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,000
We better hurry.
The cops might show up.

85
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,583
Well, I hope they
don't come too soon.

86
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,000
We still haven't tried
everything in our arsenal yet.

87
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,958
Wait, what arsenal?
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,541
I'm gonna use Slow-Motion.

89
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,000
But-- But you said you
have no control over it,

90
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,875
that you can't
use it on demand.

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,375
It should kick in if I push
myself to my absolute limit.

92
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,083
I'm gonna go run around.

93
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,708
I don't understand. Why
would you go to such lengths?

94
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:56,208
You said these attacks are
excruciating. Is it for my sake?

95
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,791
No, I'm not doing it for you.

96
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,541
I just want to beat this
damn cheater at his own game.

97
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,208
I'm ranked second in the
world. My pride is on the line.

98
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,500
Wow, what a
fighting game freak.

99
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,791
What you were
supposed to say is,

100
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,166
"Of course I'm doing
it for you!" WTF.

101
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,166
But, you know, whatever.

102
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,625
Cold!

103
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,666
How indecent!

104
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,083
Indecent, indeed.

105
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,833
I don't need an
audience, thank you.

106
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,791
Please do not worry.
Because we are indoors,

107
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,000
Gezi cannot see you in
your current state of undress.

108
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,958
You can use your
imagination, though!

109
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,708
R U OK, d00d?
You look like you're about

110
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,916
two seconds away
from keeling over.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,125
I'm definitely not okay. I
don't feel Slow-Motion kicking

112
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,333
in at all yet. What about you?
Any new information? Any leads?

113
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:03,375
No, nothing. But I will figure
out who's doing this. OWOA.

114
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
There is a surefire
method for defeating even

115
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,041
the most iron-clad
security systems.

116
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,750
Give details plz! Kthx!

117
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,291
Become close with the person who
created said security system.

118
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,083
Then you simply ask them
to give you the password.

119
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,291
That never
occurred to me, TBH.

120
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,083
Huh? I'm sorry but what
are you talking about?

121
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,708
I think I would know if
he'd slept over at my house.

122
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,333
But where else
would he have gone?

123
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,958
When I went over to
see him this morning,

124
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,416
Kai's mom told me he'd stayed
the night at a friend's place.

125
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,041
Well, I'm not his friend,
so there you have it.

126
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,625
He's probably over
at Furugori's place.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,875
Didn't you think
to check Twipo?

128
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,541
Impossible. I
just can't beat it.

129
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,041
N-No way!

130
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,666
Awesome. What's wrong now?

131
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,166
The person who framed me as
the hacker. I know who it is.

132
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,041
What-- What Gezi said about
passwords got me thinking.

133
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,208
It is possible somebody could
know my Twipo account info.

134
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,125
Especially if it's
someone in my circle.

135
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,083
Are you talking about the group
you developed KILL-BALLAD with?

136
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,416
Yeah. All the members
checked in after the blackout

137
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,166
and robot malfunction to
report that they were okay.

138
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,291
All of them
except for Maguyan.

139
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,375
You try getting in
touch with him yourself?

140
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,333
That's what I'm doing now.

141
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,791
He picked up.

142
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
Maguyan.

143
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,333
Yeah. Hey there, Frau.
Thought I'd hear from you.

144
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,166
If you're calling me,
I guess you've figured it out.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,541
I don't understand.
Why would you do this?

146
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,666
My wife and kid were
taken hostage. I had to do

147
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,166
what they said. They threatened
to kill them unless I did.

148
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,041
Do what who said?
Who was threatening you?

149
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,208
I can't say. My family's
lives will be in danger if

150
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,875
I talk about them. I've been
blackmailed, yes, blackmailed,

151
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
and that's why
I was helping them.

152
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,541
These guys who threatened you
and kidnapped your family...

153
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,416
Why did they want to
sabotage all those robots?

154
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,791
Apparently,
their ultimate target

155
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,750
was Tokyo's ministry offices.

156
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,875
Did these people
mention my mom?

157
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,458
Sorry, but that's really all
I know. I think it is, anyway.

158
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,916
You liar! I know
you know something!

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,625
Tell me what happened
to my mom, you scum!

160
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:26,250
Tell me where she
is! Please tell me.

161
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,666
Maguyan, there's one more
thing I'm curious about.

162
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,083
You said that you
have a wife and kid.

163
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,833
But at our offline meeting six
months ago. You said that you

164
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,708
were still a virgin. You
said that the only girls that

165
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,708
you ever liked
were the 2D ones. So.

166
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,708
When did you get married?

167
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,250
When did you have a kid?

168
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,666
Oh I, uh, well.
Yeah, I have a wife.

169
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,916
And my kid,
her name is Haruka.

170
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,416
Wait, Haruka's the heroine's
name in "Magical Girl M'lady."

171
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,250
Huh? I--

172
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,833
I just don't know.

173
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,958
He's really out of it.
Wait, could this be--

174
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,750
Is he... brainwashed?

175
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,250
Uh anyways, that's what's
going on. Real sorry, Frau.

176
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,958
Now that my part's
over, I'm headed to

177
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,500
the Philippines, you see.

178
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,791
They say I'll be reunited with
my family once I get there.

179
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,875
Sorry again. Goodbye.

180
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,541
I should've known better than
to let myself trust anyone.

181
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,250
I should have acted like a real
shut-in and avoided everyone

182
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
completely all the time.

183
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,625
Forever alone, that's me.

184
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah, beatin' yourself
up like that's the

185
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,541
easy thing to
do right now, huh?

186
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,083
What's your point?

187
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,875
Aki's not here, so I'll say
it for her. You're a member of

188
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,666
the Robot Research Club
now and, besides that,

189
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,583
you're our friend. Accept
it. Do yourself a favor

190
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,166
and stop acting like
you're all alone in the world.

191
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,041
Well, I--

192
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,666
Here, check it out.

193
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,375
I want to help. Is
there anything I can do?

194
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,416
There's no doubt in my mind
you're gonna get through this!

195
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,250
I'll even send you
all my power! Power!

196
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,375
I'll pick up some food and
bring it to you, so let me in

197
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,541
when I ring
the bell, all right?

198
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,416
Let's skip the usual
password nonsense, please.

199
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,458
Do you even know why I became
a shut-in to begin with?

200
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,458
Uh. 'Cause you're
not good with people?

201
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,625
The correct answer
is to make KILL-BALLAD.

202
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh.

203
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,458
My mom had just disappeared
and GUNVARREL had ended

204
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,375
without a real ending.
I was worried people would

205
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,083
lose interest in it altogether.

206
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,500
If everybody forgot
about GUNVARREL,

207
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,125
my mom would end
up forgotten, too.

208
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,791
So, I decided I would
make a fighting game

209
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,541
based on GUNVARREL.

210
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,708
I even stopped going
to school to work on it.

211
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,791
I did it for my mom.
For GUNVARREL himself.

212
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,916
Do you... like KILL-BALLAD?

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,833
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's
a really well-made game.

214
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,750
Thx.

215
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,666
Huh?

216
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,500
TY.

217
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,666
I'm sorry, what?

218
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,041
TVM.

219
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,625
Nope. Can't hear you.

220
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,375
Th-Thank you.

221
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,208
Hey!

222
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:50,666
I'm happy you like the game.
And that you like me.

223
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,833
So, are you feeling
turned on yet?

224
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,666
No, I guess I don't
have any strength left.

225
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,750
Please, Yashio. Let's
stay like this for a bit.

226
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,625
There are things
I need to say.

227
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,666
GUNVARREL is important
to me. More important than

228
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,708
you can imagine. It's what
my mom left behind for me

229
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:20,833
and it's filled with memories of
her. I couldn't bear to lose it.

230
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,791
Tell me, do you
think GUNVARREL's star

231
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,250
will shine again someday?

232
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,708
I dunno but finishing GunBuild-2
and entering it in the expo

233
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,166
is a good place to
start, don't you think?

234
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,958
I'm glad I came
here to this island.

235
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,541
If I didn't, I
wouldn't have met you.

236
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,416
Please. You have to win this
match. Somehow and it doesn't

237
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,916
have to be for me or
my mom, either, okay?

238
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,833
Ms. Furugori! We'd
like to talk to you about

239
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,333
the situation in
Tokyo, Ms. Furugori!

240
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,708
The police. Not good!

241
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,083
Wh-What do we do now?

242
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,750
It's the others.

243
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,958
Ms. Furugori, open up, please!

244
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,208
We need to speak
with you, ma'am!

245
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,083
Excuse me, are
you with the police?

246
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,666
Do you need something?

247
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,708
Um, yes, sir. Please help us!
There's some lunatic out there!

248
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,458
Let's go!

249
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,000
Right! What was that?

250
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,333
Hurry! We won't
get another chance.

251
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,958
Are you sure, Yashio?

252
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,750
We're almost out of
time. We gotta do this

253
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,625
before the cops get back.

254
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,625
Please! Work this time!

255
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,208
The enemy will use its
cheat move as soon as

256
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,375
its gauge turns
red. If I can just

257
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,833
activate Slow-Motion
at that precise moment.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,666
Are you okay?

259
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,791
Hangin' in there. When I tell
you, set it to the max level!

260
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,333
Not yet. Hang on.
Just a little longer!

261
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:29,458
Almost. Almost there.
Come on. Almost! Almost!

262
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,666
Now. Do it now!

263
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,375
I see it!

264
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,041
Are you all right? You
really pushed yourself.

265
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,291
But the robots, they're--?

266
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,125
I was able to input a
command to shut them down.

267
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,166
That's... good.

268
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:39,875
Thank you, Yashio.
You did it. GJ.

269
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,833
It's been one week since the
Tokyo blackout. And scars from

270
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,666
this catastrophe can still
be seen throughout the city.

271
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,458
But life is slowly
returning to normal.

272
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,916
Kai!

273
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,041
Are you feeling better enough
to come back to school today?

274
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,625
Yeah, seems like it.

275
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,208
In other news, the body of
a Japanese man was found on

276
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,333
the outskirts of
Manila in the Philippines.

277
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,958
According to the
local authorities,

278
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,791
the man had been
staying at a Manila hotel

279
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,708
the week preceding
his body's discovery.

280
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,125
Found inside his hotel
room was a body pillow

281
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,541
in the likeness
of a character from

282
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,000
a popular Japanese anime
"Magical Girl M'lady."

283
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,916
Frau was questioned by police
regarding the robot malfunction

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,125
but she wasn't
taken into custody.

285
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,833
Online, people still claim this
was a terrorist plot carried out

286
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,958
by the Furugoris,
both mother and daughter.

287
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,416
Those people can
think whatever they want.

288
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,041
It's Kona!

289
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,666
You've decided to
start attending class?

290
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,208
Not so much "attend
class" as "help achieve

291
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,916
the Robot Research
Club's ultimate goal."

292
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,333
Hey--!

293
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,125
Wha--?

294
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,458
I want GUNVARREL's star
to shine again someday

295
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,625
and I've decided to do whatever
I can to see that happen.

296
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,416
Uh. Well, in that case.

297
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,791
Welcome to Tanegashima High.

298
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,416
Why doesn't anybody
tell me anything?

299
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,666
Following the disasterous
malfunction incident,

300
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,625
it is announced
that IRUO will undergo

301
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,083
large scale maintenance.
Unfortunately for Kai,

302
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:10,125
this may mean the delusion
of a very special friend, Airi.

303
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,916
But it is the Christmas
season. Airi has only wish.

304
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And for it to come true,
there will have to be a miracle.

305
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,166
Epiosde 15.

306
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,541
Let's hit it off everybody!

307
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,916
Later days!
