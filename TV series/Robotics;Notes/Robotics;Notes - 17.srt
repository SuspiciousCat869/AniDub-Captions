1
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,708
Back in high school, I'd come
out here and watch Irei surf.

2
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,416
Did that a lot, actually.

3
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,958
And like you, I would
skip club meetings.

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,916
Wow. It sounds like
you were even worse at

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,458
running the club than Aki.

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,791
Yeah, I heard that all the time.
From Senomiya and from Irei.

7
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,875
So Senomiya sent a
condolence telegram, huh?

8
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,666
Oh, I mean the
older one, of course.

9
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,666
That reminds me.

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,541
She asked me to
tell Misa thanks.

11
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,500
Oh, and another thing,
Mizuka could really drink with

12
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,500
the best of 'em. I'm
gonna... I'm gonna miss her.

13
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,583
Drink up, Irei.

14
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,708
I'm just going to get right to
the point. As of today, I have

15
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,875
decided to officially disband
the Robot Research Club.

16
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,791
Really, Miss? Keep in
mind I'm partly to blame for

17
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,500
not providing
adequate supervision.

18
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,375
Hidaka's father is
exceptionally angry,

19
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,833
and for good reason,
indeed. Do you understand?

20
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,333
I do.

21
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,791
And while the help was certainly
appreciated, I'm afraid we can

22
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,291
no longer allow
you to work with JAXA.

23
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,500
We are deeply sorry,
too. We do regret the

24
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,208
lack of supervision
and the tragedy it led to.

25
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,250
Our bosses have weighed in,
too and we can no longer offer

26
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,416
the club any support.
Of course, that means there

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,666
won't be an
entry in the expo.

28
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,291
And does the
Space Candy Company

29
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,458
understand the
situation as well?

30
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,208
It is unfortunate,
but it can't be helped now.

31
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,791
All robots that were made
by the Robot Research Club

32
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,500
are to be dismantled
immediately. Understood?

33
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,291
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,333
We went to the hospital
straight after the meeting.

35
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,750
Even so, we didn't
get to see Subaru.

36
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,875
His father had told
the hospital staff that we

37
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,708
weren't to be allowed
visitation privileges.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,875
We heard his
injuries were severe.

39
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,750
So severe he might
never fully recover.

40
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:39,833
Meanwhile, Jun went to Subaru's
house to apologize to his dad.

41
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,500
I know what happened
wasn't your fault.

42
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:52,875
I know that, but please, stay
away from my son from now on.

43
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:02,625
He seemed so very sad. I know
that by accepting the blame

44
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,583
I won't change
anything and I know

45
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,291
that what I've done
can't ever be forgiven.

46
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,458
What happened
wasn't your fault, Jun.

47
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,125
Please don't be
so hard on yourself.

48
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,083
I want to say sorry
to you, too. I let you down.

49
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,458
Frau!

50
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,666
Look out!

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He got hurt and
it was all my fault.

52
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,875
So, I'm quitting
the club for good.

53
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,416
I don't really see any
point in doing that now.

54
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,500
There isn't even a
club to quit anymore.

55
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,875
Hey, shut up, Kai!

56
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,541
What?

57
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,125
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

58
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,458
Accept call.

59
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,125
Hi. Um. LTNS.

60
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Hey. How are you holding up?

61
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm working on tweaking
the auto-balancer.

62
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,541
P-Part of the reason Skeletal
GUNVARREL fell over was because

63
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,250
my program code wasn't up to
snuff. So I've been using data

64
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,916
collected over the last
few days to improve it.

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,125
Actually, the club
has been disbanded.

66
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,041
And all the
robots have to go.

67
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:13,625
Oof. W-Would have been cool if
you'd told me that sooner, TBH.

68
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,833
Yeah, sorry. I've kinda
had my hands full here.

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,791
Yeah, of course.

70
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,375
What is it? What's wrong?

71
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,666
It's just... all of this.

72
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,791
What?

73
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,000
Doesn't it seem... scary?

74
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,541
Scary?

75
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,375
R-Remember what you said? About
how "Kagome, Kagome" played

76
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,750
just before her
powered suit went crazy?

77
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,750
D-Do you think it might
have something to do with

78
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,625
the stuff in the
Kimijima Reports?

79
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,833
I told you.You shouldn't
go sticking your nose

80
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,375
where it doesn't belong.

81
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,250
Now just do what I told you
and forget about this already.

82
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,041
Tell her. Tell her thanks
for giving me these legs.

83
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,791
Do you think it was a
warning for me or something?

84
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,083
A warning? No, that's not
what I was saying. Just.

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,583
S-Sorry.

86
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,875
It's okay. Anyway, I'm
gonna go now. I'm tired.

87
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,041
Shall I download it?

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,291
Kaito Yashio.

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,625
I'm Sawada of
Exoskeleton Company.

90
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,250
I have a few questions about
the powered suit malfunction.

91
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,416
Uh, what kinda questions?

92
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,458
Look, I've already told
the police everything I know.

93
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,416
Yes, so I'm aware. They tell me
there was some audio playing

94
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,416
when the suit went out of
control. Were they sounds you

95
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,041
were familiar with?
Something you knew?

96
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,791
Something you had heard
somewhere else perhaps?

97
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,833
No, never.

98
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:39,750
I see. And have you heard of a
man by the name of Kou Kimijima?

99
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,750
No, sir.

100
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,208
Really? You see, Kou Kimijima
was connected to a young girl

101
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,166
named Airi and I'm
told you were the one who

102
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,750
discovered Airi
in a cold-sleep state.

103
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,041
I-- I just found
her, that's all.

104
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,875
I see. One more thing.

105
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,583
I hear you were a victim
of the Anemone Incident.

106
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,541
What does that have
to do with anything?

107
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,541
It's another interesting link.
That's when Kimijima died,

108
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,958
you know, almost exactly
when the Incident occurred.

109
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me ask again.

110
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,791
Is the name "Kou Kimijima"
familiar to you at all?

111
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,708
No, it's not.

112
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,333
I see.

113
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,625
Misa?

114
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,166
Accept call! Hello?
Hello, Misa? Are you there!

115
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,291
Kai. You cannot give
out the Kimijima Reports.

116
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,291
Huh?

117
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,166
You must safeguard
the information.

118
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,125
Wait. What do you mean?

119
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,791
Do not fail.

120
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:12,958
That's it, Sis. Mizuka's gone
and the club's been shut down.

121
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,375
It's all over.

122
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,750
Why'd this happen? Why, Sis?

123
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,291
Sis calling! Accept!
Accept call! Misaki!

124
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,000
Is that really you?

125
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,333
Sure is.

126
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,375
I can't believe it!

127
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,750
Have you been doing okay?

128
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,458
Yeah, how about you?

129
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,791
Nothing's changed much here.

130
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,750
So, tell me, how's
GunBuild-2 coming along?

131
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,958
Huh? Oh, um.

132
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,041
You're going to be in the
expo, right? I got your emails!

133
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,083
Well, actually...

134
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,375
I figured you'd
fail in the end.

135
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,791
I did try to
tell you, didn't I?

136
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,875
I said you would never be
anything more than mediocre.

137
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,916
What?

138
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:23,250
You'll never make my dream come
true. You're a failure, Akiho.

139
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,833
You dreamt about Misa?

140
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,833
Yeah.

141
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,208
Is it me or does
he look like he's sad?

142
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,625
Dunno.

143
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,666
What is it?

144
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,291
Hey Kai. Will you please
listen to what I have to say?

145
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
Uh, sure.

146
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,333
Attention, Chuo-Tanegashima
High Robot Research Club.

147
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,708
Our organization is hereby
disbanded. Thank you all

148
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,250
for giving your utmost to
the achievement of our goals.

149
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,083
That was great!

150
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,208
So?

151
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,208
Well that's it, I'll do
things on my own, somehow.

152
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,791
What are you talking about?

153
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
We're not allowed to
meet as a club anymore,

154
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,791
so I'll just figure out a way
to do this as an individual.

155
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,750
So despite everything,
you still haven't given up?

156
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,833
Do you really think everyone
is going to be okay with that?

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,791
I doubt it. I think the
vice principal will be angry.

158
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,958
And I think Jun, Subaru,
and Subaru's dad will be

159
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,125
furious, too. And I realize
it might seem disrespectful,

160
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,916
so soon after
Mizuka passed away.

161
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,375
Even so, you still
won't let go of this.

162
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,875
I want to catch
up to my sister!

163
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,833
I'm not special like
her. I'm mediocre.

164
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,583
But I can't just give up.
I refuse to give this up!

165
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,000
Please, Kai.
Tell me I'm not crazy.

166
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,625
I don't think I can.

167
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,958
But...

168
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:46,333
Mizuka is gone. Dead.
Subaru is seriously injured.

169
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,500
And you're still
thinking about the expo?

170
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,541
You can't just go off on
your own and expect it to be

171
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,208
all right. You aren't the
only one who's disappointed.

172
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,458
We all made GunBuild-2.
I mean, do you honestly

173
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,625
not see how selfish
you're being right now?

174
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,625
Yes, I get it.

175
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,833
Well, I'm not convinced!

176
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,291
I do!

177
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,333
Kai.

178
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,916
I'm going to see
the vice-principal.

179
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,458
The sooner we get all these
robots dismantled, the better.

180
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,083
You don't mean that.

181
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:23,166
Hold on! Kai!
Come back! Stop walking!

182
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:29,333
Please, Kai. This is
the last hope I have left.

183
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,083
It's the only link
I have to all of you.

184
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:37,416
My only link to my sister!
Don't do this. Please, Kai!

185
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:43,458
You know. It kinda sounds like
you're asking me for a favor.

186
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,041
Huh?

187
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And you know what that means.

188
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,416
You're gonna have to beat
me in a KILL-BALLAD match.

189
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,875
That's not fair.

190
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,041
What'll it be?
Gonna play or not?

191
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,958
You know I can't beat you.

192
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,083
What about
refusing to give up?

193
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,750
Come on. Let's play.
Show me how serious

194
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,958
you really are
about doing this.

195
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,666
You jerk.

196
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
What's the matter,
Snapping Turtle Aki?

197
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,750
You jerk.

198
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,416
Not so ridiculously
optimistic now?

199
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:28,250
You are such
a jeeeeerrrrkkkk!

200
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,000
Is that all you've got?

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,958
Come on.
Comeoncomeoncomeon!

202
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,375
I want to catch
up to my sister!

203
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,666
She says I'm mediocre. That
our robot's nothing but junk.

204
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,833
I'll prove she's
wrong about me!

205
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:09,416
I have to. I have to!
I have to! I have to!

206
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,375
Huh?

207
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,833
Well, that's that.

208
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,416
Wait, what?
Did I just beat you?

209
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Sure did. It was
close, but you won.

210
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,541
But how could--?
I mean did you?

211
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,041
Hey, do you have any candy?

212
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,750
Yeah sure.

213
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,666
Great, thanks.
I'll pay you back later.

214
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,416
You managed to beat me.
I'll stick with you to the end.

215
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,958
To the Tokyo expo
or wherever else.

216
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,000
Looks like it's just
the two of us again, huh?

217
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,750
It shouldn't make much
difference I think we were

218
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,750
the only ones who could
make it to the expo, anyway.

219
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,416
Ya damn brats!
Gettin' frisky in public!

220
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,791
Oh. Hey, Doc.

221
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:20,958
Wait, you're
the one in charge of

222
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,333
dismantling
the club's robots?

223
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,791
Well, that's what the school
hired me to do, anyway,

224
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,541
but now I've changed my mind.

225
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,250
See, I'm thinkin' of fixin'
up these two robots here.

226
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,250
Just for my own personal
entertainment, of course.

227
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,625
Would you guys have any
interest in helping me out?

228
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, Doc!

229
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,250
Hey! What are you doing?

230
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,916
Mitchi?

231
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,625
What the hell, who said you guys
could get started without me?

232
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,375
Look, we're not
gonna tear them apart!

233
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,375
I'm sorry, but
we refuse to give up!

234
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,250
We're gonna fix up
GunBuild-2 and enter the expo!

235
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,708
Huh?

236
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,791
You heard the girl
loud and clear, Mitsuhiko.

237
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,666
Well, that's a relief.
Wow! I thought Doc here was

238
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,666
about to start dismantling
'em. Glad to see I was wrong.

239
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,000
Here. For you.

240
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,041
Money! Where'd
you get all this?

241
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,958
Aw, man, you didn't
steal it did you?

242
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,958
Idiot! I just made
the school give it back.

243
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,875
What do you
mean "give it back?"

244
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,666
You already forget
you took second place

245
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,750
at ROBO-ONE last year?

246
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,416
This is the prize money.
So, what d'ya think?

247
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
It should be enough to
keep you funded for a while.

248
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,583
Thank you, Mitchi!

249
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,041
But why would
you do this for us?

250
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,916
I can't let the
club end like this.

251
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,583
Can you imagine how
pissed off Irei would be?

252
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,833
You're not half bad.

253
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,958
You're in trouble if the
vice-principal finds out.

254
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,541
That's a problem
for another day.

255
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,708
Kai.

256
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,333
Huh?

257
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,041
We can make it to the expo!

258
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,125
All the way to
Tokyo! And my sister!

259
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,458
You must safeguard
the information.

260
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,375
Hey Gezi.

261
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,625
Yes?

262
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,791
Kimijima Report Number
Seven is on the screen.

263
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,041
Download it now, please.

264
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,750
Are you sure about this?

265
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,958
Yeah.

266
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,666
I want to have
all the information

267
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,375
before we go to Tokyo.

268
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,625
Command confirmed.
Kimijima Report Number Seven.

269
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,833
Download now in progress.

270
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,625
What's happening?

271
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,625
Hey, Gezi. I'm not seeing a
report here. What's going on?

272
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,375
It appears that Kimijima
Report Number Seven does not

273
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,166
contain text as
previous reports did.

274
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,250
Huh? What do you mean
there's not any text?

275
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:15,083
Kimijima Report Number
Seven execution complete.

276
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,375
Copies of the six previous
Kimijima Reports have

277
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,416
now been disseminated
worldwide through IRUO.

278
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,916
Disseminated? What
are you talking about?

279
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:02,291
Aki and Kai arrive at the expo
hall with Gunbuild 2 in tow.

280
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,791
As in previous years,

281
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,666
the site is filled
wall-to-wall with robots.

282
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,958
People have come to
see their dreams come true.

283
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,791
Aki learns that her sister,
Misaki, will attend the expo.

284
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,666
Aki's anticipation and
anxiousness for their reunion

285
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,708
is tempered by what
Gunbuild 2 does next.

286
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,250
Episode 18.

287
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,875
Let's hit it off everybody!

288
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,333
Later days!
