1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,125
Trevor 1 to Wyvern.

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,583
This is Wyvern.
What's wrong, Trevor 1?

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,375
Large, moving object
spotted to the northwest.

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,458
A large, moving object?

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,166
We are unable to get
a data pull from IRUO.

6
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,916
It's over fifteen meters
in height. What should we do?

7
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,541
For now, nothing. You
Trevors are to remain there

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,375
on standby, as planned.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,458
Focus on preparing
for the launch.

10
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,916
47 minutes to launch.

11
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,250
Liquid fuel
preparation complete.

12
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,750
Wind speed: one.
No precipitation.

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,250
The unknown moving
object is expected to

14
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,541
reach the launch site shortly.

15
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,625
Request use of
missiles to defend.

16
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,791
Request received,
Trevors, but I'll be calling

17
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,416
all the shots out there.
You're to remain at your posts.

18
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,250
You came.

19
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,750
Hello, Misa.

20
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,833
Kai. Misa.

21
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
Chief!

22
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,458
Yes, I know.

23
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,750
AR decoys!

24
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,750
Let's go!

25
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,916
So this is a battlefield,
huh? Still, WTG, Sawadie!

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,625
Is everybody okay out there?

27
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,208
Yes!

28
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm all right!

29
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,208
Plan is successful
so far. The AR decoys work.

30
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,833
'Kay, what now? With the
missiles outta the picture,

31
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,500
the coast is clear,
right? Let's get closer.

32
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,333
No. The missiles won't be
a hundred percent ineffective.

33
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,875
The AR decoys interfere
with IRUO and make the dummies

34
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,666
seem genuine, and the
real one harder to target.

35
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,958
It's basically a
doppelganger technique.

36
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,750
Although the chance
of getting hit is lower,

37
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,625
they could get lucky
and shoot at the real robot.

38
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,208
It's headed your way!

39
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,083
Now, Aki! The button!

40
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,125
Hurry!

41
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,958
Oh, no!

42
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,708
I'm okay.

43
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,125
The Pile Bunker is destroyed.

44
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,041
Still got the one on the right.

45
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,500
Is that all,
Misa? Running away?

46
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,750
SUMERAGI in combat with unknown
object. Rocket status, green.

47
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,291
Continue countdown.

48
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,125
Kay, here we go. I'll charge
when I can. You guys are backup.

49
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,166
Huh?

50
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,458
All right. Down
to thirty minutes.

51
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,083
You can't fire missiles.
Not at this close range.

52
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,708
Isn't that right?

53
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,000
What the hell are those?

54
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,916
Come on, you can do it!

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,916
Nothin' to worry about.
He ain't gonna lose.

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,916
I tuned that thing myself.

57
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,041
Alright, you monopole
motors! Show 'em what you got!

58
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,166
Alright!

59
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,333
Not yet!

60
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,125
Aki!

61
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,333
Let's go!

62
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,208
GUNVAL Ankh Striker!

63
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,541
Wow, he hit it!

64
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,750
He destroyed the camera section
for sure. That might be it.

65
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,916
Misa! I know you can hear me!

66
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,833
Now come on out.
Come out and tell Aki.

67
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,458
Tell her the real
story now, face to face.

68
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,583
Tell her why
you abandoned her.

69
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,500
I want to hear you tell her
why you said she was mediocre.

70
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,500
Go ahead! Explain
everything to her!

71
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,416
She deserves
to know all of it.

72
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,166
That's why she's chased after
you all this time, to find out.

73
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,250
And now she's caught up!

74
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,541
Kai.

75
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,833
Don't you dare run away!

76
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,041
Unfortunately, it's
too little, too late.

77
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,750
Her mind has already crumbled.
She has nothing more to offer.

78
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,625
I plunged her
into darkness, you see.

79
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,750
What does he mean?

80
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,458
What?

81
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,416
S-Self destruct?

82
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,333
Huh? Look!

83
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,500
The Misaki you thought
you knew is nothing

84
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,916
but a mindless puppet now.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,416
That's all.
My own, dear little puppet.

86
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,416
She can't be gone. No.

87
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,958
This is B Team. We have
re-secured the control room.

88
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,875
Now implementing the plan
to abort the rocket launch.

89
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,208
Stand by.

90
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,750
It's no use.
The rocket cannot be stopped.

91
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,333
Why not?

92
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:58,125
This is my ultimate experiment
and I mean for it to succeed.

93
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,375
Oh, Kai!

94
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,791
Oh, no!

95
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,208
You guys! Run!

96
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:32,166
I'm gonna die. Totally
gonna die. Epic death scene.

97
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,875
Hey, is everyone okay in there?

98
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Yeah, we're all right. But that.

99
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,625
It's totally fried.

100
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,458
GunBuild-1 will have to
run on internal batteries.

101
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,583
And they won't last
long. Five minutes or so.

102
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,666
Come in, Akiho! It's
no use. Whatever we try,

103
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,375
it won't accept the
abort launch commands.

104
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,500
Looks like the
admin's blocking them.

105
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:10,541
Current admin listed as--
It's him. It's Kou Kimijima.

106
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,833
Do you know how much time I've
dedicated to this experiment?

107
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,833
I've literally
given my life for it.

108
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:23,083
I will make sure it succeeds.
You can count on that.

109
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,458
Uh, WTF?

110
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,583
What is it?

111
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:36,666
W-W-W-W-W00000t.
Go Sawadie. FTW!

112
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,125
What are you doing, Frau? This
is no time to be goofing around!

113
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:43,625
I'm not. The program's arrived.
The one for deleting Kimijima.

114
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,958
Really? It's here?

115
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,083
Here are the instructions.
"To activate it, first install,

116
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,250
then lock on to
Kimijima's AR while

117
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,791
he's displayed on the
pad's screen." Sounds simple.

118
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,708
So far but there's
more. And it isn't good.

119
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,083
When you install the program,

120
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,458
you'll also have
to reboot your pad.

121
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,041
Wait, reboot it?

122
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,708
Yeah. And we'll also
have to find a way to

123
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,583
get my sister out
of the cockpit somehow.

124
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,666
If we do that,
Kimijima is sure to show up.

125
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,875
Please, don't notice!

126
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,375
Time remaining. Ten minutes.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,291
It seems he's cut off all
communication with the others.

128
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,458
He must be up to something.
Let's find out what.

129
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,458
Still no reaction?

130
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,291
Here he comes!

131
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,375
He knows what's going on?

132
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,875
No!

133
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,750
This is bad! Yashio's still
in the middle of rebooting.

134
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,708
He can't see anything
the enemy's doing!

135
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,125
Kai.

136
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,666
Chief, no!

137
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,083
Misa. Misa.

138
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,208
Stop, Misa! Don't do this!

139
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:42,250
Listen to me! Please,
Sis! You know me! It's Aki!

140
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,041
Misa!

141
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,750
Impossible. There's
still something of

142
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
your mind remaining?

143
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,833
Aki. Get back!

144
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,666
Okay. Bring it on!
Aren't you gonna attack me?

145
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
You know that smiling
person you pretended to be

146
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,750
on TV was just a friendly
fake. You're someone who wins

147
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,333
without showing so
much as a hint of emotion.

148
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,166
A cruel woman who
never shows mercy.

149
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,458
Kai.

150
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,125
I looked up to you for
trying to build a giant robot.

151
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,125
For watching robot anime
even though you're a girl.

152
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,583
But you're just a jerk who drags
everyone into your messes.

153
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,250
Now tell me, do you
seriously think you have

154
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,375
the "right stuff?"
Answer me, Misa!

155
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,083
You keep talking
like that and I swear.

156
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,875
I'll destroy you!

157
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,375
All right. Now it's
time for our game.

158
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,166
I know what's coming, Misa.

159
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,416
It was the same in
every KB game we played!

160
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,333
Aki, now!

161
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,166
It's the same. Always the same.

162
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,291
You always dodge to
the right four frames!

163
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,291
Are you okay?

164
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,916
Pathetic.

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
What did you expect?

166
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,875
Misaki is gone for
good now. It's all over.

167
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
Look at this!

168
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,083
It's GunBuild-1. The robot you
used to work on. Your robot!

169
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,708
Is that really what you
came here to say to me?

170
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,541
It was built with our passion.

171
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,250
Yours, mine,
everyone's on the island.

172
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,958
And it actually works.

173
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,125
It's actually fighting
to save the world!

174
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,625
How amusing. It seems
both sisters have

175
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,583
the same curious
way of thinking.

176
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,583
What's happening?

177
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,875
Think back, Sis. To when
Dad showed me a robot

178
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,500
for the very first
time. Do you remember?

179
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,708
Well, I do. You looked
at me and said...

180
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,666
Aren't they amazing.
I love robots.

181
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,958
More than
anything in the world!

182
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,083
Do you still love them?

183
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,833
Think about it, Sis. Tell me.

184
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,458
Do you still love
them more than anything?

185
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,916
Shut up!

186
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,625
Say goodbye!

187
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:45,166
I was so close to
succeeding. What a shame.

188
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,875
Just wait. Someday, a
second, a third me will appear.

189
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,375
Yeah, maybe. But...

190
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,125
You still won't
win in the end

191
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,500
because good
will always triumph.

192
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,833
At least that's what
our chief likes to tell us.

193
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,958
Well, who knows.
You may just be right.

194
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,875
I've got you!

195
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,833
Aki.

196
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,583
I'm here, Sis.

197
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,041
Thank you, Aki.

198
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,875
There we go! Kimijima
is no longer the admin.

199
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,916
Entering abort
command. Please work!

200
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,583
Countdown halted. We've
stopped the rocket launch!

201
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,750
W00t!

202
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,708
Ah, man.

203
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,583
Yeah! Ow!

204
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,875
Now that's impact!

205
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,875
Boing boing boing boing!

206
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,291
That's what I call rockin'.

207
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,625
Yes! Alright!

208
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,291
Order. Quiet down,
all of you. Honestly.

209
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,625
Aki! How's she doing?

210
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,166
She'll be okay.
She just fainted, that's all.

211
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,125
Hey. Let's go
back to the hangar!

212
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,333
So, Kai.

213
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,666
What's next? What
do you think you'll do?

214
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,208
What do you mean "next?"

215
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,500
You know, like
after we graduate.

216
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,000
What do you want to be?

217
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,333
Like, when I grow
up? Why do you ask?

218
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,583
No real reason.

219
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,125
Not sure, really.

220
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,166
Who knows what'll happen.
Maybe I'll shoot for the stars.

221
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,791
Huh? What do you mean?

222
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,458
Hey!

223
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:14,875
Well, Misa. What do you
think? The dream that we had.

224
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,416
The robot we built. It was
more than just a machine.

225
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,041
It became a beacon of hope.

226
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,000
For everyone.

227
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,416
Five!

228
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,541
Four!

229
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,583
Three!

230
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,458
Two!

231
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,875
One!

232
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,833
Lift off!
