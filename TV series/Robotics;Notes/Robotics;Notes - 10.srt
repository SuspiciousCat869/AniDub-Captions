1
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, TAKANO_EYE
is totally cheating.

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,500
No wonder they're
in first place.

3
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,458
Hey, Airi.

4
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,958
What is it, Yashio?

5
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,208
Oh. I wasn't in Gezi mode.

6
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,791
What're you doing here?

7
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,041
I am here to monitor the
progress of an experiment.

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,958
August Eleven,
two-thousand-nineteen.

9
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,208
Today's date.

10
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,208
I am set for observation
to verify a prediction

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,958
for Verifacatory Experiment
Number Two Nine Four Six.

12
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,458
Experiment.

13
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,916
One that employs the EGI System.

14
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:01,833
Oh, that thing that sends beepy
static sounds into the sky?

15
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,875
How's it going?
Do you have any results yet?

16
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,583
Yes. Just now, in fact.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,041
A rock?

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,958
Geez! What is that thing?

19
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,791
A magnetic monopole.

20
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,416
Oh yeah! A monopole!

21
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,750
Wait, what is that again?

22
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,625
I'll overhaul it for free.

23
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,500
But you're the one
who installed this piece

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:15,375
of junk without tuning it up.
Don't go pinning it on me.

25
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,583
You're still going to put all
your energy into GunBuild-1?

26
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,166
Of course I am!
How many times have I said

27
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,083
I'm not gonna give up,
no matter what?

28
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,333
What's this you sent me?

29
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,916
It's the results
for some start-up

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
simulations for GunBuild-1.

31
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,375
I tried to find some way to make
it work in its current state.

32
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,583
It's not going to happen.

33
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,583
The only option is to rethink
everything from the ground up.

34
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,750
Otherwise, it'll just
be a repeat of last time.

35
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,083
It's from Yashio.

36
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,458
A monopole.

37
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
Yeah.

38
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,166
So this is a joke, isn't it?

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,625
Say that again
after you touch it.

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,458
See? You ever seen
a rock like this before?

41
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,625
True, I've never seen
a mineral that produces

42
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,916
an electric charge like that.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,125
But what makes you
say it's a monopole?

44
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,083
Huh? Oh, well,
uh, the thing is.

45
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,041
Actually, what
exactly is a monopole?

46
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,041
Really? You don't know?

47
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,791
I did have it explained
to me, but I'm confused.

48
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,375
By that weird Airi app of
yours or whatever it's called?

49
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,750
You know about? Frau told you.

50
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah, I remain skeptical.

51
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,166
I'm not inclined to
believe so outrageous a claim.

52
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,125
Yeah, I'm not really sure
I believe it, for that matter.

53
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,125
Normally, breaking a magnet
in two will simply create

54
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,208
two smaller magnets,
rather than creating two pieces

55
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,083
with different magnetic poles.

56
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,958
A monopole,
however, only possesses

57
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,125
one magnetic pole:
North or South.

58
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,833
It's said they
could theoretically exist,

59
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,041
but one has never
actually been seen.

60
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,666
It was just lying
here like this?

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,666
Well, uh.
To be precise, it fell here.

62
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,500
Like, out of the sky.

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,333
There's only this one now,
but according to Airi,

64
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
there's a chance more could
come falling down, too.

65
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,166
No way!

66
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,458
You brought Aki
down here with you?

67
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:46,000
That's not cool, man. I told
you to come alone, didn't I?

68
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,208
Looks like she'd really
like to join us over here.

69
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,500
Why don't you let her?

70
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,250
No way.

71
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,416
And now she seems
utterly forlorn.

72
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,125
Okay, okay. Hey, Aki.

73
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,833
Yes, I'm right here!

74
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,000
Alright, did you hear
everything already?

75
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,791
Yeah! Yeah! That is a mono--

76
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,208
Let's not broadcast
it to everyone, okay?

77
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,625
What's the big idea?!

78
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,750
This is a major discovery
if it's the real deal!

79
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,458
We could sell it for millions.
No, maybe even billions!

80
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,041
Just think!

81
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,291
We could pay off our debt and
buy all the robot parts we need!

82
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
This is a bigger
deal than you think.

83
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
It's the discovery
of the century!

84
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,791
Or it could be.

85
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,500
Assuming it's actually
the real thing, of course.

86
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,708
It's that awesome a find?

87
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,541
These things appear
often in science fiction.

88
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,041
The theory is
that they're capable

89
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,458
of producing tremendous
amounts of energy.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,958
Producing energy.

91
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,750
This monopole thing's
a magnet, right?

92
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,041
Does that mean we
could use it as a motor?

93
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,583
It's not impossible, but I
don't think having just one

94
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,708
would be enough
for our purposes.

95
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,250
Well, that's it then.

96
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,500
What's it?

97
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,875
Make more monopoles fall.

98
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,791
How do you expect
me to manage that?

99
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,000
A monopole rain dance, maybe?

100
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,000
I see you're finally awake.

101
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,541
You guys! Why'd you
let me fall asleep?

102
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,666
It was easier for me to
concentrate on my game this way.

103
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,916
And it meant not
having to deal with you.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,125
Have you ever heard
the term "sugarcoating"?

105
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,583
What's our monopole status now?
How many more came down?

106
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,125
Not a one.

107
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,333
What?! Airi did say more of
them were going to fall today,

108
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,833
didn't she? Didn't she, Kai?

109
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,333
Sorry, I'm fighting
TAGIRINGER now.

110
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,583
I can't let anybody
distract me. Not even you.

111
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,833
Aki, in the fighting games,
Misa would attack,

112
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,291
and then she'd always swing
to the right, wouldn't she?

113
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
I wouldn't know.

114
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,583
Never mind that!
What about the monopole?!

115
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,916
Whoa, it's that late already?

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,416
Won't your dad be
angry with you, Subaru?

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,833
It shouldn't bother him too much

118
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,375
as long as I'm not
working on a hobby robot.

119
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,958
Forget the
monopoles for a second.

120
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,000
Won't you rethink
the plan with GunBuild-1?

121
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,333
Whatever your convictions,
there is no merit in sticking

122
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,750
to such a hopeless project.

123
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,041
Well, Doc did promise
to fix the engine for us.

124
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,875
That'll help, huh?

125
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,916
Even so, it won't make much
difference. It'll still have a

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,541
heavy body it's
barely capable of moving,

127
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,250
so I just don't see any point.

128
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,208
I know, but it's GunBuild-1.

129
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,125
You should just
do what Tennoji said.

130
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,291
Build a new robot
from scratch. Think about it.

131
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,500
You'll even get
support from JAXA.

132
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,750
 But...

133
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,291
See you.

134
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,625
Hey, what are you lookin' at?

135
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,750
It's a GunBuild-1
simulation Subaru worked up.

136
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,625
He says however much we
wanna try and modify it

137
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,208
it'll still never be
the robot we imagined.

138
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,958
What'll you do?

139
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,208
Oh, I don't know.
Well, not yet, at least.

140
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,625
But I think we can
be done for the day.

141
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,958
WTF, just kill me now.
Mega Solar Death Ray!

142
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,291
Can you try to walk a little?

143
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,708
I don't know how much
longer I can hold you up.

144
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,208
You smell tera-good,
karate girl.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,250
Ah! Could you
please not do that?!

146
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,333
What is this scent? Vanilla?

147
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,708
Curse you and
your seductiveness! GTFO!

148
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:04,500
Okay! Today I'm gonna
stay completely hands-off,

149
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,625
so you kids can brush up on
your debating skills. Got it?

150
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,583
Is that just an
excuse for you to be lazy?

151
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,166
If you need me,
I'll be taking a nap.

152
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
Be sure to report the outcome

153
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,375
of the meeting
to me, Little Senomiya.

154
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,541
Talk about irresponsible.

155
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,250
It's okay. I make a point of
not expecting much from him.

156
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,166
Let's do this ourselves.

157
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,125
I see. So you haven't
changed your mind, then.

158
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,791
You're still dedicated
to finishing the Mark 1.

159
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,541
Yes. It's about more
than just the five of us.

160
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,250
It represents the hopes and
dreams of years of club members.

161
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,333
I understand. If you're that
determined, then why don't we

162
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,041
spend today taking
a further look into

163
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,791
what we can do about
improving your robot?

164
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,416
If you'll allow me.
I've put together an abstract

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,208
in preparation for this.

166
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,875
May I pass out copies?

167
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,416
That's terrific! By all means.

168
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,458
"Causes of the Mark 1's failure

169
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,416
and suggestions
regarding future work."

170
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,250
I apologize for
the poor presentation.

171
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,708
It's not poor at all!

172
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,208
I think you've done a very
professional job with it.

173
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,708
Ugh, try to swallow your
embarrassment and keep going.

174
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,583
Wha-? I'm not embawassed!

175
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,625
Huh, that's a surprise. I never
expected him to get nervous.

176
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,416
Epically virginal.

177
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,166
 Now you wisten here, I--

178
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,625
Why don't you
read it for us, Aki.

179
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,791
Then Subaru can go back

180
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,000
and explain anything
we don't understand.

181
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,125
Oh, yeah, okay.

182
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,000
It starts, "Regarding
the Mark 1's failure..."

183
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,583
That's not true!
It didn't fail!

184
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,166
Come on, Aki.

185
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,333
All right, all right. Let's see:
"The chief contributing factors

186
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,208
to the failure were the
lack of technical prowess

187
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,208
and the inability to procure
quality materials." Wow.

188
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,833
Yes. The blueprints
themselves were well executed.

189
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,208
However, due to
insufficient funds,

190
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,833
attempts were
made to compensate,

191
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,041
including the use
of materials not planned

192
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,041
for during the drawing stage.

193
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,208
Chief among these was an engine
with inadequate power output.

194
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,625
But like I said, it didn't fail!
It actually walked!

195
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,958
It was a dud. It's a
miracle it moved at all.

196
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,208
Well, um, it is impressive that
it moved despite its weight.

197
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,583
Yes. Which just goes to show you

198
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,833
how solidly planned out
the original blueprints were.

199
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:29,041
With that in mind, I have a
recommendation. Start over.

200
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,625
Use this experience
to build a new robot.

201
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh? Do you really think so?

202
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,916
But Subaru.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,750
This shouldn't be
news to you, Chief.

204
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,125
I told you as
much the other day.

205
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,416
Moving on. If you will turn to
the next page of the abstract,

206
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,958
I've outlined the key
points of robot constwuct--

207
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,750
Pardon me. The key
points of robot construction:

208
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,166
Basic structure,
materials, power source,

209
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,750
motors, control
mechanism, programming.

210
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,583
Of course, at the very least,
these fundamentals will need

211
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,291
to be constructed on a level
superior to that of the Mark 1.

212
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, that goes without saying.

213
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
Personally,
I think it'd be great

214
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,916
if the arms and body
could move independently, too.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,625
Yeah! You know, like the M45!

216
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,416
The M45?

217
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,166
The partner of the legendary
ROBO-ONE champion, Mr. Pleiades!

218
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,125
I'm a big fan,
if you couldn't tell.

219
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,916
I think making a giant version

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,250
of that robot would
be a super-smart way to go.

221
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,291
How many servo motors does
this hobby robot of yours use?

222
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,125
It needs twenty-four.

223
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,666
That's the first issue
right there. A bigger version

224
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,625
of the same robot
model would need

225
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,041
to have a motor
at each joint, as well.

226
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,916
Their weight alone would be
tremendous, and remember,

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,666
making something
ten times as tall

228
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,166
increases its
weight a thousand-fold.

229
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,375
It does, really?

230
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,166
Remember your geometry?
That's how volume works.

231
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,250
Here we have a robot
approximately five times

232
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,500
the hobby robot's size. We can
lighten it as much as possible

233
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,666
by constructing
it out of aluminum,

234
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,708
thereby enabling it
to walk, as seen here.

235
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,083
Giving it that many operational
joints would be very difficult.

236
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,958
We would need to lighten it even
further, and that would require

237
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,875
the use of composite materials,

238
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,416
like diamond film
or carbon fibers.

239
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,541
I don't think that
would really be feasible,

240
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,083
in terms of the
expense involved.

241
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,208
In that case,
I'm afraid it will have

242
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,833
to look something like this.

243
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,291
Huh?!

244
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,250
But that's so lame!

245
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,333
Maybe so, but the Mark 1
was pretty lame, in my opinion.

246
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,208
That's just how it ended up.
It didn't start that way!

247
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,416
However you want to
spin it, lame is lame.

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,833
You take that back!

249
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,250
Those two aren't ever
going to get along, are they?

250
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,416
of club members had to
piece it together bit by bit!

251
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,166
This is some good moe.

252
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
Give me some room, will ya?

253
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,125
You even admit that it didn't
turn out well. So why do you

254
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,291
still refuse to consider

255
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
Hey, could we make
it look like GUNVARREL

256
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,875
on the outside by
using something like this?

257
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,250
What are you talking about, Jun?

258
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:18,291
Huh? Oh, I just noticed that
Yashio is using some kind of

259
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,041
app on his pad to make you look
like a cute little cat ear maid.

260
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,916
Kai! Again?!

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,708
Oh, err.

262
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
I never thought of that.

263
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,750
Using AR to alter its
appearance. Interesting.

264
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,833
That could actually
be a possibility.

265
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,625
We could use AR to make this
look like GUNVARREL at the expo.

266
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,916
People would just have
to view it through a pad.

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,333
We won't have to worry
about its actual appearance.

268
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,708
I think I see, and when it
moves around, people looking at

269
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,625
their pads will see GUNVARREL
moving around, instead.

270
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,875
That sounds like
an awesome idea!

271
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,916
In other words,
it's a Spirit Bla--

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,041
Okay, now we still have

273
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,916
the control
configuration to consider.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,583
Wh-Wh-Why don't we just use
the same system as KILL-BALLAD?

275
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,708
Indeed, that would
be quickest, and, naturally,

276
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,833
that means the
operator should be...

277
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,541
Whoa, whoa, hold it.
I'm not gonna--

278
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,333
Easy. The Mark 2
will use remote controls

279
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,041
and an external power source.

280
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,875
You won't mind
doing it then, right?

281
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,250
Wha?! He won't be in it?!

282
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,625
Of course he won't.

283
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,250
Not when weight is the
biggest issue we're facing.

284
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,625
Subaru!

285
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,416
This makes it possible
for you to build a robot.

286
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,083
One you can take to the expo
without fear of embarrassment.

287
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,250
How did it go? The meeting
with my daughter's club.

288
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,166
It was certainly interesting.

289
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,375
We've got some kinks we'll
have to work out along the way.

290
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,583
I would imagine so.

291
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,375
They're all such unique
individuals, you know,

292
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,583
but that actually
makes them a great team.

293
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,791
I'm sure it'll
work out in the end.

294
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:15,416
Misa! I'm gonna
do it, you'll see!

295
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,875
I'm gonna join the club
and make your dream come true!

296
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,541
You'll never be anything
more than just mediocre, Aki.

297
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,291
Hey, Aki.

298
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,791
Why're you here?

299
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,875
How many times have I told you

300
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,833
it's important
to get enough sleep?

301
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:45,041
Honestly. I really do want to
go to the expo with GunBuild-1.

302
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,541
But, I think Subaru's right.
It's not going to happen.

303
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,833
Really?

304
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,708
I know what you think,
but I'm not blind.

305
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,125
I saw the test run.

306
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,958
I realize we've got no
choice but to build a new one.

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
And I know Subaru's
got the right idea.

308
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,000
It's just
difficult for me to...

309
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,791
Tell me, Kai.

310
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,083
What would you do in my place?

311
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,083
You have to ask yourself:
is your dream to enter

312
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,000
the Tokyo expo or to finish
construction on GunBuild-1?

313
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,625
You're right.

314
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,500
I have to make
that decision, don't I?

315
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:37,250
Maybe I'm not as
good as you, Sis. But...

316
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,916
I'll do whatever I have to
to make your dream come true!

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,041
You can just wait
in Tokyo until I do!

318
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,250
That's not fair Koujiro!

319
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,208
Let someone else have a turn!

320
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,791
GunBuild-2, huh?

321
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,416
The "Let's make a life-size
version of GUNVARREL" project,

322
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,416
Mark 2. Or just GunBuild-2,
for short.

323
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,125
I think it's high
time we move forward

324
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,250
with Tennoji and
Subaru's suggestion.

325
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,208
So, then, you'll be
giving up on GunBuild-1?

326
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,583
No, I'm not. I will
finish GunBuild-1. Later.

327
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,458
But for now, we're going
to build GunBuild-2

328
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,666
and take it to the expo.
All five of us!

329
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,291
All five?

330
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,083
Uh-huh. There's me, you,
also Jun and Frau Bow,

331
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,958
and Subaru, of course.

332
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,250
Very well. Count me in.

333
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,291
Was some reaction
too much to hope for?

334
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,791
After all the heartbreak I went
through making this decision!

335
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,666
Jun, Frau Bow, listen up!

336
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,250
Today the Robot Research Club
will begin work on GunBuild-2.

337
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:55,291
The theme will be "a giant
robot that only we can build!"

338
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,208
I want there to be parts of it
that only Jun could contribute,

339
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,875
and you, Frau Bow. Something
from every member of the club!

340
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,333
Subaru's ideas.
Kai's control skills.

341
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,708
We'll build a robot that
combines all of these things!

342
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,000
And that's how I want us
to make GunBuild-2: together!

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,166
All right! Let's do it!

344
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,666
Sorry, but do what, now?

345
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,208
Haven't you done this before?

346
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,625
Put your hands out, guys!

347
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,333
Robot Research Club,
Spirit Blast!

348
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,208
Let's hit it ooooooffffffff!

349
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,916
Yeaaaaaaah! Huh?

350
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,916
Come on, you guys! Say iiittttt!

351
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,416
Good afternoon! How are you?

352
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,583
Would you like to
hear today's weather forecast?

353
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,916
Still the
same as ever, I see.

354
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,375
It's actually
kind of frightening

355
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,791
how little you've changed.

356
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,791
We have a very
pleasant forecast today.

357
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,666
The Tanegashima region will have
clear skies and winds blowing

358
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,333
in from the east,
with occasional strong gusts.

359
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,541
Tell me, Airi.

360
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,000
Have you been bound here
for nine years straight now?

361
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,750
Airi's sorry,
but she doesn't understand

362
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,458
what you mean by "bound".

363
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,041
Listen, Airi.

364
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,083
Could you please disappear?

365
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,666
The Robot Research Club
now finds itself

366
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,166
building a new robot.

367
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,083
Meanwhile, Kai and Frau
set out to locate another

368
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,291
of the mysterious
Kimijima Reports.

369
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,458
The information in the report
seems too incredible to believe

370
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,708
but too important to dismiss.

371
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,041
Can the report's
assertions be trusted?

372
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,625
Before Kai can decide, a
shocking development further

373
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,916
complicates the situation and
threatens to change everything.

374
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,875
Episode 11!

375
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,416
Let's hit it off, everybody!

376
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,833
Later days!
