1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:14,458
You've done some good work here.
Now it's time to take it easy.

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,625
Right!

3
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,750
Well, here I am, Odaiba!
I have finally returned!

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,500
I think my butt fell asleep
somewhere along the twenty-hour

5
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,833
truck ride it took
to get us here.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,791
Well, the expo starts
tomorrow at nine.

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,000
Looks like they'll be

8
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,000
opening the entrance
for robots around eight.

9
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,541
'Kay. Looks to me like we've
got it all wrapped up for today.

10
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,583
So let's head
over to the hotel.

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,166
An actual hotel this time?

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:51,208
Wow! Look how
big this bed is!

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,041
Oh, yeah! I can
practically do somersaults!

14
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,333
Mitchi really
splurged this time.

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,708
Maybe he's not so bad! Huh?

16
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,291
He splurged alright.
On a single room. Huh?

17
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,916
He only gave us one room key

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,333
and this is a
bed for two people.

19
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,041
Whaaatt?

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,375
So you know, any
illicit relations are

21
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,541
grounds for expulsion.
Just a tip from me to you.

22
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,083
Ugh, could we have a
worse adult supervisor?

23
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,500
What's it gonna be?

24
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,166
Uh, sorry, what d'you mean?

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,125
I'm okay with it. I just
don't know about you.

26
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:39,291
Oh, right, yeah.
I'm totally fine with it.

27
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,625
Oh, really?
Well, that's good.

28
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,458
How long do you
think it's been?

29
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,833
Since we slept
in the same bed.

30
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,541
Kai! The bathtub is
taking forever to fill!

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,333
Totally normal. That's
how it is in nice hotels.

32
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,291
Yeah? Why?

33
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,208
And now the question
on everyone's mind.


34
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,708
Just what are the so-called
Kimijima Reports that were


35
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,583
recently sent to PhoneDroid
pads around the world?

36
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,166
Are they part of
some elaborate hoax,

37
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,375
or actual state secrets
that have been leaked?

38
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,208
The mystery only deep--

39
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,083
TAGIRINGER.

40
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,791
I've seen these
moves. I know them.

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,416
I know it's you, Misa.

42
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:17,583
Make contact! Stop
avoiding us! She's gone!

43
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,041
Mizuka is dead,
don't you even care?

44
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,416
Yeah, I'm dead.

45
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,291
Mizuka! How?

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,750
You knew there was something
wrong so why didn't you save me?

47
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,666
You were right
there when it happened.

48
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
You know you could
have stopped it.

49
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,625
I tried to!

50
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,375
Mizuka!

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,083
Aki.

52
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,333
Are you okay, Kai?
You had a nightmare.

53
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,291
I tried to wake
you up, but I couldn't.

54
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,458
I just had a bad dream. Prob'ly
from rattling around in the

55
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,791
back of that
truck for so long.

56
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
I'm gonna go take a shower.

57
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,166
Wait.

58
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,041
Trust me on this,
I could really use one.

59
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,166
You always do this.
You hide how you feel behind

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,333
some joke or
sarcastic comment.

61
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,666
Oh, yeah? Do I?

62
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,541
When you're hurting,
just say you're hurting.

63
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,791
Lately it feels like we're
never really together anymore.

64
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,333
You're always going off
somewhere on your own.

65
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:45,750
Worrying about something you
don't want to tell me about.

66
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,458
I didn't realize.

67
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,541
I pretended not to notice
because I knew you didn't want

68
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:54,791
to talk about it. But
I really do want to help.

69
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,541
I want to be able to be there
for you when you're hurting.

70
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,916
We're always there
for each other.

71
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,208
You probably don't think
there's much I can do to help

72
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,791
but please, at
least let me try.

73
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,375
All right, then. I don't think
I'll be sleeping any more.

74
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,958
You wanna stay up
all night with me?

75
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Huh?

76
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't want to?

77
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,208
I thought I already told
you, you can count on me!

78
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,125
I have just the thing, too.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,875
Now I'm worried.

80
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,208
I think it's time for an
all-night GUNVARREL marathon!

81
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,333
I guess I shoulda
seen that coming.

82
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,791
That's it! Almost there!

83
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,291
So, what's going on with Misa?
Has she contacted you at all?

84
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,833
Nope, nothing. Not a
word. It almost feels like

85
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,208
she isn't real. Like
she doesn't exist anymore.

86
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,125
I'm pretty sure
your sister's real.

87
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,791
Oh, yeah? Well, she's
certainly not acting like it.

88
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,666
Here at Exoskeleton we work hard
for you. Our powered suits have

89
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
been specially
designed to be accessible

90
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,833
and useful in the daily
lives of ordinary people.

91
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,833
Whoa! What is that thing?

92
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,666
Oh. Yeah, that's Exoskeleton's
robot. Here's the information.

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,916
It's a concept model
called "Sumeragi."

94
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
How in the heck is
that supposed to be

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,833
useful in day-to-day life?

96
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,208
Oh, this is only
a concept model.

97
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,750
Oh sorry?

98
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,166
It's basically a way of saying,
"here's what's possible."

99
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,500
Um, hello. Sorry to bother you.
My name is Akiho Senomiya?

100
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,750
Senomiya?
Oh, Misaki's sister?

101
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Yes. Do you know if
my sister will be here?

102
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,333
Yeah. Of course she will.

103
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,041
She is the company's
key PR girl, after all.

104
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,583
She's coming? Really?
When will that be?

105
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,125
Well, I don't know when
exactly but shortly after

106
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,708
the expo begins,
I would guess.

107
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,625
My sister'll actually
be here and that means

108
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,500
I'll get a chance
to show her GunBuild-2.

109
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,791
Hey, where are you going?

110
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,166
I'm gonna go put
GunBuild-2 together!

111
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,041
Of course you are.

112
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,041
She's really excited.
They must be very close.

113
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,541
Actually. Can I
ask you a favor?

114
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,791
Hey, Misa.

115
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,916
Kai!

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,083
I didn't know you worked
this late. Good thing I stuck

117
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,500
it out for the last
five hours waiting for you.

118
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,166
You need to go.

119
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,541
She thanked you.

120
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,708
That's how she spent
her last breaths. On you.

121
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,916
Thanking you for giving her that
powered suit so she could walk.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,916
She wanted me to tell you.

123
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,375
I see.

124
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,416
Is that all! Mizuka's dead,
and that's all you can say?

125
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,250
It was that thing! The
powered suit you gave her.

126
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,750
It went out of
control! It killed her!

127
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,583
Don't you even care?

128
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,958
I'm sorry to hear
what happened to her.

129
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,708
Is that really all?

130
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,291
I'm not going to be able to
convince you to leave, am I?

131
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,166
Okay, get in.

132
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,416
Some guy named Sawada showed
up asking about Kimijima.

133
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,625
He knew I was a victim of
the Anemone Incident, too

134
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,500
and that Kimijima had
died around the same time.

135
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,208
Who is Kou Kimijima anyway?

136
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,375
And what connection
does he have to you?

137
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,375
What about Airi, then?
You know her, don't you?

138
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,916
I saw her at the hospital
earlier in the evening.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,291
She's awake now.

140
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,416
She remembers Kou Kimijima.
But she doesn't seem to

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,916
know much about the AI stuff.

142
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,083
You're the first person who's
visited me since I woke up.

143
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,791
It's nice to have company.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,083
What's today's
forecast? D'you know?

145
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,500
It looks like nice enough
weather out, I guess.

146
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,375
So you still don't
have anything to say?

147
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,416
Fine, then don't talk to me.

148
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,458
But Aki, the least you can
do is give her an explanation.

149
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,791
She doesn't get
what's going on with you.

150
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,375
She's done nothing
but work non-stop

151
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,208
to make your dream
come true. To catch up to

152
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,708
her older sister and
all that she's achieved.

153
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,541
She wrote to you. You know
she's in Tokyo right now.

154
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,791
So what? Why do you have to keep
pushing your own sister away?

155
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:08,708
I haven't been pushing her away.
I've simply stated the truth.

156
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,458
She's mediocre at best.
She doesn't have what it takes

157
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,666
to follow in my footsteps.

158
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,833
She can try, but she'll
just be wasting her time.

159
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,541
You can't mean that!

160
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:26,291
Of course I mean it. That's why
I told you to look after her.

161
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,666
What is wrong with you?

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,041
So many excited faces!
The Tokyo Expo 2020:

163
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,500
"Dream, Create, Innovate
Exhibition" begins today!

164
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:46,291
And the highlight of this year's
expo. You guessed it! Robots!

165
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,500
In fact, it's even referred
to as the Robot Expo!

166
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,416
Giant robots from around
the world have come to

167
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
fill the expo hall and amaze
the throngs of visitors!

168
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,208
That's impact. Compared
to that, we've got nothing!

169
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,125
Just a little more. There
we go. Now we just use the

170
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,125
special compact
laser power transmitter.

171
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,750
It was so nice of
my dad's friend to

172
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,958
agree to make this for us.

173
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,666
She's mediocre at best.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,708
Hello? Kai?

175
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,041
What's up?

176
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,666
Are you doing okay?

177
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,583
Did something happen
to you last night?

178
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,416
After you saw Airi? I mean,
you did get in pretty late.

179
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,791
No, I'm fine.
I could stand to

180
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,708
get a little more
sleep, that's all.

181
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,500
Hey.

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,791
So what's the deal? Is that
supposed to be GUNVARREL?

183
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
Well, uh...

184
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,041
Seriously? A robot from
an anime made by a murderer?

185
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,458
What the hell are you
doing bringing it here?

186
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,541
Did you guys
want something, or-?

187
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,750
Not from you!

188
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,958
Ah, crap!

189
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,000
Little Senomiya!

190
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,833
Thanks, Mitchi.

191
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you all right, kid?
No head injury or anything?

192
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,333
No, I'm okay.

193
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,000
It's about time you
packed up and went home.

194
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,916
Yeah, you and your
stupid-ass murder robot.

195
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,583
I've had enough of you!

196
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,250
Chesty! Chesty!
Boing, boing, boing!

197
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
How awful. It makes me sad.

198
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,041
I had no idea people
hated GUNVARREL so much.

199
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,750
It's not like the robot
did anything wrong.

200
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,458
That guy again?

201
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,625
Wyvern. X minus ninety minutes.

202
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,541
Roger that.

203
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,708
Exoskeleton's SUMERAGI concept
model has six legs and these

204
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:30,208
are controlled through the use
of a Finger-Operated System.

205
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,375
The design is streamlined
and easy to use.

206
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,708
Wow!

207
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,208
Way cool!

208
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,541
Attention, everyone!

209
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,500
What'd she say?

210
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,375
Greetings from Tanegashima.

211
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,583
We'll start up
our robot shortly.

212
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,041
I'd like to begin by
explaining the unique history

213
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,500
of this robot's development.

214
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,791
Approximately nine years ago,
the Robot Research Club's work

215
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,375
on the "Let's make
a life-size version

216
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,583
of GUNVARREL" project began.

217
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,291
Of course I realize
presenting a robot

218
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,000
modeled after GUNVARREL now--

219
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,625
Uh, Aki, you might
want to get to the point.

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,208
It's just the
longer you talk,

221
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,291
the smaller the
crowd seems to get.

222
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,416
But it has more impact if I
talk about how our history is

223
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,791
full of love,
courage, and honor!

224
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
Yeah, sorry, but
it really doesn't.

225
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,833
The boy is right.

226
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,708
Fine.

227
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,416
Here goes.
GunBuild-2, activate now!

228
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,125
Move forward!

229
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,625
Now, sideways march!

230
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,833
Not a very cool
robot, huh, Daddy?

231
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,291
No, not really.

232
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,375
You there! The boy who
thinks it's "not very cool."

233
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,375
Do me a favor and take a look
at GunBuild-2 through IRUO!

234
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,791
You'll find that
the real GUNVARREL

235
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
is standing before you!

236
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,291
Whoa!

237
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,166
GunBuild-2!
Pulverize Number 1!

238
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,000
A spirited blow!

239
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:12,041
As swift as the wind! A
strong as the sea! GUNVARREL!

240
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,166
If only it wasn't GUNVARREL.

241
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,833
Come on, Takashi, let's go.

242
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,500
Aww! But why, Daddy?
I want to see more!

243
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
Sorry, son. Mommy'll
be mad if she finds out

244
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,125
I let you see GUNVARREL.

245
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,500
Try not to let it
get to you too much.

246
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,375
Hey! Hey, lady!
Do it again! Do it again!

247
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,041
Do that last move! You
know, "as swift as the wind!"

248
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,750
Please? Pretty
please! One more time?

249
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:53,416
As swift as the wind! As
strong as the sea! GUNVARREL!

250
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,666
What's up?

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,250
I, uh. Ah.

252
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,958
Uh. Hewwo, everybody!
It's so very mice to be here!

253
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,791
Oh no. First Subaru,
and now her?

254
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,958
How's the
response been so far?

255
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,166
Well, we're
just getting started.

256
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,625
But we're confident
about winning it all!

257
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:33,458
Wow, what a bold declaration,
huh folks? Akiho Senomiya has

258
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,666
a famous older sister,
Misaki, who you may know

259
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,583
from Exoskeleton
Company commercials.

260
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,000
Has she had anything to say?

261
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,375
Oh, no. Not yet.
I'm sure she will.

262
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,958
Well, I do believe she's here.

263
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,333
Want to tell her about
your upcoming victory?

264
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,333
Huh?

265
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,791
Oh. Did nobody tell you?

266
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,750
Oh. Uh, yeah. We
expect to win, Misa!

267
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
Great! This has
been Akiho Senomiya of

268
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,708
the Tanegashima
Robot Research Club!

269
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,875
Where are you going?

270
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,791
I think they said
Exoskeleton's waiting room

271
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,625
is this way, didn't they?

272
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,416
Hold on.

273
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,291
What? Why?

274
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,166
Why don't you
put it off for a bit?

275
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,708
I don't think you should
go see Misa just yet.

276
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,500
Why not? Kai, do
you know something?

277
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,333
Well, no.

278
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,208
Wait! Aki, please!
Just wait a second!

279
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,875
Listen to me.

280
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,416
Hey, that's her, right?

281
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,416
Hey, Sis, it's me!
Misaki, wait up!

282
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,916
Please, Sis, it's me!
It's Akiho! You remember?

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,791
Well, of course you do.
I'm your sister, aren't I?

284
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,416
But it has been seven years
since we saw each other, huh?

285
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,541
I was just a kid then,
still in grade school.

286
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,291
So, maybe, you
don't recognize me.

287
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,708
Well, Aki. You've
really grown up.

288
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:28,708
Yeah. Oh, hey, have you seen
our robot yet? GunBuild-2.

289
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,458
The whole Robot
Research Club built it.

290
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,958
Aki. Are Mom and
Dad still doing well?

291
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,583
Oh, sure. Dad's
really excited about this

292
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,291
major rocket launch
that's coming up.

293
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,041
Hey, Misa! Why won't
you even look at us?

294
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,958
You haven't seen
your sister in years.

295
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,500
Misaki Senomiya.

296
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Why're you here?

297
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,541
Freeze.

298
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,458
Put your hands up. Do it now!

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,541
I said, put your
hands up. Slowly!

300
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,166
Do what he says, Misa.

301
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,875
Come on, Sis.

302
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,083
Aki. Is the rocket
launch happening soon?

303
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,958
Do you hear me,
Senomiya? Hands up, now!

304
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,625
No! Don't, Sis!

305
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,208
The sound of
gunshots fills the arena.

306
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:05,541
All over the globe, riots break
out, and senseless panic erupts.

307
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,666
The capital is paralyzed.

308
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,791
Unprecedented
disasters sweep the world.

309
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,458
Amidst the loss,
bewilderment and confusion,

310
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:18,208
Kai finally learns
the terrifying truth.

311
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,583
