1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,875
I have been waiting eagerly.
For the bright, chilly sky.

2
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:20,833
For the freezing wind. For the
fluttering, white snowflakes.

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,208
It has to be more than just
an ordinary snow, though.

4
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,500
It has to be something special.

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,791
A snow that's surprising,
almost miraculous.

6
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:41,333
Yes. Like soft, powdery snow
on Christmas Eve, for example.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,083
Weather lady! Weather
lady! Will it snow on

8
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:52,083
December 24th this year? Is
there going to be a miracle?

9
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,833
Man, this thing is
acting all screwy.

10
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,458
Do you think it's messed up
because of the solar storm?

11
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,333
I heard it's interfering
with a lot of

12
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,166
pads' function
and connectivity.

13
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,083
Makes sense. Kona was actually
griping to me earlier about

14
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,458
a bunch of PCs
being broken, too.

15
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,500
Well, it was a
pretty major storm.

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,458
That may be it. The storm could
be the reason IRUO's needed

17
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,208
so much maintenance lately.

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,625
Yeah, and maybe it's also
the reason we haven't decided

19
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,500
what to do after we graduate.

20
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,958
Hey! Good point! Which means
the horrible grade I got

21
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,166
on my finals was obviously...

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,916
No question. Totally
the solar storm's fault.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,125
Oh, my. What is this
place? Hello, excuse me!

24
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
Is anybody there?

25
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,791
Guys, it's a ghost! A ghost
in my pad! What do I do?

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,458
Airi?

27
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,791
Yeah, it's her. She's been
acting pretty strange lately.

28
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,208
She doesn't usually do this.
I don't think she's ever tried

29
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,875
to start a conversation
with anyone but me until now.

30
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,375
Do you think this is because
of the solar storm, too?

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,416
Okay, solar storm, GTFO!

32
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,291
Being responsible means
not blaming things on others.

33
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,708
Keep your spirits high.
We'll get through this!

34
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,041
GTFO, too, Genki bot.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
What the--? Uh-oh.

36
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,250
That was truly pathetic.
I didn't think it was even

37
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,791
possible to be that
bad at something.

38
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,333
Well hey, I warned you I
wasn't going to be any good.

39
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,083
Why do you think I ate ten
passion fruit buns up front?

40
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,666
'Cause I knew teaching me wasn't
gonna be easy for you to do.

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,458
I know, but seriously,
you're not even watching

42
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,250
the waves, Kai! It's no wonder
you can't so much as stand up.

43
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,291
That's all I can
take today. Let's go.

44
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,291
Wait, hey! Come back, Mizuka!

45
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,875
The real world is big,
but Airi's world was small.

46
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,750
That's why master made
Airi like this, so she could

47
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,791
learn a little about
the big, wide world.

48
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,083
Hey. Pay attention, will ya?
There's only one flag left

49
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,500
for the sixth Kimijima
report. "Go to the beach

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,666
and surf a wave for
three or more seconds."

51
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,375
That's the last thing
I hafta do to unlock it.

52
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,750
The weather forecast
for today, December 12th,

53
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,791
through tomorrow,
December 13th.

54
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,291
Those living in the
Tanegashima region can

55
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,375
expect clear,
cloudless skies. On the--

56
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,500
What the. She's glitching
up now? Not Airi, too.

57
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,833
Okay, Mom, I'm back now.

58
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,958
Yo.

59
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,375
So. What're you doing here?

60
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,375
Inviting you to
a Christmas party.

61
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,541
More like a drinking party.

62
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:54,458
I guess you could say that. All
the usuals are gonna be there.

63
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,500
Never thought I'd see the
day when you'd go down to

64
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,000
the ocean again. You
must be really passionate

65
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,708
about this gig as
Yashio's surfing coach, huh?

66
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,500
I don't think passionate's
the right way to put it.

67
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,750
I dunno. I guess I just...

68
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,458
Epic surfer fail, huh?

69
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,333
If you're gonna be
like that, I'm hanging up.

70
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,583
H-Have you seen
the IRUO notice?

71
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,583
Why? Something going on?

72
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,041
Th-They're doing extensive
maintenance. On the 24th.

73
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,833
It just had to be
right around Christmas.

74
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,625
When all the real-lifers come
crawling out of the woodwork.

75
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,583
What about people like me?
What about the shut-ins who

76
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,250
wanna see the world from the
comfort of their own homes?

77
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,333
That's tragic, but I don't
get what it has to do with me.

78
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, there's always a chance
they'll do a server reset

79
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,666
and wipe all
the existing data.

80
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,583
So, in other words,
Airi might go bye-bye, too.

81
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,958
This really sucks. I have to
access all the Kimijima Reports

82
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,750
by Christmas Eve, or they're
gonna disappear for good?

83
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,000
Wow, you're a jerk.

84
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,083
What about never getting
to talk to Airi anymore?

85
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,333
Talk about an epic sadface.
Although, if I had to choose,

86
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,708
I would pick Gezi
over Airi, so many more

87
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,791
possibilities for
depraved conversation!

88
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,083
Snow, snow, snow! Snow
is falling, falling down.

89
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,833
Snow is falling,
hit the ground!

90
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,916
Aw, loli-girl!

91
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,041
Oh, yeah. That reminds me,
Akiho said she wants to

92
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,375
throw a Christmas
party. And, uh.

93
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,291
She wanted to
invite Airi, too.

94
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,416
A C-Christmas party?
Like, IRL?

95
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,875
She was also very
enthusiastic about

96
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,166
the idea of
exchanging presents.

97
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,583
Ooh, Christmas
presents? Really?

98
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,791
I have lots of erotic
novels. You can have as many

99
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,791
as you want, my
lovely little loli! w00t!

100
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,708
The only present Airi wants
is snow! It would be like

101
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,500
a dream come true if there
was snow on Christmas Eve!

102
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,166
You see, that's what Airi
wishes for every year,

103
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,458
with her whole heart!
A white Christmas!

104
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,250
Watch the waves.

105
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,875
Gotta watch the waves.

106
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
I'm surfing!

107
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,458
Did you see that, Airi?
It was awesome!

108
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,083
I must've surfed that wave
for five whole seconds!

109
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,291
Fun! Now, would you like to hear
tomorrow's weather forecast?

110
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,208
The Tanegashima Region
can expect clear skies.

111
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,875
Gezi. Hey, what the--?

112
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,750
Will you please stop poking me
like that. It doesn't feel good.

113
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,291
'Kay, sorry. But I
really want to know

114
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,875
the flag completion status.

115
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,291
Right! Airi is on
the case! Let's see. Oh!

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,000
It looks like the final
flag has just been cleared!

117
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,250
The AR annotation
has been made visible!

118
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,583
Let's hurry up and find it!
Quick, it's going to snow!

119
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,208
Snow is falling, falling
down. Snow is falling.

120
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,291
December 23rd. The day
before Christmas Eve.

121
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,791
Yhe day Airi might've
disappeared for good.

122
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,416
That was the day I finally
found Kimijima Report Number 6.

123
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,333
Utilizing the media to
disseminate fabrication as

124
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,250
reality is already an
outdated method of persuasion.

125
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,208
Rather, twenty-first
century propaganda will

126
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,833
function by augmenting
fantasy into reality.

127
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,916
Why do these things have to be
so complicated and confusing?

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,708
They make my head hurt.
All right, Report Number 7

129
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,250
should be the final one.
What are the flags?

130
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,250
Leeet's seeee. In order
to access Report Number 7,

131
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,583
all six previous reports
need to be unlocked.

132
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,125
And that's all!

133
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,250
Wait, so that's it?
No missions to complete

134
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,750
like with the other ones?

135
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,875
Apparently not. It sounds
like it's been made visible now

136
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,375
but unfortunately,
I don't know where it is.

137
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,375
Man. Gimme a break.

138
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,083
Umm. Airi would really like to
go back to her home now, please.

139
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:10,750
Airi's birthday is tomorrow!
Airi wants to go home

140
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,541
for her birthday and Christmas
Eve. Would that be okay?

141
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,208
Wait, hold on. You were
programmed to have a birthday?

142
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,625
That's unusual.

143
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,083
Not really "programmed."
But Christmas Eve was the day

144
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,416
Airi first woke up, so
it's sort of like a birthday.

145
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,833
Oh. Okay, well, in that case,

146
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,125
what was programmed
as your home?

147
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,291
It isn't programmed!
It's really Airi's home!

148
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,666
It's the actual place where
Airi and her master lived!

149
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,666
We have to go to
Kimijima's place. Really?

150
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,083
It's completely falling apart.

151
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,875
Is that how you see it?
For Airi, it's still as nice

152
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,291
and tidy as she remembers
it being nine years ago.

153
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,791
So it is.

154
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,458
There's something about
this room. It seems familiar.

155
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,750
My master was an amazing
person! So sweet and kind!

156
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,833
Sometimes Airi would
cook for him as a way of

157
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,833
saying "thank you." That's
what this room was for.

158
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,416
I don't know how
that would work.

159
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,333
I've never heard of
an AI cooking before.

160
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,750
A basement?

161
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,791
Down there is where my
master has his work room.

162
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,916
Look at that.

163
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,875
It's just like the door in the
old museum. Which should mean.

164
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,208
Hidden Hand.

165
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,875
What does this machine do?

166
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,083
There should be some buttons
there. Do you see them?

167
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,416
Airi, what--?
I-I don't understand!

168
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,125
I haven't seen her in a long
time. Her name is Airi Yukifune.

169
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,458
She is the original Airi.

170
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,416
The original?

171
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,541
It's untreatable. That's what
the doctors said. "Untreatable."

172
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,750
My illness is serious, though
not actually life-threatening,

173
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,875
but I would suffer greatly
for the rest of my life.

174
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,958
That's what they said, anyway.

175
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,083
Eventually, I found the only
thing I ever looked forward to

176
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,916
was the weather forecast.

177
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,625
As I lay there, I told myself
that if a miracle happened

178
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,541
and our southern island had snow
on Christmas Eve, then maybe,

179
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,208
just maybe, I would
miraculously get better, too.

180
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,041
So as the end of December
rolled around every year,

181
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,833
I'd watch the weather
forecast a dozen times a day,

182
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,666
sighing every time
they predicted sunshine.

183
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,916
That's when I
met Kou Kimijima.

184
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
The man who would
become Airi's master.

185
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,916
He knew all about my
illness and how sick I was.

186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,833
So one day he gave me
the most wonderful present.

187
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,000
It was something he was
working on at the time.

188
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,958
Something incredible.

189
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,541
He gave me an
alpha version of IRUO.

190
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,916
With it, I got to travel to
places all around the world

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,958
and I could
talk to him about

192
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,083
all the exciting
adventures I had!

193
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,916
However, it wasn't long before
those pleasant days were

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,541
nothing more
than a nice memory.

195
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,166
My illness steadily worsened and
I gave up the childish idea that

196
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,833
a miracle would happen
and I'd be healed.

197
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,916
But when Kimijima
found this out, he said...

198
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,958
Oh, Airi, I'm so sorry.
But I think I may know a way

199
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,291
to make your wish
come true. However.

200
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,375
It would be very dangerous.

201
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,166
This is the
chamber you'll sleep in.

202
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,583
It will likely be
decades before you wake up.

203
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,041
But when you do,
things will be different.

204
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,583
You'll wake to an era when your
illness has become curable.

205
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,333
Although, I'm sure you'll be
lonely sleeping all that time,

206
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,125
so I'll make sure
you're able to dream.

207
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,458
And that's when he
created the Airi you know.

208
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,208
Inside IRUO.
My new dream world.

209
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,833
Good night for now,
my Sleeping Beauty.

210
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,458
Good night, Kimijima.
Thank you so much.

211
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,291
Sweet dreams, little one.

212
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,916
I went back and forth over it
for a long time, but I ended up

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,875
reporting the simple
truth to the police.

214
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,875
Time for tomorrow's weather
forecast. As usual for this time

215
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,916
of year, the Tanegashima region
will experience clear skies

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,875
and a zero percent
chance of precipitation.

217
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,416
Guess what Airi learned today.

218
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,125
"A kiss on a white Christmas
will make love blossom."

219
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,583
That's what the
weather lady said, anyway.

220
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,583
Hey, Brother, are you in love?

221
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,541
Dunno. That's a good question.

222
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,500
Evading it isn't fair.

223
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,333
All right, what about
you? Are you in love?

224
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,041
Airi can't be in love. That
sort of thing isn't included

225
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:49,166
in her programming. But,
as a girl, it is interesting.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
If it snows, will you.

227
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,458
What?

228
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,708
If a miracle does
happen, a kiss would be

229
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,125
a nice way to commemorate
it. Will you give me one?

230
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,916
Well, that's it.
Merry Christmas Eve!

231
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,791
It looks like it isn't
going to snow after all, huh?

232
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,458
I did have my hopes up a
little. Even so, Airi still had

233
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,833
a very nice time in her dream.

234
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,041
I'm so glad I got
to meet you, Brother.

235
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,125
Airi really loved
talking to you.

236
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,083
I'm glad we met, too, but
do you have to talk like that?

237
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,833
Like it's the end of
everything? It might not be.

238
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,291
There's still a chance
that whatever maintenance

239
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,875
they're doing won't
erase you, ya know.

240
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,458
I guess that's true. But
still, since it never snows,

241
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,750
I gave up believing in
miracles a long time ago.

242
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,666
Snowflakes. Look,
Brother, it's snowing!

243
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,208
Airi can see it, too!
All white and soft!

244
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,750
Looks like today's
weather report was wrong!

245
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,750
So now here's the
updated forecast for tonight!

246
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,083
In the Tanegashima
region, there will be...

247
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,833
...clear skies followed by snow!

248
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,708
Hey, Brother!

249
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,791
You remember the
promise from earlier?

250
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,583
Promise? Wait! You
really want me to kiss you?

251
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,791
I do! So, where
is it going to be?

252
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,375
On the forehead,
or on the cheek?

253
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,000
Or maybe it's on Airi's lips?

254
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,291
In case you're wondering,

255
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,541
the forehead would
be Airi's first choice.

256
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,166
Are you serious?

257
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,750
Oh, no! You're not going to
break your promise, are you?

258
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,916
Just when it's
finally snowing, too.

259
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:26,250
Brother. What's wrong?
Why is Airi crying like this?

260
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,125
I don't understand what's
happening. I don't feel sad.

261
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,375
Who knows, maybe
it's another glitch.

262
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,416
If that's the case, then
I should thank my master.

263
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,250
Because this is one glitch
that Airi doesn't mind so much.

264
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,083
Thank you, Brother.

265
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,750
Having a crane
makes this a lot faster.

266
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,000
So what do you think?

267
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,375
Is the monopole motor
really going to work?

268
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,583
Oh yeah! I'm totally fired up!

269
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,291
So, Yashio, what's the deal.
Have you tried calling for

270
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,125
Airi since they finished
the maintenance on IRUO?

271
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,041
Why would I? There's
no point. She was erased.

272
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,291
Well, why don't you
give it a try, anyway?

273
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,041
Like right now, I mean.
What could it hurt?

274
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,083
Airi.

275
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,166
See? It's like
I said, she's gone.

276
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,458
They deleted her like
a virus from a hard drive.

277
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,166
You're sure? But I could have
sworn I saw Airi just yesterday.

278
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,375
Really? Well if so,
then why didn't she

279
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,875
show up when I called her?

280
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,666
Because she isn't here.

281
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,166
Airi is gone.
The only one left is--

282
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,750
It's Gezi!

283
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,500
Yes. Accordingly, there will be
some changes to our interaction.

284
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,583
There is no need to
touch, no need to tap,

285
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,583
and certainly no need to
kiss me on the forehead.

286
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,041
Kiss your forehead? But.

287
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,041
Hold on a second! You
actually remember that?

288
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,541
I am not sure. It is
not immediately clear why

289
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,541
Gezi referred to you kissing
her on the forehead just now.

290
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,791
A check is underway to search
for any possible viruses.

291
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,083
Well, I couldn't say if it's
a virus or not, but either way

292
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,000
it's perfectly all right with
me. I know this is a little

293
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,416
late, but Merry Christmas to
you, Gezi, and to Airi, too.

294
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,625
And the same to you,
Yashio. Merry Christmas.

295
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,333
Gunbuild 2 is finally
on the way to completion.

296
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:05,583
A Monopole motor-drive system.
A laser-based power supply.

297
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,875
Despite the many
obstacles to be faced,

298
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,416
Aki is excited about
the upcoming expo,

299
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,625
but what tragedy will occur
when Mizuka confronts Kai

300
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,916
while he searches for yet
another Kimijima Report?

301
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,458
Episode 16.

302
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,916
