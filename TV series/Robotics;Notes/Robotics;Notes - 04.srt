1
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,166
I remember May twenty-first
of two thousand and ten well.

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,458
Aww. I lose again?

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,791
Twelve wins in a row! You need
ten more years' experience

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,583
if you want to
beat the master.

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,041
One more match! Please!

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,958
I promise I won't ask again!

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,291
Oh my gosh!

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,625
You guys ready?
It's almost time!

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,125
Wake up!

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,750
Sleepy.

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,416
Worried face. Pig snout!

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,208
Come on, sleepy head!

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,875
The rocket's about to launch!

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:56,916
[QUIET CHATTER]

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,833
[QUIET CHATTER]

16
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,583
Wow! It's so awesome!

17
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,833
Amazing! There it goes!

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,083
Yeah! Alright!
Go, Hot Dog, go!

19
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,500
What does that mean?

20
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,916
It's a line from an old movie.
Listen, when you grow up, Kai,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,833
I want you to be a man
with the "right stuff," okay?

22
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,125
Yeah, I remember that day.

23
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,750
It was four months
before the incident.

24
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,791
What's taking Aki so long?

25
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,916
Drawing upon
our long relationship,

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,541
the Chuo Tanegashima High
School Robot Research Club

27
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,500
requests the following
three things from JAXA.

28
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,041
Number one. Facilities
for assembling a robot.

29
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,625
Number two. Personnel versed
in robotic engineering.

30
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,291
And number three. At least one
million yen in research funds.

31
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,916
One million?

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,875
Yes. That is the
absolute minimum we require.

33
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,083
One million.

34
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:48,291
Very well.
I understand your requests,

35
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,750
but before we speak further.

36
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,125
Your dear old dad
could use a restroom break.

37
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,166
No you don't! You're just
trying to avoid the whole issue!

38
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,958
No, it's not like
that at all, I promise.

39
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,833
But you're the director of
the Tanegashima Space Center!

40
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,416
You can make
this happen, can't you?

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,458
Sure, I am
technically the director,

42
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,125
but I have all the power
of a mid-level manager.

43
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,125
I basically just do what
my superior asks me to.

44
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,708
Don't ruin my image of
you like that! You're my dad!

45
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,458
You're supposed to be my hero!

46
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,166
Come on, Kai, help me out.
Say something!

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,000
Uh.

48
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,708
GunBuild-1 is a special project!
It's not some ordinary robot!

49
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,750
Misaki was the
one who started it, and now

50
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,500
it's the culmination of
both your daughters' dreams!

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,208
Hmm. Oh, okay.

52
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,833
Tell you what, sweetie, I'll
talk it over with your mother.

53
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,333
You know she
doesn't understand dreams

54
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,083
or lofty ideals or
anything like that!

55
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,750
Not like you, Dad.
You were different!

56
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,958
You were the passionate one,

57
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,291
always daring to
go for your dreams

58
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,416
and stay true to yourself!
My whole life,

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
as long as I can remember,
I've loved that about you!

60
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,750
Thank you, sweetie.

61
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,000
But not now, it's like
all of your passion

62
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,666
has just evaporated!
It makes me so sad!

63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,500
But if there is still
some fire in your heart.

64
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:08,583
If you still are the dad
I love. Then you'll help me--

65
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,333
Hello?

66
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Exactly what do
you think you're doing,

67
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,500
barging into your
father's workplace

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,000
and pestering him for money.

69
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,791
Please, Mom, I just wanted-- 

70
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,500
Oh, no... Don't give me that!

71
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,916
Your father may
be lenient with you,

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250
but I don't remember raising
such a conniving little-

73
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,625
Well, that was an epic bust.
I was just about ready

74
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,541
to let loose with a
GUNVAL Ankh Striker in there.

75
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,125
It was never gonna happen.
Your demands are crazy.

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,458
What did you expect
them to be able to help with?

77
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,958
The TNSC is just
a rocket launch site.

78
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,875
I know that, but JAXA does
have an astrorobotics branch.

79
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,708
I thought they'd be interested.

80
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,208
Like I told you before
you left for the meeting.

81
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,291
If you want help
from the Robotics Division,

82
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,458
look further out.

83
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,083
You should go to
Tokyo or Tsukuba, instead.

84
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,041
"Why must you always
insist on quibbling?!"

85
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,125
Sorry to say it, but I
think he might have a point.

86
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,333
Huh?! You're siding
with him, you traitor?!

87
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,625
And here I was planning to let
you be GunBuild-1's pilot, too.

88
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,416
Pilot that monster? Me?

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,666
Yeah, that's pretty
much the last thing I want.

90
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,458
What?! But the
pilot's the star of the show!

91
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,666
It'd be an honor!

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,833
You know what they say:
"One man's honor

93
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,416
is another man's
human sacrifice."

94
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,125
You're too kind-hearted
for your own good, Yashio.

95
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,916
If it was me, I'd be
headed for the hills by now.

96
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,208
You two are impossible!
Fine, then!

97
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,250
At least there's still the

98
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,916
ROBO-ONE prize money
to work with.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,625
I'll just use that to
finish GUNVARRELL on my own!

100
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:38,541
So, here's the deal. There's
no money coming your way.

101
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,791
You know I'm talking about
the prize money, Mitchi,

102
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,000
and not a
personal contribution. Right?

103
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,875
Yeah. I know that.

104
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,583
I swear, I will call
the police!

105
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,166
You really think
I would pocket your money?!

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,750
This is how things work
in the public school system.

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,166
The prize money
will be added to

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,500
your club's funds
for the next school year.

109
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,916
The next school year?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,750
Yep. Next April, to be exact.

111
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,416
But I'll have
graduated by then.

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,166
You might get held back.

113
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah, thanks.

114
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,125
A tip from me to you,
Little Senomiya.

115
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,750
Don't call me that, Mitchi!

116
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,708
Oh yeah? Well,
then don't call me Mitchi!

117
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,041
Now, listen to me yo--

118
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,666
Great! What am I
gonna do now?

119
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,875
I still owe
Doc a ton of money!

120
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,625
Guess the only choice
at this point is to give up.

121
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,583
I'm with him.

122
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,166
Ugh! I hate you two!

123
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,041
Huh?

124
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,416
What's up?

125
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm gonna go home now.

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,458
Yeah. Fine, go!

127
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,375
According to this.

128
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,250
That's where
I'm supposed to go?

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,666
That's the Thunder Emperor.

130
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,333
Well you're not exactly dressed
for the occasion are you?

131
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:18,541
Huh?

132
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,166
Listen. When you're
doin' stuff like this,

133
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,250
it's usually a good idea
to wear your gym clothes.

134
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
Just a tip from me to you.

135
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,916
What do you mean
"stuff like this"?

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,791
All I got was a
message to come here.

137
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,708
Yeah. It kinda
took me by surprise.

138
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,333
I didn't think you and
Furugori knew each other.

139
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,708
Furugori?

140
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
When did you two hook up?

141
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,875
When we went to Tokyo?
You're a stud!

142
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,625
It sounds like somebody's
just been messing with me.

143
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,041
Kay, I'm outta here.

144
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,250
No!

145
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:53,500
You would go without helping me?
I hate this stupid island.

146
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,208
Totally unacceptable.

147
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,833
Hold on, you're
FRAUKOUJIRO, aren't you?

148
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,583
That's a new one.
A nickname or something?

149
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,958
Huh? So, her real
name's Furugori?

150
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,041
Yeah, that's right.
Kona Furugori.

151
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,333
She's transferring to
Chuo Tanegashima High School

152
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,375
starting tomorrow.

153
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,416
Kona.

154
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,125
Use that meatspace
handle and die!

155
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,000
Tera-barfy.

156
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,291
I don't really understand,
but whatever.

157
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,666
C'mon, let's get started.
There's a lot to do.

158
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,333
Huh? Start what?

159
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, helping her
move in, obviously.

160
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,458
That stupid assistant
principal. Why should I have

161
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,208
to help some new student
lug around stupid boxes?

162
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,458
Moving in?
This is where you live?

163
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,416
It's been bought.

164
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,750
By who?

165
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,833
By me, obviously.

166
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,291
Hey! Yashio!

167
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,666
Come here, gimme a
hand, will ya?

168
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,666
Forget it.
I'm getting outta here.

169
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,291
Look, if you really want
my help moving your stuff,

170
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,541
you're gonna have to beat
me in a KILL-BALLAD match.

171
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,458
You-- You asked
for programming code,

172
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,958
and I gave it
to you, didn't I?

173
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,916
Y-You owe me one, IMHO.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,541
See, Frau is
willing to help others,

175
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,250
but not without getting
something for it in return.

176
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,208
Remove the cockpit? No way!

177
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,166
Giant robots are
designed to be ridden in!

178
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,916
Once, but these blueprints
are from ten years ago.

179
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,500
These days,

180
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,041
the remote-controlled
types are the norm.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,833
This exterior
needs to come off, too.

182
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,916
What?! That would look stupid!

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,458
Look, I'm sorry,
but it's gotta go.

184
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,875
This robot already has
enough weight issues as it is.

185
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,833
Do you honestly hope to
take something as defective

186
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,000
as this junk pile
to the Expo? I mean--

187
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,125
Don't talk about it that way!

188
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,458
GunBuild-1 has been
around from the start.

189
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,375
The first Robot Research Club
members worked hard on it!

190
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,416
It represents
the club's history!

191
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,583
There's no way I'm gonna
tear it apart, piece by piece!

192
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,875
So that's a big, fat "no"

193
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,750
to everything you
just suggested okay?

194
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,791
Fine. Whatever. I was
just trying to do my part

195
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,666
as a member of the club, but
if you don't want to listen.

196
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,250
Dismantle it? I can't.

197
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,416
Hey, what's up?
How're you feeling?

198
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,041
At the moment? Horrible.

199
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,583
Then I have something
equally horrible to tell you.

200
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,750
You know the
Space Candy I always eat?

201
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,583
Guess who runs the company?

202
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,041
No idea.

203
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,916
Mitchi's uncle, apparently.
This sucks.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I've been giving money
to the Nagafukada family

205
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,416
this whole time.

206
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,541
And?

207
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,833
It kinda makes me
want to ask for it back,

208
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,375
and then the club would
actually have some money

209
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,291
to continue the project.

210
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,375
Once again, thank you
for the infor--

211
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,083
I see you're as good
a friend to her as ever.

212
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,416
What's up? Are your
legs bothering you again?

213
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,250
No, just doing a tune-up.

214
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,583
I like to take care
of this much myself.

215
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,708
The Crash happened
back in twenty-fifteen,

216
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,250
so I've had this
for about four years now.

217
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,333
It's held up really well.

218
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,291
Good thing, too. I bet it
would be pretty hard for you

219
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,541
to toss out something
Misa sent you.

220
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,500
Hey! Is there anybody in here?

221
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
I've got a delivery!

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,166
Hello?

223
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,125
thx.

224
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,291
Man, you look like
a ghost back there.

225
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,958
Whazzis?

226
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh, it's Skal. I guess you
don't see it much in Tokyo.

227
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,791
TY.

228
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,333
What?

229
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,250
thx.

230
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,125
Your comprehension
is full of fail!

231
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,291
Sure, whatever.
Anyway, I'm leaving.

232
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,500
Are you gonna be
okay here all by yourself?

233
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,541
The renovations are
scheduled to begin tomorrow.

234
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,500
Securing this place is
my top priority. No question.

235
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,125
There's my collection
of sordid images to think of.

236
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,333
It easily exceeds
one tera in size.

237
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,166
In that case,
wouldn't a normal house

238
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,625
have been the better choice?

239
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:27,000
GTFO! The "abandoned ruins"
vibe here is way cute, IMO.

240
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,291
I just need hot shirtless
men to guard it, plzkthx!

241
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,291
What about your parents?

242
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,541
AFK.

243
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,666
What?

244
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,375
NSFW.

245
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,083
Uh.

246
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,041
Did I say AMA? Fine.

247
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,625
My dad's in Tokyo,
and my mom...

248
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
Your mom is?

249
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,833
I'm home.

250
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,208
All right, it's the
bottom of the third

251
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,250
and the pitcher takes the mound.

252
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,208
Know what I heard today?

253
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,583
Apparently there was
one of those

254
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,791
robot tournaments last week.

255
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,541
Oh was there, really?
I wouldn't know.

256
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,166
I've given up robots,
after all.

257
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,166
It appears that Yokoyama
is back in full form, indeed.

258
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,333
We all know he was plagued
with injuries last season,

259
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,250
but from his pitching
form today it's almost as if

260
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,083
nothing ever--

261
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,958
I never knew you
had such adorable pupils

262
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,416
at that school of yours!
Look at her!

263
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,000
She's a darling little thing!

264
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,041
I dunno. You got the
"little" part right, though.

265
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,250
I can't believe I'm asking
these people for help.

266
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,208
Anyway, what do you
think of my proposal?

267
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,666
Will you consider
backing our club?

268
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,833
I'd like to sponsor you,

269
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,291
but I'm afraid you
lack impact, you see.

270
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,916
No, I don't see.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,458
Something that'll
make the young bucks sit up

272
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,875
and pay attention.
Somethin' with pow!

273
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,625
Chesty! Chesty!

274
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,125
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

275
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,833
Exactly right, my friend.
Just like that.

276
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,291
Um "boing, boing?"
I don't follow.

277
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,083
Well, you know,
a girl who's got a bit more

278
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,583
to offer in the chest area.

279
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,833
Come on, Uncle, that's not a
very polite thing to say,

280
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,833
especially to her.
Right, Little Senomiya?

281
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,541
Ah! I get it!

282
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,375
GUNVAL Ankh Strikeeeer!

283
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,541
Hey, can we talk?

284
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,041
I must be hearing things!

285
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,916
The great Mr. Pleiades
wants to talk to me?

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,583
Don't call me that. I actually
want to ask you something.

287
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,125
It's about ROBO-ONE.
The first world championship

288
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,125
is next month in Las Vegas.

289
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,500
I've been chosen
to represent Japan.

290
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,875
You don't say.

291
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,625
I was wondering if
you would team up with--

292
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,625
I think I'll pass, thanks.

293
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,958
Already? But I haven't
even finished talking yet.

294
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,166
Don't worry, it's alright.

295
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,541
I wasn't gonna
pay attention anyway.

296
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,666
You fought so well
in the last tournament.

297
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,625
If we were a team,
we could take on the world,

298
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,541
doesn't that interest you?

299
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:01,000
Hold on a sec. Are you
into me or something?

300
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,333
Okay, I'll be frank.
I honestly cannot stand you.

301
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,375
Well, I'm glad
to hear it's mutual.

302
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:13,125
But, I admire your
skills as an operator.

303
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,625
Yeah, I really couldn't care
less what you think about me.

304
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,750
Then I challenge
you to KILL-BALLAD.

305
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,750
If I beat you,
you'll do whatever I say.

306
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,916
No questions asked.

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,500
So. Do you wanna play?

308
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,500
Or are you afraid of losing?

309
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,541
That was a complete
and utter waste of time.

310
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,416
Kai?

311
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,416
Seriously?
You lost at KILL-BALLAD?!

312
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,041
Well, I won
twenty-one in a row,

313
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,458
but then lost the
twenty-second. I'm an idiot.

314
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,083
I should have set a limit
on the number of matches.

315
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,250
What?

316
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,250
Oh, I just find it funny that
you're Subaru's sidekick now.

317
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,583
I have to do it,
on my honor as a gamer.

318
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,166
Then play me! And if
I win, you'll be my underling!

319
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,166
I dunno.
Don't think that'd happen,

320
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,750
even if I didn't limit
the number of battles.

321
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,583
Oh, that's it!
Now I'm fired up!

322
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,583
I doubt that's gonna help.

323
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,416
Where is Subaru, anyway?

324
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,750
He went over to talk
to Frau. Apparently he wanted

325
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,708
to ask her about this
thing's control program.

326
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,000
Frau who?

327
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,416
From KB. She just
moved to Tanegashima.

328
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,875
What's the password?

329
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,250
Hi. My name's Subaru Hidaka.

330
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:45,125
I'm in the same class
as you-- U-Umm. Hello?

331
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,208
It's her program.
Her intellectual property.

332
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't use it unless
I can get her permission.

333
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,750
Whoa, in that case,
you can count me out. Sorry.

334
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,125
We had a deal, remember?
You agreed to do whatever

335
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,041
I said if I beat you.

336
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,666
It's nice to see you
put in your place.

337
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,625
Hey, hold on a second! If
you two are gonna be spending

338
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,208
all your time getting
ready for this tournament,

339
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,500
then what's gonna happen with
construction on GunBuild-1?

340
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,666
It won't be much different,

341
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,666
it's not like I
was gonna help out anyway.

342
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,791
What?! Ahh..
GUNVAL Ankh Strikeeer!

343
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,458
All right. Let's begin.

344
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,083
We can worry about the
control program another day.

345
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,000
For now, you need to
familiarize yourself with

346
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,083
the M45's specialties
and fighting style.

347
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,958
Just "hang back
and wait," right?

348
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,291
Yes. You stay put until
the opponent rushes forward,

349
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,125
then grab and throw.

350
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,708
The passive approach
really isn't my thing.

351
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,625
That's not all. I've added
something to make up for such a

352
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,083
short-range attack.
See those Pile Bunkers?

353
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,000
How do you aim?

354
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,833
You don't need to.
If you fire one of them off

355
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,708
at this speed while
the enemy is in range.

356
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,000
You can't miss.

357
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,708
Hey, you can't use the Honorary
Chief as a punching bag!

358
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,458
Except when we fought,
you were able to dodge it.

359
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,916
Your reaction time during
that battle was inhuman.

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,083
I can't dismiss it as nonsense.

361
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,250
It was unbelievable. Do you
think you could show me again?

362
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,000
Not right now, thanks.

363
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,541
I've racked my brain,
but I still can't figure out

364
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,166
how you managed it.
Please, explain!

365
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,541
I'd rather not.

366
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,041
Go on, Kai.

367
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,458
I can tell you this.
It wasn't some kind of

368
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,583
special attack move
or anything like that.

369
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,041
It happened four months
after the day we all watched

370
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,708
the H2 rocket launch.

371
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,625
It was on September 11th,
two thousand-ten.

372
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,291
There was a mass fainting aboard
a ship called the Anemone.

373
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,125
We had just finished
a sightseeing tour

374
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,041
as part of a school field trip.
We were sailing back from

375
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,333
Kagoshima when
the incident occurred.

376
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,500
To this day,
nobody knows what caused

377
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,583
everyone onboard
that ferry to pass out.

378
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,250
There was more to it than
fainting for Aki and me, though.

379
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,833
We were the only ones who

380
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,666
experienced severe
side effects afterward.

381
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,375
Something known as the
Elephant-Mouse Syndrome.

382
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,000
It causes "Slow-Motion"
and "Fast-Forward" attacks.

383
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,041
The guy's younger than I am.
I can't let him get to me.

384
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,750
Oh, well.
That's over and done with.

385
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,875
Who the heck's TAGIRINGER?
What the--?

386
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,625
Who's Gezi? Signal
interference or something?

387
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,500
Huh?

388
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,500
Hello? Can you hear me?

389
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,916
Can you hear me?

390
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,208
Kai sets out to learn more about
the strange encounter he had

391
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,166
in the park and the confusing
message that he received.

392
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,708
While he and Junna are looking
into the island's urban legends

393
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,791
and rumors about
supernatural occurrences,

394
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,166
they discover a series

395
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,375
of odd events that have
taken place on Tanegashima.

396
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,500
Inside an old
abandoned building,

397
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,791
Kai comes upon what appears

398
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,541
to be the ghost
of a young girl,

399
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,291
one who has been watching
him for a very long time.

400
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,166
Episode 5!

401
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,375
Let's hit it off, everybody!

402
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,666
Later days!
