1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,583
As you can see, I am
an individual personality.

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,875
One that exists
within the network.

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,000
One with everlasting life.

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,541
Kimijima. He's alive.

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,541
If everything had
gone as I intended,

6
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,875
my transference
would have been flawless

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,208
but while conducting an EM
wave irradiation experiment,

8
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,541
I had the misfortune of being
murdered by Misaki Senomiya.

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,666
Huh?

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,750
Oh, you didn't
know? Interesting.

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,916
Especially considering
that's the only reason

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,666
that the two of you survived.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,083
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,000
He means the Anemone Incident.

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,875
That's correct. As I said,
I was doing an experiment

16
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,041
and the passengers
on the Anemone had

17
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,458
the distinction of
being my guinea pigs.

18
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,833
Unfortunately,
Misaki Senomiya found out

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,333
about the experiment,
and she wasn't pleased.

20
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,000
Mail from Furugori?

21
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,500
What a nuisance.
She just had to interfere.

22
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,541
In this case, apparently,
interference meant

23
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,250
splitting my head open
like an overripe cantaloupe.

24
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,750
What is this?

25
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,583
Misaki did that?

26
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,541
So, about a month later,
I decided it was time to pay

27
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,291
murderess Misaki a little visit
and chat about what she'd done.

28
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,583
Her feelings of guilt were
so intense it was simple for me

29
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,541
to make use of them. I
threatened her by describing

30
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,125
just how easily I could bring
her crime to the light of day.

31
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,250
She was more obstinate
than I expected, though.

32
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:51,583
"No matter what you do," I said,
"you'll never be rid of me."

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,125
"Don't you understand
yet how easily I can

34
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,250
harm that which
you hold dear?"

35
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,750
And with those
threats... she succumbed.

36
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,958
They all do in the
end, right, little one?

37
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,333
Now then. Project Atum
was originally slated to

38
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,625
begin in 2015. We're
already behind schedule.

39
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,416
It would be a shame
to waste more time now.

40
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,125
Especially when you consider
the fact that Misaki Senomiya

41
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,791
threw her life away so that
the project could succeed.

42
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
I'm done listening!

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Aki, no!

44
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,916
Little Senomiya,
is that good idea?

45
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,083
I have a question
about my sister.

46
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,333
Does she still like
robots the way she used to?

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,916
That's your question?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,750
Answer me! Does she
still like robots?

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,208
I couldn't really say. But
she spent all of her free time

50
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,250
playing some kind
of robot video game.

51
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,916
I believe the game
was called KILLBALLAD.

52
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,166
That's so good to hear.

53
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,125
There's your answer.
So, are you satisfied now?

54
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,625
Yes, I am. See, robots
represent a kind of bond.

55
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,416
They are a form of hope.

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,083
The culmination of
hard work with friends.

57
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,083
Robots can't talk, fight,
or even walk correctly unless

58
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,250
you give them
clear directions.

59
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,666
They're like helpless,
high-maintenance children.

60
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,958
But if you open
your heart to them,

61
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,875
they'll open theirs to you.

62
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,583
The original GunBuild,
the new GunBuild-2,

63
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,833
and even little
Tanegashi Machine.

64
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,000
All of them, they're
like children to me.

65
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Robots are precious things.

66
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,208
And yet, my sister
destroyed them.

67
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,458
I wonder how she felt when she
did it. Was it painful for her?

68
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,416
Or maybe, she couldn't
feel anything at all.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,083
That's why, I swear to you.

70
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,333
Be careful, Aki.

71
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,416
I swear it. You will
pay. Your mind games

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,833
and manipulation
made my sister do this!

73
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,500
Do you hear me? I am
going to make you pay!

74
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,916
What a lovely speech. I
can't wait to see you try.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,500
Of course, that's assuming
you live long enough to.

76
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,583
Get back!

77
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,625
Everyone knows there's
one thing that always defeats

78
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,041
a robot of evil.
A robot of justice!

79
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,208
You might not
know this, Kimijima,

80
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,375
but I'm happy to fill you in.

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,041
They're more
than hobbies, toys.

82
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,416
The world itself
has been saved dozens,

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,416
no, hundreds, of times
by giant robots of justice!

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,041
And it's going to happen again!

85
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,458
A robot will save
it this time, too!

86
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,291
The robot that we built!
The robot that we filled with

87
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,333
our dreams! It'll defeat
that evil robot of yours!

88
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,958
It'll defeat you!
It'll defeat my sister!

89
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,333
It's going to save
the entire world!

90
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,875
You, Kou Kimijima, the
Committee of Three Hundred,

91
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,291
Project Atum, you
can go straight to hell!

92
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,875
And my sister, too!
I've had enough!

93
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,833
I won't let my perfect,
superhuman sister beat me!

94
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,916
I'll say it again and again!
Good will triumph over evil!

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,958
We will triumph over you!

96
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,041
And I swear, we're
going to save my sister!

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,458
That was superb. Just
superb. I'm deeply moved.

98
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,458
Let me see if
I have this right.

99
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,666
What you're saying is you're
going to let this girl die

100
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,250
so you can kill
your own dear sister.

101
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,041
Now let's see
how much you like it

102
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,958
after your threats
become reality.

103
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,750
Wait, no! Stop!

104
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,166
Chesty!

105
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,916
No boing boing!
She ain't chesty!

106
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,416
Good job! Well done, Taro!

107
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,875
Airi!

108
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,500
Where'd he go?

109
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,291
He up and vanished.

110
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,250
That's you. A giant
robot of justice.

111
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,458
Are you okay?

112
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,458
Yes, I'm fine.
Why are you here?

113
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh, well, I uh, I felt like
I needed to be doing something,

114
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,791
so I guess I
just ended up here.

115
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,541
I understand.

116
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,916
Did you see the feed
from the Chofu runway?

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,208
The speech Akiho made?

118
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,625
Yes.

119
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm certain this is the giant
robot she was referring to.

120
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,333
Umm, Hidaka.

121
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,333
I wanted to, I just,
I never got the chance to

122
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,125
apologize properly until now.

123
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,250
I'm so, so sorry.

124
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,625
If that's really how you feel,
could you do me a favor?

125
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,291
What do you mean?

126
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,125
If you really want to make
it up to me, the best way I can

127
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,666
think of for you to do
that is not say "I'm sorry."

128
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,583
Trading favors with
an older female student

129
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,458
in lieu of an apology.

130
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,875
Sexual favors, I assume.
Is this a new erotic game?

131
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,583
Furugori, hey.

132
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,791
Oh good. Looks like we've got
the whole gang together again.

133
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,291
Yo. I figured I'd
find you all here.

134
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,333
Grandpa! Why are you here?

135
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,916
Heh. I saw that brat
screamin' like the rest of ya.

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,708
She's plannin' to cause
some trouble I'm guessing?

137
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,291
Most likely.

138
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,750
But first things first. We need
to get it in working order.

139
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,125
So it's true, then.

140
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,500
What's true?

141
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,625
I wondered why your face
had been looking so strained

142
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,166
and pale all the time lately.

143
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
With what happened
to Aki and Kai--

144
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,583
Look, I'm not gonna
tell anyone else.

145
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,458
I'm not gonna
tell you to confess.

146
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,916
And obviously, I'm not gonna
go to the cops about it myself.

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,500
I just want to help you and
I want to be there for you.

148
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,291
If only I'd told you then, maybe
you could have said something.

149
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,166
Yelled at me. Gotten
me to stop somehow.

150
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,541
You're a stubborn
girl, too, aren't you?

151
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,583
You still don't realize
it's pointless to try?

152
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,208
I told you, you're going to
work for me until the very end.

153
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,041
Aki. Kai.

154
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,291
You are a tough one,
though, I'll give you that.

155
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,333
When I take control, you
become little more than

156
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,541
a shell, a puppet
without the ability to

157
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,625
think for itself or move
its body of its own will.

158
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,916
And yet you
never stop fighting.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,333
Aki. Aki.

160
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,666
Old Tanegashima? But, why?

161
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,041
That's perfect. We can
go straight to the hangar.

162
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,583
How can you be so relaxed
about this crazy plan?

163
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,125
The old airport hasn't
even been used in years!

164
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,041
Well, that's true enough.
However, we can't seem to

165
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,916
get a hold of New
Tanegashima airport, so--

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,375
So that means Misa's group
has probably taken it over.

167
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,000
Hey, we're here! Tanegashima!

168
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,291
It's kind of weird.
It feels like we've been

169
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,458
gone a long time, huh?

170
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,458
Has Tanegashima
always been this small?

171
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:25,375
Huh? I was just wondering.
"Has it always been this big?"

172
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,041
Funny. Maybe it is.

173
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,458
What?

174
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,500
This island's really small
but it's also really big.

175
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,791
So maybe it's both.

176
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,041
Alright. Now we can see
what we're doing, at least.

177
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,541
Hey, is that a plane?

178
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,000
Is it just me, or
is it mega close by?

179
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,708
Yeah, it's close!
Really close!

180
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,833
It's headed right this way.

181
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,916
Seriously? Don't
they know how long ago

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,125
they shut this place down?

183
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,916
It's still coming.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,458
Whoa, look!

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,375
WTF?

186
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,125
It's making a belly landing.

187
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,583
It seems to be
heading right for us.

188
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, it's definitely
coming in this direction.

189
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,875
Maybe we should run for it?

190
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,083
We should definitely run!

191
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,083
I wonder who's on board.

192
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,708
Maybe it's some kind
of time traveling warrior.

193
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,000
Only pretty boys need apply!

194
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,416
Who is that little girl?

195
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,375
Look! It's Airi!

196
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,541
Huh?

197
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,458
Hey, there's the chief.

198
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,458
And Yashio's with them.

199
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,166
Chief!

200
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,458
You're here.
All of you! But why?

201
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,625
Oh. Well, we, uh--

202
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,333
I'm guessing you saw the
little video I posted, huh?

203
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,375
What? What are
you talking about?

204
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,375
Yeah. Never mind.
Who's the angel?

205
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,458
Oh. You haven't
met, have you?

206
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,666
Nice to meet you.
I'm Airi Yukifune.

207
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,541
Sorry to impose.
I just sort of came along.

208
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,541
Uh, hi.

209
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,291
Hold on! I'll tell you
exactly what happened, okay?

210
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,708
My intended bride, who
I always thought was 2D,

211
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,083
turned 3D and fell
from the starry sky!

212
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,791
People may say I've
read too many light novels

213
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,958
for my own good. But it
isn't like that at all!

214
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,458
It's best if you ignore her.

215
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,625
Due to the chaos following the
news about the solar storm,

216
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,833
JAXA employees and others
who couldn't make it home

217
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,416
have taken shelter
here in the school

218
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,333
and the gym at
the sports park.

219
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,166
So after their failed
raid on the airport

220
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
and the botched kidnap
attempt on Frau Bow,

221
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,875
the armed guerillas only
have control of JAXA now?

222
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,041
That's correct.

223
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,500
What about the cops?

224
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,166
Confused. The solar
storm disinformation

225
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,416
still has them in
a state of panic.

226
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,625
So it's played out
exactly as Kimijima planned.

227
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,041
Hey. All set. Doc's here.

228
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,541
Really?

229
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,583
Yep. And now I'm gonna show
Airi to the nurse's office.

230
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,583
I'll catch ya later.

231
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,166
Are you feeling all right?

232
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,375
Yes. I'm doing much better now.
Thank you again for everything.

233
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,625
This is GunBuild-1.

234
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,250
Yeah. For starters we're
gonna replace all the motors

235
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,125
with monopoles and
increase its mobility.

236
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,541
And we're also
planning to attach

237
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,708
a couple of Pile
Bunkers to its hands.

238
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,916
Pile bunk-- Do we
have any of those?

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,041
Got some I built
for kicks a while back.

240
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,833
He says with a l33t
look on his face.

241
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,041
That's great, but is there
really enough time to modify it?

242
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,541
There ain't no
"can we do it."

243
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,875
We gotta do it!
Don't ask, just rock.

244
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,833
All right. Let's review
the situation so far.

245
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,708
Armed guerillas have taken over
the Tanegashima Space Center.

246
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,250
Their goal is to launch a
black hole bomb into space

247
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,083
on board a JAXA rocket.

248
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,208
The launch will take place
sometime shortly after

249
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,083
the weather clears up.
Our only option now is to

250
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,458
modify GunBuild-1, get past the
enemy's SUMERAGI combat robot,

251
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,750
and find a way
to stop the launch.

252
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,583
If the rocket
launch is successful,

253
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,166
approximately five
billion people will die.

254
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,750
That's crazy! We can't take
on that much responsibility.

255
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,375
It's like Doc said, we have to.
That's why Kai and I came back.

256
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,208
I know, but still.

257
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,500
B-By the way, the person
who's taken control of JAXA

258
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
is your big sister, right?

259
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:54,083
And on top of that, isn't she
holding your father hostage?

260
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,333
Yeah.

261
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,291
I don't want you guys to worry
about that. What matters is that

262
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,958
the robot of justice comes
out on top. And the only way

263
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,041
that's going to happen
is if we all work together.

264
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,250
We understand.

265
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,458
Okay. Subaru and Doc. You're
in charge of directing everybody

266
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,500
and getting
GunBuild-1 modified.

267
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,666
Roger that, Chief.

268
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
Jun, you'll assist Subaru.

269
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,291
Okay!

270
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,333
Frau Bow, you'll take a look at
the program a man named Sawada

271
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,166
handed over to Kai earlier.

272
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,666
Who's Sawada?

273
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,375
I'm having a hard time getting
the whole thing downloaded

274
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,500
with the 'net still
as unstable as it is

275
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
but from what I can
tell, it's a program.

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,625
It shows how to
deal with SUMERAGI.

277
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:43,375
"Can't use IRUO. Install the
DG297 I had someone develop."

278
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,416
No '"please" or "thank
you?" What a bossy email.

279
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,166
Oh yes, and I like it.

280
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,916
All right. I'll send it to
you and let you handle the rest.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,458
Okay, I'm gonna head
out for a little while.

282
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,875
What? You're leaving now?

283
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,166
This is an EM wave
irradiation device,

284
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,083
it can make people see things.
It could be a useful weapon.

285
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,083
And since it's one of
Kimijima's personal creations.

286
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,916
I just might be able
to find out more about it.

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,500
You think so?

288
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,250
Everybody's got that l33t
look on their face today.

289
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,625
Hold it right there!

290
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,583
And just what do you
children think you're doing?

291
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,833
The Robot Research
Club has been disbanded.

292
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,708
No! The vice-principal!

293
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,666
Not now!

294
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
This is a really bad time
to start cracking dow--

295
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,208
Don't bother with excuses.
If you insist on proceeding,

296
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
you will sign this
document immediately.

297
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,875
Oh, come on.
Give us a break!

298
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,500
Who cares about
school rules at a time--

299
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,916
Quiet, Kai. These
are club sign-up forms.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Huh?

301
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,875
Before you begin
any additional work,

302
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,083
you must first reestablish
the Robot Research Club.

303
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,375
Otherwise, should
anything untoward happen,

304
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,333
the school would not be
able to accept responsibility.

305
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,666
You really mean it, ma'am?

306
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,083
What's all that?

307
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,250
Well, do you think
this is gonna be enough?

308
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Food and drinks!
But why so much?

309
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,000
So much? I imagine it will
hardly be enough considering

310
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,458
the number of students who
have volunteered to help you.

311
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,333
Huh?

312
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,333
Really?

313
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,083
Hey! Yashio!

314
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,625
We thought you
could use some help!

315
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,250
No way!

316
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,708
Big man's here! Sorry
to keep ya waiting, folks!

317
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:42,208
I hope you don't mind,
I brought some JAXA engineers.

318
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,208
My dad.

319
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,208
Well, Aki.
I guess you were right.

320
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,583
Huh?

321
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,166
About this island.

322
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,041
It is really small, after
all, and really big, too.

323
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,875
Misaki, please.

324
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,000
Hurry and get out
of here. Please! Hurry!

325
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,458
But how can I leave you?

326
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,208
I can't go. As long as
he's inside my head, I can't.

327
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,583
I have to--

328
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,958
Get out of here!

329
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,125
How many times have I
warned you now, my puppet?

330
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,375
If you resist me too hard,

331
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,416
your very self will
begin to fall apart.

332
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,708
I don't care about that.
Not now. Aki and Kai.

333
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,791
Do you copy me, Gezi?

334
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,333
Yes.

335
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,458
As of this moment,
I'm freeing you.

336
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,958
I do not understand.

337
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,791
Go to them now.
To Kai and Aki.

338
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:19,583
And that's all,
Gezi. Later days.

339
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,291
Kai and the gang visit

340
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,583
the old folk museum
where Gezi is waiting,

341
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,500
as she was
ordered by Kimijima.

342
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,666
Meanwhile, with
great trepidation,

343
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,875
Aki prepares herself
for her final battle

344
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,833
against her sister. Her
heart is filled with doubt

345
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,708
but thoughts of Kai find
their way to the surface.

346
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:18,166
Can love grow in the shadow of
confrontation or will it wither?

347
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,625
Episode 21.

348
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,166
Let's hit it off everybody!

349
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,625
Later days!
