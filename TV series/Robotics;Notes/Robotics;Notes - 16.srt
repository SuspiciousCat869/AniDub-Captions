1
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,916
"A giant robot that only we
can build!" I believe we have

2
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,208
succeeded in creating a
robot that is faithful to

3
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,375
that idea and imbued
with our passion.

4
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,291
Thanks to each of you!

5
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:46,291
Now for the big moment. Da da
DA! The "Let's make a life-size

6
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,625
version of GUNVARREL"
project, Mark 2.

7
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,750
Or just GunBuild-2, for short!

8
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,500
What's that stuff it's
got stuck to its head?

9
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,583
It's a small but necessary
symbol of my defiance.

10
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,791
A robot has
no need for a face.

11
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,875
But its face is
part of its identity!

12
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,833
I believe we've already been
through all this numerous times.

13
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,041
Or have you developed a
more convincing rebuttal to

14
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,208
my well-reasoned arguments?
If so, I'd like to hear it.

15
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,750
You big jerk!

16
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,833
Hey! Stop, will ya?

17
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,708
You guys ready? Let's do this.

18
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,416
The start-up test?
Now? What about Tennoji?

19
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,708
She's not here yet.

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,583
You know the rule
about working on the robot.

21
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,041
We're not supposed to
operate it without supervision.

22
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,166
We can still go over all
the pre-launch information.

23
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,875
Okay. Yashio.
You're the operator.

24
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,250
Daitoku. You're
the sub-operator.

25
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,833
Yeah, that's right!

26
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,666
Furugori, you're the
drive system supervisor.

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,041
NO U, thnx!

28
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,125
But. We discussed this!

29
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,083
D00d, IJK. Plz continue.

30
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,000
The most unique aspect
of the Mark 2 is its...

31
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:08,458
monopole motors... which give
the unit certain advantages.

32
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,458
Its maneuverability,
for example,

33
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,041
far surpasses
that of the Mark 1.

34
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,958
Operation is remote,
using the KILL-BALLAD system.

35
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,458
The monopoles are amazing.

36
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,958
Although, I think we were all
surprised when they started

37
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,875
falling from the
sky every morning.

38
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,250
Now, we needed to use
one additional piece of

39
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,916
equipment that was not
found in the Mark 1. Namely.

40
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,416
A laser power transmitter!

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,708
Man, it's big.

42
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,750
Is that a canon?

43
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,000
It converts electricity
into a laser beam

44
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,000
as a way to transmit power.

45
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,375
Kai, Jun, as operators,
you're in charge of it.

46
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,625
Huh?

47
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,791
Be very careful.
Don't point it at anyone.

48
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,791
Okay, but what would
happen if it hit somebody?

49
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,750
Then they would die.

50
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,625
No. No! No, no,
I don't wanna!

51
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,916
Yeah, same here. It's
too dangerous. I'll pass.

52
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,958
Don't worry. It has
a safeguard in place.

53
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,125
It will only discharge when
aimed at the satellite dish.

54
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,500
It's plenty safe.

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,625
R-Really?

56
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,291
You're great at this sort
of thing. You should be fine.

57
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,875
Actually, it's fighting
games that are my specialty.

58
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
Shooting games are
another thing entirely.

59
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,916
Hey, you guys!

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,791
Oh there you are, Nae! I'm
glad you could make it out.

61
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,791
Sorry I'm late.
I was in a meeting,

62
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,125
and it ran a little long.

63
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,291
A meeting? On Sunday morning?

64
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,583
Oh. Well, yes.

65
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,250
Okay, now. The start-up test!
Are you guys ready to get going?

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,500
You can do it! Yeah!

67
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,375
Right!

68
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,583
Well? Now?

69
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,083
Yeah.

70
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,083
Fire!

71
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,791
Wow! Amazing!

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The b-battery is
ch-ch-charging, OK!

73
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,333
'Kay, Subaru! Set it down!

74
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,083
Alright, I'm on it!

75
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,625
We're all set up, Nae.
We just need the final call.

76
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,958
What d'ya say?
Are we ready to begin?

77
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,416
Yes! The start-up
test is a-go!

78
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,083
Okay, powering up!
Prepare for lift off!

79
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,458
S-Skeletal GUNVARREL
has started up.

80
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,375
OS is f-f-functioning normally.

81
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,083
D-Deploying laser scanners!

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,666
Detaching crane cables!

83
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:48,041
This is it, Kai, time to
take the historic first step.

84
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,208
'Kay. I'll just start
off by moving it forward.

85
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,666
Roger that.

86
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,416
Okay, GUNVARREL.
Let's do this!

87
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,583
Well? What d'you think?

88
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,000
It's amazing!

89
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,625
Wow! It's incredible!

90
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,541
You would never guess that this
was made by high-schoolers!

91
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,708
I knew all along what
you guys were capable of!

92
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,083
There is one thing.

93
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,875
What? What's wrong?

94
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,666
Unfortunately, it looks like
the club, and the Mark 2,

95
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,541
will have to be completely
moved out of here by next week.

96
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,291
Huh? Moved out?
What do you mean?

97
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,583
You know that meeting
I mentioned earlier?

98
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,625
Well, they've just scheduled
the first rocket launch

99
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,166
from Tanegashima
in five years.

100
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,583
Oh!

101
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,000
Really?

102
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,416
Really. So, for security
reasons, we can't allow you to

103
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,958
continue using this
as your workspace.

104
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,166
I know it's
disappointing. I'm sorry!

105
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,375
Wow! So baby soft!

106
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,333
Since the twenty-fifteen
Crash, our company has

107
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,083
taken extra precautions.
Our powered suits are

108
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,666
fully protected from
solar storm EM waves.

109
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,541
If the suits are so safe,
what was the cause of

110
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,833
the wide spread
malfunction last summer?

111
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,875
I can't comment on that
while the trial is underway.

112
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,541
Sometimes I can't
decide if I'm more amazed

113
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,583
or dismayed by the chief.

114
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,208
This is the promotional
video she developed.

115
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,291
She'll submit it
to the expo committee.

116
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,500
This should be good.

117
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,708
From Chuo-Tanegashima
High's Robot Research Club.

118
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,750
Club leader Akiho Senomiya.
I'm eighteen years old.

119
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,500
Why did I dream of
building a giant robot?

120
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,458
Because giant robots
are adored by everyone!

121
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,000
Because giant robots
are children's heroes!

122
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,625
Because giant robots
are defenders of justice!

123
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,791
Because I love giant robots!
And I hope you do, too!

124
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,375
The attack on the Diet
Building changed things.

125
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,958
GUNVARREL's image in particular
was hurt and people have

126
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,166
started to become leery
of robots in general.

127
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,041
Maybe some people are
frightened. But not Aki.

128
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,666
Are you there, Gezi?

129
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,166
What is it, Yashio?

130
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,833
Give me the candidates
for today's search.

131
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,041
Yes. The search for
Kimijima Report Number Seven.

132
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,375
The candidates for
today are as follows:

133
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,375
Homan Shrine.
Kumano Beach.

134
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,416
A rocket launch.

135
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,666
Cape Kadokura.

136
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,458
Yeah! Alright!
Go, Hot Dog, go!

137
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,708
Listen. Years from now,
when you're all grown up,

138
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,625
I want you to be a man
with the "right stuff."

139
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,833
That old thing?

140
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,416
It's just a
giant piece of junk.

141
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,166
Forget about him.

142
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,000
Forget about Kou Kimijima.
Stop poking around.

143
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,166
These are logs of Twipo
posts made from Tanegashima.

144
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,166
Though it was quickly
deleted, there was a post

145
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,500
referring to Kou Kimijima.
It was posted by Junna Daitoku

146
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,583
and deleted at the
behest of Kaito Yashio.

147
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,041
I gave you an order
to investigate this boy.

148
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,500
Yet, somehow,
you failed to find this?

149
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,333
My apologies, sir.

150
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,708
Apparently, he not only
attends your alma mater,

151
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,541
but he's also good friends with
your little sister. Interesting.

152
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,333
You think I'm protecting him?

153
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,625
If you'd like me to,
I'll dispose of him myself.

154
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,041
No. There's no need.

155
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,166
Mr. Nagafukada
certainly is late.

156
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,166
I w-want to go home.

157
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,666
Where's Yashio?

158
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,208
I went to his house to get
him, but he was long gone.

159
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,250
Where could he hav--

160
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,875
Koujiro! Your skirt!

161
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,000
Subaru! Don't even
think about looking!

162
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,333
M-My back is turned!
What nonsense!

163
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,708
Are you really sure
we should be doing this?

164
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,791
We'll only move it around
a bit. It's important.

165
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,416
We don't have much time
before the next screening.

166
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,125
Doesn't look like it's
around here, either.

167
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,208
Huh? I found it.
That's kinda weird.

168
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,666
It wasn't there a second
ago. Well, it's here now.

169
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,291
Gezi. Are you sure that
this is Report Number Seven?

170
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,916
Yes. Would you like
me to download it?

171
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,416
I've come this far, right?
I can't just turn back now.

172
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,750
Yes, Gezi. Download the--

173
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,583
Stop what you're
doing, Kai. Now.

174
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,833
Mizuka, hey!

175
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,041
Come on, Mitchi.
Where are you?

176
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,250
Uh. Hey guys, I think--

177
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Hold on a sec.

178
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,416
What's the matter, Jun?
Is there a problem?

179
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Well, something seems off
each time it takes a step.

180
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,541
Huh?

181
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,083
"Off," how?

182
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,666
It's like, when it moves its
legs, they get stiff like this

183
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,500
for just a second
before they set back down.

184
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,083
Could the motor gears have
gotten stripped somehow?

185
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,916
What do you think?

186
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,333
Not sure, but I'll take
a look. You run the laser.

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,750
Why are you here?

188
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,375
I told you, you shouldn't
go sticking your nose

189
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,916
where it doesn't belong.

190
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,458
Now just do what I told you
and forget about this already.

191
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,250
What're you talking about?

192
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,500
Wait a second. You mean
the Kimijima reports?

193
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,125
Go home, Kai.
Find a new hobby.

194
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,791
Or are you talking about
Kou Kimijima himself?

195
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,541
Please, Mizuka. You
know something, don't you?

196
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,083
Just let it go!

197
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,083
Th-That ringtone. What?

198
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,916
Okay, make it walk, please!

199
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,041
Yeah, you're right.

200
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,958
It does seem like it's
teetering a little bit now.

201
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:17,958
But why?

202
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,083
Maybe it doesn't
have enough power?

203
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,083
All systems show normal.

204
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,750
That's it! Keep it going!

205
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,708
Are you okay?

206
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Look out!

207
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,333
"Kagome, Kagome!" But why now?

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,625
Who is this?

209
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,000
Mizuka, where are you going?

210
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:47,500
Huh? What the? I'm not-!
What is this? What the hell?

211
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,000
Hey, come back!
We're not done talking.

212
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:56,208
Kai! I really hate to ask,
but, uh, could you gimme a hand?

213
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,666
Do wha?

214
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,166
Uh. It's my suit.
Thing seems to be actin' up.

215
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,750
I can't get it to stop walking.

216
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,708
It's moving all by itself?

217
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,708
What's happening?

218
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,000
If the suits are so safe,
then what was the cause

219
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,541
of the widespread
malfunction last summer?

220
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,041
Oh god! No!

221
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,125
Mizuka!

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,833
Kai!

223
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,083
Crap! What the hell?!

224
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,208
Hurry, Mizuka! Shut it down!

225
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,166
I already tried that!
It won't turn off!

226
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,791
Please, don't let
go of me, Kai!

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,833
Mizuka! Are you okay?

228
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,833
Thank you, Kai.
I really owe you one.

229
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,916
C'mon, quick.
We need to get this off.

230
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,583
No, not again!

231
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
Kai. It's all right.

232
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,166
No, it's not all right!

233
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,708
You have to let go.
It'll only take you with me.

234
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,875
Stop!

235
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
Mizuka!

236
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,291
Listen, Kai.

237
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:44,041
Please. If you
ever get to see Misa.

238
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,333
Aki! Kai!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

239
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:54,750
Tell her. Tell her thanks
for giving me these legs.

240
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,916
Following the
accident with Gunbuild 2,

241
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,708
the Robot Research
Club is disbanded.

242
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:07,708
Powerless to act, Aki falls
into a severe depression.

243
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:11,250
The club members drift
away. Heartsick and weary,

244
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,041
Kai investigates the
cause of Mizuka's death.

245
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:18,083
Unwilling to allow Aki to give
up, he challenges her to battle.

246
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,833
Episode 17.

247
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,208
Let's hit it off everybody!

248
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,750
Later days!
