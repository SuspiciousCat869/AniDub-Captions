1
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,750
Someone said it was a battle

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,166
to save the world
from a cruel fate.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,791
Someone said all hope for
the future of humankind

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,750
rested squarely
on our shoulders.

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,125
Counting down!

6
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,208
Three, two, one. Liftoff!

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,375
But I don't care
about any of that stuff.

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,458
That's not why I'm here.

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, we've loaded
the laser thingy.

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,250
Wait, I mean,
the laser turret, right?

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
It's in the Thunder Emperor!

12
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,916
System link: Online.

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,416
Connect PhoneDroid pad.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,666
It's the red cable.

15
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,375
The perimeter map
is loading now.

16
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,416
Three meters.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,208
Five, seven,
ten, fifteen, twenty.

18
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,541
Maximum range!

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,583
O-Okay.

20
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,166
Topographical
assessment AI ready.

21
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,000
All checks complete.

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,041
Kai, we're going
into this unrehearsed.

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,625
Well, we always knew that was
how it was going to be, right?

24
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,208
We've already come this far,
no sense backing down now.

25
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,750
Thank you.

26
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,000
Status!

27
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,083
We're all green!

28
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,750
This is the final call. Go!

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,833
GUNVARREL!

30
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,916
Forward!

31
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,541
Performing voice
recognition test.

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,958
Please say something
toward the screen.

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
Okay, My name is Kaito Yashio.

34
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,291
I'm a student at Chuo
Tanegashima High School.

35
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,166
Which is lots of fun.

36
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,458
What else is there to
tell a PhoneDroid pad?

37
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,208
My grades are mediocre at best.

38
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,250
Welcome to IRUO.

39
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,333
Update was successful.

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,916
Jeez, do you ever stop gaming?

41
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,125
I was just running an update.

42
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,791
Found a cool little app
while I was at it, too.

43
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,250
Hello, kitty cat.

44
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,875
I don't understand
how you can be

45
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,750
so relaxed when things
are looking terrible for us!

46
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,250
Things look bad, huh?

47
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,166
No! Terrible!

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,791
Hey, this thing
really does work.

49
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,250
Awesome.

50
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,750
You and I are the only
remaining members

51
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,375
of the Robot Research Club.

52
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,583
You know that, right?

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,750
Me-ow.

54
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,291
We have a new contender
for my favorite app.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,333
Okay, okay. What now?

56
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,416
Were you able to pin
down the vice-principal?

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,333
She's in another meeting.

58
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,875
Apparently she's "too busy to
meet with every single student

59
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,416
who drops by," so instead,

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,583
I'm supposed to submit a
detailed budget breakdown

61
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,916
for her to look over.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,875
Lemme guess, you're gonna
request a huge amount

63
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,833
of funding for the club again?

64
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,958
Well, yeah.

65
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,666
We need money to stay afloat.

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,916
Found it!

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,291
Wait, you're just gonna
turn it in like that?

68
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,000
Sure.

69
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,250
What do we have to lose?

70
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,250
I mean, it's just
like he always said:

71
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,458
"Don't give up!

72
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,291
This isn't over!" Eh?

73
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,125
Pay attention! Come on.

74
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,875
We have to go down
to the faculty office now.

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,958
It's not really
a two-person job.

76
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Can't you go by yourself?

77
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,375
You're a member, too.

78
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,166
Would it kill you
to act like it?

79
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,458
Come, let us face this together!

80
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,333
Okay, you win.

81
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,791
Just lay off the noble hysterics

82
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,083
and I'll go with you as
far as the office door.

83
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,416
As soon as I'm done
with this battle.

84
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,791
Whoa!

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,500
FRAUKOUJIRO?!

86
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,333
Really?

87
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,625
Who is that?

88
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,166
He created this game.

89
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,416
I heard he plays a lot,

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,666
but this is the first
time I've run into him.

91
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,208
Ah, sweet.

92
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,291
Wow.

93
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,500
Hey! You're good!

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,875
I can overpower any
technique an opponent uses

95
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,083
in just eight frames.

96
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,750
But hey, I am ranked
fifth in the world.

97
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,958
Kai, that's incredible!

98
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,291
You beat the game's creator!

99
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,250
Well, that ought to
preserve my standing

100
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,958
in the game's
rank system, anyway.

101
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,500
What's that?

102
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,458
It's a message from
the creator himself.

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,416
Huh? What's he talking about?

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,583
What's the matter?

105
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,750
It looks like I'm too good.

106
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,166
The creator thinks
I'm using cheats

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,791
to make my reaction time
faster than physically possible.

108
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,583
Cheats, huh?

109
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,500
Just like it sounds, they
help you cheat at the game.

110
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,583
Gah!

111
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,666
Can't he lose graciously
or does everyone

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,458
who beats him get
labeled a cheater?

113
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,625
Must be jealous.

114
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,333
Accusations like this
are pretty common

115
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,041
when you're as
highly ranked as I am.

116
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,333
Didn't expect it
from him, though.

117
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,166
Stand up for yourself!

118
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,208
Say something!

119
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,958
Nah, I don't care.

120
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,791
It's not like I've actually
done anything wrong.

121
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,416
Really? Hold on.
Where are you going?

122
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,916
The office, remember?

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,416
We've got a meeting, right?

124
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,250
You guys are seriously gonna
give this to the vice-principal?

125
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,041
Why wouldn't we?

126
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,125
You're the one who told me she'd
want to see a budget, Mitchi.

127
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,750
First of all, say
"yes," don't just nod.

128
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,500
And please, remember
what I keep telling you:

129
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,958
call me Mr. Nagafukada.

130
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,416
So, how do you think
she's gonna react to this?

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,875
I think it's going to convince
her for sure this time!

132
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,000
Huh.

133
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,416
Well, that's weird.

134
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,333
I've never seen such an
aggressive STEINGMA user before.

135
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,041
Great. What am I gonna do now?

136
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:17,875
Hey, Yashio!

137
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,041
Hey, what's up?

138
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,291
There's something I've gotta do.

139
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,625
Do you think you
could do me a favor

140
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,666
and take out the trash for me?

141
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,291
You're on clean-up
duty, too, right?

142
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,333
Don't even bother.

143
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,791
It's no use talking to him.

144
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,875
Shut up, it's not like
he's doing anything.

145
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,375
Yeah, sure, no problem.

146
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,500
I'll take out the trash for you.

147
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,333
Oh! Really?!

148
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,333
Of course.

149
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,166
Right after you beat
me at KILL-BALLAD.

150
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,708
I'll take care of the trash
and whatever else you want.

151
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,500
Ya see, what'd I tell you?

152
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,791
Let's just go.

153
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,041
What's with that guy?

154
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,291
So how did the appointment go?

155
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,916
She wasn't there, so I left
the proposal with Mitchi.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,083
Mitchi? Really?

157
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,333
You sure that's a good plan?

158
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,125
Why wouldn't it be?

159
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,708
He is our club advisor.

160
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,208
And don't worry,

161
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,375
I plan to grill him later to
make sure he gave it to her.

162
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,625
Maybe I should start calling
you Snapping Turtle Aki.

163
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,041
Snapping Turtle?!

164
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,375
I don't like that.

165
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,125
Hi!

166
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,833
I didn't see you standing there!

167
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,375
Aha! I've got you now!

168
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,333
There's nowhere to run!

169
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
It's not too late.

170
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,041
Join our club and help us
with our grand endeavor t--

171
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,750
I will not join your club.

172
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,208
You'd say no just like that?

173
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,791
Just like that?

174
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,833
I've given you the same answer
more than twenty times now.

175
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,750
So please, stop bothering me.

176
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,708
But the Robot
Research Club needs

177
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,625
your unparalleled
technical prowess!

178
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,791
We have a lot of fun, you know.

179
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,625
We pour all of our
blood, sweat, tears,

180
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,083
and oil into one noble creation!

181
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,083
Racing ever forward toward
the ultimate triumph together!

182
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,166
I said, quit bothering me!

183
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,875
Goodbye.

184
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,250
One way or another,

185
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,583
I am going to convince
him to join our club!

186
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,750
He tries to shake you off,
but you won't let go.

187
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,333
Snapping turtle, alright.

188
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,125
If you're not going
to be helpful,

189
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,791
then just shut uuuuuuup!

190
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,875
Feeling okay?

191
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,958
Sure am.

192
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,791
Are you going straight home?

193
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,666
Whaddya got in mind?

194
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,166
I was thinking about
maybe stopping by

195
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,875
the hangar for a little while.

196
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,833
Again?

197
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
Well, yeah.

198
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,666
We do need to keep it
well maintained, you know.

199
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,958
It's vital for the
club's future.

200
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,833
Come ooooonnnn!

201
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,708
We don't have to
stay for very long!

202
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,583
Hangar, open now!

203
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,625
Why do you say that every time?

204
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,083
It's important to set the
right mood for stuff like this.

205
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,666
This place could use
some spring-cleaning.

206
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,625
I don't see anything.

207
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,291
Are you sure it's still in here?

208
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,083
Of course.

209
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,208
Where else would it be?

210
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,750
It is the reason for the Robot
Research Club's existence.

211
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,875
The "Let's make a life-size
version of GUNVARREL,

212
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,375
the giant robot
of justice" project,

213
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,208
or just "GunBuild-1" for short.

214
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,125
Construction began when
the club was founded,

215
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,125
and work on it continues
bit by bit, to this day.

216
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,708
The robot is stored here, in
an abandoned airport hangar.

217
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,666
It looks really unlikely that

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,791
it'll be finished by
the time we graduate.

219
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,208
But that doesn't faze Aki.

220
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,208
She has total faith that we'll
be able to complete it somehow.

221
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,500
It's good to see you, GUNVARREL.

222
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,333
There we go.

223
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,750
Now that leaves.

224
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,916
Just a little, there.

225
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,916
I swear, it's like a
sauna this time of year.

226
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,125
Start pulling your weight!

227
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,500
This is not a warning!

228
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,166
Refuse and I'll fire!

229
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,708
Technique: GUNVAL Ankh Striker!

230
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,416
Something wrong?

231
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,291
Some oil just dripped on me.

232
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,083
Nice legs.

233
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:03,791
Hey!

234
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,958
Back off, you pervert!

235
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,416
Yeah, kicking around like

236
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,875
that just shows 'em
off even more, you know.

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,916
Keep looking and I'll kill you.

238
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,125
What were you doing, anyway?

239
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,416
Hard to explain.

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,916
It's just, being here.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,208
This place.

242
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,458
It's like it's the
hangar that time forgot.

243
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,791
Oh, wow.

244
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,916
I sound like a
thirteen-year-old girl, don't I?

245
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,416
No, I get what you mean.

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,458
And that's exactly why
weirdos like us have got

247
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,916
to work together to keep
the club and its goals alive.

248
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:37,958
'Kay?

249
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,791
I'll be happy to
help however I can.

250
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,833
As soon as you beat
me at KILL-BALLAD.

251
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,250
Exoskeleton Company's
Powered Suits have been

252
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,750
specially designed
to be accessible

253
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,500
and useful in the daily
lives of ordinary people.

254
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,833
Like cars and PhoneDroid pads,

255
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,875
Accept call.

256
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:57,958
With voice only.

257
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,000
Hey, Kai! Wait a sec.

258
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,250
What's up with voice only?

259
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,916
I'm changing clothes.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,166
Oh, good call then.

261
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,833
Anyway, I was curious,
have you gotten

262
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,666
your English homework
finished for tomorrow?

263
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,333
I bet you haven't yet, huh?

264
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,583
You're always jumping
to conclusions.

265
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,666
But no, I haven't.

266
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,333
Yeah, that's what I thought.

267
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,916
Why don't we split the work?

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,250
It's just like he once said:

269
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,208
"When it comes to battle,
thinking two steps ahead

270
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,291
of your opponent
often means victory." Eh?

271
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,666
Well, when it comes
to English homework,

272
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,083
I don't think you're even
one step ahead, are you?

273
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,166
But splitting up the work
sounds like a good plan to me.

274
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,416
Okay, perfect!

275
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
We'll meet up in
the club room, then.

276
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,041
Reserve your Powered Suit today.

277
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,791
Exoskeleton provides
the support you need.

278
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,541
Put your trust in us.

279
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,541
Morning, thanks for coming in.

280
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Never mind, it's just you.

281
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,416
Where's Aki?

282
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,416
She probably went
on ahead to school.

283
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,916
If that girl thinks
she can ignore me,

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
she's got another thing coming.

285
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,541
Come on, Mizuka,
why would she ignore you?

286
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,250
It's nothing like that, really.

287
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,375
She's just flat
broke, that's all.

288
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,666
Give Mitchi a message for me.

289
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
He needs to come in and
pick up his order already.

290
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,166
Why do I have to get involved?

291
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,875
Can't you call him yourself?

292
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,291
I'm too busy.

293
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,666
Yeah, okay.

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,583
I just don't want
to talk to him.

295
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,041
That isn't really something
I want to do, either.

296
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,041
Oh, crap!

297
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,416
I completely forgot!

298
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,166
And I don't have
any money on me!

299
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,458
This is why no one
wants to talk to him.

300
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,666
He spits!

301
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,166
Well, I've done my part.

302
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,916
Bye.

303
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,000
 How did she seem?

304
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,166
Was she angry?

305
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Uh, I dunno.

306
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,083
Yeah, I guess,
maybe she was a little.

307
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,291
Now listen up, kid!

308
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,875
Mizuka Irei gets seriously
scary if you make her mad.

309
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,583
Just a tip from me to you!

310
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,833
Yeah, I know that.

311
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,375
And I have one
other piece of advice!

312
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Listen carefully!

313
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,958
Fine, what is it?

314
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,500
As swift as the wind!

315
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,916
As strong as the sea!

316
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,041
GUNVARREL!

317
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,625
Keep flailing around
this tiny room,

318
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,416
and you'll bust
your PhoneDroid again.

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,666
A Skal!

320
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,666
I was just talking to Mitchi
and the guy wouldn't shut up.

321
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,833
Huh? What anime
are you watching?

322
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,500
What seriously?! Are you blind?!

323
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,000
It's GUNVARREL!

324
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:28,708
Oh, yeah.

325
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,458
That's right.

326
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,791
What?!

327
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,875
"Oh, yeah?!" Tell me, that
KILL-BALLAD video game

328
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,916
you play all the time.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,791
What is it based on?

330
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,250
"GUNVARREL."

331
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,666
And what has our club been
working tirelessly to build?

332
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,875
GUNVARREL.

333
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,208
And this anime is?

334
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,541
GUNVARREL.

335
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,666
That's better.

336
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,458
You had me really
worried for a sec.

337
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,958
I thought maybe
you'd finally lost it.

338
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,166
Here.

339
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,958
Why don't we go through
it all from the top?

340
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,708
No, please.

341
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:55,583
Not again.

342
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,541
I've got it.

343
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,875
From the top!

344
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,125
Now, then, the current
robot boom is pretty much

345
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,750
entirely the result of
GUNVARREL's popularity.

346
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,208
The show represents
the culmination

347
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,583
of a half-century
of robot anime.

348
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,541
It aired in a hundred and
sixty-eight countries

349
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,666
and was an
international sensation.

350
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:22,833
Yet, despite its success, the
final episode was never aired.

351
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,083
GUNVAL Ankh Striker!

352
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,291
It's been four years now,

353
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,500
and the final episode
still remains a mystery.

354
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,916
It must be an ending
of epic proportions.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,125
There's no doubting it!

356
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,166
Oh, by the way.

357
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,166
What?

358
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,250
Mitchi asked me to
pass along a message.

359
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,291
The vice-principal's agreed
to see you during lunch break.

360
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,166
You're kidding.

361
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,041
No, I'm not.

362
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,291
The time has come!

363
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:02,750
C'mon, Kai!

364
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
Show some club spirit!

365
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,958
Yeah, do I really
have to go in too?

366
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,375
Of course you have to go!

367
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,125
You are a club
member, aren't you?

368
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,166
I guess so.

369
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,500
Are you aware of the reason

370
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,041
for which I summoned
you to my office?

371
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,375
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,958
It's about the
club budget, isn't it?

373
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,458
I'm guessing that you must've
finally made your decision...

374
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,916
We really appreciate it!

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,208
Yes, well.

376
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,500
It would seem you
are still not thinking

377
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,000
with a clear head, young lady.

378
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,041
Now would you care to
explain to me again why

379
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,291
you think such an exorbitant
budget request is justified?

380
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,250
This is an extremely large sum.

381
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, that's a good one, ma'am,

382
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,916
since I've explained it to
you a bunch of times already.

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,791
I said "again" or
weren't you listening?

384
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,708
Robots from all over
the world are going

385
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,083
to be showcased during the Tokyo
Expo being held next February.

386
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,625
We intend to participate,
entering our club's giant robot.

387
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,541
However, completing
it in half a year's time

388
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,583
will not be an easy
task to accomplish.

389
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,833
It will require a
substantial budget increase.

390
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,458
Well, it's all over now.

391
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,750
I see nothing has changed.

392
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,791
Your analysis of the
situation is no different

393
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,708
than any of the
previous attempts.

394
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,666
Naturally!

395
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,791
Perhaps you can at least explain

396
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,791
why it must be a giant robot?

397
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,833
GunBuild-1 is the reason

398
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,500
for the Robot
Research Club's existence.

399
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,791
It has always been my dream
to take it to the Tokyo Expo.

400
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,625
I will not give that dream up!

401
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,958
One additional question.

402
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,041
Can the two of you
alone honestly hope

403
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,625
to complete a project
of this magnitude?

404
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,250
And with such a short deadline?

405
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
Determination will prevail!

406
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,416
I must deny your request.

407
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,791
"Everyone makes mistakes,
though the young

408
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,166
are particularly
unwilling to admit them."

409
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,500
Do you wanna fill me in
on what you're doing, Aki?

410
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,166
Oh, very well.

411
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,708
But I do have some conditions.

412
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,458
Okay, like what?

413
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,791
Eight years ago, your
older sister turned a circle

414
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,375
of aficionados into
an official school club

415
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,875
by producing results,

416
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,250
and now it is your
turn to prove yourself.

417
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,666
If you manage that,

418
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,250
I will give this absurd
budget genuine consideration.

419
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,166
Thank you so much!

420
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,958
We're not finished.

421
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,583
We aren't?

422
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,416
I haven't stipulated the
terms of the agreement.

423
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,833
Now listen closely.

424
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,875
The following condition
is non-negotiable.

425
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,958
No time to waste!

426
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,666
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

427
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,250
What do you say, Kai?

428
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,833
Do you actually
think this is possible?

429
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,500
Sure!

430
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,833
We just have to win
ROBO-ONE, right?

431
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,416
The Robot Research
Club did it before,

432
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,541
eight years ago,
and we'll do it again!

433
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,625
Well, yeah, but didn't
they have like a whole year

434
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,541
to get their entry ready?

435
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,750
Whereas we've only got

436
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,000
two weeks until this
year's tournament opens.

437
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,125
Time is no match for passion!

438
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
I hear it's gotten a lot more
competitive and high-tech,

439
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,875
what with the robot boom.

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,625
Determination will prevail!

441
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,458
And the club will
instantly be shut down

442
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,166
unless we take first place.

443
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,166
Never consider defeat before the
battle has begun!

444
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,500
Problem is, we don't
even have a robot, do we?

445
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,083
No, I guess we don't.

446
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,541
You're just realizing that?

447
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,666
No, no, no, no, no!

448
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,416
Ridiculous optimism
is my one saving grace!

449
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,458
I don't know how yet, but
I swear I will make it work!

450
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,291
I have to because
GUNVARREL is waiting.

451
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,750
Now preparing Report Number
two-eight-eight-seven.

452
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,416
The date is June Thirteenth;

453
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,458
the year is
two-thousand-and-nineteen.

454
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,000
Current time: Nineteen-oh-nine.

455
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,458
Assessing status:
the report is ready.

456
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,291
It is confirmed that the
situation remains unchanged.

457
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,625
Those eyes.

458
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,958
Whose are they?

459
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,000
With the club's
future on the line,

460
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,000
Aki and Kai focus on winning
the ROBO-ONE tournament.

461
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,583
They modify
Tanegashi Machine--

462
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,208
one of the club's old robots--

463
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,833
elicit the help of Karate
Club member Junna Daitoku,

464
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,083
and develop their strategy.

465
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,166
All the while, shadows linger
in the back of their minds.

466
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,208
A red aurora, a
childhood memory,

467
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,208
and thoughts of Miskai Senomiya,

468
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,125
Aki's older sister who
left the island years before.

469
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,041
Episode 2!

470
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,500
Let's hit it off, everybody!

471
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,041
Later days!
