1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,166
Look, I haven't eaten
anything today, d00d.

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,708
Well, considering I barely
even move, one meal a day

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,750
is probably enough for me, TBH.
Keeps me from becoming a fatty.

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,208
Or are you saying
you like 'em plump?!

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,125
I'm not saying anything.

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,375
Just calm down
already, will ya? Here.

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,166
I know! You filled it with
knock-out drugs, didn't you?

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,958
And while I'm asleep,
completely helpless,

9
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,958
you'll have your way with me!

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,166
What a dirty plan!
Right out of an erotic game.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,458
Suit yourself. If you
don't want it, I'll eat it.

12
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:54,083
TY. Come to mama, baby! Yum!

13
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,291
Well. I'm here.
Now, what's this about?

14
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,208
Most of @channel has it down
as a fake, but I don't want

15
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,916
to write it off yet. According
to unauthenticated rumor,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,833
the final episode of
GUNVARREL has been leaked.

17
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,000
Really?

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,166
It's been almost four years
since it went off the air.

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,083
IDK why it's the
center of attention now.

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,833
It's been trending
on Twipo, even.

21
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,416
So with all that's going on
lately, I wanted to know

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,083
what's up with those
Kimijima reports of yours.

23
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,791
Kimijima reports, please.

24
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,791
I seriously doubt there's
any connection between

25
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,166
those reports and
what happened with your mom.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,208
I mean, they're ridiculous.

27
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,416
Probably some
weirdo's practical joke.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,791
Even so, they're still
the only lead to my mom

29
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,458
I've found since
I've been on the island.

30
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,625
I wanna check
them out, at least.

31
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,083
The reports I've read so
far are all about some group

32
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,791
that rules from the shadows
and wants to use solar storms'

33
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,333
magnetic fields to obliterate
humanity and end the world.

34
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,708
Like I said, it's ridiculous
stuff out of science fiction.

35
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,708
Of course, a monopole
did fall from the sky

36
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,375
like Airi said it would.

37
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,125
Kou Kimijima.

38
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,416
Kaito. Where did
you hear that name?

39
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,000
Now that I think about it.

40
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,083
I never did follow up
on all this with Mizuka.

41
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,750
All I'm sayin' is, wouldn't
it be easy to just stick

42
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,458
GUNVARREL's face
on here like this?

43
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,166
Do we have to go
through this again?

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,791
Just give it up, already!

45
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,541
No fair!

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,333
It's another
sweltering day today.

47
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,625
Why are we here?

48
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,750
Because, Aki and the
others are at the hangar.

49
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,416
They might have spotted
us if we met at your place.

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,666
As you requested earlier,
Report Number Three Flags.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,208
File was
successfully downloaded.

52
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,166
Okay. First flag: "Find
Kimijima Report Number 2."

53
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,708
Second flag:
"Photograph Kandelia Obovota

54
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,125
flowers and upload to IRUO."

55
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,666
Third flag: "For three days
in a row, focus on the geotag

56
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,041
in the Chikura Cave
for three hours straight,

57
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,083
starting at one p.m."

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,208
Fourth flag: "Place
thirty-six geotagged stones

59
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,375
on the buried Shinto gage.
However, you must not knock off

60
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,000
any stones that
are already on it."

61
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,666
I'll say it again, this has
to be a practical joke.

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,375
Epic suck. What a PITA.

63
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,625
Let me know when
you're done. I G2G.

64
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,166
Hold it. Where do you
think you're running off to?

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,708
You're the one who had to see
the Kimijima Reports, remember?

66
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,125
Okay, Airi?

67
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,250
Do you happen to know
exactly how many other people

68
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,250
have tried to hunt down the
Kimijima Reports before?

69
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,666
Like, how many people have tried
these Number Three challenges?

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,875
Well, uh... zero.

71
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,375
Zero? Epic fail
on an epic scale.

72
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,708
Hey, hold on.
How does this even work?

73
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,333
How can IRUO
know whether or not

74
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,291
we knock over any
of the other rocks?

75
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,958
Because Airi is watching you.
Airi has to be watching

76
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,625
when you clear it, or it won't
count. Those are the rules!

77
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,291
And what if I ask you to
overlook this particular flag?

78
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,041
Oh goodness! Brother!

79
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,958
You're not really saying
that you would cheat, are you?

80
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,208
Oh no, you're
distressing the loli!

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,750
She's totally freaking!
How shameful!

82
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,083
Isn't there anything
you can do about it, Frau?

83
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,000
You know, maybe hack the
programming or something?

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,791
OIC. Cheats, huh?

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,750
But hacking IRUO would be
impossible. Even more impossible

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,625
than hacking into CERN
and warezing its files.

87
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,875
I guess we just
have to do it, then.

88
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,416
That one fell!
It doesn't count!

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,041
Oh, man, and this is
still the first stage?

90
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,833
Forget Hard Mode, we're in
Nightmare Mode already.

91
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,041
Since there're two of us here,
we might as well split the work.

92
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,500
Piling these stones without
dropping any, or focusing on

93
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,125
the geotag in the cave for three
hours: which job do you want?

94
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,041
Neither, thx. You can have both.

95
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,041
That's not an option.
Now, pick one.

96
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,708
Okay. This job.

97
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,458
Man, the water's cold!

98
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:32,791
Here we go!

99
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,875
Accurate focus confirmed!

100
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,166
He went through all the
trouble of sticking a geotag

101
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,000
in this obscure spot!

102
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,291
Ugh, who was this
Kou Kimijima guy anyway?

103
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,875
Airi told you! He's her master!

104
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,208
Hey, is it okay if I play
KILL-BALLAD while I wait?

105
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,458
Yes, Airi thinks that
should be okay, Brother.

106
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,041
Keep multitasking on.
That way Airi can tell

107
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,000
you're still focusing
on the geotag, too!

108
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,083
Great. Thanks.

109
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,333
Frau Bow isn't home, either.

110
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,833
Honestly! It's like she
and Kai aren't even a little

111
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,916
fired up about this!
What happened to

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,125
all the excitement from
when I announced GunBuild-2?

113
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,083
Where did
it all go, huh?!

114
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,583
Well, you know, to be fair,
you were the only one

115
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,958
who was particularly
excited at the time.

116
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,541
Kona?

117
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,666
You all done?

118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,041
This sux, sux, sux.

119
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,750
Three hours and I
couldn't get a single one!.

120
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,083
It's hopeless,
I tell you! Hopeless!

121
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,791
Yes. That sounds terrible.

122
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,541
The devil's work!
It's the devil's doing!

123
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,333
Well, now that I think about it,

124
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
it probably wouldn't
have counted, anyway,

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,166
since Airi wasn't
watching you stack them.

126
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,458
What?! You lousy troll!

127
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,041
Two thousand-year banhammer!

128
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,916
Sorry about that. Anyway.

129
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,541
Thought you'd wanna know,
I just beat TAKANO_EYE!

130
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,250
The suspected cheater?

131
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,333
Man, I'm fired up!

132
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:05,333
I beat the best
KB player alive! Yeah!

133
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,083
Careful. You'll hurt
yourself. Oh, and FWIW.

134
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,416
One win isn't enough
to change the rankings.

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,083
Yeah, I know. But it's
still cool. Never mind.

136
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,583
Your cheat analyzer's
installed on here, right?

137
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,750
Hey, Rozetta. Status, please.

138
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,875
Virus check. Running.

139
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,166
In some cases,
this may take several minutes.

140
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,250
Why do a check?

141
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,666
These WTFs have me freaking.

142
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,833
Virus check is now complete!

143
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,250
Results of scan. Virus detected.

144
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,916
Huh? What's going on?

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,583
Wanna know what's
going on? I'll tell you.

146
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,750
The cheat analyzer that
was supposed to be analyzing

147
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,458
the KB matches was
actually infected by a virus!

148
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,833
A virus?

149
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,958
Outfoxing the game's creator
and implanting a virus?

150
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,833
That is totally not kewl.

151
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,083
Who did it? TAKANO_EYE?

152
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,875
Maybe, but it's set
for random opponents now,

153
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,541
so if we want to catch this
creep, I'll need to contact

154
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,541
my associates in Tokyo,
get them to pay IRL visits

155
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,875
to the cheaters' homes and see
what they can find out about it.

156
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,125
From a recent press conference
with the Exoskeleton Company.

157
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,875
Don't you have anything to say?

158
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,375
Can you give us some details?

159
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,666
Miss Senomiya!
Do you know anything yet?

160
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,833
What have you uncovered?

161
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,625
Hey, Mizuka! How's it g--

162
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,375
Don't you feel responsible?!

163
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,291
So, what? You still insist the
powered suits aren't defective?

164
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,333
 I, uhh...

165
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,291
What's your company's response?

166
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,083
[RAPID-FIRE QUESTIONING]

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,166
It's you.

168
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,791
You look nice, as always.

169
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,125
Are you here for
a passion fruit bun?

170
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,416
You haven't been ordering
them as much these days.

171
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,666
Yeah, sorry,
I've been kinda busy.

172
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,416
Hey, have you talked
to Misa at all lately?

173
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,791
Why do you ask?

174
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,625
Well. It's just that
Aki says she never replies

175
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,500
to her emails or anything.

176
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:01,250
She's never been much of one
for electronic communication.

177
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,500
Actually, there're a few things
I wanna ask her about, too.

178
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,583
Y'know, like about
Airi and Kou Kimijima.

179
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,833
When I asked you a while ago,

180
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,166
you mentioned that she
knew them, didn't you?

181
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,833
Seriously? This again?!

182
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,708
Whoa, what's gotten into you?

183
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,375
Just drop it! Stay out of
Kou Kimijima's business, okay?!

184
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,250
Why should I?

185
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,625
What is it? Something bad?

186
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,958
No, but, it's just. It's just
that I wouldn't get involved

187
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,958
in his nonsense if I were you.

188
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,583
Okay, then, if I
eat a passion fruit bun,

189
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,541
will you tell me what you know?
The same deal we always do.

190
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,666
Eat all you want, be my guest,

191
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,500
but it won't change
the fact that all I know

192
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,208
is Misa was acquainted
with Kimijima and Airi.

193
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,791
That's it. All I've got for ya.

194
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,000
Kou Kimijima?

195
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,250
That's correct. There are
records indicating that Kimijima

196
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,041
had been investigating
solar storm activity.

197
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,041
What's more, he died
on Tanegashima the day

198
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,583
of the Anemone incident.
I believe there's a chance he

199
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,958
learned something
about Project Mars.

200
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,125
I'd like you to dig
into his past, if you would.

201
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,541
I understand. Goodbye.

202
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,250
I guess in the end,

203
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,666
robots have no choice
but to fight. Like us.

204
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,500
Good morning.

205
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,708
It's a little late
for "good morning."

206
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,000
Have you seen Twipo?
No, I guess you haven't, huh?

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,625
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

208
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,291
but Frau Bow
called a club meeting.

209
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,708
She wants us to
come to the hangar

210
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,500
so she can show us something.

211
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,583
You're talking about Kona?

212
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,041
Th-They arrived this morning.

213
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,125
Four RGB cameras,
all equipped with depth sensors.

214
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,041
Are we gonna attach
them to GunBuild-2?

215
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,083
Why would we?

216
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,375
It's going to be
remote-controlled,

217
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,250
so there's no point.

218
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,666
Well, think of the KB System,
and the combat moves it uses.

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,541
Those aren't going work well at
the expo. Everyone will be like

220
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,750
"WTF? Who the heck are j00
supposed to be fighting, d00d?"

221
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,708
IMHO.

222
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm kinda lost. Could somebody
please translate what she said?

223
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
I believe so.
Frau is saying that we need

224
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,500
to create new movements
that the giant robot's joints

225
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,791
can withstand.
Well, that's the gist of it.

226
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,375
And we have the
perfect guinea pig

227
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,916
for the new moves:
K-Karate girl.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Huh?! Why me?!

229
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
Because you're so
tiny and vulnerable-looking

230
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,708
in a sexual sense!

231
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,166
You look like one of
the classic villains now.

232
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,125
The ones who get taken out by
the good guys in five seconds.

233
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,375
And just like that,
war was beginning, huh?

234
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,041
Well, set up us the bomb,

235
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,333
'cause all your karate girl
are belong to uuussss!

236
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,208
Quit it, Kona.
Can't you tell she's scared?

237
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,416
CNR.

238
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,833
Hey, it's okay.
Nothing to be afraid of.

239
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,916
All you'll have to do is move
around for the cameras, I think.

240
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,208
Good, right there.

241
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,041
You ready for this, karate girl?

242
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,416
C-C-Cause I'm gonna be
spying on you from all angles!

243
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Spying? On me?

244
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,416
Why not start out with a
kata you're comfortable with.

245
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,250
That "Suparinpei" one, maybe?

246
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,166
All right, then. Suparinpei.

247
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,791
How's it going so far?
Can you see it?

248
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,000
Awesome!

249
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,791
This'll be the base.
We'll use it to create

250
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,708
several new movements, and then
I'll add them into the system.

251
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,416
Ooh! I'm gettin' fired up!

252
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,333
It's a good idea and all.
But is this kind of thing

253
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,916
really necessary yet?
I mean, we haven't even

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,166
completed the
Mark 2's blueprints.

255
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,750
Yeah, I see your point.

256
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,708
Necessary or not,

257
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,916
it does mean I'll have
the afternoon to myself.

258
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,125
Oh, that looked like...

259
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,541
Hey Kai!
I'm heading to Tokyo!

260
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,708
Oh, really? When do you go?

261
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,416
Tomorrow! I'm going to discuss
the plans for GunBuild-2 while

262
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,625
I'm there. So look
forward to hearing good news!

263
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,125
Great! I will, thanks!
By the way,

264
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,958
you're sweating so much,
I can see through your shirt!

265
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,291
Thanks for the warning.

266
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,291
It's just not my day.
I wonder where he's going?

267
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,750
Hah. It didn't say anything
about the size of the rocks.

268
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,666
How's that?

269
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,916
Yay! The flag has
been cleared, Brother!

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, that takes care of the
most difficult one, at least.

271
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,333
Which leaves.

272
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,791
Well?

273
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,291
I wanna die. Worst game ever.

274
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,208
I did for two days.

275
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,958
I don't think it's asking
very much for you to do one.

276
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,500
Okay, it's four p.m.

277
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
It's been the
required three hours.

278
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,041
So, the flag has
been cleared, then?

279
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,833
Yes, it has. Congratulations!

280
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,166
You worked really hard,
Brother. Airi's proud!

281
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,375
You're a good cheerleader.

282
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,625
Thanks a lot, Airi.

283
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,625
I worked hard, too, plzkthx.

284
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,750
Since the final flag
is clear, Kimijima Report

285
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,875
Number Three's AR annotation
has been made visible.

286
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,083
So, now...

287
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,791
Let's see here.

288
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,666
There. That must be it.

289
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,625
Report Number Three
has now been downloaded.

290
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,708
You can see it at
any time in the viewer.

291
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,250
Ooh! Kimijima Report, please!

292
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,875
Just remember,
there's no guarantee

293
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,666
it contains anything helpful.

294
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,291
Of particular
concern is Project Autm.

295
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,833
The Committee of
Three Hundred's Human

296
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,708
Cultivation Project
Number One-one-four,

297
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,333
which is led by the
Tavistock Institute.

298
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,208
This project involves directly
interfering with the sun

299
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,791
during a period of maximum
solar activity to artificially

300
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,333
generate a solar corona, as
well as solar magnetic storms

301
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,375
discharged by said corona,

302
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,041
to dramatically alter
the global environment.

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,166
Rough estimates
suggest the number

304
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,583
of casualties will
reach five billion.

305
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,750
Groundwork for
implementation is scheduled

306
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,791
to be underway
by twenty fifteen.

307
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,125
In preparation,
droves of manufacturers

308
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,458
that are affiliated with the
Committee of Three Hundred

309
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,666
will most likely
enter the robot research

310
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,750
and development
sector by twenty twelve.

311
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,250
In America, U.S. Robocom.

312
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:44,791
In Britain, Liverpool Tech.
In Japan, Exoskeleton.

313
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,625
Uh. WTF?!

314
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,083
I warned you, didn't I? All
of the Reports are like this.

315
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:58,541
But it mentions Exoskeleton.
Where Misa works.

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,375
Almost made it
safely inside, too.

317
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,416
You, shirtless, playing
around with cheeky glasses boy

318
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,458
in the pouring rain-
that would be classic!

319
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,833
You're welcome
for the cab, B-T-dub.

320
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,791
What's going on?

321
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
R-R-Remember my Tokyo friends?

322
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,083
One of them just emailed me.

323
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,208
They went to all the
top three players' homes.

324
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,833
So? They find anything out?

325
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,750
Let's see.

326
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,041
What is it? Something wrong?

327
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,666
A-A-All three of them
were dead in their homes.

328
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,000
A-All accidental deaths, and all
of them were half a year ago.

329
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,416
You're messing with me.

330
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,791
That's impossible.

331
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,541
Then who played
TAKANO_EYE until yesterday?

332
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,208
D-Dunno. There are
no signs of his account

333
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,000
being hijacked or
any cheats being used.

334
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,625
What? You think a
ghost was playing his account?

335
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,208
Hey. Kona.

336
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,916
I-I wonder if this could
possibly have something to do

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,375
with my mom's disappearance.
Maybe she's trying to use

338
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,375
KILL-BALLAD as a way
to warn me about something.

339
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,125
Oh, Kai! Did you see?

340
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,041
Huh?

341
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,291
It's GUNVARREL!
It's awful, Kai!

342
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,125
They've established a countdown
until the next solar storm?

343
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,041
Sheer idiocy.
These people are a pain.

344
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,250
What is it?

345
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,041
Are you watching
the evening news?

346
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,125
Not now. What happened?

347
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
Looks like it's been leaked.

348
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,250
What, Kaminagi?!

349
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,416
No. The final
episode of GUNVARREL.

350
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,166
Understood, I'll review
the footage when I can.

351
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,291
Now return to Tokyo.

352
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,125
Yes, sir.

353
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,875
The timing can't possibly
be a coincidence. It must be...

354
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,583
Kai?

355
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,125
Are you okay?!

356
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:38,208
It's all so wrong. This isn't-
It's not GUNVARREL!

357
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,416
The leaked footage
was four minutes

358
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,250
and thirty-one seconds long.

359
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,541
They're all making their
way to the space elevator.

360
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,791
But the robots,
good and bad alike,

361
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,916
suffer power malfunctions
and fall into the blast furnace.

362
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,708
The elevator then fires a laser
gun right into a large sunspot.

363
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,583
It's the same.
The solar storm that

364
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,625
results destroys
Anubis, the final boss.

365
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,541
But it also destroys
life on Earth as we know it.

366
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,416
It's the same.
Rozetta collapses lifelessly.

367
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,708
Genki, the hero, looks out at

368
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,291
the decimated
landscape and mutters,

369
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,958
"It's over.
The world has ended."

370
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,666
It's all wrong! That's not
the GUNVARREL I know!

371
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,291
This isn't how it
was supposed to be!

372
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,208
Solar storms,
the end of the world.

373
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,250
It's exactly like what
Kou Kimijima was saying.

374
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,958
The same stuff that
was in the reports.

375
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,500
Gezi's master was murdered.

376
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,125
Just drop it! Stay out of Kou
Kimijima's business, okay?!

377
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,875
All three of the top players
were found dead in their homes.

378
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,791
Maybe she's trying
to use KILL-BALLAD

379
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,333
as a way to warn
me about something.

380
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,958
That you, Misa?

381
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,333
Forget about him.

382
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,625
What?

383
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,208
Forget about Kou Kimijima.
Stop poking around.

384
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,458
Tetsuharu Fujita, the owner
and operator of the Robo Clinic,

385
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,500
falls ill and is
hospitalized. His granddaughter,

386
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,791
Junna Daitoku, attempts to
visit him but is turned away.

387
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,500
The sad story of their long
estrangement comes to light

388
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,916
when Kai seeks to clear a flag
from the next Kimijima Report.

389
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,833
What piece of history will Kai
unearth in the Robo Clinic?

390
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,750
Will it be enough to repair a
long-neglected relationship?

391
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,750
Episode 12!

392
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,041
Let's hit it off, everybody!

393
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:24,958
Later days!
