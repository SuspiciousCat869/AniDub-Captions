1
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,583
"Gezi" Where have I heard that?

2
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,541
Uchugaoka Park? Seriously?

3
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,708
Who would go there on a dare?
It's not scary at all.

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,166
You know what I heard a girl I
met in the Karate Club say?

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,083
There's a ghost
haunting that park!

6
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,625
You're kidding, right?

7
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,291
What are you doing?

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,791
Oh, sorry.

9
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,916
Yeah, of course
I know about Uchugaoka Park!

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,583
I didn't know
you had any interest

11
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,166
in urban legends, though!

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,583
That's a surprise!

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,333
Of all people,
I never woulda expected her

14
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,541
to be so into this stuff.

15
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,416
She sounds even more perky
and excited than usual.

16
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,750
Freeze! Right there!

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,250
I need you at the club
today. A local newspaper

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,708
is sending reporters
to interview us

19
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,916
about taking second place

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,416
at the ROBO-ONE tournament.

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,083
I'll pass on that. Just tell
'em whatever you want.

22
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,708
Hey! Come on!

23
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,125
You might want to work up
something to say ahead of time.

24
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,166
If you play your cards right,
a company might even want

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,875
to sponsor you after
reading the article.

26
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,833
Yeah, maybe!

27
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,833
Kai!

28
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,375
I gotta go see Daitoku.
I'll catch you later, okay?

29
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,458
From Karate Club? Oh yeah,
I did notice you started

30
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,000
following each other
on Twipo. What is this?

31
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,041
"A youthful mistake
in the making?"

32
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,458
I'll drop by the
hangar if I have time.

33
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,000
'Kay, have fu-
No! Don't have fun!

34
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,208
Around here?

35
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,541
Yeah.

36
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,125
When it happened, do you
remember hearing anything?

37
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,958
Like a kind of buzzing
sound or something?

38
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,166
"Bee, boo-boo, buh buh-bee-bee"
You know, like that.

39
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,958
Something like that, I guess.

40
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,166
I thought so.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,666
There a legend
about the beeping?

42
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,708
Mhmm

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,250
What's that?

44
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,000
It's "The Buzzer." This same
buzzer sound has been playing

45
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,000
non-stop on a shortwave
radio station in Russia

46
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,291
for the last
thirty years or so.

47
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,208
One of the theories
people have come up with

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,208
is that it has to do with
ionosphere research. Who knows?

49
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,833
JAXA does have a station
pretty close to here.

50
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,291
Maybe the Uchugaoka Park beep

51
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,166
has something to do
with ionosphere stuff, too.

52
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,541
Hey! Could that be what caused

53
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,250
my PhoneDroid pad to freeze up?

54
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,041
Oh. I think that happened all
over the country, actually.

55
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,333
The real issue is that
email and the girl you saw.

56
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,958
If anything, they sound
more "occult" to me

57
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,500
than "urban legend."

58
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,958
There's a difference
between the two?

59
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,625
They're totally different.
The occult deals with

60
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,583
ghosts and demons
and stuff. It's scary.

61
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,666
There've been rumors
going around for awhile.

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,708
Stuff about a ghost
at Uchugaoka Park.

63
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,791
They say it's
a girl with long hair.

64
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,625
She's about
junior high age, or so.

65
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,000
Look, there she is!

66
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,791
What ghost would show up now?

67
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,208
The sun's still up.

68
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,125
That wasn't nice.

69
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,166
I admit. I've got
goosebumps now,

70
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,916
after hearing what you said.

71
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,583
The girl I saw here was exactly

72
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,791
like the one
you were describing.

73
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,375
Huh?! Really?!
Now that I think of it,

74
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,083
she's actually been seen
in other places, too.

75
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,875
Like at the Chikura Cave.

76
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,458
Yeah. I think I've heard of it.

77
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,666
Want to go look. My house
is that direction anyway.

78
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,833
That'd be cool, but do you mind

79
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,708
if we stop by the hangar first?

80
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:40,875
What hangar? Oh, you mean
that club you're in.

81
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,375
That cool?

82
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,791
I'm sorry. Robots are just...

83
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
Oh. Never mind.
I don't really need

84
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,291
to stop by
there anyway. Let's go.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,500
We'll check out the cave.

86
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,458
Yeah, that sounds good.

87
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,833
And now, let me introduce you

88
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,791
to the incredible, GunBuild-1!

89
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,291
Yeah... as we said,
we were hoping

90
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,000
to hear about ROBO-ONE.

91
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
I understand. But please.

92
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,541
That tournament is long over.
It's old, stale news by now!

93
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,708
I'd much rather discuss our
current activities and our futu-

94
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,791
Are you in here talking
nonsense to yourself ag--

95
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
Is he in the club, too?

96
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,208
What? Oh, yeah. That's our
new member, Subaru.

97
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,583
Whoa, is that what
I think it is?

98
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,916
No! It's not!

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,375
It's the M45! The winner
of the tournament!

100
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,625
Nope! It's totawy diffwent!

101
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,291
No doubt about it!
That's the one!

102
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,375
Absolutely! But what's
it doing here?

103
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,083
Well, Subaru belongs
to the club,

104
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,250
and that robot belongs to
Subaru, so there you have it.

105
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,541
Oww! Ow! Oww!
What was that for?

106
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:59,166
I'm sorry. You see.
Mr. Pleiades is a visitor here.

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,500
He's training for the upcoming
world championship tournament.

108
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,875
Oh, really? He is?

109
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,500
That's awesome!
Why didn't your club leader

110
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,416
give us that
information sooner?

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,916
We'd love to hear
all about it for our story.

112
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,083
I'm not finding
anything so far.

113
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:35,125
Mmm. Everything seems to
be normal with the pad, too.

114
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,041
Not freezing up or anything.

115
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,375
What's that?

116
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,958
Aww. It's a poor, dead whaley.

117
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,666
There've been a lot lately.
Apparently fourteen of them

118
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,291
washed up all
at once a while back.

119
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,375
Yeah, that was
in March, wasn't it?

120
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,541
I hear there have been lots

121
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,375
of wormies dying out,
and froggies, too.

122
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,000
A lot of strange things have
been happening on this island.

123
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,875
I don't think it's
just on the island.

124
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,541
I think, there's more to it.
Like how temperatures

125
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,541
in Russia were as hot
as summer this past winter?

126
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:21,500
Or how America's west coast is
getting slammed with snowstorms.

127
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,583
Or how heavy rains
have eroded the Nazca Lines.

128
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,041
You're right.
That is a lot of anomalies.

129
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,625
Yeah, sure is, but I guess
there's no way to know

130
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,666
if they're linked
at all, is there?

131
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,000
Even so, it is pretty strange.

132
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,208
It reminds me of the Anemone.

133
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,208
Thanks for your help today.

134
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,291
Here's a token of appreciation.

135
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,333
Man, you can't catch.
Wanna trade?

136
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,833
No, that's okay.

137
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,125
So, do you have training
tomorrow or what?

138
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,583
Like, karate?
No, I'm done with it.

139
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,958
It's my last year of school,

140
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,333
and I just had
my last tournament, so--

141
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,166
Oh! How'd you do?

142
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,875
I lost in the first round.

143
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,208
Wow. You're that bad
at it, huh?

144
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,291
Unfortunately. It's not
like I didn't try to improve.

145
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,750
I thought
three years of practice

146
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,875
in the school club
would help, but...

147
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,958
Then why don't you
join our club?

148
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,125
But I'm graduating this year.

149
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,458
So what? The same thing
goes for me and Aki.

150
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,166
I know, but,
robots aren't really...

151
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,583
I get it, there's something
with you and robots.

152
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,000
Still, you should come check
out the club at least once.

153
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,166
Although, I totally understand
if you're not a big fan of Aki.

154
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,000
No! That's not it!
Not at all!

155
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,583
Believe me, I have nothing
against Akiho whatsoever.

156
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,000
Really. In fact,
I actually think it would be

157
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,541
kinda cool if we
got to be friends.

158
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
Oh, yeah? That's awesome.

159
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,750
I'm sure she'd love to hear
that. You should tell her.

160
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,125
Well, maybe.
I'll think it over.

161
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,625
That's a bonus.

162
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,791
By the blessing
of the Seven Goddesses,

163
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,666
I now make my advent
of four hundred light years!

164
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:16,000
I am Mister Pleiades!

165
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,541
Will you go home?

166
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:31,000
GUNVAL Ankh Striker!

167
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,333
Hello, anybody home?

168
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,541
Dude, knock!

169
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,916
Oh, come on.

170
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,916
How'd the interview go?

171
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,375
Okay, I guess.

172
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,541
What about the Space Candy guy?

173
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,291
You did say you were going
to see him again, didn't you?

174
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
No dice. I even took
Tanegashi Machine with me,

175
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,500
but it didn't help.

176
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,083
Meh. Once again,
completely lacking impact.

177
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,666
Chesty, chesty!
Boing, boing, boing!

178
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,291
Why don't you take
Subaru with you?

179
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,541
If that guy's got
one thing, it's impact.

180
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,166
I already thought of that.
I asked him earlier.

181
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,041
You know I'd never go.
What kind of fool are you?

182
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,166
How about you take a good
look at what you're wearing

183
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,083
and then ask me that again?

184
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,083
Kai. What're we gonna do?

185
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,958
Well, good luck
figuring that out.

186
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,250
You act like it's got
nothing to do with you.

187
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,666
You're GUNVARREL's pilot,
you know. Start acting like it!

188
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,000
This conversation again?
I already told you no.

189
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,458
I don't wanna get
squished when it falls over.

190
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,208
It's not gonna fall over!

191
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,083
Geez, you'll do
what Subaru says,

192
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,375
but not me?
Some kinda friend you are.

193
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,833
Well, you can
always challenge me.

194
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about Daitoku?

195
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,666
Did she beat you, too?

196
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
Huh? That was
totally different.

197
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,541
She was doing me a favor.
I asked her to show me around.

198
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,625
Around where?

199
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,666
Some local urban legend spots.

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,041
Yeah? What for?

201
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,583
Well, well.
Are you interested?

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,291
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I don't care if you and Daitoku

203
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,833
want to go on a silly date.
It's really none of my business.

204
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,875
It's just, well,
you don't go places

205
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,208
with anyone all that often,

206
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,083
so I'll admit, it's kind
of surprising. That's all.

207
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,250
Actually, I was just asking
if you were interested

208
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,541
in spots around town
associated with urban legends.

209
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,500
"Kai! You are skilled, indeed!"

210
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,625
How so?

211
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,958
Oh, shut up!
You jerk!

212
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,083
What's with you?!

213
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,125
I hate you!

214
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,541
Just Mom asking about dinner.

215
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,958
Yeah, this kinda
thing never happens

216
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,583
when you're actually
waiting for it to.

217
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,416
Can you hear me?

218
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,791
Bingo!

219
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,625
Hello? Is anybody there?

220
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,333
One of the theories
people have come up with

221
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,666
is that it has to do
with ionosphere research...

222
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,291
Getting closer doesn't seem
to make any difference.

223
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,208
I probably had that coming.

224
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,875
Well, I guess that's that, then.

225
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,375
Don't I have an infrared
camera app on this thing?

226
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,833
Huh? What is this?

227
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,791
What password?

228
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,291
Airi knows the password.

229
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,041
I'd like to tell you what it is.

230
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,541
Are you here? In this room?

231
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,375
Yes, I'm here.

232
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,375
Airi was getting
so worried that

233
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,125
you wouldn't be
able to hear her.

234
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,750
What's going on?

235
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,875
Hey. Would it be alright
if I called you "Brother"?

236
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,458
I'd like to talk to you.

237
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,916
Is this real?

238
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,541
Testing, testing.
Tomorrow's weather report.

239
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,041
Looks like we
can expect good weather

240
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,708
for the Tanegashima region.

241
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,958
Clear blue skies!
How was that? Can you hear me?

242
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,375
It's an A.I.? That's good!

243
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,375
I can hear you loud and clear.

244
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,541
Airi's so glad. I'm great
at talking, actually.

245
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,666
In fact, I even know how to
say your full name, Brother.

246
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,666
You are Kaito Yashio!

247
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,750
How do you know that?

248
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,416
Are you asking
for a full explanation?

249
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,125
Then please tap Airi
to call for Gezi

250
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,041
and Gezi will
answer your question.

251
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,458
Go on. Just tap.

252
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,333
Access confirmed. Switch to
Gezi mode was successful.

253
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,208
Oh, so, you're Gezi.

254
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,833
Airi is the name
that has been given to a

255
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,916
communication interface that
resides in the IRUO servers.

256
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,541
Gezi is different.
Gezi is designated as a

257
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,666
fully-automated data
collection engine.

258
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,583
Okay, now will you tell me
how you know who I am?

259
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
Airi was initially
put into operation

260
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,833
on December 24th of the
year two-thousand-and-eight.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,833
You visited the park frequently.

262
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,625
You were also approximately
Airi's age at the time.

263
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,416
For these reasons,
you were selected

264
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,708
as a priority target
for possible contact.

265
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,750
Over the course of eight years,
twenty-nine distinct attempts

266
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,291
at contact were made.
Of those twenty-nine attempts,

267
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,750
you reacted in
some way three times.

268
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,708
However, this is the first time

269
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,583
that successful contact
has ever been achieved.

270
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,000
That many?

271
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,416
Let me see if
I've got this straight.

272
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,916
Basically you're an IRUO app
that took a liking to me?

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes, that is correct,
Mister Yashio.

274
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,625
Do you think you could
call me something else?

275
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
You are welcome
to register a nickname

276
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,958
if you would prefer it.
Go ahead.

277
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,916
Oh, let me think a second.

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,875
Just Yashio is fine
or Kai, maybe?

279
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,166
"Oh let me think a second.

280
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,916
Just Yashio is fine
or Kai, maybe."

281
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,375
Is this nickname correct?

282
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,916
Uhh. Cancel please.
Go with Yashio.

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,166
Canceled. The nickname
"Yashio" has been registered.

284
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,625
Is this nickname correct?

285
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,833
Yep. So, What do I do
to turn you off?

286
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,916
Do I just press this?

287
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,250

Pronounced Hidden Hand.

292
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,250
I dunno, this kinda
seems like a trap to me.

293
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,958
Oh, well: Hidden Hand.

294
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,375
This is a secret data file
located on the IRUO servers.

295
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,916
Codename: "Kimijima Report"
Number One.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,041
Written by Kou Kimijima. Date
created: November 7th,

297
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,833
two-thousand-and-nine.

298
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,125
Kimijima, huh? 'kay.

299
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,000
"I am creating this
backup report in the event

300
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,875
that I meet with an untimely
death. Someone has been

301
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,791
making threats on my life.
I expect it won't be long before

302
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,000
I am permanently eliminated."

303
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,375
Here goes: NASA is perpetrating
a massive cover-up.

304
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,875
During a solar survey
conducted in November of 2000,

305
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,333
magnetic monopoles
were discovered

306
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
in the sun's
southern polar region.

307
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,791
These findings are accurate
and cannot be disputed.

308
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,041
However, NASA organized
a full-scale

309
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,083
propaganda campaign in order
to convince the public that

310
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,500
the information leaked
regarding this discovery

311
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
was part of a hoax.

312
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,250
But the fact remains that all
scientific evidence indicates

313
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,416
that the sun is on
the verge of explosion.

314
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,625
Large-scale solar storms
will occur in succession

315
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,833
in twenty-twelve,
twenty-fifteen,

316
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,458
twenty-nineteen,
and twenty-twenty.

317
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,333
The twenty-fifteen solar
storm in particular will have

318
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,500
serious effects on the Earth
and its magnetosphere.

319
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,333
The sun will slam the
planet with energy so great

320
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,666
that it will plunge the
entire world into crisis

321
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,708
and no one will see it coming.

322
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,875
There's always talk
about solar storms.

323
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,208
And NASA cover-ups. It's not
like it's anything new.

324
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,000
So, like, it could
just be a story

325
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,375
some random guy came up with,
or I dunno, maybe even

326
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,125
a chapter from a
sci-fi novel or something.

327
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,166
Yeah, that seems likely.
But you said it was labeled

328
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,916
Number One, right?
Shouldn't that mean there's

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,625
a second part out there?

330
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,625
We'd want to look
at that, too, and besides.

331
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,458
Yeah?

332
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,541
There's still the fact that

333
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,125
it predicted the
solar storms perfectly.

334
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,500
Even the auroras started showing
up in Japan in twenty-twelve.

335
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,000
The years twenty-twelve,
fifteen, nineteen,

336
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,250
and then twenty.

337
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,833
What brings you here so late?

338
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,666
Mizuka, you're looking
nice, as always.

339
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,916
You wanna use
the bench, buy something.

340
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,958
The 2015 Crash. Oh, yeah.

341
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,250
When computers all around the
world started malfunctioning,

342
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,041
they said it was
because of a solar storm.

343
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,416
Oh my, you're looking
pretty serious.

344
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,916
And that isn't like you.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,375
Yeah, you're right.

346
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,500
Sorry. I just read
something strange.

347
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,250
Had to do with some
guy named Kou Kimijima.

348
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,541
Kaito. Where did
you hear that name?

349
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,916
So he did briefly demonstrate
abnormal behavior at the time.

350
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,083
I was right. It seems it wasn't
my imagination, after all.

351
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,500
I've compiled my report.
Would you like to see it now?

352
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
I would.

353
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,166
Kaito Yashio.
Currently eighteen years old.

354
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,250
Born May 5th,
two-thousand-and-one.

355
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,125
Hails from Tanegashima.

356
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,625
And one of the victims
of the Anemone incident.

357
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,583
After finding the mysterious
and cryptic Kimijima Report,

358
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,791
Kai goes to explore
the old folk museum,

359
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,083
following the suggestion
made by the AI named Airi.

360
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,125
Meanwhile, the search
for somebody to sponsor

361
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,291
the construction of
GunBuild-1 leads Aki back

362
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:14,166
to the Space Candy Company,
this time, with impact!

363
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,291
Just when things seem to
finally be falling into line

364
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,750
for the Robot Research
Club's sponsorship,

365
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,833
yet another conflict arises.

366
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,541
Episode 6!

367
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,250
Let's hit it off, everybody!

368
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,375
Later days!
