1
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,458
"Let's hit it off festival"?

2
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,458
Yeah, that's a local expression.

3
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,875
"Let's hit it off" means...

4
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,583
Something like, "Let's all
get together and work hard."

5
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,291
Not that anyone
actually says it.

6
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,458
Oh!

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:47,333
Okay, club! Let's hit
it oooooooofffffffff!

8
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey! Get into
the spirit, will you guys?!

9
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,833
This is a celebration of
GunBuild-1's near completion.

10
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,875
The whole club
should be partying.

11
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,125
Can we do it quickly?
I'm not staying.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,125
If it's a club party,
where are the other two members?

13
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,708
Kai went off to get Frau Bow,

14
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,500
but neither of
them have shown up.

15
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,666
Man, some festival
this is shaping up to be.

16
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,208
I feel like drifting off to
sleep held in the safe warmth

17
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,666
of your capable arms.

18
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,333
Or maybe you would
prefer it if I held you?

19
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:58,583
Hold me so tightly
I break. Please! w00t!!!

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,791
Uhh, you know. I really
only came to invite you

21
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,500
to the festival, not to
help you hunt for cheaters.

22
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,000
A festival?
That sounds pretty lame.

23
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,416
Look at this place.
You could stand to clean up.

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,208
Loli-maid plzkthx.
Rozetta might even work.

25
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,791
You mentioned that name before.

26
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,708
Who or what is Rozetta?

27
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,125
Wha?!

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,791
Hi, Yashio. How are you today?
I am Rozetta Yuuki!

29
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,750
Oh!

30
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
With all the KB you play,
h-how in the world could you

31
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,833
forget the name of
GUNVARREL's main heroine?

32
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,500
Y-Y-You poseeeeeeer!

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,875
Hi, I'm Genki! Genki Dotou!

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,208
And I'm GUNVARREL's
pilot! Nice to meet ya!

35
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,083
Pretty cool bots.
Did you program 'em yourself?

36
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,541
I'm l33t!

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Do these guys just talk to
you whenever they feel like it?

38
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,875
No, because that
would be really annoying.

39
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,833
Oh, I know. I wish Airi
could hear you say that.

40
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,208
Airi?

41
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,000
Did somebody call me?

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Lot of good it did me,
telling you to stay away.

43
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,416
Hey, what is that? A bot?

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,916
No, it's different.
OMG! It's for reals!

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,125
Switch to Gezi
mode was successful.

46
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
Hi, Gezi. Do me
a favor and explain

47
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,041
what you are
to this pervert here.

48
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,375
Understood.

49
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,708
Go ahead. Launch IRUO.

50
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
Make it quick, though, will ya?

51
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,583
Aki's waiting for
us at the festival.

52
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,875
True or false? Girl characters
gotta have wife material,

53
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,458
but with guys it's
all about the slash.

54
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,250
Ellery plus Genki equals OTP.

55
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,208
ITA. There are no
girls who dislike boyslove.

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
Zoh-my-God! QFT!

57
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,916
Wow. Didn't see that one coming.

58
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,708
It's HANASONO!

59
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,666
He's ranked Number 2!
It's time to go hunting!

60
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,333
Could you pwease wet
go of my arm aweady?

61
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,833
No, don't listen to him!

62
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,291
You know he's gonna
bolt as soon as you let go.

63
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,041
Right!

64
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,916
Why can't I leave?!

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,041
Look, there's a
shooting gallery over there!

66
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,291
Awwww. But I
don't like those games!

67
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,708
Look, Sis! It's Gunbam!

68
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,500
Sorry. It's too much.

69
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,958
Aww.

70
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,416
Besides, you don't want a mask.

71
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,541
A robot's not
something you can be.

72
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,958
It's something you make.

73
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,125
So good!

74
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,541
When does the
fireworks show start?

75
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,916
Aw, is it too hot
to handle, sweetie?

76
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,958
Unlike you, Chief.

77
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
Quick, you guys! Get down!

78
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,625
Why? What's happening?

79
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:44,125
Mr. Nagafukada? And he's
with that lady we met from JAXA.

80
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,333
Nae Tennoji. I don't see how
those two could know each other.

81
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,291
I bet the slut's
trying to gain access

82
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,916
to the club by seducing Mitchi!

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,333
Do you really
think she'd do that?!

84
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,375
Bah! "Now just what
are you up to, JAXA lady?"

85
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,750
He's reaching. She's reaching.
They're gonna...!

86
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,541
Don't do it!

87
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,083
Oh! Hi, Akiho.
I didn't know you were here.

88
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,875
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be that hungry.

89
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,458
It's not nice to
steal other people's food.

90
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,041
Someone could even call
the cops on you for that.

91
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,375
Ugh, you smell
like a distillery.

92
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
I didn't realize you
two knew each other.

93
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,416
How did you meet?

94
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,916
I dropped by the school
to say hi to you guys,

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,041
and he kindly offered to
show me around the festival.

96
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,291
Yeah, that's right.
I thought I'd show her

97
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,291
a good time,
for your club's sake.

98
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,625
Looks like I broke up their
little party just in time.

99
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,583
Is the robot coming along well?

100
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,250
Yeah, it is! As a matter
of fact, we're connecting

101
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
the upper and
lower bodies tomorrow.

102
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,708
Wow! So it's
almost finished, huh?

103
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,166
Just about, yeah!
Our blood, sweat, and tears!

104
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,291
That's what we've poured
into it for nine years!

105
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,708
At long last, the day
has come for GunBuild-1

106
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,083
to stand, proud and tall!

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,791
Yeah, yeah. I get it. I lose.

108
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,500
So, what's the verdict on him?

109
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,958
Epically epic fail!
My analyzer got nothing.

110
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,083
I even had my buddies in Tokyo
running online checks, too.

111
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,250
I can't believe
we struck out again.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,041
And the fireworks
have already started.

113
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,916
Minami Kogori was the name of
the woman who directed the show.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,166
She was also my mom.

115
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,750
Hey, uh.

116
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,708
Remember what I
said like, the other day?

117
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm in major
need of info, plzkthx.

118
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,041
I-If there's
anything on the island

119
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,583
you think might be relevant.

120
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,791
Something on the island?

121
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,583
Have you ever heard
of the Kimijima Reports?

122
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,083
Hey there, Sis. I mentioned
this in an earlier message,

123
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,583
but we're finally finishing
up work on GunBuild-1 tomorrow.

124
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,541
The dream you and the original
Robot Research Club started

125
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,875
is about to be realized. I wish
you could be here to see it.

126
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,833
But I'm sure you're really
busy with work and everything.

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Well, I'll let you know
how it goes. Talk to you later.

128
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,333
Okay! Let's move 'em on in!

129
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,375
Right!

130
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,541
I didn't know Jun was
in the Robot Research Club.

131
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,666
Nice and easy, bub!
Nice and easy!

132
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,125
This is an important day!
I can't believe those

133
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,333
other two didn't
show up! And you, Kai!

134
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,041
You never came to the
festival last night, either.

135
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,958
Hey! Robot Girl!

136
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,750
Uhhh. Hey, sounds like
he's calling you!

137
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,083
Oh! I'm coming!

138
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,750
Almost there! Let's go!

139
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,166
GunBuild-1! Standing at laaaast!

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Wow!

141
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,375
Damn.

142
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,208
Yep! That's serious
impact all right!

143
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,958
Eep, eep! Eep, eep, eep,
eep, eep, eep!

144
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,208
You know, Aki.

145
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I would really
love it if you could

146
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,416
make my dream
come true someday.

147
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,583
Well, later days!

148
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,750
Later days!

149
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,583
And don't forget,
tomorrow's start-up test

150
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,208
is at ten o'clock sharp!

151
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,500
Yeah, I know.

152
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,291
Oh, never mind, it's just
my mom. I'm standing outside!

153
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,083
Still nothing?
No word from Misa yet?

154
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,083
Nope. Man. I thought if I
sent her pictures of GunBuild-1,

155
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,833
she'd find the
time to say something.

156
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,750
You know, Kai, sometimes,
sometimes it makes me wonder

157
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,708
if she really wanted me
to finish what she started.

158
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,125
Like, maybe she
doesn't care anymore?

159
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,708
Well, she said it, didn't she?

160
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,541
She told you she wanted you
to make her dream come true.

161
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,500
Yeah, I know. But then,
when she left for Tokyo...

162
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,708
Misa! I'm gonna do it. You'll
see!

163
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,875
I'm gonna join the club and
make your dream come true!

164
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,208
Aren't you happy?

165
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,333
You'll never be anything
more than just mediocre, Aki.

166
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,416
It's like I told you before.

167
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,791
I'm sure she only said
that to get you fired up.

168
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
Do you really think so?

169
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,541
And I bet she's not replying
to your messages now 'cause she

170
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,333
doesn't like that you
finished what she couldn't.

171
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,208
Maybe.

172
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Hey. Is that the face
you're gonna wear tomorrow?

173
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,583
You really gonna look all
sad on GunBuild-1's big day?

174
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,916
No. You're right. There's no
point in worrying about it now.

175
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,541
What is this?!

176
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,666
Thanks. Enjoy the show!

177
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,458
Quite a turnout.
Looks like my advertising

178
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,333
had some real impact. Huh?

179
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,375
Check it out.

180
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,791
So many people!

181
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,666
Uh, I'm all in
favor of calling it off.

182
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,625
This is the very
first test. It might--

183
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,166
As swift as the wind!
As strong as the sea!

184
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,708
GUNVARREL!

185
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,458
Huh?!

186
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,125
The Robot Research Club
will regain its former glory!

187
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm fired up!
All fired uuupp! Right!

188
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,833
Hello, everybody!

189
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,875
I'm Akiho Senomiya.
On behalf of the

190
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,250
Robot Research Club,
I welcome you to today's test.

191
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,125
This is a giant
robot of justice!

192
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,791
Our club has worked on
it for the past nine years.

193
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,750
And now, at long last,
the day has arrived!

194
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,083
For the first time ever, a pilot
is going to board this robot

195
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,166
and conduct an
operations test. Oh, and...

196
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,666
The blueprints for
Gunbuild-1 were drawn up

197
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,166
by my big sister,
Misaki Senomiya.

198
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,791
Please, relax and enjoy!

199
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,000
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

200
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:58,958
What?

201
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,166
What are you doing?

202
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,208
I was planning to get in it.

203
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,291
You're not piloting that.

204
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,416
If I don't, then who's going to?

205
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,375
My stomach. Ahhh, oooh...

206
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,750
Aw, man. Okay, okay.

207
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,041
D'you got any candy?

208
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,666
Thank you, Kai.

209
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,041
Oh, wow, it's hot in there!

210
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,083
Yeah, answer call.

211
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,625
Kai! How is it?

212
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,583
Like a sauna.

213
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,291
I guess we should've installed
some fans in there, huh?

214
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,625
I'll look into it.

215
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,708
You can do that,
but it's a metal tube.

216
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,250
Okay. Now look
over the controls.

217
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,666
Seems simple enough.
Can we get started now?

218
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,291
I'm roasting here.

219
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,250
Okay, wait for my signal,
then rev up the engine!

220
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,125
All right, everybody!

221
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:11,041
It's time to
start up GunBuild-1!

222
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:17,125
Countdown! Three! Two! One!

223
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,333
Okay, GunBuild-1! Let's go!

224
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,916
That's it, Kai.
Now try taking a step!

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,291
Huh?! What did you say?

226
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,666
GunBuild-1... prepare to walk!

227
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458
You want me to make it walk?!

228
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,250
Damn! This thing's loud!

229
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,875
Counting down!

230
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,708
Three! Two! One! Let's walk!

231
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,333
Hey, Aki! What's going on here?!

232
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,791
It's okay!

233
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,291
Oh, really? 'Cause it
doesn't sound okay!

234
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Is this thing
even moving forward?!

235
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,166
Man, it's slow!

236
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,916
That is underwhelming.

237
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,416
Hey! Don't talk
about it like that!

238
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,875
It's walking, right?
Okay, so it may be going slowly,

239
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,583
but it is walking
which is amazing!

240
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
It's an incredible achievement!

241
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,833
Woulda been
nine years ago, but...

242
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,000
Times change, kid. That's just
the way of the world.

243
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,000
It's constantly evolving.

244
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,125
Oh, come on! This is boring!

245
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,250
Make it do somethin', already!

246
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,000
Guess it must be broken, huh?

247
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,625
About what you'd
expect from a kid's club.

248
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,791
Why isn't it moving?

249
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,458
It stopped?

250
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,583
Aw, come on. Is that it?

251
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,208
What happened?!

252
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,208
How should I know? The engine
cut out all of a sudden.

253
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,875
Do something!
Try starting it again!

254
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,625
No good. It won't go.

255
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,166
No way!

256
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,000
That diesel engine was
practically scrap metal.

257
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,791
It must've died.

258
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,500
It's time to let it go.

259
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,166
I'm sorry, Aki.

260
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,458
Well, good work, Kai.

261
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,833
You can come
down now. Thanks a lot.

262
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,541
My sister probably would
have done a better job,

263
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,791
don't you think?

264
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,833
If she'd built it.
It would work.

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,625
That's cold!

266
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,625
So, what do we do now?

267
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,500
I don't know. I just want
my sister to acknowledge me.

268
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,250
No, that's not quite it.

269
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:53,958
I guess I just... I want to
step out of her shadow, somehow.

270
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,541
Poor GunBuild-1.
He seems sad, huh?

271
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,583
So they finished it,
after all this time.

272
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:18,041
It looks so different, though.
It's nothing like my blueprints.

273
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,041
What is that?

274
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,250
Nothing. Just a
big piece of junk.

275
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,750
After GunBuild-1's failure, the
Robot Research Club is forced

276
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,916
to consider a
different plan of action.

277
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,833
While Aki and Subaru clash,

278
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,333
JAXA renews its
offer to collaborate.

279
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,291
Weight and motion.
Stubbornness and compromise.

280
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,875
Dreams and reality.

281
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,750
After striving so hard for so
long to bring her sister's robot

282
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,166
to life, what choice
will Aki ultimately make?

283
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,041
Episode 10!

284
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,083
Let's hit it off, everybody!

285
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,750
Later days!
