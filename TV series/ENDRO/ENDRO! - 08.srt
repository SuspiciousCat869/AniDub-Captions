Wait for me, everyone!

00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,208
What a beautiful day,
don't you think?

00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,375
Good morning, Hero!

00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, Rona! Good morning!

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,958
Everyone should really
have one of these.

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,750
You'd be surprised
how handy a staff

7
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,666
can be when you're
dungeon crawling.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,291
Any idea why that is?

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,666
How about you, Princess?

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,041
Huh? Well, um...

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,833
[SEIRA] They can be very useful
in searching for traps.

12
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,875
They're great for poking
around in dungeons.

[RONA]
Oh my gosh, thank you.

around in dungeons!

You do realize I heard
every word of that?

[RONA, SEIRA laugh]

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,250
It's vital for adventurers
to know about Cartado,

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,333
and how to use
them effectively.

20
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,750
They can be used for
offensive magic such as this,

21
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,583
or for carrying items around,
or a million other things.

[RONA]
Miss Mao?

23
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,375
I've never really understood
what Cartado are.

24
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,291
[MEI grunts]

25
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,375
I see. Where to begin?

26
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,875
[MEI] Cartado date back all
the way to the ancient times,

27
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,708
when heaven and earth
were first created!

28
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,875
[MAO]
Huh?

29
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,458
There are different
theories about that.

30
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,541
Like, for example, one theory
says the great creator appeared

31
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,625
back when our world
was nothing but chaos.

32
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,708
There was no light,
darkness, heaven, or earth,

33
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,166
and he raised up a single
card and said,

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,958
"Car-Tado!"

35
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,708
In Ancient Lapanestan,
that translates into

36
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,333
"world, be filled with light!"

37
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,708
and that is how the wonder
that is Cartado came to be!

38
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,708
Wow! Is that really true?

39
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,833
Yeah!

40
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,958
Hey! How 'bout if
I teach the lesson?

Yes, I can tell you like it
from how much you're eating!

44
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,833
You should have
some, too, Princess!

45
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you, I think I will!

46
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,375
Wait, what is happening?

47
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,500
It looks like Fai
is sharing food.

48
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,250
I guess they must
be super close now!

49
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,041
[YUSHA]
Aw, this bow is so cute!

50
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,125
It would look really
great on you, Hero!

51
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,375
I think it would look
even better on you.

52

Huh?

00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,375
Well, yeah, 'cause you're
already so cute anyway!

56

[RONA laughing]
Well, I must admit,

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,208
I had a very fulfilling day!

58
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,208
Although, I do feel as if
something is missing.

59
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,291
[RONA gasps]
Oh, gosh, that's right!

60
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,791
Well, then,
what brings you here?

61
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,250
And on your day off?

62
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
Miss Mao.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,250
It bothers me that the Hero
isn't even slightly heroic!

64
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,333
Huh?

65
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,000
What the heck are
you talking about?

66
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,625
Heroes are really special.

67
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,250
They save us all from the
good-for-nothing Demon Lord,

68
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,541
otherwise he'd bring
total chaos and destruction

69
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,083
to the world as we know it.

70
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,916
So, heroes should be the
strongest, bravest people ever.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,916
Who're you calling
good for nothing?

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,791
Sorry?

73
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,791
Nothing! W-Was that out loud?

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,041
Continue.

75
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,916
All right. So, anyway,
our Hero's different.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,666
She attends classes, eats
boxed lunches, goes shopping

77
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,375
with the rest of us, and lives
like a fairly normal girl.

78
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,500
[MAO] So, basically she
does all the same things

79
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,291
that you do, and you
don't like that?

80
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,208
It's not that I don't like it.

81
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,041
It's really fun to
hang out with her!

82
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't get it then.
What's the problem?

83
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,750
Not a problem. It's just
always been my wish

84
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,291
to get to see the Hero
doing heroic things.

85
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,583
Gotcha, so you wanna see
big acts of bravery.

86
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,000
Come to think of it,
she did say something

87
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,208
about defeating an evil
god over summer break.

88
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,583
Who knows if it's true, though.

89
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,333
Defeating an evil god?
That's perfect!

90
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,416
Give me more of that, thank you!
Are there any of those villains

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,583
that're just ripe for
destroying out there?

[MAO]
No, of course there aren't.

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,291
And don't talk about evil
gods as if they're fruit.

94
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,500
Besides, even if
Yusha is the Hero,

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,166
you have to keep in mind that
she's still just a fledgling.

She can't go on proper

Seira and Mei,
you guys stay back!

161
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,333
Here it comes!

162
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,541
[POMURUNS]
Pompom pompom!

163
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,500
[SEIRA]
Huh? Pomuruns?

164
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,583
[MAO]
Look at that!

165
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,583
They're really taking
this seriously!

166
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,166
The Hero does seem
to be fighting

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,125
as hard as she
possibly can for me!

168
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,333
Though, this is
pretty unsatisfying.

169
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,208
The Pomuruns aren't
working for you?

170
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,208
Well, after all, they really
are the weakest monster,

171
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,916
aren't they?
And the boulder trap

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,708
was obviously made out of papier
mache, and besides that...

173
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,041
Hold on!

174
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,416
Oh my goodness!

175
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,791
You even prepared
recovery points for them?

176
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry, but this
doesn't feel serious!

177
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,000
Uh... Okay, then what did
you have in mind?

178
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,666
To demonstrate her true power,

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,583
I think the Hero should
have to face trials

180
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,916
just like the ones spoken
of in our legends!

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,666
For example, a falling trap
that'll flatten even trolls!

182
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,791
An army of demons from the
demon realm lying in wait!

183
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,541
Cursed evil spirits that'll
steal their souls if they dare

184
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,875
to let their guard down
for even a minute!

185
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,625
Y'know, things like that.

186
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,791
Jeez, even I didn't think to set
up hardcore stuff like that!

187
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,708
Pardon me?

188
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,750
[MAO]
Nothing! What? Nothing!

189
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,041
Hey, Princess.

190
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,750
It sounds like you
won't be satisfied

191
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,291
until they're put
in actual danger.

192
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,166
Huh? Well, doesn't danger

193
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,708
just go with the territory
when you're the Hero?

194
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,041
Unless, wait a minute...

195
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,208
I guess when I think about it,
the one who's putting

196
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,666
the Hero in danger is...
Oh dear, oh my. Could it be?

197
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,791
[MAO] Look! Here we go, they're
approaching the next room.

198
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,750
Oh yes! I'm finally about
to witness the real-life,

199
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,416
marvelous deeds of a Hero!

200
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,166
Look at you! So confident!

201
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,583
I am!

202
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,833
Because guess what is awaiting
them in the next round?

203
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,541
The Demon Lord's Four Generals!

204
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,875
His Four Generals?!
Are you crazy?!

205
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,041
You actually brought them here?

206
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,208
[GENERALS laughing]

207
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,333
Who's there?

208
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,541
[GENERALS laughing]

209
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,750
Wait! Hold on,
what're those costumes?

210
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,958
[RONA] They're the Demon Lord's
Four Generals, see?

211
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,666
Look at this. Perfect replicas!

212
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,666
[MAO]
No, that's not...

213
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,458
The author of that book may have
taken some artistic license.

214
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,625
They're really big.

215
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,208
And they're strong!

216
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,291
Great eye.

217
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,375
Guess that's just the
Four Generals for ya, huh?

218
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,750
This is nuts. They're
almost freakishly strong!

219
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
Of course they are!

220
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,333
The ones in the costumes
are my personal bodyguards

221
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,208
so they're the very best,
and the pride of our nation!

222
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,833
[RONA]
Sword Master.

223
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,250
Grappler.

224
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,500
Archer.

225
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,000
And Arch Wizard!

226
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,500
They're the four
strongest people

227
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,500
in the whole Lapanesta Kingdom!

228
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
Yes, I'm ashamed to say it,

229
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,750
but they might be stronger
than the real Four Generals.

230
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,750
[GENERALS laughing]

231
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,000
You guys feelin' okay?

232
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,875
This might be a bit too much.

233
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,375
They're out of our league,
it's not a fair fight.

234
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,541
The way this is going, we won't
be able to save the princess!

235
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,416
[SEIRA, MEI sigh]

It's too soon to give up!

00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,000
Because we decided
we were going to save

240
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,375
our friend Rona no matter what!

We're with you.

She's our friend, after all!

246

And that's the kind of thing
friends do for each other!

Stay out of our way!

Do you understand me?

255
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,000
Rona is our friend and
she's coming with us!

256

Huh?

257

Wait, what?

00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,875

00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,750
Yeah.

00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,875
[gasps] Are you letting us pass?

262
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,625
[SWORDMASTER 8A]
Mm.

263
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,750
[SWORDMASTER 8A] The four of us
have served the Princess

264
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,041
ever since she was just
a little slip of a thing.

265
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,333
Thank you all
for protecting me!

266
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,916
You're the best!

267
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,208
[SWORDMASTER 8A]
The Princess's happiness

268
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:21,375
is all that any of us
could ever wish for.

269
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,041
To have people who would risk
their very lives for yours--

270
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,083
well, we think you've made
some good friends, Princess.

271
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,750
[RONA, MAO]
<i>ENDRO!</i>

272
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,416
Well, it was pretty
wonderful getting

273
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
to watch the Hero fight,

274
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,041
but it ended right when
it was getting good.

275
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,541
I wonder what could
have happened

276
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,666
to make everyone
stop fighting like that.

277
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,166
Uh! Do you think maybe they all
suddenly got stomachaches?

What is it?

00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,083
I think it's time to
stop this, don't you?

281
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,333
[RONA]
Huh?

282
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,375
Come on, haven't you
already gotten your wish

283
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,083
to see all of them fight
like real Heroes?

284
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,666
They did well, considering.
So, aren't you satisfied?

285
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,250
Not yet! Right after this comes

286
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,333
their final battle
against the Demon Lord!

287
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,208
Which you know is the
climax of any Hero's tale!

288
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,916
I mean, it would
just be unthinkable

289
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,916
to shut it all down now.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,458
[MAO] Hm... What was
going through your mind

291
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,500
as you watched them fight today?

292
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,750
Huh?

293
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,541
[RONA]
When they first came for me...

294
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,291
...I was simply elated!

295
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,916
I did get nervous when
they set off the traps.

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,791
But I was so thrilled to see how

297
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,666
truly wonderful
their fighting was!

298

But, then...

299
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,791
Because we decided
we were going

to save our friend

Rona is our friend,
and she's coming with us!

[RONA] I wonder what this is,
this prickling in my chest.

303
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,125
I thought this was all I wanted,

304
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,083
to get to see a real
Hero in action.

305

Huh?

321
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,000
What is this?

322
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,125
[grunts] Come on!

323
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,666
It's a barrier. One that's
dangerously strong.

324
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,250
Don't worry! I'll get you
outta there guys!

[DEMON LORD]
If you want to save her,

326
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,375
I'm afraid you'll
have to defeat me.

327
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,791
[DEMON LORD]
One more thing.

328
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,416
You must use your
own power, alone.

329
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,291
Be careful.

330
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,333
It'll be okay.

331
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,875
I've got this.

332
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
I promise I'll save you!

[yells]

335
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,375
I ask you this, now.

336
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,750
Why is it you seek the Princess?

337
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,541
For wealth? For status?
Or perhaps, for fame?

338
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,750
No!

339
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,000
Then is it just because
you're the Hero?

340
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,708
Your strong sense of duty?

341
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,166
Because it's your
destiny to defeat me?

342
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,833
No, none of that!

343
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,708
It's not because she's
the princess, or because

344
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,958
I'm the Hero. None of that
matters. It never did!

345
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,958
It's about her!

346
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,000
Because Rona is one
of our precious friends

347
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,625
and she's in trouble now!

348
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,666
That's why we've all
come to save her!

349
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,750
[gasps]

350
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:41,000
[RONA] Oh my gosh, now that
I look back, I see it all!

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,958
[inaudible]

352
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,125
Hang on, friend!

353
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,125
[RONA] She always thinks
of me as "Rona, her friend."

354
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,416
I don't remember the last time
she called me "Princess."

355
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,166
And what did I do?

356
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,208
I only thought of
her as one thing.

357
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,500
You better give Rona back!

358
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,250
[RONA] No, you have
to stop this, please!

359
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,125
[YUSHA]
Huh?

360
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,625
[DEMON LORD]
Huh?

361
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,333
I'm so sorry!

362
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,583
I'm responsible for
every single bit of this.

363
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,000
The Demon Lord
isn't really back.

364
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,208
My kidnapping was a big lie.

365
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,583
It's true. I did this!

366
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm so incredibly sorry!

367
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,791
[GIRLS]
Uh?

368
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,166
What?

369
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,333
[GIRLS]
Why?!

370
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
I've always admired
the Hero in our legends,

371
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,625
even way back when
I was a tiny thing.

372
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,875
I just knew that, one day,
I would meet a Hero

373
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,791
who was as lovely and triumphant
as the ones in the stories.

374
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,875
But now, I can see that I was
a little hung up on the stories,

375
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,916
and I tended never to look
at what was really there.

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
What was really there?

377
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,166
You, Hero, you were
there the whole time.

378
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,083
No. I mean Yulia Chardiet.

379
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,583
I feel like I've constantly
imposed my ideal Hero on you,

380
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,416
and I haven't been looking
at the real you at all.

381
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
So you're saying,

382
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,333
you got a fake Demon Lord
to make Yusha act heroic?

383
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,166
Because she hadn't done
anything like that yet

384
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,333
and so you felt like you
were missing out?

385
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,458
I mean, on one hand, it's true,
Yusha is hardly heroic.

386
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,333
Yeah, can't really blame her.

387
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,000
Huh?! Come on,
that's not true, you guys!

388
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,416
Yeah! She's right!

389
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Yulia is a wonderful person,
and she is heroic!

390
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,708
[gasps, sighs]

391
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,708
[laughs]

392
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,083
So, anyway, seems like there
wasn't a real Demon Lord.

393
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,333
Indeed.

394
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,333
[YUSHA]
That's good!

395
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,333
Huh?

396
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,875
Honestly, I'm just
really relieved

397
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,125
that you weren't
actually kidnapped!

398
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,666
Hey but, do you know what?

399
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,583
If the Demon Lord
ever did do this,

400
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,250
or anything even
remotely like it,

401
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,458
I wouldn't hesitate
to save you again!

402
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,458
It's true!

403
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,750
Absolutely!

404
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,083
We should probably come
up with some strategies

405
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,750
to try to keep her safe.

406
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:11,083

everyone! So much!

and a very powerful
one at that, I think.

00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,291
I was seriously doing my best
to cut straight through you!

I'm so sorry!

Heh. It'll be a hundred years
before a weakling like you

has the skill to slay me.
