I'll seal his blades
using Seal Weapon!

00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,041
Looks a lot like
"birdlime" to me.

00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,625
Which is perfect for the birds.

Get it, you guys,
"for the birds"?

Oh, no, you're
not getting away.

I'll do Breeze times three
for a Tornado Combo!

Basic Cartado are great
if you know how to use them.

You of the honored Hero's party.

As someone who's witnessed
everything you've ever done

record it, which might be weird,

I'm so incredibly thrilled
I got to see this!

[GIRLS]
We'd like a Hero's quest.

Whoa, what in the heck did
you do that for, Miss Mao?

Good, looks like you're
back in your right minds.

Honestly, you girls should
be able to cure yourselves

when you've been
inflicted with Confusion.

We've been in our right minds!

Also, I'm so sorry, but I have
to ask, did you really just

42
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,375
cast magic without using
any Cartado at all?

43

Uh.

Well, never mind
about that right now.

I thought you were
here to talk about

a Hero's quest, weren't you?

We sure are!

Hold on.

Take a look at this, Miss Mao!

00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,083
An advanced quest receipt,

00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,750
for the purpose of
defeating a Criffon?

Guys, this is nuts.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,166
That's the legendary rare

around it, referred to as
the "Truth Recorder"!

Thanks for breaking that
down for us, Mather.

Very well done. Now, I'd
like for you to watch this.

It's some footage of
Yusha and the others.

at what you see.

[gasps]

66
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,083
I can't believe that you
four defeated a Criffon,

67
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,541
and you actually cleared
an advanced quest, to boot.

68
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,791
Oh, weird. Why'd you record us?

69
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,791
I wanted to keep a historical
record of what you've done.

70
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,583
Our newest Hero deserves
to be remembered.

I've recorded
everything I've seen.

And it's been an honor
to do so as your friend,

I guess they really did it.

76

Now that I think about it,
both Yulia Chardiet's group

77
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,208
and the "Hero-fanatic" princess
have grown by leaps and bounds.

78
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,958
You deserve the
credit, Miss Mao!

79
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,791
Because this is obviously
due to everything

80

you've been teaching us!

[MAO] Wow. This must be what
it feels like to help others.

So, are you gonna give
us a Hero's Quest?

I can't.

[YUSHA]
What do you mean? Why not?

85
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,583
Because the Demon Lord
hasn't even revived yet.

86
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,625
So why would a Hero's
Quest even be available?

That makes sense.

88

Guess we can't have a Hero
without a Demon Lord.

89
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,625
You say that as if there was
some kind of secret pact

between Demon Lords
and Heroes of the past

You know, Mao.

Sometimes I think
education requires

both the carrot and the stick.

95
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,000
I get it. That's helpful
to keep in mind.

And just so you know,
if you were the one offering,

97

both the carrot and the stick.

that's not helpful at all.

Hmm.

00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,583
Well... I suppose that
since you've finished

00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,875
an advanced quest,

102
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,416
I could consider gifting
you a special reward.

there is no Demon Lord.

that entering this room again

to clean it like before.

Yeah, that time, I just
assumed it was like this

with the Demon Lord fever.

[MAO] Yep, my dignity
is in serious danger.

163
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,541
Just like this elf girl who's
taking her long life for granted

164
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,750
and claiming she'll get
serious one day,

Nope!

Ka-boom! So, what do you
think of my cooking, now?

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,125
It looks incredible, Miss Mao.

176
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,916
You mean it looks
incredibly weird.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,833
I'm confused, it's like we were
watching her start to cook,

178
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,916
but then I can't remember
seeing her do anything.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,166
So, um, you didn't by any
chance use Cartado, did you?

Look, why don't you guys
go ahead and eat up?

I don't get it.

This flavor doesn't even
exist in the natural world.

It's like my mind is
still totally clear,

00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,458
but only my mouth moves.

189
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,250

It's as if this poison decided

190
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,750
to leave our tongues alone

00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,958
solely for the purpose of making
us eat this stuff forever.

00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, goodness, what a shame.

193
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,125
Maybe you should
stay over tonight,

though I'll need to check and
see if I have enough pillows.

So, I guess her name is
officially settled, then?

Yeah, why not? She's a

Why are complications like
this happening again?

[YUSHA] Ah! You guys,
a maid popped out!

Bad Chibi! That was bad!

[SEIRA]
Hold on. This girl isn't human.

224
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,458
She looks like some

Would you stop?

Although, I've never seen one

that looked so much
like a human before.

[MAO] What is this?
What is she doing here?

Before I got flung
into the past,

231
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,500
she was an all-purpose
golem that served me.

232
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,791
So how did she
end up in this age?

233
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,916
And why'd she shoot out
of that monster's mouth?

Oh, that reminds me.

I'm not doing that!

Don't be ridiculous!

You guys, I'm pretty
sure she'll be fine

252
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,250
since she'll be living with
Miss Mao for a while.

253

Looks like you're even bringing
her to school with you now, huh?

Well, I can't just
leave her all alone.

255

[MAO] I'm even more anxious
when she's not nearby!

She's not bullying you, right?

257
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,500
[MEIGO] No, she's treating
me very well, thank you.

Not that. I meant
with her cooking.

Would you please shut up?

260
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,666
Besides, preparing our meals
became one of her jobs

right off the bat.

00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,166
Oh, I see.

263
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,833
So what you're saying
is she won you over

264
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,791
through your stomach,
is that the case?

265
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,958
What a totally bizarre
way to put it.

Don't you have lesson plans
to prepare or something?

269

[sighs] Today has
been so exhausting.

You've done a good
job, Miss Mao.

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,416
[MAO] Well, let's be real, most
of this stress is from fretting

272
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,333
about what to do whenever
your memories come back.

273
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
I think I might have a
drink with my coworker

It feels like she might.

Actually, I think I'll just
lounge around at home instead.

Tell me what?

It's impossible to
eat this in peace

my shoulder like that.

Thank you.

295
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,583
I convinced the
fishmonger to share

296
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,666
some of his secret
broth with us.

297
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,291
Apparently, the product is
labeled "Mackerelman Leftovers."

298
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,000
[MAO] I think I'm
probably better off

299
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,500
not pursuing those
details any further.

300
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
Understood.

301
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,916
Oh, and do try some of this
salt-fried <i>tottori</i> , as well.

Feels silly that you're
just standing there.

306
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,875
A servant is never
permitted to do such things.

307
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,208
[MAO]
This isn't so bad, after all.

308
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,291
Wait, I'm only keeping
this girl close to me

309
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,541
so I can keep an eye on her!

314
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,791
Would you all like to
explain what you're doing

315
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,083
in my house right now?

316
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,250
Simple!

317
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,250
I wanted to experience
being invited over

318
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,750
to a friend's home, as well!

319
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,125
I told you people, I'm not
your friend, I'm your teacher,

320
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,541
and there's a difference!

321
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,208
Why'd you have to pick my
tiny little house, anyway?

322
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,500
How're you, Meigo?

323
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,333
Well, thanks.

324
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,208
I've got a surprise for you.

325
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,833
In anticipation of something
like this happening,

326
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,833
I keep a "Legendary Rare" on
me that restores memories!

327
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,458
And now, I'm so glad I do!

328
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,708
[MAO gasps]

329
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,750
Wait! It restores them
no matter what happened?

330
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,166
That's incredible, Rona!
What great news!

331
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,833
You'll get your memories back!

332
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,416
Oh, my. Do you really think so?

333
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,708
[MAO]
Not good! Not good!

334
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,833
I am in so much trouble
if you use that thing

335
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,375
and she remembers me!

336
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,083
Hold on! Slow down a minute!

337
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,791
Are you positive she wants
this, 'cause she might not!

338
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,750
[RONA]
Sealed door of memories,

339
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,916
open before this
light of blessing!

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,583
Now!

341
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
[ALL gasp]

342
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,791
Well, do you
remember now, Meigo?

343
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,583
[MEIGO]
Mh-mh.

344
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,125
[RONA]
Oh. I'm so sorry.

345
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,125
Wait, so it didn't
work? What a...

346
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,416
That's so strange.

347
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,625
I wonder if I was
out of magic power.

348
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,250
Mather, what do you think?

349
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,875
[ALL]
Uh...

350
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,916
I just remembered!

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,166
[MAO]
Wait, they remember stuff?

352
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,541
[YUSHA] We met at the adventurer
school, and we hit it off fast,

353
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,958
so we formed a party!

354
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
[SEIRA] And during our
first quest in class,

355
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,958
Yusha drew the Hero's Sword.

356
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,958
[MEI] And then we set off on a
journey as the Hero's party,

357
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,583
determined to defeat
the Demon Lord.

358
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,666
[FAI] We went on lots and
lots of adventures,

359
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,041
and finally arrived at
the Demon Lord's castle.

360
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,875
[YUSHA]
There, we fought him bravely.

361
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,250
[YUSHA]
And then,

362
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,958
after we were all thrown
back into the past,

363
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,666
we met up again,
like the first time.

364
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,791
Look at you. Each of you.

365
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,250
You're my fate.

366
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,875
And you're ours.

367
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,250
You sure are.

368
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,791
We're with you.

369
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,458
But! It's on you!

370
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,333
This is all your fault
for flubbing the chant

371
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,125
to that stupid forbidden spell!

372
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,583
I know, I'm so sorry, okay?

373
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,333
Do you realize what
this means, though?

374
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,041
You all have practically
defeated the Demon Lord already!

375
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

376
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah, that was no sweat at all.

377
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,291
That's what happens when we
all four decide to get serious.

378
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,291
[MAO]
What do you mean, "serious?"

379
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,958
[RONA] But I'm curious,
how did Meigo end up here?

380
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,083
[YUSHA]
Oh, yeah.

381
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,541
As I recall,

382
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,416
she was the final enemy
protecting the Demon Lord.

383
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,291
She was even stronger
than his Four Generals!

384
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,541
But the thing is,
I couldn't possibly tell you

385
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,166
how she ended up popping
out of Chibi's mouth.

386
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,666
If Meigo is indeed the
Demon Lord's attendant,

387
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,250
then isn't there a chance that
she knows where he is right now?

388
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,416
[MAO]
Gulp!

389
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,833
I don't know. You think
she might tell us?

390
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,875
You seriously think the Demon
Lord's attendant will confess?

391
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,291
Not like there's anything we
can do about it, anyway.

392
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,625
Did you forget her
memories didn't return?

393
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,083
Hey, I've got it, we can
keep her here as a hostage

394
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,666
to draw the Demon Lord out!

395
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,458
What do you think?

396
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,250
[OTHERS]
Okay, elves are scary.

397
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,833
No, that was a joke.
I was totally kidding!

398
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,333
Well, for now,

399
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,083
I say we at least keep her here
in the Lahpanesta Kingdom!

400
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,625
We certainly can't
allow anything

401
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,833
related to the Demon
Lord to run free.

402
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,458
Good idea! I'm on
board with that!

403
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,750
It makes sense,
so I guess you're right.

404
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,958
[MAO] If she truly didn't regain
her memories with that spell,

405
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,416
there's not much chance of her
recalling my real identity.

406
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,333
Which means my peaceful life
will be secure once more!

407
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,291
Try not to hate me for that.

408
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,958
Besides, this is the princess
we're talking about.

409
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,875
She would never hurt you.

410
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,000
[gasps]

411
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,208
[MAO]
Hold on, is she scared?

412
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,125
But golems don't
have any emotions.

413
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,500
Don't worry. You'll be safe.

414
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,208
[MAO gasps]

415
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,666
[MAO] Does that mean her
memories have returned?

416
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,375
[MEIGO] In that case, you
may take me in, Princess.

417
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,916
You will never be mistreated.
Don't be afraid.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,166
[MAO]
Calm down, it's gonna be okay!

419
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,500
She may look like she's human,
but she's just a golem.

420
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416
[MEIGO] I am a golem and
I was created specifically

421
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,666
to serve the Demon Lord.

422
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,291
[MAO]
She's not a real person.

423
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,750
She's only capable of doing
what she's ordered to do!

424
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,291
She's just...

425
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,416
[YUSHA]
But hey!

426
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,208
If the Demon Lord's
attendant is here,

427
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,541
then that means he must
be out there somewhere!

428
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,583
So we have to defeat him!
Because I'm the Hero!

429
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,458
Victory is mine!

430
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,166
I hope so.

431
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,458
[MAO]
I get it.

432
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,500
Because while she has her
personal pride as the Hero...

433
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,208
...I do, too!

434
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,875
I won't let you!

435
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,333
What did you say?

00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,458
[MAO]
My pride is as fierce as yours!

437
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,666
What kind of Demon Lord
abandons their loyal servants?

438
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,375
[MAO yells]

439

What the heck is happening?

00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,291
[MEI]
Incredible magic power!

441
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,333
Coming from Miss Mao?

Hello, Master.

What seems to be the
trouble, Yulia Chardiet?

No, wait, "O Legendary Hero."

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,416
Have you not been longing
to defeat the Demon Lord

447
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,750
more than any other wish?

448

Is that you... Miss Mao?

449
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,916
[DEMON LORD] I'm none other
than the Demon Lord.

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,625
The Demon Lord who shall
rule over Naral Island!

451
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,333
You'd do well not to forget.

[DEMON LORD laughs]

455
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,375
If you want to save
the princess, Hero,

456
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,916
then come to my castle,
and don't waste time!

457
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,541
I'll be waiting for you there.

458
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,833
And Yulia Chardiet,

459
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,833
I plan to make you taste
true despair once more!

460
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,041
Is this happening?

461
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,000
I can't believe that Teach
is the real the Demon Lord.

462
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:18,875
It's true.

463
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,625
That form and powerful magic,

464
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,416
they definitely belong to the
Demon Lord that we remember.

465
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,958
Gotta save Rona,
and Meigo, too.

466
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,708
And Miss Mao!

467
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,750
Oh, Miss Mao.

468
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,750
No, you're... the Demon Lord.

469
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,041
I don't understand why
you're doing this.
