1
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
So, the summer break you've
all been looking forward to

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,750
finally starts tomorrow.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,541
[STUDENTS]
Yay!

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,041
[MAO]
You are so predictable.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,041
You do realize you'll
have homework?

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,041
[STUDENTS]
Aww...

7
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,875
Don't worry,
I think you'll like it.

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,166
Your summer homework will
be to clear several quests

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,791
successfully and write a report
on at least one of them.

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,833
I like quests, but I don't
love summer assignments.

11
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,125
Wonder what the options are.

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,166
[SEIRA] Let's go look at
them later and decide.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,791
Sound good, Yusha?

14
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,875
[YUSHA gasping]

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:45,791
Yusha!

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,000
What? What'd I do?

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,958
It kinda looked like
you were spacing out.

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,625
Something particular
on your mind?

19
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, I guess.

20
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,416
I'm just really looking forward
to our summer break!

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,458
I was wondering
where we should go.

22
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,291
There are so many fun options!

23
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,125
[laughs]

24
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,125
[MAO] How very bold
of you to hold your little

00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,625
summer-fun-committee-meeting

26
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,333
when I'm standing
in front of you.

27
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,583
[YUSHA]
Huh?

28
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,458
Give it up. Your summer
is owned by homework.

29
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,708
[YUSHA screaming]

30
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,208
[FAI] So, now we have
to pick a quest?

31
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,958
What are the choices?

32
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,291
You know, thanks to you,
we won't be able to get away

33
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,000
with picking an easy one.
I'm really looking forward

34
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,958
to all the extra scrutiny
from Miss Mao.

35
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,833
[gasps] Forgive me,
I'm so sorry!

36
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,458
Calm down. I'm joking.

37
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:07,208
Let's see, we could mine some
ore or go collect monster eggs.

38
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,708
We could even gather
medicinal herbs.

39
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,916
What kind of quest are you
girls in the mood for.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,666
Duh! Defeat a Demon Lord!

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
'Fraid not.

42
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,416
[FAI]
I know! Let's eat yummy food!

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,750
That's not a quest.

44
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,041
[MEI] We could complete
my Cartado collection!

45
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,583
Another personal wish.

46
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,833
I've got it!
Let's go to the beach!

47
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,375
[ALL]
To the beach?

48
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,375
Yeah! I mean, you have to go to
the beach in the summertime!

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,375
Beach, beach, beach...

50
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,208
[MEI, SEIRA, FAI]
The beach, huh?

51
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,500
[FAI] Oh, wow, there would
be so much tasty seafood!

52
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,916
[MEI]
It's a chance to find Cartado

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,583
that are exclusive
to port towns!

54
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,458
--I'm all in for this idea.
--[MEI] I'm in. Let's go!

55
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,041
Gonna take a wild guess,
so tell me if I'm wrong.

56
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,833
You two are only in this for
the seafood and Cartado, huh?

57
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,583
Can we go?
What do you think, Seira?

58
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,875
If it's just for play,
I'm against it.

59
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,541
But, if we're going
on a quest, I'm in.

60
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
[MEI] Investigating the monsters
living on a remote island?

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,208
That sounds perfect for us!

62
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,416
Wanna do it?

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,875
Yep! This is the one!

64
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,375
If we're going on
a real journey,

65
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,416
then we'll need Cartado
for camping gear.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
And I won't bring
the wrong one again.

67
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,750
Okay, Fai?

68
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,083
[FAI]
Mm, mm, mm. These are good.

69
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,958
They haven't expired
yet or anything.

70
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,208
Hey wait! You're not supposed
to eat those now!

71
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,875
[YUSHA giggles]

72
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey, Yusha,
everything okay?

73
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,833
Huh? Yeah, it's great!

74
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm just sitting here thinking.

75
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,000
It's kind of fun preparing
for a big adventure.

76
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,458
Even for school.

77
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,041
Yeah, it really is.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,250
[FAI] Oh! I forgot to check
Sei's food stash!

79
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,291
Now that's the stuff!

80
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,125
[SEIRA]
Huh? No, no, no, no! Don't!

81
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,708
That's for the quest!
Leave it alone!

82
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,041
[GIRLS laughing]

83
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,166
We made it!

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,208
Let's get this party started!

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,083
Time to play!

86
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,666
[SEIRA]
We have a job to do!

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,166
We are here specifically
to go on a quest.

88
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,083
As representatives
of all adventurers,

89
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
we must stick to
the task at hand.

90
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,250
There are monsters
on this island.

91
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,708
[SEIRA] When the heck
did you put those on?

92
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,708
Aren't you gonna get
changed, Seira?

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,291
I told you!

94
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,125
We did not come all the way
out here just to play around!

95
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,250
Come on, didn't you
bring a swimsuit?

96
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,750
Well, yeah, of course I did
but that's not the point.

97
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go! I'll help
you get ready!

98
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,125
U-Uh... I can do it myself.

99
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,833
Aw... I've been splurging
too much lately.

100
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,041
Nah, you're good.
Being soft and squishy's nice.

101
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,708
Mei, I swear, if you keep
doing that, I'm declaring war!

102
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,166
Uhh...

103
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,333
Look how cute you are
in your swimsuit!

104
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,833
Whatcha doin'?
You heading somewhere?

105
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,625
Seira, where're you going?

106
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,625
[SEIRA] Look, just don't
stand next to me, okay?

107
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,458
It's embarrassing!

108
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,708
[CHIBI 1A]
Huh?

109
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,458
Ahh!

110
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,875
Let's get right down to it!

111
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,500
Keep in mind, we are
here for this quest!

112
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,458
So, let's get out there and
investigate some monsters!

113
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,083
[MEI, YUSHA, FAI]
Okay!

114
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,041
The monsters around
here seem quiet.

115
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:18,541
Mm? What a pretty shell!
It'll make a great souvenir!

116
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,791
Huh, that's weird.

117
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,416
Whatcha doin' over here?

118
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
It's strange, this shell
doesn't wanna budge.

119
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,458
That's nothing these
guns can't handle!

120
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,166
See what I mean?

121
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
It looks like I'm about to have
to get serious with this one!

122

[inhales] Heave-Ho!

is that thing?!

124
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,041
What is going on?!

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,750
[YUSHA] Wow, look at that!
Do you know what it is?

126
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,166
[MEI] It's a monster that
lives on sandy beaches.

127
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,333
The "tip of the iceberg" shell.

128
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,250
If you mistake it for
a shell and kick it,

129
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,708
it hurts pretty bad. Are you
taking it home as a souvenir?

130
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,708
I gave up on that.

I think we should
make it bigger.

Roger that!

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,875

start playing around.

[FAI]
Aww. This totally sucks!

140
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,458
My castle has officially been
taken over by a hermit crab!

141
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,625
[MEI] That's a monster commonly
known as The Lodging Hunter.

142
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,958
These small monsters
can be total buttheads.

143
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,666
When they find something
they want as a home,

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,291
they take it by force
and move in.

[GIRLS]
Huh?

146
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,250
I don't wanna say "bye"
to the Royal Yusha castle!

You actually named it?

Uh...

...of course it crumbles.

I'll never forget
about my palace!

I still can't tell where
the watermelon is!

It's to your right!
You're super close!

Oh, now you've gone too far!
A little more to the left!

they're playing around again.

That thing... is a
watermelon mimic.

It's a troublesome monster
that appears on beaches

and multiplies whenever
it's cut with a sword!

Fine, then. I'll just hit it!

Yeah, when you punch it,

Well, what if I attack
it with magic?

[SEIRA screams]

173

Little side note:
it reflects magic,

174
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
so it's best not to use that.

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,750
So glad you're telling
me that now!

176

I can't believe swords
and magic won't work.

Horned gorillas are actually a
whole lot cooler than you are.

Wow.

182
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,625
[YUSHA] First, there was the
"Tip of the Iceberg" shell.

183
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,916
Then it was
"The Lodging Hunter," right?

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,458
Lastly, "The Watermelon Mimic."

185
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,416
Who knew there were so
many types of monsters

186

just on the beach!

00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,791
For real. We should be super
thankful that we had Mei.

188
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,625
[FAI] You really do seem to know
a lot about monsters, huh?

All right! Homework, complete!
Now, I think it's time--

[YUSHA]
Yeah!

Well, should I prepare
something, then?

Huh? This one's no good.

[FAI]
Hmm... Oh! Maybe.

200
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,416
It's because I ate
every scrap of food?

201
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,750
Yes, Fai, that's
obviously the reason!

202
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,416
Mei, do you have any
Preserved Food Cartado?

203
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,708
That's a no!

204
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,666
[SEIRA] How is that
anything to smile about?!

I'm really sorry, Seira.
It's all this summer freedom.

I think it's getting to me.

207
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,166
[YUSHA] There's nothing we
can do if it's been eaten.

208
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,916
[MEI] We have to look forward
to the future, not the past.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,916
That's true, we need to
focus on finding food.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,208
Let's see what we've got.

211
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,333
Now, of the Cartado we can use,

212
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,291
the one that looks
the most helpful is...

Yeah, it's mine, too.

[gasping] Are fish always
this strong? Ahh!

to be a rest stop we visit

That's preposterous, you nobody.

316
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,375
All of creation has
belonged to me

did he just say?

[gasps] Maybe, let's see.

does what he wants.

to go out of his way
