1
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,083
Oh, wow.

2
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,041
I don't think I'll ever
get enough of reading

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,083
the old Hero legends!

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,791
Learning about
the great achievements

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,125
of past champions
is just the best,

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,958
but I also love the
stories about all their

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,458
different companions!
Their talents and skills

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,916
only make each of the
Heroes that much better!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,833
Now that I think of it,
I really don't know anything

10
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,750
about the companions
of our current Hero,

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,625
the 999th one of her kind.

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,416
This is terrible. If I
profess to love our Hero,

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,125
then I must make an effort
to know her companions!

14
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,500
[ALL]
A... choo!

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,458
That was crazy! You all
sneezed at the same time!

16
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,458
[SEIRA] I wonder if
someone's talking about us.

17
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,708
Yeah, that sounds
highly unlikely.

18
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,125
The only person who knows
all three of us is... Yusha!

19
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,333
Was it me? I do think of
you guys kind of a lot!

20
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,625
So your brain was
running its mouth.

21
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,625
Got it.

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,583
So, what were you
saying about us?

23
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,375
Gimme a sec.
I bet I can try to remember.

24
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,250
Wow, Yusha, it was
literally 30 seconds ago.

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,416
[YUSHA] But, I mean, so much
has happened since then!

[FAI, MEI laughing]

00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,166
Uhh...

28
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,083
So, anyway. If it's agreeable
to you, I would very much

29
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,750
like to further my acquaintance
with your companions.

30
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,625
Possibly starting with Eleanor?
If you would be so inclined.

31
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,541
Uh, sure.

32
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,416
What does "further my
acquaintance" mean?

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,916
I think she just wants
to become better friends.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
Oh, cool, we'll get
to hang out, then!

[RONA laughs]

38
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,750
Sorry to ask again,
but remind me

39
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,708
what our next class is gonna be?

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,500
We've got Basic Magic Studies.

41
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,875
Ah, that's right!

42
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
[MEI grumbles]

43
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,916
Mei, that's the wrong one!
You want the blue book, instead,

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,833
that's the textbook
on magic history.

45
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,250
Oh, crap, I forgot my
friggin' textbook!

46
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,875
Don't worry, I brought a spare,
you can borrow this one.

47
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,583
You're pretty amazing, Seira.

48
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,000
I mean, who carries spare
textbooks around?

49
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,958
Me, because there's
always at least one of you

50
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,875
who forgets yours.

51
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,500
[GIRLS laugh sheepishly]

52
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,333
And because of that, I own
two full sets of textbooks.

53
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,708
How impressive!

54
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,333
That's so like you,
Ellenoar of the Hero's party!

55
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,875
And you know what? The Priest
of the 18th Hero's party

56
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,166
was a fastidious maker
of plans, as well!

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,666
You two have a lot in common!
Isn't that wonderful?

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,666
Uh, that's interesting,
thank you.

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,250
Hey, Seira, Here, you can
totally have my peppers!

60
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,541
You can have my carrots,
too, if you want.

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,666
Are you gonna eat that
fried chicken, Seira?

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,958
Okay, okay. But you guys
should still eat one, each.

63
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,166
And Fai, please chew.

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
[GIRLS]
Okay!

65
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,541
[RONA]
Impressive, again, Ellenoar!

66
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,875
It's so like the Priest of
the 132nd Hero's party.

67
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,791
He showed great concern for his
companions' health, as well.

68
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,416
It's just wonderful!

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,958
Oh, kinda random
but thank you.

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,708
[SEIRA sighs]
Today was beyond exhausting.

71
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,416
[SEIRA]
Uh? Uh!

72
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,833
Be careful, Princess!

73
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,291
What the heck are you
doing out there, anyway?

74
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,958
You have things strewn
everywhere around your room.

75
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, yeah, that, well, I've just
been so busy, you know?

76
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,666
Between practicals, homework,
and the Hero's Festival, it's

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,791
like there haven't been enough
hours in the day to clean!

78
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,875
You continually impress me!

79
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,250
The Priest of the 571st Hero's
party was just the same way.

80
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,625
He had, shall we say, quite a
unique sense of aesthetics!

81
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,750
Just wonderful!

82
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,375
Uh?

Hi there, Mather! I'd like to

84
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,250
spend today furthering my
acquaintance with you!

85
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,708
Yeah, that's fine, but
understand that my errands

86
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,333
might not be very interesting
to the uninitiated.

--[RONA] Huh?
--There's the first one.

88
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,791
[RONA] Ohh... Oh my, so,
this is a Cartado shop?

89
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,791
Who knew there were
so many different kinds?

90
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,666
Yeah, it's true, this one has
a pretty large selection,

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,458
but there aren't any
treasures here.

92
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,708
It's geared towards
the casual customer.

93
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,541
Hello.

anything good in?

We have a few new
rares in stock,

97
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,625
but nothing I think you'd
find very exciting.

No problem.

Wow, you're leaving already?

I was only dropping by to
check on their latest shipment.

102
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,541
I don't really have the time
to waste browsing around.

103
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,375
Why is that? Do you have
other big plans after this?

104
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,416
[MEI] I'm going on my usual
rounds to all the Cartado shops.

105
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,291
So, don't feel like you
need to come, since--

106
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,458
I'd expect nothing less from
a member of the Hero's party!

This is like, the promised land.

It's a hardcore shop
that draws true aficionados

00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,750
How could I not have
thought of this before?

158
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,166
Huh?

159
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,833
[RONA] If you please,
I'd like to purchase

160
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,333
all of the rare Cartado
in this store.

161
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,958
Mather, these are yours now,
to do with as you will.

162
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,125
This isn't real.

163
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,208
[RONA] Well, you are the Mage of
the Hero's party, aren't you?

164
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,750
Seems to me, you should
have lots of good Cartado

165
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
at your disposal! Go ahead!

166
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,041
[MEI squeaking]

[PATRON 7A]
Hold it!

168
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,666
If you accept that pile of
cards, then you're finished

169
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,833
as a legit Cartado collector!

170
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,958
That stack is a thing of beauty
and something Cartado collectors

171
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,750
everywhere would
weep and drool over

172
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,625
and wish for all of their lives,

173
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,208
but if you accept this now,
you'll be spitting in the face

174
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,458
of the years of effort that
it takes every true collector

175
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,666
to gather them!

176
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,458
So, go ahead!
Can you live with yourself?

177
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,666
Knowing the truth?

178
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,125
[MEI screams]
Sir, you've opened my eyes!

00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,375
I was so very wrong!

00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,625
Well, so long
as you understand.

181
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,208
For the serious collector,
there are no shortcuts!

182
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,250
Understood!

183
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,000
[RONA]
I'm so impressed, Mather!

184
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,041
The Mage of the 888th Hero's
party turned down something,

185
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,083
too. It was the esteemed
position of Head Royal Mage.

186
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,333
He wanted to join
the Hero's party instead!

187
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,250
That firm resolve,
it's so wonderful!

188
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,500
Oh, um, thanks for that.

189
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,250
Your acquaintance with me?

Yes! It's your turn, Fai!

00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,666
I've already gotten
to know Ellenoar

I think, so, here I am!

[FAI]
Uh, it's just...

I'm heading out on a
little trip tomorrow.

Could it wait until I get back?

196
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,666
A trip? How wonderful!

197
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,208
And it bears resemblance to
the Warrior of the 337th.

198
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,333
He used to go on short trips
with his companions

199
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,666
to deepen their bonds.

200

Will you allow me
to accompany you?

201

Well I guess we could go
on the trip together!

See, I grew up in the woods.

205
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,541
So I go on trips like
this to reconnect

206
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,500
with my inner wild child!

207
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,916
Fascinating!

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,166
It actually brings to mind
the Warrior of the 674th.

209
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,416
He was also said to
treasure his homeland.

You're so delightful!

211

But wait, where is all your
luggage for the journey, Fai?

212

Oh, I never like to
mess with luggage!

Yep, yep, yep, yep, I see.

221

You're just like the Warrior
of the 70th Hero's party.

222
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,375
He loved high places,
so he could look down upon

on his enemies.

257
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,833
told my knights not to follow
me, so I'm truly alone.

something, do you love Yusha?

Huh?! How were you
able to figure that out?

Well, it helped
that you just said

she was your "dearest Hero."

me to admire her, right?

She's gallant and strong, and so
reliable, and occasionally wild.

And yet, she's still
kind enough to escort me.

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,375
I can't believe you worked
so hard just for me!

471
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:27,541
Thank you! It means a lot!

472
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,583
What's this?

473
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:34,500
[RONA] Why am I feeling
so unbelievably happy?

474
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,833
[YUSHA] Hey! We're so glad
you guys are back!

475
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,916
Welcome home!

476
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,666
Hey there! Glad to see
all of you, too!

477
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,500
Guess what!
Guess what happened!

478
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,083
The Princess was so
incredible on our journey!

479
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,333
She was all,
"ahhh-ahhh-ahhh",

480
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,666
and then "zoom!" and
"sploosh!" and "hoppity-hop",

481
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,875
and "sleep-sleep"
and "nom nom nom!"

482
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,166
Wow, great.

483
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,916
Princess, you really must be
incredible if you were able

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,125
to keep up with Fai on one
of her wild journeys!

485
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,500
Those trips are so crazy
that even we usually have

486
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,625
to turn her down!

487
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,750
Wow, Rona! Amazing!

488
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,916
No. It wasn't...

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,291
It was a fun trip,
dontcha think, Princess?

490
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,125
[gasps, laughs]

491
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,833
[RONA]
Yes!

492
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,041
[RONA]
"My Yusha-sama!"
