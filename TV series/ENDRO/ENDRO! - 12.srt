[SEIRA]
You know what guys?

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,458
I think this is
getting out of hand.

4
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,166
[MEI] Mmm! It's kind of
unsettling to remember things

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,416
that we haven't experienced yet,
like a weird sorta déjà vu.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,333
Yeah, but they're
only memories.

7
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,791
We're still the same strong
girls we always were.

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,125
Okay. What should we do, Yusha?

9
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,708
Huh? Well, I guess

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,833
we have no choice but to go
after her and rescue Rona.

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,833
Fight Miss Mao? I mean,
uh, fight the Demon Lord.

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,375
I'm not certain,

13
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,125
but I do know that we can't
just stay here and do nothing!

14
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,291
Still though, we don't even
have the faintest clue

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,333
as to where they might be.

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:56,083
Okay then, perhaps I could
be of some assistance!

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,291
[GIRLS]
Teacher!

18
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,583
[WARRIOR]
I couldn't help but overhear

19
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,833
what you were talking about.

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,625
Well, yeah, there
aren't any walls.

21
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,875
I'll give you this
Chaser Cartado.

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,125
If you use it, then it should
lead you to Miss Mao.

23
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,333
I've used it a couple of times.

24
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,541
Now that's a Cartado that
really gets my heart racing!

25
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,125
Please show us the correct path.

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,750
Chaser!

27
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,500
Look, it already
managed to locate her!

28
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,541
Yay! Let's go get our princess!

29
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,708
Huh?

30
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,875
Uh. Right.

31
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,291
[WARRIOR]
Yulia.

32
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,791
Yes ma'am?

33
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,333
Have you ever been inside of
a dungeon and lost your way?

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,541
It's not uncommon. So,
sometimes the best thing to do

35
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,375
in that situation is to go
back to the beginning.

36
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,833
Back to beginning, huh?

37
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,375
[MAO laughs]

38
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,291
Soon I'll destroy
those loser heroes

39
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,208
like a true Demon Lord!
Then I'll turn Naral Island

40
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,375
into my personal playground
of chaos, ha, ha, ha!

41
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,500
Don't do this! It's never too
late to change your mind

42
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,000
about destroying everything!

43
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,708
Yusha and the other girls
are still your students!

44
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,791
Enough of your chatter! Sheesh!

45
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,833
Surely even you must
have had an idea

46
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,666
about how this was
all gonna go down!

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,208
Huh?

48
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,041
C'mon. For real? You remember!

49
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,083
That means...

50
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,333
They could be closer
than you think.

51
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,916
Looking forward to class.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,041
This is but another fate
laid forth by the world.

53
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,041
Surely there was a
point behind saying

54
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,375
those super ominous
things to me.

55
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,708
Ah! Oh those things!

56
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,000
They were quotes from a
previous character called

57
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,958
"the Dark Night." I think it
was chapter six in volume 82

58
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,666
of the <i>Tales of Heroes</i> .

My grandfather said
obsessing over that stuff's

61
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,708
a phase all people go through!
And you're one to talk--

62
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,875
it's not as if you don't have
your own little secrets.

63
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,541
It's you that's hiding
your scary form

64
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,083
in that adorable little
body, remember.

65
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,000
Actually, this is my real form!

66
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,708
But the thing is, it doesn't
look Demon Lord-ish enough.

67
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,958
So, it's just a front
to look scary?

68
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,208
Who asked you?!

69
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,583
Here's a fun fact.

70
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,208
The Demon Lord also enjoys
composing poetry

71
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,750
--in her secret room.
--[MAO] Hey, hey, hey!

How would you know that?!

73
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,416
Because. It's my job to know

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,250
every single intimate detail
about the Demon Lord.

75
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,833
Really?

76
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,833
I had no idea that spying was
in a golem's job description.

77
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,333
Well, seeing as I have
the capability to operate

78
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,541
semi-permanently, I am aware
of many different truths.

79
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,791
I know things about Heroes
and Demon Lords you don't.

80
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,750
Everything.

81
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,000
What did you just say?

82
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,625
That's so interesting!

83
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,333
Won't you please share your
valuable knowledge with me?

84

[MAO]
Like it matters.

85
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,041
The current Hero
is way too careless.

86
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,000
Nothing you know
would be relevant.

87
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,291
[MEIGO]
Of course.

88
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,375
It's still hard to believe
that we're going back there.

an intense convo!

98
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,458
Negotiating fees
with a higher penguin

99
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,041
isn't for the weak, y'know?

100
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,541
Looks like we made it.

101
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,166
Except this time it's
the real deal castle.

102
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,916
Man, that was such
a long journey,

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,875
and those penguins don't
mess around with surcharges.

104
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,250
Now that we've made it,
there's only one thing to do!

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,750
Camping outside the
Demon Lord's castle?

106
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,000
This is gonna be super fun!

The moon is especially
beautiful tonight.

108
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,458
How are you so calm?

109
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,750
We are practically sitting right
on the Demon Lord's doorstep.

111
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,208
Hey, you guys. Do you think
we'll really have to fight her?

112
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,333
[ALL]
Uh.

113
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,083
I mean, that is why
Heroes exist.

114
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,416
[YUSHA]
Yeah. I know, but...

115
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,625
[YUSHA]
This might sound weird,

116
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,000
but sometimes I wonder
why I wanted to be the Hero.

117

Welcome, Hero's party.

120
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,916
We've been expecting you
for quite some time.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,791
Meigo, you're here!

122
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,583
So, you've decided to
still use that name?

123
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,041
Even though I'm a loyal
servant of the Demon Lord?

124
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,208
So that must mean...
you remember?

125
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,583
Well, to us you're
still the same Meigo!

126
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,000
I see.

127
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,541
Then Miss Mao is still Miss Mao
and not the Demon Lord?

128
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,916
[gasps]

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
Such predictable behavior.
Heroes are so naïve.

130
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,458
How typical. No matter...

131
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,625
I will proceed to share this
critical information with you.

132
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,291
[MEIGO] A long time ago,
on Naral Island,

133
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,208
a tremendous, destructive power
appeared without warning.

134
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,000
The people called it
"a Demon Lord."

135
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,625
[MEIGO] Eventually, a Hero came
along and destroyed that power,

136
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,166
and restored peace
to the island.

137
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,791
However, the Demon Lord
revived once again,

138
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,708
and at the same time,
another Hero.

139
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,708
This event has
occurred 998 times,

140
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,375
leading to the 999th Demon Lord.

141
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,125
Are you serious?

142
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,250
Is it just me, or does that
seem like a big problem?

143
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,375
That's the Demon Lord's destiny.

144
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,875
[GIRLS gasp]

145
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,416
[MEIGO] It's because their
strength knows no boundaries.

146
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,958
Even when they're defeated,

147
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,750
they eventually regain their
power and are reborn once more.

148
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,166
That's why

149
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,375
they're destined to revive and
be defeated, constantly.

150
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,875
To prevent regaining
their true power.

151
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,708
Now hold on. Are you
saying that these generations

152
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,625
of Demon Lords aren't
reviving on their own?

153
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,166
Yes, though I am unsure
of who determined

154
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,750
this destiny for them.

155
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,166
All I know, is that the Heroes
have spent a long time fighting

156
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,291
against the Demon Lords.
It's part of a valiant effort

157
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,041
to keep them from
reviving prematurely.

158
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,583
Both of their destinies
are intertwined.

159
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,041
That's the reason why
the two are always

160
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,791

the exact same time.

00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,416
[YUSHA]
Huh?

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,166
Meaning, you are
the last Hero, Yusha.

163
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,041
For real?!

164
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,291
What exactly are you saying?

165
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,125
That after 998 generations
of constant fighting,

166
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,541
the Demon Lord
has been worn down.

167
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,000
She's weaker.

168
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,541
To put it rather simply,
once you win this battle,

169
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,500
the Demon Lord will be
defeated permanently.

170
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,916
Never to be revived again.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,208
Huh? So Miss Mao will vanish?

172
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,291
[MAO]
There you have it!

173
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,750
I'm the last one of the set!
I'm only born to be defeated, so

174
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,750
it's probably better if the Hero
just gets it over with already.

175
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,000
[RONA] The Heroes that
I've always admired.

176
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,583
They're just slaves to a destiny
of defeating the Demon Lord.

177
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:54,750
Over and over in an
unbreakable chain.

178
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,083
But, if for some reason,

179
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,041
Yusha and the others
don't fulfill that destiny.

180
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,916
If they don't manage to
overthrow the Demon Lord,

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,125
Miss Mao... then she'll
regain her full power

182
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,375
and try to destroy
Naral Island once again.

[MAO grunts]

184

[RONA]
Yusha...

185
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,958
I'm having a hard time
making sense of all this.

186
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,875
So, basically, we either have to
defeat the Demon Lord and make

187
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,541
Miss Mao disappear, or it's
game over for Naral Island.

188
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,958
Sounds like checkmate to me.

189
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,750
Why would you go out of your
way to tell us these things?

190
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,916
And now that we know--

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,541
Right. You won't want
to fight anymore.

192
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,208
Not given who you are.

193
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,416
That's low! How dare you!

194
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,875
With the current level of
your abilities, you would fail

195
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,208
to stand up to the
Demon Lord in battle.

196
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,541
However, you are the Hero so the
improbable is always possible.

197
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,458
And now... How will you proceed?

198
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:54,250
You're a naive girl
with a big decision to make.

199

Well then. I must return,

201
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,125
but know the Demon Lord
is awaiting your visit.

202
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Uh! So? What are
we gonna do then?!

203
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,208
We either fight Miss Mao,
or the island's history.

204
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,208
Seems like no matter what,
it's a tough call.

205
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,208
Sounds like we lose either way.

reached its capacity.

what we should do next!

Life can be a real maze.

normal to feel lost or whatever?

Yeah. I am feeling lost.

I wonder what a Hero would do?

Have you ever been inside of
a dungeon and lost your way?

to find a letter

from the Hero addressed
to you in the mailbox.

we have a mailbox here?

Okay, let's see.
"Dear Miss Mao..."

are truly unpredictable!

You do remember
you're a hostage, right?

I'm sure that Yusha
believes in you!

Deep down, she knows you
possess a heart of gold

to bring the fight to her!

Yes, as you wish.

254
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:24,333
Guys! We finally made it.
This was the very beginning!

255
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,333
Both before and after we were
all flung into the past,

256
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,833
this place is where
we formed our party.

257
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,083
All because we met in class,
and then as if bound by fate,

258
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,833
we sat next to each other.

259
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,958
That was probably more of
a coincidence, you know?

260
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,500
Even so.

261
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,750
It's how we found ourselves
facing the Demon Lord together.

262
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
It's all because...

263
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,416
...we met right here.

264

[YUSHA]
Hey, Seira.

265
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,583
What made you want
to be a priest?

266
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
To be honest, I think it's
because both my mother

267
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,791
and grandmother come from
a long line of priests.

268
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:09,958
It's like a bond that ties our
family together, you know?

What about you, Fai?

00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,791
What made you decide
to become a warrior?

271
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,166
That's easy! I wanted
to protect the forest

from bad people!

What about you Mei, why did
you want to become a mage?

274

Actually, I'm almost positive

275
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,791
your answer involves
Cartado, right?

Hey, you never know, there
could be another reason!

Anyway, I think the more
important question

00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,500
is why Yusha decided
to become the Hero!

thought about it.

00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,833
That's right! You cared enough
to teach us valuable lessons.

318
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,416
Even though we're
the Hero's party!

319
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,708
You taught me about
all kinds of Cartado

320
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,416
and how to use them properly!

321
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,125
Sure, sometimes you got mad, but
you always rewarded us, Teach!

322
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,291
You made us happy!

323
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,291
[gasps, growls]

324
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,250
Having class with you
every day was so much fun!

325
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:19,166
You know it! Right, Miss Mao?

326
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,666
You fools. That was all just...

327
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,416
[DEMON LORD, MAO]
That was...

328
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,708
That was...

329
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,208
That was fun!

330
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,958
And I enjoyed every
single moment

331
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,208
of every single day, okay?

332
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,041
[MAO] But, if you don't
hurry and defeat me,

333
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,083
then I'll regain my power and
this island will be destroyed!

334
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:51,083
And all that will remain
is my isolation.

335
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:56,708
Lonely... and cold.
Without anyone else...

336
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,541
I can't stand it. Not anymore.

337
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,125
And that's why...

338
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,000
I wouldn't mind if the students
I spent my happiest days with

339
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,958
are also the ones
who take me down.

340
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,333
Oh, Miss Mao.

341
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,291
I understand.

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,666
--[SEIRA] Yusha!
--[MEI] Wait, Yusha!

343
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,166
[YUSHA] I always...
wanted to be a cool hero.

344
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,875
One who'd fight the Demon Lord,
and take them down for good.

345
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,750
So!

346
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,250
Thank you. It's for the best.

347
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,958
[YUSHA yells]

348
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,750
Right! Time for dinner, Chibi!

349
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,000
[ALL gasp]

350
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,125
Catch!

351
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
[CHIBI]
'Lil burp.

352
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,041
[CHIBI chirps]

353
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,000
[YUSHA sighs]
All done!

354
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
[ALL]
What the heck's wrong with you?!

355
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,500
You served the Hero's
Sword for dinner!

356
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,875
Now what are we gonna do?!

357
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,208
And what's more!

358
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,875
Without it, you can't be
recognized as a true Hero!

359
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,708
It's okay you guys!
I never got to tell you

360
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,166
the second reason I
wanted to be a Hero!

361
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,000
It's because I wanted everyone
to have fun and be happy!

362
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,291
I really mean it!

363
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,875
So of course that
includes Miss Mao, too!

364
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,625
[gasps]

365
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,916
If my job is to
make someone sad,

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,875
then I don't want to be
the Hero anymore.

367
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,083
Are you serious,
Yulia Chardiet?

368
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,625
You mean it?

369
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,875
[laughs]

370
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,000
Listen, I really hate
to bring down the mood

371
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,875
in the middle of this
tender moment.

372
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,083
But if we don't have the Hero's
sword, we're sort of in trouble.

373
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,541
Because now Teach can
recover her true power,

374
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,791
and go all Demon Lord-y on
the entire island or whatever.

375
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,166
Huh? Nah, no way!

376
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,833
Miss Mao won't let that happen.

377
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,291
Right? You tell 'em!

378
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,791
[MAO]
Mm...

379
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,750
Oh, no!

380
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,791
[MAO]
That's what we've been saying!

381
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,791
[MEIGO]
Looks like it's my turn, then.

382
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,625
[MAO gasps]

383
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,500
[screams]

384
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,041
[CHIBI]
'Lil burp.

385
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,791
[ALL screaming]

386
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,791
Bad Chibi! No eating people!

387
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,333
Yeah, you don't know
where she's been!

388
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,833
And she could upset your tummy!

389
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,333
You can't just eat things raw!

390
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,458
The real problem is
she ate our teacher!

391
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,375
[CHIBI grumbles]

392
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:24,958
[MAO groans]

393
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,166
Miss Mao!

394
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,458
You're alive?

395
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,291
[MAO panting]
Hey!

396
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,250
It's incredibly rude to
just eat people, y'know!

397
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,333
Don't ignore me!

398
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,250
Please calm down, madam,
and just listen.

399
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,416
Think about it.

400
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,583
Can you still feel
the Demon Lord's power?

401
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,833
Say what?

402
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,166
Yeah, of course,
it's right here inside of me.

403
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,500
It's gone!

404
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,833
[GIRLS]
Huh?!

405
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,875
During the previous battle
between the Demon Lord

406
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,583
and the Hero's Party,

407
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,083
I also managed to get

408
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,833
caught up in the effects of
the Hero's forbidden spell.

409
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,583
[chirps]

410
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,875
[MEIGO]
Afterward...

411
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,250
While I was drifting in
the dimensional gap,

412
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,750
this little dragon saved me.

413
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,375
Really, Meigo?
It sounds like it ate you.

414
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,500
Nice one, Chibi. Good goin'.

415
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,625
[chirps]

416
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,083
You see, ordinarily,

417
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,041
it would be impossible for
a golem to move on its own.

418
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,583
But then, this one, made it
possible for me to do so.

419
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
[MAO]
Whoa, back up!

420
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,708
Are you seriously trying to tell
me that thing was able to eat

421
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,916
the concept of "golem"
which bound you?

422
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,166
Yes, and because of that,

423
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,166
I thought she might be able to
help you by erasing the concept

424
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,625
of the Demon Lord, as well.

425
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,875
Thus, hopefully breaking
the circle of destiny

426
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,833
that has bound you and
the Hero together.

427
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,666
At last, it's over.

428
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,416
Wow that was a super
awesome call, Meigo!

429
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Although...

430
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,875
This only worked because Yusha
cast aside her role as the Hero.

431
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,416
You have my gratitude.

432
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,625
It's no prob! I just wanted
everyone to be happy.

433
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,833
In the end, that's all
that really matters.

434
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,583
So that's why you told us that
stuff back in the forest,

435
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,291
because you were really
looking for a way

436
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,708
to save Miss Mao, huh?

437
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,416
You must have been so very
worried about her, Meigo!

438
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,958
You really do care!

439
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,000
Even though I couldn't
move on my own,

440
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,458
I've always been
watching over her.

441
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,166
Uh, more importantly,
being able to erase

442
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,541
an entire concept from
someone is kind of

443
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,541
Creator-God level
stuff. So fess up.

444
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,833
Why are you all keeping such
a mysterious beast as a pet?

445
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,458
Yeah, why are you keeping
Chibi as a pet, Seira?

446
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,750
Me? Chibi belongs to Mei!

447
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,333
Huh?

448
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,166
No way, if anything I assumed it
was one of Fai's forest buddies.

449
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,083
Nah. There's nothing
like Chibi in the forest.

450
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,208
Besides, out of all of us, she's
always hangin' out with Yusha.

451
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,916
Huh. That's so weird.

452
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,458
How long has Chibi
been with us, anyway?

453
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,958
[SEIRA]
Now that you mention it,

454
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,458
she wasn't with us when we
faced Miss Mao the first time.

455
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,166
[MEI] She was just
kind of there one day.

456
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,541
[GIRLS]
Hm...

457
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,250
Well, she's ours now!

458
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,875
Uh... I swear.

459
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,458
What am I gonna do
with you four?

460
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,708
Huh?

461
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,708
It's morning! [yawns]

462
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,250
I'm feeling wiped out
all of a sudden.

463
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,000
We just pulled an all-nighter,
so it makes sense.

464
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,000
I vote we go take a nap.

465
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,208
If you do you'll be
late for first period,

466
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,750
so sorry but hard no.

467
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,291
[GIRLS]
Huh?!

468
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,833
[YUSHA]
That's so mean, Miss Mao!

469
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,041
[SEIRA] We were on an
important quest, you know!

470
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,208
[FAI]
Meanie-head!

471
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,000
[MEI] You really are
an evil Demon Lord!

472
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,458
Not anymore, now I'm
just an Evil Teacher!

473
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,750
But... There is one thing.

474
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,416
You know.

475
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,416
Go on. Just say it.

476
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,666
Uh. So I wanted... to say...

477
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,458
Thank you! For your help!

478
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,166
[GIRLS laughing]

479
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,250
No problem!
That's what friends do!

480
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,833
Okay. Hold down the fort!

481
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,250
[MEIGO]
As you wish.

482
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,500
Thanks!

483
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,916
Take care, and I have a
good day at work, Mao.

484
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,208
[MAO]
Thanks, see you tonight!

485
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,833
[WARRIOR grumbling]

486
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,375
Come on, we're gonna be late.

487
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,000
Huh?

488
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,791
[MAO] As teachers we should at
least try to be there on time.

489
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,958
[gasps] Right.

490
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,083
[MEIGO laughs]

491
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,166
Hey, look!

492
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,583
I heard that they cleared an
advanced quest the other day!

493
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,666
Well, that's the
Hero's Party for you.

494
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,875
I bet they could even
defeat a Demon Lord!

495
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,875
Everyone keeps saying things
like that. Little do they know

496
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,458
that both the Demon Lord
and Hero are history.

497
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,708
Doesn't that mean
Yusha's classless?

498
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,958
[whines] Why did you have
to go and remind me?

499
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,583
You know., you have to have
a job to accept new quests.

500
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,958
Duh, of course I
know that, Seira.

501
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,583
Everyone, hi!
And good morning!

502
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:08,000
I know it's early,
but look at my new book!

503
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,250
Looks awesome!
So, what's it about?

504
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,583
Oh, right. It's the
newest volume in

505
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,500
<i>Tale of a Hero</i> created by me!

506
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,625
[GIRLS gasp]

507
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,541
[YUSHA]
Can I see?

508
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,750
Huh?

509
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,750
The only thing I have
done is the cover.

510
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,958
[GIRLS groan]

511
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,875
I was so focused on
perfecting the binding

512
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,750
that I didn't even
finish the rest.

513
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,083
Makes sense.

514
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,041
Yes, I agree. Sometimes
you just get hyper focused

515
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,125
on something, like finding
the perfect Cartado,

516
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,000
but it's more than
just a collectible!

517
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,583
And the only way to truly
appreciate your new treasure

518
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,375
is to make use of its power!

519
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,333
Only then can one achieve
true Cartado nirvana!

520
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,750
For that reason, I feel
like I failed my...

521
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,458
It's totally blank.

522
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,041
[RONA]
I do apologize, Yusha.

523
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,416
Thanks, Rona. It's perfect!

524
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,791
Huh?

525
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,458
[MAO] Okay. It's time to
take your seats, class.

526
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,208
It's Miss Mao!

527
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,250
[MAO]
What now?

528
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,083
Our future is still
blank, right?

529
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,500
So I was thinking,

530
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,208
can we be whatever we want?

531
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,625
Uh. Yeah, I don't see why not.

532
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,125
[YUSHA]
Well, in that case,

533
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,833
I'm going to be the Hero!

534
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,416
Typical Yusha...

535
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,958
That's a great idea.

536
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,583
Duh, of course it is!
It's Yusha's!

537
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,458
Okay! I'll pal with you!
'Cause that's just what pals do!

538
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,833
Great job! You are amazing!

539
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,791

[YUSHA]
Aw, Chibi!

542
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,666
[SEIRA]
When did you get here?

543
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,625
[FAI]
Maybe she can teleport!

544
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:38,375
Oh my goodness. [sighs]

545
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,875
The problem with Heroes is they
never know when to give up.

546
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,875
Well, you'd better give
it your best, Yusha!

547
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,875
Right! I promise.

548
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,708
I won't fail!
