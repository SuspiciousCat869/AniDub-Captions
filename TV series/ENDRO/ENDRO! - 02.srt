[YUSHA]
You guys,

2
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,875
do I really have to
say it out loud?

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,708
It's kind of embarrassing to
tell you what I like about him.

4
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,708
Please don't make me.

5
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,416
Come on, Yusha. Give it up!

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,083
We promised to be totally real
with each other, didn't we?

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,708
That's right. It's a sacred
pajama-party promise.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,250
I have a feeling this
is gonna get good!

9
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,083
Fine, but you have to
say why you like yours.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,708
Ahem. Wow, where do I start.

11
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,666
I mean, he's lived
really close by me

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,583
ever since I was a little girl.

13
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,625
And he's always liked to mess
with me and stuff, you know.

14
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,625
He kinda reminds me of a cat.

15
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,375
It's pretty adorable
how he always acts

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,000
like he wants attention,
until I try to give him any.

17
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:56,958
[giggles]

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,125
[FAI]
'Kay, my turn!

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm obsessed with
how huge mine is!

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,666
I'll never forget how
super-ripped his body was

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,541
back when I first saw him!
He was unbelievable.

22
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,000
I just love him!

23
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,375
Mine is so bold.
But I can't help it.

24
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,375
I couldn't take my eyes
off him if I tried to.

25
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,000
He's got this kind
and gentle gaze.

26
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,458
And a truly enlightened soul.
Not to mention his strength.

27
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,875
Unbelievable...

28
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,375
[MEI] Well, everyone has
their thing, I guess.

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,833
I think what I love the most

30
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,166
is how mysterious
he still is to me.

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,333
They really are the best
ever, aren't they?

32
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,791
[ALL]
Mm.

33
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,166
[inhales] Pomurun!

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,375
[FAI]
Dragons!

35
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,708
[SEIRA]
Horned gorillas!

36
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,208
[MEI]
Wacky seaweed!

37
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,083
[GIRLS]
Uh...

38
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,958
Hey, Yusha. I can see how
you might've missed this

39
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,041
since pomurun are
really weak monsters.

40
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,541
But, uh, it was actually
just attacking you.

41
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,875
[YUSHA]
Huh? Are you sure

42
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,875
it wasn't just trying to
get my attention to play?

43
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,833
Never would've pegged you as
a horned-gorilla lover, Sei.

44
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,708
I mean, even I wouldn't
try to make a meal

45
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,708
of a sage of the
forest, bad girl.

46
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,125
[SEI] Why would you think I
meant I wanted to eat him?

47
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,416
Wait, are you saying
you want to eat a dragon?

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,833
Also, Mei. What the heck
is a wacky seaweed?

49
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,208
It's a little monster from my
hometown with a fiery passion

50
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,458
for dance!

51
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,583
Actually, I think it's
part of a prayer ritual

52
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,916
to ensure a good harvest.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,666
Which I guess is kinda weird.

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay. Its name makes
more sense now.

55
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,833
'Kay, you guys, we've
done "favorite monsters".

56
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,583
So, now what are we
gonna talk about?

57
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:27,666
[YUSHA] Mm... Maybe things we
hate about Demon Lord generals?

58
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,375
[SEIRA, MEI, FAI]
Oh!

59
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,708
[MEI]
I'm diggin' this choice, Yusha.

60
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,750
[SEIRA]
Yeah, that's a good one!

61
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,958
[FAI]
Okay, cool, I'll go first!

62
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,500
My name is Yulia Chardiet!

63
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,625
But everyone just
calls me Yusha.

64
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm studying to become a Hero
at an adventurer school!

65
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,708
Recently, my friends Seira,
Fai, and Mei were with me

66
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,250
on a practical challenge.

67
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,000
When, somehow, we discovered
the Hero's Sword!

68
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,333
Then, shortly after I
drew it from its place...

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,500
...I became a
really-for-real hero.

70
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,291
I did. Yusha the Hero.
Just kidding.

71
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,375
[MAO growls]

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,416
And behold, the Hero now sleeps.

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,916
Dude, I totally got that.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,791
A play on Yusha sleeping and
the classic Hero's journey,

75
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,375
am I right?

76
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,708
You know, you actually have some
good moments now and then, Fai.

77
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,083
[YUSHA]
She's here.

78
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,541
This sweet lil' nugget
named Miss Mao.

79
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,416
She's tiny, but fierce,
and she teaches my class

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,958
at adventurer school,
which is just the best.

81
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,791
Good grief, would you
wake up, already?

82
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,833
Wha--? Hey. I'm up!

83
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,166
What a weirdo.

84
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,083
You're a skilled
sleep-talker, though.

85
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,583
[SEIRA]
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,208
See the thing is, we were
all up kinda late last night.

87
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,458
Yeah, 'cause we had
a pajama party.

88
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,958
Yes, a pajama party
for an adventure party!

89
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,375
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Glad to hear you're having fun.

90
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,791
Thanks! It really
was such a blast.

91
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,916
I think my favorite topic was
"how do you think you would

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,833
handle a Demon Lord
if they surrendered?"

93
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,208
That was great!

94
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,708
I still think Yusha's answer
was by far the best one.

95
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,041
Hold on.

96
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,750
That's something I've always
been curious about.

97
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,500
Uh! Ahem! So you!
Class president.

98
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,125
Sorry, what exactly do you
mean, "class president?"

99
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,250
Nothing. You just kinda
have that look about you.

100
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,791
There's a look?

101
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,000
[MAO] Besides, you elves are
all like, "You vulgar, inferior

102
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,208
races will just have to obey
our beautiful and noble kind!"

103
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you think,
did I get that right?

104
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
Please refrain
from saying things

105
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,500
that misrepresent entire races!

106
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,791
Whoa! Teach, you're
somethin' special.

107
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,916
Yeah, you seem so perfectly cast
when you condescend like that.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,291
Let's pick up from where
we were interrupted.

109
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
Class president, explain
the struggle between

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,416
the Demon Lord and the Hero.

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,625
[SEIRA]
Oh, all right.

112
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,916
It started several
millennia ago.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,500
A living calamity appeared
to us on Naral Island.

114
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
That calamity happened
to be the first Demon Lord

115
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,333
ever mentioned in
recorded history.

116
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,416
And likewise, the very
first Hero was then born.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,250
The one who could oppose him.

118
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,166
After fighting a fierce battle,

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,750
the Hero defeated
the Demon Lord.

120
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,750
However, after some time passed,

121
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,958
the Demon Lord
appeared once again.

122
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,875
So, of course, a new
Hero appeared, as well.

123
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,208
Ready to fight.

124
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,708
He challenged the
Demon Lord to a battle.

125
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,958
Once again, the Demon Lord
was vanquished.

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,583
That cycle has continued to
repeat throughout history,

127
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,208
and then, before we knew it,

128
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,625
suddenly, we came
to our 999th Hero.

129
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,625
How was that? Okay?

130
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,250
Yes, maybe even good.

131
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,500
[gasps] I'm gonna kill you,
you little...

132
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,416
Schoolwork is important,
but adventurers have to think

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,958
about building
their strength too.

134
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,750
Come on, get it together, guys!

135
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,875
Damn! She's so freakin' quick!

136
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,750
I can't land a single attack!

137
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,958
Well, Draptors are monsters
known for their agility.

138
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,750
You'll never hit one
by swinging wildly.

139
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:30,000
[FAI yelling]
I'll end you!

140
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,166
Multi-punches, go!

141
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,458
She's good! Crap,
I didn't see that coming.

142
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,166
A Cartado user's
strength is dependent

143
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
on their magical
power and skill.

144
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,583
Even low-ranked cards
can stand up against

145
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,083
higher ranked cards when they're
used in a successful way.

146
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,916
[screams]

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
It's true. By combining
some low-level Cartado

148
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,750
like these, you can multiply
their powers exponentially

149
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,500
and use them to accomplish
greater things

150
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,916
than one would ever expect.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,458
I'm sorry, everyone.

152
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,166
When it comes to Cartado
I tend to get overexcited,

153
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,666
but I'm guessing that's
kinda obvious at this point.

154
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
Oh, hey, ya think?

155
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,541
You'll find that
a treasure chest

156
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,333
is an adventurer's

A quest?

That's right. A true adventurer
accepts various quests and

213
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,833
earns both honor and personal
rewards from their work.

accept a quest, as well.

223
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,166

is you'll need to work together

and combine your strengths
to be successful.

225

skills effectively.

Hm... Uh! Hey, you guys!

What if we all take turns
being the leader?

315
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,791
I could get into that. So,
we'd have sort of a trial

at leading the group?

Sounds like a blast! I'm in!

That might be the fastest

you'll only splinter it and
then your party will to have

to disband! And
when that occurs,

assess their skill level.

468
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,791
I've always loved how
hardcore you can be, Fai.

469
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,166
[YUSHA]
Everyone, let's go!

470
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,666
What is this power?

471
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,000
[YUSHA]
O Holy Spirits,

472
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,041
filling the border between
heaven and earth.

473
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,208
Though we are young-- [gasps]

474
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,833
The incantation. I messed it up.

475
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,958
[DEMON LORD screaming]

476
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,625
Huh?!

477
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,375
[GIRLS screaming]

478
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,916
[DEMON LORD screams]
What the hell is happening?

479
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,625
Uh?

480
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,541
Huh?

481
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,916
[MAO] That was where this
whole thing started.

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,916
The Hero's stupid mistake
sent us back in time,

483
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,333
and now I'm stuck
teaching my enemies!

484
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,750
Hey, is anything
the matter, Mao?

485
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,458
[MAO] If they end up
appearing before me

486
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,375
in that same state again,
even if I am the Demon Lord,

487
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,291
does that mean history will
repeat itself once more?

488
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,750
Will I eventually be swept away
and defeated all over again?

489
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,333
'Cause if that's how it is...

490
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,583
Fine! Just means no
more Demon Lord for me!

491
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,916
Hey, how 'bout a drink?

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,208
[FEMALE WARRIOR]
That sounds great.

493
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,833
Thanks for asking me!

494
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,416
Sure thing! Today, we celebrate!

495
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,458
Time to make a toast
to an ordinary life!

496
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,250
[YUSHA, MEI, SEIRA, FAI laugh]

497
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,541
[YUSHA] Now we just wait for
a Demon Lord to show up!

498
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,333
I sure hope we get one soon!

499
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,833
[YUSHA]
"Quest Practical!"
