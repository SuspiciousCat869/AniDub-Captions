1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,083
[YUSHA] We finally get to do
our quest practical tomorrow!

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:20,916
[FAI]
I know!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,333
I totally can't wait!

4
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,208
I mean, quests are what
adventuring is all about, right?

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,875
And the Heroes are
the people who accept

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,916
the challenges before them
to help out their fellow man!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,958
This is just part of
our lessons, though.

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,916
So, I'm pretty sure they'll only
be giving us basic quests.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,625
What kind of quest do you
dream about taking on, Yusha?

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,541
[YUSHA] Hmm... Well,
whenever I think of Heroes...

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,958
...I think of dragon-slaying!

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,458
Sure, and at our current level,

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,458
we'd get wiped out
in five seconds.

14
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,250
I mean, what part
of the word "basic"

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,791
don't you understand, huh?

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,625
Fine, then, what kind of quest
would you all like to go on?

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,166
Wow, lemme think.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,916
Oh! On my dream adventure,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we'd get to eat
lots of yummy food!

20
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,958
Being charged by someone
with a mission to find

21
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,333
a rare Cartado would be amazing!

22
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,666
Yeah, I don't really think
that's a thing that happens.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,541
[FAI] Kay, smarty-pants, what
kind of quest do you wanna do?

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:13,666
Uh! I guess I don't know. Hmm...

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,916
Ah! It would be
something like a quest

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to stop a horned gorilla
on a rampage!

27
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,166
So, like, you're talking about
a horned gorilla slaying?

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,458
No, no.

29
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,125
Not a quest to slay one.

30
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,083
It would just be to
find it, soothe it,

31
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,666
and to persuade it to chill.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,666
[FAI] Like you do with
a thief in a holdup?

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,708
"Just think about how
your mother would feel!"

34
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,416
That's what they would
say to those guys.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,750
Yep.

36
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,333
In the end, the horned
gorilla would return home

37
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,125
thanks to our gentle
encouragement.

38
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,416
And the gorilla
that we persuaded--

39
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,625
he's a candidate for
Horned Gorilla King!

40
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,166
And he's caught up
in an epic battle

41
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,333
for power between factions!

42
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,541
So, of course, I join
up with my new friend

43
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,708
to fight for the throne,
and aid him as he battles

44
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,791
corruption in the
horned gorilla world!

45
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,500
But, then! His long-lost nephew,

46
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,625
the former king's
illegitimate son, appears!

47
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,750
He claims that he's the
rightful heir to the throne,

48
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,125
and he takes over the kingdom!

49
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,125
After being driven out,
we go searching all through

50
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,458
the hidden land
of Horned Gonglia

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,625
for the legendary,
sacred sword Exgorilla.

52
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,666
But along the way, we get
caught up in a twister!

53
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,041
It's so scary! Our cart
gets launched into the land

54
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,500
of Goth in another
world, where we meet

55
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,541
the Horned Gorilla
Witch of the West!

56
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,208
[PEOPLE chattering]

57
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,166
I can't believe we're assigned
a quest from an actual guild.

58
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,333
So cool!

59
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,083
Wonder what kind of
mission we'll have.

60
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,125
Like I said, it's only
a practical quest,

61
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,416
so I'm sure it's like...
"Go to the store across town

62
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,208
and purchase the
things on this list."

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,625
Or, "deliver this message
the next town over,"

64
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,875
or something similar.

65
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,083
So, it looks like this is the
quest we have for you guys.

66
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,583
"Obtain the whisker of
a flying ocean sunfish

67
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,000
from the shores of Star Coral."

68
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,625
Got it!

69
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,500
Here's the quest
we have for you:

70
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,000
"Obtain the fruit
of a wind piper

71
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,250
found inside
Black Elm Forest."

72
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,375
Right!

73
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,375
Those quests sound
pretty legit to me!

74
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,208
Maybe we can get our hopes up.

75
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
Wouldn't hold my breath on a
horned gorilla quest, though.

76
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,625
You're hilarious!

00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,875
[YUSHA, FAI laugh]

Yay, our turn!

Uh? A party of only women?

That's unusual.

So, you're a priest.

You're a warrior.

83

And you're a mage, right?

84
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,708
And what're you?

Ah, sure, of course.

Will it help you
if I play along?

Hey, don't worry!

Who cares if you're an official
Hero, as long as you're Yusha?

Either way, "Yu" shine!

No, you don't get to be
smug about that pun.

choose to call me out?

96

[RECEPTIONIST 3A]
Your quest will be...

97
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,375
...to find a cat.

98
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:22,291
[meowing]

99

Oh, look. You've
found him, then.

100
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,458
Excellent job.

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,166
Your reward.

102
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,041
There's still more to
the practical, though.

103
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,250
So be ready to work tomorrow.

104
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,666
[ALL sigh]

105
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,291
Here's a good question:

106
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,208
Do adventurers really
look for cats?

107
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,083
Well, by definition, a "quest"
is a search for something,

108
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,958
so they're not wrong
in that respect.

109
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,208
Yeah, now that you mention it,

110
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,583
it's actually exactly
what adventurers do.

111
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,791
Searching for lost treasure,
finding captured princesses,

112
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,208
and going to find
legendary monsters.

113
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,458
Then I guess in the end
adventurers aren't so much

114
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,958
professional combatants
as professional seekers.

115
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,500
Right!

116
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,875
Oh, hey, maybe next time we lose
our room key we can just ask

117
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,250
some adventurers
to find them for us!

118
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,458
[SEIRA]
I think you're forgetting that

119
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,833
we're those adventurers.

120
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,750
Man, so we'll have to find
them ourselves, anyway?

121
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,666
Wait, once we become
adventurers,

122
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,333
it won't be about getting to
eat lots of yummy foods?

123
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,083
It'll just be about going
on quests to find it?

124
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,958
[SEIRA] Yeah, that's much
more likely I'm afraid.

125
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,416
How'm I s'posed to do that?!

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,750
If I find something yummy,
I just gotta eat it!

127
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,666
I agree! When I come across
bread in Seira's bag,

128
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,333
I can't help but
eat it on the spot!

Yeah! Dude, me too!

Fine, Seira. I hear you.

Even if we accept a quest to
hunt down something delicious,

I will not eat it.

that it isn't a quest

00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,291
Yes, sir!

160
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,541
Well, let's take a look at what
fate has in store for you today.

161
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,708
Interesting.

162
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,208
[ALL gasping]

163
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,083
[RECEPTIONIST 3A] Looks like
your quest is: "Find a cat."

164
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,916
[ALL]
Not again!

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,125
Excuse me, but do you think
you could maybe give us

166
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,333
a different one?

167
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,666
Sorry, nope.

168
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,875
Nobody here gets to
choose their missions.

169
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,708
We're required to assign
them completely at random.

170
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,333
But that's twice in a row
that we've had to find a cat.

171
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,500
If you don't like it,
feel free to drop out.

172
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,625
We don't wanna do that, though.

173
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,958
[sighs] I know!

174
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,125
We can pick up another
quest on the side!

175
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,291
We learned the best ways
to catch a cat yesterday,

176
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,916
so it'll be easier this time!

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,416
Makes sense to me!

178
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,083
Really? Is that wise?

179
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,666
[YUSHA laughs sheepishly]

180
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,750
What are the chances that
we'd pull "find a cat"

181
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,333
five times in a row, huh?

182
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,166
Yeah, it's kind of incredible.

183
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,375
I still don't understand
why we didn't just stop

184
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,541
after the third one.

185
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,416
Uh-huh. We went a
little overboard.

186
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
At this point, all we can
do is find those cats!

187
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,541
[meowing]

188
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,791
[YUSHA grunts]

189
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,625
Oh, great! You actually
found the five, then!

190
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,666
You should be proud.
Here you go.

191
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,708
We'll see you again tomorrow!

192
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,458
[ALL sigh]

193
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,208
I don't like to complain,
but today was really rough.

194
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,416
[grunts]

195
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,916
Yeah, I know. But just think,

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,208
we've for sure gotten the
hang of finding cats now.

197
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,750
Truth! If we keep this up,

198
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,375
I bet we probl'ly could even
find cats professionally!

199
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,291
Oh! That sounds like a fun job!
And we'd know right away

200
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,333
whenever any cute kitties
were in the area!

201
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,833
Hey, now, let's back up.

202
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,416
We're committed to being
the Hero's Party regardless,

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,458
aren't we? Once the
Demon Lord revives,

204
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,458
how can we fight him if we're
too busy being cat finders?

205
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,208
Huh, that's a good point.

206
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,583
[DEMON LORD]
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

207
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,958
You will bow down before
my enormous power!

208
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,416
[YUSHA] Attention, all the
cute kitties I'm friends with

209
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,583
throughout the kingdom!
The time is now!

210
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,250
[CATS meow]

211
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,750
[DEMON LORD] Ooo! How have
I been living without

212
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,083
sweet wittle furballs?

00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,625
[YUSHA]
Listen up, you!

214
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,125
If you keep doing evil, I'm
taking all these kitties home!

215

Please, no, don't do that!

I can't possibly go on
without pussycats now!

218
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,291
[YUSHA] Then you won't be
doing evil anymore, right?

219
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,500
[DEMON LORD] No! No more
bad things, I promise!

220
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,875
[YUSHA]
And we live happily ever after!

221
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,083
See? Like that!

222
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,208
Eh... What a nice
little fairy tale.

223
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,333
That would be so great!

224
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,583
Am I right?

225
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,333
If that's the case, then
I'll need to gather up

226
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,583
every Cartado that
deals with cats.

227
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,375
[SEIRA]
Are those a thing?

228
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,875
[YUSHA]
Good morning!

229
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,458
[RECEPTIONIST 3A]
Oh. You four.

230
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,750
So, give us the scoop.

231
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,833
What kind of cat will we
be looking for today?

232
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,250
Calico? Spotted?
Bring it on, dude.

233
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,000
After six times, we
might be overprepared.

234
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,833
I did some research
last night and found

235
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,750
a Cartado with a catnip spell.

236
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,458
[SEIRA]
Unbelievable.

Well, here's your
quest for the day.

"Go obtain some moonlight moss

239
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,750
from Silver Bone Cave
and bring it back."

'Kay, so, that's a long
name for a cat.

'Cause it's not a cat!

This is your quest, okay?

00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,083
Go obtain some moonlight moss
from Silver Bone Cave right now!

...we're actually...

246

Could it really be...

247
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,208
We're not looking for
a cat this time?

248
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,500
You aren't. That is correct.

Wow...

00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,958
Hooray!

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,416
[YUSHA]
Silver Bone Cave, huh?

252
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,291
Where was that again?

253
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,416
[SEIRA] If I'm remembering
correctly, I think it's about

254
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,583
two hours south of
here, give or take.

255
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,625
Oh, that sounds pretty far.

256
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,875
It does. We'll need
some gear. And food.

257
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,375
Oh, should I maybe bring
our barbeque set?

there for a vacay.

I can't find him.

Oh, who's Michael?

black on the tip of his tail.

he was missing, and I don't
know where he could be!

Wait, what are you saying?

Remember, a Hero is someone
who helps people in need,

291

and that's exactly
what we're doing!

Oh! You praised Yusha for once!

00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
Of course I did.

It's not like I hate her
or anything, you know.

When she kills it, I say so.

embarrass me, aren't you?

No way, I mean it so hard!

301
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,416
I mean it harder.

302
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,833
Uh! Well, thanks, but we should
get back to finding the cat.

303
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,541
Come on, let's get going.

304
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,250
[GIRLS]
Right!

305
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,875
[roars]

306
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,333
Do you really think a little cat

307
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,333
would hang out around
a creature so gross?

308
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,666
Some people in town said they
had seen one that matched

309
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,000
his description in this area,
so we had to check.

310
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,041
Apparently, when one cat
enters another's turf,

311
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,833
they get chased around
and driven farther

312
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,041
and farther away.

313
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,916
At this point,
I'd say he's not lost,

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,041
he's on a long journey.

315

Yes! We won!

[FAI] Ugh, what a super
crazy strong monster.

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,416
[SEIRA]
I'm officially exhausted.

482
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,041
This was somethin'. I even
sank a rare Cartado on him.

It's Michael!

How'd he get up there?

[YUSHA] Aw... And how're we
s'posed to rescue him?

[YUSHA grunting]

Nope.

I don't have any more Cartado
that I can use right now.

What do we do, then?

It's up to me.

Oh, right! You could use that

00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,041
to cut through those
threads, couldn't you?

499
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,625
Hold on!

500
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,666
I thought you said you weren't
very good with a bow earlier!

501
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,083
That was a lie.

502

I'm a good shot, it's just
that my eyes aren't great.

I've spent so much time reading,
now I'm nearsighted.

Seira, that was totally amazing!

Hey, if you're that good, why
not wear glasses all the time

508
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
and just be an archer, huh?

509
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,666
No, absolutely not!

510
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,166
But why would you not?

511
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,958
Well, 'cause, then people will
just think I'm a bookworm.

Thank you, friends!
You really saved the day!

Totally our pleasure.

Well, we went through a lot,

but it turns out quests
are really fun.

They sure are!

I'd say they're not half bad.
