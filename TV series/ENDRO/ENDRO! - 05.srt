Yes, what is it, Father?

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,000
[KING 5A] As princess of
Lapanesta Kingdom,

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,125
it's important to
remember your duty.

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,041
Moreover, do not
forget your dream.

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,083
I will never forget. I promise.

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,833
You can entrust it
all to me, Father.

[SOLDIER 5A]
Princess Rona Pricipa

10
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,541
O'Lapanesta is departing!

11
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,708
This journey will
lead me straight to you.

12
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:59,500
I've waited so long
for this day.

13
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,791
I'm coming for you, Hero!

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,083
[YUSHA] And out of nowhere,
the evil god once sealed away

15
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,541
in an underwater temple
was resurrected!

16
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,000
[SEIRA]
When we heard about this,

17
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,791
the Hero's Party set about
to protect the world!

18
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,750
[FAI] We found that wicked
underwater god,

19
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,500
and we started an awesome
battle to teach him a lesson!

20
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,291
[MEI] When it seemed like
we might be losing,

21
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,208
the Hero's Sword began to glow,

22
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,208
and it put a stop to
him once and for all!

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,083
[YUSHA] Maintaining world peace
was a complete success!

24
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,125
It was a happy ending!

25
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,750
Let me get this straight.

26
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,625
At the behest of a
mackerel you saved,

27
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,875
you found an evil god
that was sealed away,

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,125
then defeated him, thus
saving the world, right?

29
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,500
--[YUSHA] That's right!
--[MEI] You got it!

30
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,666
That so?

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,541
Well, that's quite a story.

32
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,000
Stop wasting my time!

[GIRLS]
What?!

34
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,375
Man. Why does Miss Mao
have to be so mean?

35
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,583
I can't believe that
she thinks we're lying.

36
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,791
I'm actually taking
your side on this one.

37
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,541
There's no denying that
we defeated an evil god.

38
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,500
I suppose we need a
witness, or a wet-ness.

39
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,291
I feel a little gill-ty that he
lives far, but we should ask

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,833
that Mackerelman to
give his testi-moray.

41
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:42,500
Yusha, that tale you
told us was interesting!

42
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,458
It reminded me of stories I read
about Heroes when I was a kid.

43
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,041
I look forward to more!

Great, so now it's been
downgraded to nothing better

46
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,416
than a fictional picture
book for children.

47

You know what?

00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,791
Uh! Yeah?

00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,500
I'm starting to think nobody
actually recognizes you

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,916
as the real Hero.

[YUSHA gasping]

Yusha, keep on living in denial,

53
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,125
but reality will hunt
you down like an animal.

54
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,458
It's just like struggling
to survive in the wild.

55
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,708
But it's not fair because I
actually am the real Hero!

56
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,833
Oh! I can prove it
with the Hero's Sword!

at the beach in the salty air.

You've picked up some
barnacle hitch-hikers.

Oh, yeah.

out of his knees?

that there's a hero,

But if there isn't one,
then shouldn't we

the Hero's bravery helped
him to found a nation.

I should tell you. I've
always admired the Hero,

I have ever since I
was a little girl.

race thinking about

the Hero's adventures.

382

and I would think to myself:

"What if the real Hero
were to suddenly appear?"

dream about becoming

that I actually got to
meet the Hero like this!

we're both women, right?
