--[MEI] There you are!
--[FAI] That was awesome!

00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,125
[DEMON LORD]
Fascinating.

00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,291
Is that the power of a Hero?

00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,541
Demon Lord!

5
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,833
[DEMON LORD]
Splendid. If you would agree

6
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,541
to wield that
strength in my name

7
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,250
rather than for
your own purposes,

8
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,375
I could easily grant you
half the world, Hero.

9
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,625
I don't need it!

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,541
All I want is to live
in a land where everyone

11
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,041
has a reason to smile
and be at peace!

You know, I knew that's
what you'd say, Yusha.

00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,625
Good! Then I vote we go
ahead and end this.

15
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,083
Then we can go home and eat!
And just be together!

You guys...

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,416
Yeah!

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,708
Me first! [grunts]

19
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,833
Holy Break!

Or not!

26
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,083
I'll show you the abyss...
of Cartado!

27
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,750
Single, Double, Triple,
Quadruple, and Quintuple.

28
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,750
And now for... Judgment Strike!

Did you believe you'd win?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,625
Don't think you can
bury me that easily,

36
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,125
even with a Hero's sword!

37
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,750
No way. I thought we won.

[gasps] But you can't!
That's forbidden magic!

00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,541
Although, if you were to fail...

45
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,166
Don't worry!
Put your faith in me!

And put some faith
in your amazing selves!

O Holy Spirits, filling the
border between heaven and earth.

48
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
Though we are young,
we honor you.

49
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,500
And we beseech the
guardians of order.

50

Open. Open...

Open the prison of time,

We proclaim, in the name of
the Hero, Yulia Chardiet,

What a huge victory!

Way to go, Hero!

00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,208
Oh, no it wasn't just me.

69
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,375
I couldn't have done it
without you all at my side.

70

[YUSHA] Let's go home.
Everyone is waiting for us.

[SEIRA] Yusha, it's morning.
Time to wake up.

74
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:23,125
Num, num. I don't think
I can sleep anymore.

75
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,416
Well, if that's the case,
then get your butt out of bed.

[exhales]

00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,916
Come on. Do you wanna be late
for school right off the bat?

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,416
[YUSHA] Mm... Let me just
sleep five more years.

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,666
What the heck?!

80
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,291
I thought you said you
couldn't sleep anymore!

81
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:43,875
[YUSHA grumbles]
You win. Good morning, Seira.

82
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,166
I'm gonna go wake up
Fai and Mei, now.

83
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,958
You get changed and
wash your face, got it?

84
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,416
Yeah.

00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,416
[yawns]

86
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,125
Well, good morning! I sure
hope you slept well, Chibi!

87
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,583
What a mornin'! Heh.
So sorry about that, Seira!

88
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,833
I'm always totally starving
when I first wake up!

89
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,583
Oh, yeah?

90
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,916
Hey, the tips of your
ears look kind of red.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,958
What's going on?

92
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,250
[gasps] Stop.
It's nothing, okay?

93
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,333
But your face is red, too.

94
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,791
Was it as tasty as you
hoped? Tell us, Fai.

95
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,458
Well, lemme think about that.

96
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,125
[SEIRA wails]

97
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:55,958
What's wrong with you?!
Wake up, Fai! Stop it, please!

98
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,500
Yeah, it was good--
soft and spongey!

99
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,458
[cries]

00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,791
[MEI yawns]

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
Mei, didn't Seira have to
come wake you up, too?

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,541
[MEI]
Mm-mm.

103
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,916
Negative. I didn't sleep
in the first place.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,708
[YUSHA]
Huh? Why not?

105
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,500
Mei hasn't slept
because she's been

106
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,083
obsessively studying
Cartado, all night.

107
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,625
What's Cartado?

108
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,375
Cartado is truly the epitome
of all the world's mysteries,

109
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,416
it's the culmination
of mankind's wisdom

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,625
through the ages.

111
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,250
Though the power within
each individual card

112
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,458
is obviously limited,
by combining cards,

113
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,500
you can call forth effects
from the entire universe

114
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,958
which surpass the imagination

115
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,708
and lead to infinite
possibilities!

116
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,750
For example, the combination
I came up with...

117
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,750
[SEIRA]
Okay, okay, let's walk and talk.

118
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,500
Hey, Fai. Aren't we lucky
to have someone like Seira

119
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,708
to look after us?

120
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,750
So true! She's kinda
like a mother figure!

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,250
Cut that out you two,
I'm not that old yet, okay?

00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,916
[TEACHER 1A]
Uh... I have a rather

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,125
important announcement
to make this morning.

125
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
I've decided to go and
live in the countryside

126
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,208
with my grandchild's family; so
today is my last day teaching.

127
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,250
[STUDENTS]
Just like that?!

128
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,416
Never fear, your new teacher
has already been selected--

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,875
no need to worry.
Farewell students!

[STUDENTS]
Uhh...

132
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,000
See, that's what you
can do when you've

133
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,125
honed your use of Cartado.
What an impressive teacher.

134
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,875
Well, impressive or not,
he isn't our teacher anymore.

135
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,416
I'm excited! Aren't you?

136
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,375
I can't wait to see what
our new one will look like!

[door opens]

138
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,958
I...

139
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,750
...will be...

140
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,875
...your... new... teacher...

Get out of my way,
you big hunk o' wood!

143
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,416
Starting this moment, I'm going
to be your new teacher!

144
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,958
The Dem-- I mean, Mao.

145
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,625
I'm planning to whip
you all into shape,

146
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,750
so prepare yourselves!

147

[STUDENTS]
So cute!

Yeah, I'm sure she'll
really appreciate that

I could totally
squeeze you forever!

What the heck are you doing
to our teacher, Yusha?!

Yusha! The Hero?

Yeah! But you can just
call me Yusha, though.

Miss Mao.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,708
[MAO] Here on Naral Island,
anything is possible.

165
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,250
It's a land full of magic.

166
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,750
But, because of that,
there are plenty

167
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,750
of unpredictable
problems, as well.

168
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,333
Normally, the Royal
Military would handle

169
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,750
any trouble that might arise,

170
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,041
but, truth is, they can't
even keep up with it.

171
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,041
So, that's why our homeland
needs hearty adventurers.

172
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,458
And they need to be
jacks of all trades.

Great, no pressure...

176
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,791
But, it's also important for you
to hone the specific skill sets

177
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,958
unique to your
individual Classes.

Yes, ma'am!

00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,458
The Seiran family have
always been priests,

183
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,500
and like my ancestors before me,
I, too, am a healing Priest.

184
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,791
And I'm a warrior!

185
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,750
That means I hit
things a whole lot!

186
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,541
[MEI] I think it would
be fascinating to be

She's not crazy,
she's just a mage!

00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,291
And as for me--I'm proud
to say that I'm a Hero!

A Hero?

Did she say "Hero"?

193
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,958
[YUSHA] Hm? What is it,
did I say something strange?

194
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,250
Don't you understand?

195
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,791
Heroes only exist when
there's a Demon Lord.

196
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,083
There are plenty of other
monsters on the island,

197
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,750
but there's no Demon Lord
around in this day and age.

198
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:10,625
Therefore, you are currently
without a class at all!

00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:15,375
What did you say?!

200
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,833
Welp, okay then.

201
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,666
The first thing to do
is find a Demon Lord

202
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,250
living in this age, right?

203
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,375
Then once I do, I become a real
Hero, isn't that all it takes?

00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,208
[MAO gasping]

Heh. ENDRO!

Hey, you two.
Settle down and listen.

your first practical

[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am!

But worry not.

217
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,875
It's just a simple task of going
in and retrieving the items

218
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,375
I've already carefully placed
deep within the ruins.

219
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,541
Oh, nice, this should
be really easy, then!

220
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,000
By the way, those of you who
fail this practical challenge

221
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,583
will be permanently expelled!

222
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,791
[STUDENTS]
What?!

223
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
Like, expelled, for real?

224
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,583
I can promise you
these ruins contain

225
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,833
the weakest monsters around,

226
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,041
and there are no
lethal traps to kill you.

227
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,333
So, if you can't clear
this level, then, frankly,

00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,416
you're not fit to
be an adventurer!

Let's go do this!

00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,416
Man, that was easy.

233
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,000
She was right, those traps
weren't bad at all.

00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,125
I thought she was joking,
but that was no sweat.

235
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,458
What a total piece of cake.

236
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,083
It seems like it really
is an easy task!

237
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,166
Come on. What're you waiting
for, you're the last ones to go.

Kay!

Out of curiosity,
what made you four

decide to group up
and be a party?

241
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,583
Because our seats are really
close together in class?

242
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,083
Because we shared a table
in the cafeteria?

243
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,708
Because our dorm rooms are
right next to each other?

244
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,541
No. I believe it's because
it's our destiny.

245
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,541
After all, together, we bested
the most mortifying challenge

246
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,041
set by teachers or Demon Lords.

"Look around, kids,
and form a group of four!"

and we beat it by bravely
coming together as a party!

As a Demon Lord, I don't think
I'd consider that a challenge.

Sorry, did you say something?

Nope, you imagined it.

But enough chatter.
You four should get going.

to use forbidden magic.
But, it was a huge failure!

is the right way...?

[YUSHA] Seira, what're you

There's definitely more to

What are you talking about?!

We clearly left the ruins
quite a while ago!

I can't believe we're
going to be expelled

this to my poor family?!

Seira, c'mon,
it's fine, don't cry!

No, let her! Tears are
nutrition for the heart.

That means, in the end,
they'll make Seira stronger!

Well, we should at
least do our part--

those tears aren't wasted.

Do you really?

Absolutely.

It looks like we're gonna
get a lot of rain tomorrow,

345
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,000
so we can't forget to
bring our umbrellas!

Do you expect me to find
comfort in a weather report?

What is wrong with you?!
We're all going to be expelled!

Don't worry.

be saying that right now?

Huh. That looks like a sword.

Are you the one? Did you
just call out to me?

real thing that happens?

the sword becomes the Hero?

the Hero's sword shall
