for my entire life.

One was going to Tarka Village,

66
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,791
but I already made
that one happen.

67
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,666
Tarka Village was
a blast, wasn't it?

68
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,791
Yeah, and they had some
super yummy food!

69
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,375
The fireworks were pretty, too!

70
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,916
That was the happiest
day I've had

in my entire life
so far, you guys!

second dream has always been?

[ALL]
Yeah. Spill!

74
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,375
I'm glad you asked!
Obviously, it's Cartado.

00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,375
A complete collection
of every one!

76
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,000
Ancient Cartado
with forbidden spells,

sealed away for centuries
in forgotten ruins!

78
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,291
There's a super rare kind of
Cartado that brings good luck

79
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,000
to its owners. Only one
in every billion monsters

drops it when they're defeated!

81
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,791
Then, of course, there are the
mysterious Cartado that nobody's

82
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,500

Therefore, I want to own
every single one of 'em!

Cartado, I think of Mei.

I'd love to see that collection!

00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,333
[MEI]
And then, once I've gathered

90
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,833
every Cartado in this world,

91
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,000
that's when I'll unleash their
true power for all to see.

gain a will of their own.

As a result, the Cartado,

00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,583
with their mind-bogglingly
superior power,

96
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,500
will rule over this realm and
create a brand-new world!

103
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,041
Can I go next, then?

104
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,791
I want to set out on big
adventures around the world

105

and try out lots of different
kinds of delicious foods!

106
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,416
For example, did you know
that in the southern seas

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,250
there's a certain fish
that's said to contain

seven different flavors?

the legendary golden apples
of the northern jungle!

plains that even a thousand

to finish eating!

[SEIRA] Although... My room is
definitely stressing me out.

before graduation.

[SEIRA] It started off
so clean and tidy.

140

How could I ever
let it get this way?

141
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,250
I'll never understand
how it happened.

142
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,916
[SEIRA]
It's a dark mystery.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,250
I think Seira's entered some
intense state of deep thought.

This is such a
weird dream, you guys!

your future goals!

to face reality yet!

317
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,083
Would you guys just
wake up already?!

318
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's deal with this
by combining

319
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,208
all three of our dreams!

320
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,583
Good call! Then we can
stand against Seira,

321
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,416
with the power of
three people's dreams!

322
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,083
Yeah, I third that!

323
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:37,916
[YUSHA]
Done!

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,041
[FAI]
Yeah!

325
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,250
[MEI]
In!

326
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,208
Here's my dream of
defeating the Demon Lord!

327
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,666
My dream of eating
delicious food!

328
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,125
[MEI]
And my dream of rare Cartado!

329
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,958
[GIRLS yell]

330
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,916
[SEIRA]
This is...

331
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,708
[YUSHA] It's like... the
crystallization of our dreams!

332
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,333
--[FAI] Yummy.
--Demon Lord...

333
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,208
Cartado!

334
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,250
It's "Yummy"? Seriously?

335
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,416
Wow! You're right, it is yummy!

336
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
I told you!

337
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
Gimme some, too!

338
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,125
Wait, lemme try!

339
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,416
[YUSHA]
It's so good!

340
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,958
[MEI]
I can't stop eating this!

341
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,416
That was perfectly delicious!

342
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,208
Can't believe I'm full!

343
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,541
I can't believe we
ended up eating it all!

344
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,666
We sure did, though.

345
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,208
[YUSHA] Wait! Wasn't that the
crystallization of our dreams?

346
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,000
Seira ate it all right up,
didn't she?

347
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,416
That's a pretty gutsy move,

348
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,708
eating other people's
dreams, you know.

349
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,375
[SEIRA] Stop talking as if I'm
the only one who had some!

350
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,041
[GIRLS laugh]

351
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,000
[SEIRA]
Wait!

352
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,208
Not so fast!

353
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,625
[CARTA EATER 10A screams]

354
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,500

Huh?!

355
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,458

[YUSHA]
Huh...?

359
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,916
Where are we?

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,916
At least it seems like
we're actually awake now.

361
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,500
Seira, that was
pretty mean of you.

362
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,958
I was hoping to eat so many
more yummy things too.

363
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,875
[MEI] I'll never have another
dream so wonderful again!

364
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,708
Would you shut up? Now, look!

365
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,250
All of it was this
little thing's fault!

366
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,375
A monster, huh?

367
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,750
How'd he get here?

368
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,083
Hold on, isn't that
a carta eater?

369
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,375
[SEIRA]
Yes.

370
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
[FAI, YUSHA]
Carta eater?

371
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,750
[SEIRA MEI]
It puts adventurers to sleep,

372
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,958
and then it eats up
all their Cartado.

373
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,583
It's a pretty
terrifying monster.

374
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,500
Wait!

375
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,125
What?!

376
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,875
That thing really got us good!

377
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,083
It sounds to me like Mei
might have found herself

378
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,458
a new "worst enemy."

379
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,125
What's crazy is that if
Seira hadn't woken us up...

380
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,916
Then that stupid little
monster would've eaten

381
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,166
every last one of 'em!

382
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,291
I see.

383
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,916
We owe you one, Seira!

384
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,208
Don't worry, you don't
owe me anything.

385
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,166
After all, isn't it our job to
save our fellow party-members?

386
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,916
[SEIRA grunting]

387
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,666
Seira is the coolest ever.

388
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,666
She's the only one who wasn't
taken in by her own dream!

389
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,041
That can be really
difficult to do, too.

390
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,291
The carta eater makes people
dream of their deepest desires.

391
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,000
So, it's hard to overcome it

392
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,625
unless you happen to have some
rare and formidable willpower.

393
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,416
You truly are incredible, Seira!

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,708
Yeah, of course I am.
Now, it stopped snowing.

395

You all ready to go home?

396
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,166
Heck yeah!

397
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,333
Time to clear the quest!

00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,875
Let's do it!

399
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,041
[SEIRA]
Still, though...

400
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,541
I really should clean my room.
