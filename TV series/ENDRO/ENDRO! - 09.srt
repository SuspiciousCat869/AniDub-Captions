[MEI]
Check it out!

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,416
Crazy big news, you guys!

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,333
Are you ready? I managed to get

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,875
into the Cartado Festival
for the first time!

6
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,125
[ALL]
Huh?

7
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,541
Once a year, the Tarkas,

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,666
who are the only manufacturers
of Cartado in the world,

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
host a super-cool
Cartado Festival!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,333
It's a private event so
not just anyone can show up,

11
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,875
so it's become a
big secret thing

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,916
that most people
only read about!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,083
And now, finally, I have
been officially invited!

Muh!

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,375
So, um, who's your new friend?

16
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,708
[MEI] Oh! This is Dodo,
the Tarka I met

17
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,708
and ended up bonding with at one
of my favorite Cartado shops!

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,083
We got to talking, and now
he's letting me participate!

19
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,500
Muh!

20

--Nice to meet you! I'm Seira.
--[MEI] So, um.

27
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,875
Anyway. About the festival...

28
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,458
Wow, guys.

29
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,208
I'm really glad you were
able to hit it off so fast.

30
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:25,416

literally months to do that.

31

[DODO]
Muh, muh!

32
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,333

Muh, muh!

33
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,458
Muh, muh, muh.

34
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,750
He says,

35
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,083
"The path to the village...
is through here."

36
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,916
So, I guess we'll assume this
cave leads to the festival.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,458
Farewell, then. 'Fraid this
is as far as you girls can go.

Look, don't "what?" me!

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,541
There are tons of evil merchants
out there who would love to know

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,208
how to get to the Tarka Village,
the birthplace of Cartado!

42
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,833
It's not a place
outsiders just waltz into.

43
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,083
It was practically a miracle

44
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,875
that I received permission
from Dodo at all!

45
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,625
So I've got to go on my own!

46
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,000
I cannot do anything
to mess up this chance!

47
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
Muh, muh, muh.

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,291
He said that we can come, too!

49
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,708
That's fixed!

50
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,833
Not cool. Don't say that just
'cause you want to come!

51
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,750
"You all come. Village.
Come. Welcome."

52
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,500
'Kay, you're right...
How'd you understand him?!

53
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,875
Not really sure.
Wild instincts, maybe?

54
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,500
So you're saying we can come
to the village with you now?

55
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,791
Hooray!

Yes! [laughs]

Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

59

You guys have zero idea
how lucky you are.

00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,083
Is it just me, or is
this a dead end?

61
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,375
[YUSHA]
Wow, how'd you do that?

62
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,916
[SEIRA]
Huh? Where'd it come from?

63

Muh, muh.

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,125
It sounds like he's
telling us to jump down.

Mm... Yeah, she's right.

Well, all right, then--
here I go!

Jeez! How were you guys able
to jump without hesitation?

I mean, what, am I
high-maintenance?

77
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,125
[MEI] Yusha and Fai are
both totally fearless.

78
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,500
Not just them, you're
not panicking, either!

79

Well, I'm actually panicking
quite a bit.

80
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,791
Okay, I don't see that at all.

81
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,875
I'm the type to drown in a
river without anyone noticing.

Well aren't you just a
little ray of sunshine!

Uh? What now?

84
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,916
If I had to guess, I'd say
it's some kinda gate

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,041
that will eventually
lead us to the village.

86

Maybe we'll be there as
soon as we pass through!

[YUSHA, MEI groan]

94
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,916
Couldn't it have set us
down a little bit more gently?

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,750
Muh. Muh!

96
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
There they are.

97
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,916
Those are some
weird-looking trees.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,958
It kinda seems like they
grow paper instead of fruit.

99
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,541
[MEI]
They do!

100
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,875
Those are the Cartado trees I've
dreamed of seeing all my life!

101
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,458
And now they're right
in front of me!

102
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,708
It's almost too good to be true!

103
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,083
[SEIRA, FAI, YUSHA]
What?!

104
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,458
I had no idea that
Cartado grew on trees.

105
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,541
You know, I'm not sure
where I got this from,

106
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,083
but I always kinda had this
idea that a powerful mage

107
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,125
used some kind of special magic
circle to concentrate his power

108
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,083
and imbue the spells
into the cards.

109
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,708
Yeah, that's exactly
what I thought, too!

110
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,291
No! That's a big part of what
makes Cartado so unique!

111
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,250
They aren't manufactured
items created by mankind.

112
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,291
They're a product of nature,
grown from the soil itself!

113
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,375
[YUSHA] Wow. There are
all different kinds

114
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,625
of Cartado growing
from a single tree!

115
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,750
That's another part
of their mystery.

116
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,166
From everything I've come
across in my research,

117
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,750
the strongest theory
seems to be that the land

118
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,500
in this region is what produces
Cartado, not the trees.

119
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,750
Wow, to think,
I had no idea! Huh?

120
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,000
Hey, are those Tarka children?

Oh my gosh!

understand what he said?

Uh-huh! He said their
clothes are special.

127
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,875
They're wearing them because
of the festival today!

128
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,125
Yeah, makes sense.

Look at you!
Taking her word for it.

130
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
Well, when logically
speaking it's easier

131
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,375
having an interpreter
than it is to use a book.

since they grow every year.

Muh-muh, muh.

have some, too. If we want.

Do you think so?

325
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,916
I mean, that's a legendary rare.

It's not like you're going to

That's a common.

That's a common, too.
And that's an ordinary rare.

330
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,333
Mei, are you just looking
for legendary rares?

331
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,791
Hey! Maybe we could
find a mythic rare

332
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,583
kinda like the one Rona has!

333
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:32,000
Impossible. There are only a
few mythic rares in the world.

334
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,000
The ones that exist are said
to be gifts straight from God,

335
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,875
and then passed down
for generations

336
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,625
since ages and ages ago.

337
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,333
There's no written record of
any of them growing on trees

338
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,958
like the others do.
But there's still a chance

339
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,000
that we might find
another legendary rare.

340
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,458
And besides, even if I
don't become Cartado King,

341
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,041
I still got to participate
in the Cartado Festival

do, then I'm gonna help you!

we're not that likely to find,

set, so we're close to the end.

in a landslide or something.

ones everyone picked out

They arrange them in a pile

like this in order to offer
them up to the gods.
