1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:21,291
[MAO] In short, it's tempting to
use medicinal herbs in the wild,

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,916
but it's unsanitary.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,125
So only in emergencies.

00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,333
[MAO groans]

00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,333
I mean, unless it's urgent.

8

--[SEIRA] Are you okay?
--[MEI] What's up with Miss Mao?

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,958
[YUSHA]
Miss Mao, what's wrong?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,833
Uh! She's got a fever!

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,541
Oh my, would you be willing to
leave this one to me, Hero?

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,875
Are you sure?

14
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,375
It's important to remain
calm in moments like this.

15
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,083
No panic, no rush.

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,708
We're simply going to build the
ultimate hospital right here,

17
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,875
right now!

18
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,583
On the contrary,
you're in full panic mode!

19
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,791
Let's just get her to
the nurse's office, okay?

20
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,333
The way you can make
the right decision

21
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,000
in the middle of a crisis
always amazes me.

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:10,500
[panting]

23
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,833
[NURSE 6A] I have the
results of your exam.

24
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:16,458
Huh? That look... in your eyes.

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,541
It's bad, isn't it?

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:22,250
Yes. I knew it would
come to this one day.

27
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,708
[NURSE 6A] This is terribly
difficult to have to tell you.

28
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,000
I know my body better
than anyone.

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,000
I can always feel when
something isn't quite right.

30
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,041
I'm prepared to accept anything.

31
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,875
I've had a long time
to think about it.

32
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,125
So, please, tell me the truth.

33
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,875
[NURSE 6A] Miss Mao, what
you're dealing with is rare,

34
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,791
and it is called the
Demon Lord Fever!

35
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,125
[MAO]
Demon Lord what now?

36
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:27,375
[MAO panting]

37
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,041
[MAO]
It's called "Demon Lord Fever"

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,458
because even Demon
Lords can't escape it.

39
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,416
What a weird way
to name a sickness.

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,041
Seems a little harsh
that even I,

41
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,791
who gave up being
the Demon Lord,

42
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,500
should have to deal with this.

43
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,416
But maybe it's my punishment
for tossing my duty aside.

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,541
[MAO sighs]

45
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:55,208
That's some good strawberry
juice. Fill 'er up, please!

46
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,500
Now I'm home and I'm
happy, safe, and sound!

47
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:02,041
Off. Off. Bed!

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:07,750
[snoring]

49
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,291
[MAO] Well, I have no idea
how I could've caught this,

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,583
but there's nothing
to be done.

51
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,166
I guess I just have to accept it

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,375
as some kind of karma
being dealt to me.

53
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,333
[stomach growls]

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,833
[MAO]
Oh, man.

55
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,416
It's a pain to get up, but I
don't have much of a choice.

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
They said there's never been any
kind of wonder drug for this,

57
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,750
so the only way to treat it

58
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,875
is to stay warm and
get plenty of rest,

59
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,875
and to make sure I'm eating
loads of "nutritious stuff."

60
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,750
So, I guess it's time to start.

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,250
Demon Lord Fever's the worst!

62
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, dang.

63
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:44,250
I know it's my own fault,
but I still can't believe it.

64
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,750
I suppose I should cook
for myself more often.

65
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458
Huh? What's that?

66
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,208
Oh, right!
It's the drop we got

67
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,125
from the Honey Boo Monster
during that outdoor practical!

68
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,166
This honey is
chock-full of nutrients!

69
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,583
[MAO] Ugh. Shoot, is this
really all I have left?

70
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,208
Well, I guess it's
better than nothing.

71
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,875
[MAO]
Li'l lick.

72
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,625
So sweet!

73
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,958
I've heard it said
that this honey

74
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,750
provides complete nutrition!

75
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,791
I can use it to fight off the
nasty Demon Lord Fever!

76
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,583
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.

77
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
I'm sad.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,166
I mean, what am I doing here
all by myself and super sick,

79
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,583
instead of being the Demon Lord?

80
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,833
No fair.

81
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,666
Why was I unceremoniously
thrown to the past

82
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,083
during that battle
with the Hero?

83
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,666
Ugh!

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,541
Although, when
I think about it,

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,916
there's really not
much difference

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,791
between then and now.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,250
[MEIGO] Have you awakened,
new Demon Lord?

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,166
[MAO]
And you are?

89
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,583
[MEIGO]
I am a golem,

90
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,875
and I was created specifically
to serve the Demon Lord.

91
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,083
So, Demon Lord,
have you been able

92
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,416
to finish recovering
all your memories?

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,750
Not all. I wish I had,
but I'm not there yet.

94
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,083
Remember, this is 3,000 years of
memories you're talking about.

95
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,916
The details tend to get
a little hazy over time.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,291
[MEIGO] That's to be
expected, of course.

97
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,416
This is your 999th
resurrection, after all.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,291
[MAO] And when the Demon Lord
is resurrected in this land,

99
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,416
a Hero also appears to
take them down, right?

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,583
Heh.

101
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,041
So, if the legends are all true,

102
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,125
that means we've now
been defeated 998 times,

103
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,291
which is crazy.

104
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,500
Hmph.

105
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,208
It seems like we're
only being resurrected

106
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,916
for the sole purpose of
being taken down again.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,375
I have full confidence that you
can achieve a victory this time,

108
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,208
for what it's worth.

109
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,291
[MAO]
Very well.

110
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,583
In that case, you may
begin guiding me

111
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,666
toward becoming a
true Demon Lord.

112
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,708
Of course. That's
what I'm here for.

113
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,291
[MAO]
What are those things?

114
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,958
They're glasses.
I will be your teacher.

115
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,625
[MAO]
Wearing those things?

116
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,000
[MEIGO]
Indeed.

117
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,500
What is the major known weakness

118
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,041
of the second tail of
a five-tailed dragon?

119
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,375
[MAO]
Easy-peasy, it's fire.

120
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,250
[MEIGO] That is the weakness
of its fourth tail.

121
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:27,541
The correct answer is that the
base of the tail is ticklish.

122
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,625
Okay, we're talking about
a different kind of weakness.

123
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,875
Next, if our friend Tom
harvests 300 from his fields,

124
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,083
approximately how much
will he pay in taxes

125
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,833
if it's a rate of 30%?

126
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,666
Well, that's ridiculous.
He would pay 90.

127
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,208
[MEIGO]
Incorrect.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,416
Tom would pay no taxes and would
instead flee into the night,

129
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,416
after the Demon Lord
burns all of his fields.

130

Wait, am I some kind of tyrant?

131

You're the Demon Lord.

The Hero has arrived!

159
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,958
That's right.

160
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,041
They've successfully
defeated the Four Generals,

161
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
and now they're headed
straight for you, Demon Lord.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,708
I'll attempt to intercept them.

163
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,833
[MAO]
Wait.

164
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,333
Yes, Demon Lord?

165
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,583
Nothing. Never mind, forget it.

166
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,916
[MEIGO]
Then please excuse me, my lord.

167
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,250
Even if I wanted to stop
that girl from leaving,

168
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,125
I don't even know
her actual name.

169
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,083
I guess, when it comes
down to it, I'm all alone.

00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,625
[yells]

171
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,541
[DEMON LORD] I applaud you
for making it this far

172
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,000
and reaching my lair, Heroes.

173
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,041
I was so very close to
conquering Naral Island,

174
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,166
and putting an end to
my sad, pathetic life

175
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,125
in the lonely Demon
Lord's Castle.

176
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,375
Why did the dumb new Hero have
to be someone so clueless?

177
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,000
It's just infuriating!

Miss Mao, please, don't die!

182
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,708
Please!

00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,791
[FAI] Ooo, you've got her
in a nice lock, Yusha!

184
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,125
You should have her
beat in three seconds!

185
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,541
[SEIRA]
Hey, hey, hey, Yusha!

186
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,708
You need to ease up a
little on that grip, okay?

187
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,583
Come on. See? Miss Mao's
trying to tap out!

188
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,416
Let her go and back away slowly.

189
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,916
Now, fight!

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,458
Hey, Seira, I don't think
you're helping the situation.

191
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,291
You all really are the
most clueless creatures!

00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,291
Are you all right, Miss Mao?

196
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,875
Believe it or not, I was
actually doing fairly well

197
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,333
until you crazy weirdos

[MAO coughs]

199
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,833
[FAI] I found some Honey
Boo honey over here!

200
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,416
So sweet!

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,416
Wait, that's mine!

202
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
Hey! Give that back to me!

203
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,250
That honey is my last
hope for nutrition

204
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,833
before it all
comes crashing down

205
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,625
and I die a sad and lonely death
surrounded by school children!

206
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,791
This is the end...

207
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,541
How could that have
been your last hope?

208
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,583
It seemed like there was
hardly any in there.

209
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,000
Truth.

210
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,375
But if you think it'll help,
then have a lick! Here!

211
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,791
[FAI chuckles]

212
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,208
I won't lie, it kinda tickles
when you lick it like that!

[chirps]

She looks really uncomfortable.

When I had Demon Lord Fever
as a kid, it wasn't like this.

222
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,833
I recovered right away.

223
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,416
Hey, I know!

224
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,875
Mei! Why don't we just cure her
Demon Lord Fever with a Cartado?

225
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,750
Because that's impossible.

226
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,375
You can heal wounds
with Cartado,

227
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,250
but you can't cure illnesses.

228
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,416
That's just the nature
of how they work.

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,541
Oh, I see.

230
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,375
Guess Cartado has
its limitations

231
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,708
just like everything else.

Hey, Yusha.

235
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,458
I'm sure it's not because
Cartado lack any power,

236
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,250
but more because nothing
can compare to a mother!

237
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
You mean as a cure?

is enough to start?

I'd say so.

I'll make some food

00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,041
You shall taste the power
of the Demon Lord! Ha!

320
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,916
Huh?

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,333
What is going on?
Where'd my power go?

322
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,791
Oh, I see. So you're
playing "Demon Lord"?

323
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,625
What's so funny to you, human?

324
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,291
My, you're very scary!

325
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,166
I'm in quite a pickle facing off
with the big bad Demon Lord!

326
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,333
What'll I do?

327
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:21,083
After all, the new Hero
has yet to appear.

328
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,333
You would dare to insult
the Demon--? Wait a minute.

329
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,250
What do you mean
there's no Hero?

330
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,333
Now I get it.
At least, I think I do.

331
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,375
At present, there's no Hero
walking around on Naral Island,

332
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,333
let alone a Demon Lord.

333
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,458
So what does that mean, then?

334
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,791
Only thing I can think,

335
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,125
is that I've been sent
to the past somehow,

336
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,625
and it must have been...
because of her!

337
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,458
But time travel is supposed
to be impossible for everyone

338
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,041
except the Creator-class
god, so just how badly

339
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,791
did that dimwit Hero
have to screw up

340
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,500
in order for this craziness
to happen to me?

341
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,041
[sighs]

342
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,583
Although, I guess it could
be a whole lot worse.

343
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,666
Fortunately, I still possess
my memories of the future.

344
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,166
And if I use those wisely,

345
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,375
I might even be able to prevent
the birth of the new Hero!

346
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,625
Unfortunately, whether it's
because the Hero's magic failed,

347
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,458
or because I've somehow
travelled back in time,

348
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,083
my power has been
drastically weakened.

349
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,416
I need to try and get some rest
so I can recover my power.

350
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,875
To do that...

351
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,708
...I will need to procure
a base and a job!

352
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,083
[MAO laughing]

353
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,625
I am the Demon Lo--I mean, Mao!

354
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,333
Listen well,
foolish little humans

355
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,708
of the Adventurer's Guild.

356
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,666
You will humbly and
obediently find me

357
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,708
a suitable job and residence!

358
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry, kid. All outta
good quests right now.

359
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,000
Here, have some candy
and go play outside.

360
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,958
Nice. It's wise and admirable
of you to present a tribute.

361
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,666
I shall return again!

362
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
Well, curses!

363
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,791
At this point, I'm going
to have to try everything!

364
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,958
Why is it this difficult
to find a base and a job?

365
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,125
And what possible reason
could everybody have

366
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,458
for continuing to give me candy?

367
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,291
As tasty as it is,
quite frankly,

368
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,500
candy isn't going
to fill my stomach.

371
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,458
To think that the Demon Lord

372
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:37,250
could be taken down
by basic hunger.

373
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,750
Ugh...

[groaning]

375
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,208
Well, good morning,
are you awake?

376
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,458
You have no right to ask
me any questions, ma'am.

377
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,708
Would you care to explain
why you're carrying me

378
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,083
under your arm?

379
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,708
When you spot a cute young
girl collapsed on the road,

380
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,750
you take her in!

381
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,000
Look at her.

382
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,583
How can she have such
clear, unwavering eyes?

383
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,791
Anyway, I found you
while I was on a quest,

384
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,416
so I couldn't leave you alone.

385
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,333
[MAO] That may be, but
why do I get the feeling

386
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,500
I would've been safer
if you had left me alone?

387
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,583
[MAO]
Would you just put me down?!

388
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,125
All right. I certainly couldn't
fight while carrying you around.

389
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,666
Huh?

390
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,666
A five-tailed dragon?

391
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
So, hey, when you
mentioned a quest...

392
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,291
You sure seem to know a
lot for such a little one.

393
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,541
Here, have some candy.

394
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,000
[MAO]
Not again!

395
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,250
Wait, I don't have
time to eat candy.

396
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,416
Right!

397
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,291
Gaia Gate!

398
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,583
Wow, look at that!
I've recovered quite a bit!

399
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,416
Candy seems to be
surprisingly energizing!

400
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Feeling better, then?

401
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,625
Yep, so let's defeat it already!

402
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,500
I'm afraid I'll
run out of candy.

403
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,750
Wait--I mean, my magic power!

404
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,208
[FEMALE WARRIOR 2A] I don't
know, that's a formidable foe.

405
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, yeah, so you just have
to go for its weaknesses.

406
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,125
Go over there and try tickling
the base of its second tail.

407
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,750
If you do that, it'll
calm down right away.

408
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,333
Fine, I'll try it.

409
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,541
Then, we're out of here!

410
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:22,208
Wait, why are you taking me?!

411
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,500
[FEMALE WARRIOR 2A]
You really saved me today.

412
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
It's amazing that you
already have such knowledge

413
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,291
and strength at this age.

414

[MAO laughs]

415
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,083
Well, but of course I do!

416
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,041
So, considering all of that,

417
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,416
would you ever think
about being a teacher?

418
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,875
A teacher?

419
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,000
That's right, I work
full-time as a teacher

420
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,416
at the Adventurer School.

421
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
Would you like to as well?

422
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
[MAO] Why should the Demon
Lord train up adventurers

423
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,708
when one of them is for sure
going to become the future Hero?

424
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,333
Sorry, but I don't
think that's really--

425
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,833
Also, the Adventurer School
is run by the kingdom.

426
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,375
Are you serious?!

427
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,416
So, you mean, I would be...
someone with a stable income?

428
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,625
That's right.

429
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,500
Well, you should've said
that in the first place.

430
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,541
I now humbly accept your offer.

Well, hello. May I ask what
you're doing in my bed?

433
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,333
I happen to be looking
after a sick little girl.

434
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
How is it this woman keeps
calling me a little girl

435
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,083
with such clear,
unwavering eyes?

436
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,500
Oh, my body feels much lighter.

437
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,458
That's good to hear!

438
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,208
The girls who left when I came
in were worried about you.

439

They seem like good friends.

440
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
They were worried?

441
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,250
She's just like a little baby,
falling asleep when she eats!

442

It's so cute!

00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,208
Her complexion is looking
a lot better, as well.

Please take care of
her after we go!

445
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,000
Sure. You can leave
it all to me.

446
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,541
It's my pleasure.

to be cold. I should re-heat it.
