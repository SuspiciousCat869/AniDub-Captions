- HMM?
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,875

BUT I COULDN'T TAKE THE WHINING!

YOU CAN SHOWER ME WITH ALL

- JUST MAKE SURE YOU PAY
ME BACK WHEN WE HIT TOWN.

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,750
MY WALLET'S ALMOST EMPTY.

18
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,708
- YOU'VE GOT A POINT THERE.

19
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,208
- AM I REALLY GETTING
THROUGH TO THIS GIRL?

20
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,375

- ( door opens )

21
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,833

HAVE SOME OF YOUR WATER?

22
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,000

23

EVERYONE HERE IS EXHAUSTED

26
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,916
FROM THEIR TERRIBLE ORDEAL
IN THE SAND STEAMER?

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,208
DON'T WORRY,
I'VE SHUT HIM UP FOR YOU.

34
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,125
- HUH?

35
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,125

- BUT THAT WAS MY--

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,750
- Meryl :WHAT WERE YOU DOING
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT?

46
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,208
- HEH, WELL, MY BIKE DECIDED
TO BREAK DOWN ON ME

47
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,291
ABOUT 100 ILES OR SO
DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE,

48
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,166
SO I THOUGHT
I'D JUST HOOF IT.

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,625
- Meryl: ARE YOU SAYING
YOU ACTUALLY WALKED 100 ILES?!

50
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,750
- THAT'S RIGHT!
IT WAS PRETTY HORRIBLE.

51
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,250
- UH...

52
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,708
- Milly: GEE, IT MUST HAVE
BEEN AWFULLY TIRING

53
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,000
TO WALK CARRYING THAT HUGE THING
ON YOUR BACK.

54
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,000
- ( man laughs )
I COULDN'T LEAVE IT BEHIND.

55
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,041
I DO HAVE MY PRIDE
AS A TRADESMAN, YOU KNOW.

56
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,875
- Meryl: UH, TRADESMAN?

57
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,541
- I'M A MAN OF THE CLOTH.

58
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,125
- YOU? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

59
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,541
- ( laughs ) DO YOU, LIKE,
MAKE PRETTY DRESSES?

60
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,083

STRAYED OFF THEIR PATH,

63
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,500
YOU GIRLS ARE THE ONES WHO
SPOTTED ME, AREN'T YOU?

64
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,916
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,583
- WELL, ACTUALLY THE
ONE THAT SPOTTED YOU

66
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,083
WHEN YOU NOTHING BUT A TINY
LITTLE SPECK ON THE HORIZON

67
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,583
WAS THAT PATHETIC GUY.
- ( moaning )

68
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,291
- OH. HEY,

69
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,416
I'M ALIVE BECAUSE
OF WHAT YOU DID.

70
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,416

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,166
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
MR. VASH THE STAMPEDE?

78
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,458
- HMMM?!

HE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!

85
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,000

I HAVE TROUBLE BELIEVING IT TOO.

OH, HEY!

( laughing )

94
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
- Vash: DON'T BROADCAST IT
TO THE WHOLE WORLD, OKAY?

95
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,541
- IF I SHOT YOU DEAD RIGHT NOW
AND COLLECTED THE $$60 BILLION

96
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,958
I'D HAVE A REALLY
FUN JOURNEY, WOULDN'T I?

97
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,125
( laughs )

98
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,625
- YOU WEREN'T
LISTENING, WERE YOU?

99
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,916
- GOT ANY MORE WATER?
- I WOULD, BUT YOU DRANK IT ALL.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,916
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT!

104
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,500
- Meryl: THE BIRDS OF A FEATHER
HAVE FLOCKED TOGETHER.

105
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,583
- ( passengers grumbling )
I'M TIRED. THAT WAS A LONG TRIP.

106
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,291
- I'M SO STIFF!
- I COULD GO TO SLEEP.

107
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
- I'VE GOTTA STRETCH!
- MOMMY, I'M TIRED.

108
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,458
- LOOK, MISTER, DO ME A FAVOR,
PLEASE COUNT IT ONE MORE TIME.

109
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,500

00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,333
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

112
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,125
RECOUNT IT ALL YOU WANT,
IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

113
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,583
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
THE FARE IS $$100.

114
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,083
- IF I GIVE YOU ANY MORE,
I'LL DIE OF STARVATION.

115
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,541
COME ON, DRIVER.
PLEASE GIVE ME A BREAK.

116
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,666
- ( groans )
ALL RIGHT.

117
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,000
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL LET YOU RIDE FOR $$80.

118
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,250
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
- REALLY?! THAT'D BE GREAT!

119
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,541
THANKS A LOT!
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT!

120
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,625
- WHAT?

121
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,541
W-WHAT-- WHOA.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

122
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,083
- IT'S A CONFESSIONAL.
YOU KNOW, THOSE PRIVATE ROOMS

123
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,041
THEY USED TO HAVE IN THE
CHURCHES BACK HOME?

124
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,333
THIS ONE IS PORTABLE!

125
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,583
YOU MUST HAVE
SOMETHING TO CONFESS?

126
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,958
SOME BLASPHEMOUS ACT,
AN INDISCRETION MAYBE?

127
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,541
IT'S ON THE HOUSE!
GO AHEAD, DON'T BE SHY!

128
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,541
( gasps )
- NO THANKS, PADRE.

129
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,666
- WELL NOW, HE'S NOT MUCH FUN.

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,583
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A PRETTY TOUGH JOB.

131
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,625
- HMM?

132
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,083
- IS THAT THING
PART OF YOUR GOSPEL?

133
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,166
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S ALL BUSINESS--

134
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,916
UNFORTUNATELY.

135
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,500
OUR CHURCH KIND OF DOUBLES
AS AN ORPHANAGE.

136
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,500
WE SCRAPE OUT A LIVING
DOING WHAT WE CAN.

137
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,625
WE TAKE IN ALL THESE KIDS
WITH NO LIVING FAMILY,

138
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,625
NO PLACE TO GO.

139
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,916
( inhales, exhales )

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,250
GUESS IT WAS TIME
I LEFT THE CHURCH ANYWAY.

141
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,541
I DECIDED IT WAS
A HOPELESS EFFORT

142
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,250
UNLESS I MADE SOME
MONEY FOR THEM.

143
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,500
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU MAKE MONEY AS A PRIEST?

144
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,791
- WELL, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
PUT IT LIKE THAT.

145
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,250
BUT... OH.

146
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,083
- MAMA, I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
- AND I'M TIRED.

147
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,625
- WE'LL BE IN THE CITY SOONER
THAN YOU THINK, GIRLS.

148
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,333
ONCE WE GET THERE,
I'LL GIVE YOU PLENTY TO EAT.

149
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,250
BE PATIENT FOR MOMMY, OKAY?

150
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,083
- BUT, MOM...
- DON'T BE THAT WAY, HONEY.

151
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,041
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

152
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,958
- ( groans )

153
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,333
- I WANT FOOD NOW, PLEASE, MAMA?
- MAMA, I'M THIRSTY!

154
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,250
- Wolfwood: ARE YOU GUYS HUNGRY?
- HUH?

155
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,375
- UH-HUH.
- I SEE.

156
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,291
WELL, I HAVE THESE.
THEY'RE LITTLE,

157
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,166
BUT THEY TASTE PRETTY GOOD.

158
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,750
- UH.
- OH.

159
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,833
- OKAY? WELL, THIS...
IS YOURS.

160
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,458
AND THIS ONE...
IS YOURS.

161
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,500
AND THEN THIS ONE...
UH...

162
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,916
IS MINE.
SORRY IT'S NOT MUCH,

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,708
BUT YOU THINK IT WILL
BE ENOUGH FOR NOW?

164
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,583
HMM?

165
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,958
- AHHH.

166
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,541
( laughs )

167
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,666
- THANK YOU.

168
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,250
- ( girls laugh )

169
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,083
- COME ON, YOU TWO.
WASN'T THAT NICE?

170
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,666
- YEAH!
- I WON'T DROP A CRUMB.

171
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,666
- WELL, I'LL BE.

172
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,291
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT
YOU CAN SMILE LIKE THAT.

173
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,666
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU HAD ME KIND OF WORRIED.

174
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,250
I NOTICED THAT YOU ALWAYS
SMILE AND SEEM REALLY FRIENDLY,

175
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,458
BUT THE WAY YOU SMILED WAS
SO EMPTY, IT HURT TO WATCH YOU!

176
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
YOU'RE HURTING LIKE CRAZY
ON THE INSIDE,

177
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,958
YET YOU GRIN AND BEAR IT.

178
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,791
AT LEAST THAT'S THIS MAN'S
OPINION ANYWAY.

179
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,041
THAT'S WHY I HAVE
THIS CONFESSIONAL!

180
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,416
- GAH!
- NO MATTER WHAT THE WORRY,

181
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,041
I'LL LISTEN TO IT.
JUST PUT A COIN IN HERE.

182
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,875
- YOU'RE REALLY
GOOD AT YOUR TRADE.

183
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,750
- I'VE GOTTA BE
TO MAKE A LIVING!

184
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,375
IT'S NOT EASY, YOU KNOW.
- SOMEBODY COME QUICK!

185
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,791
- Both: HUH?
- ERIK IS COMPLETELY CRAZY!

186
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,916
- Wolfwood: I GUESS
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
THE SUN IS GETTING WORSE.

188
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,916
- HEY, ERIK, BUDDY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,291
HANG ON OKAY!
- IT-- IT WAS...

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,083
- DON'T TALK. HEY, GET THE
STRETCHER OVER HERE!

191
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,166
- HE'S JUST FALLEN DOWN.

192
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,791
HE DOESN'T REALLY LOOK THAT BAD.

193
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,791
HMMM?
- ( moans )

194
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,375
- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

195
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,541
- THERE ISN'T ANYONE HERE
BUT THE PASSENGERS.

196
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,833
- ( murmuring )

197
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,250
- ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

198
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,541
WHOEVER DID IT, COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS UP RIGHT NOW!

199
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,416
- WHY YOU POINTING
THAT THING AT ME?

200
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
- IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?

201
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,333
- IT WAS NO MORTAL
THAT DID THIS.

202
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,250
- Girls: HUH? HMM?
- COME AGAIN?

203
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,458
- ( all gasp )

204
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,583
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
THAT THING IS HUGE!

205
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,833
- ( zooming )
- ( screaming )

206
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,541
- WELL, IT'S--
- IT'S STILL ALIVE!

207
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,500
- WHAT IS IT?!

208
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,291
- Wolfwood:
HEY, NOT BAD, GIRL.

209
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,500
- ( laughs )
- ( all scream )

210
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,458
- Meryl: RUN!

211
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,250
WHY DOESN'T ANYTHING
NICE EVER FOLLOW YOU?!

212
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,291
- Vash: I KNOW!
IT'S A REAL DRAG, ISN'T IT?

213
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,291
- WHAT THE HELL ARE
THOSE UGLY THINGS?

214
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,583
HUNKS OF LOST TECHNOLOGY?!

215
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,916
DAMN! IT'S ALL BECAUSE
I CHANGED MY ROUTE

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,666
TO SAVE THAT STUPID
CHEAP PRIEST!

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,916
- I'M TOO NICE. I SHOULD'VE
CHARGED HIM FULL PRICE!

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,250
- NOW NOW.

219
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,875
( thinking ) HOW CAN THEY
STILL BE OPERATIONAL?

220
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,458
THEIR EXPIRATION DATE
WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

221
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,750
- ( moaning )
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.

222
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,208
- Vash: CAN YOU HELP HIM?
- I MAY NOT LOOK IT,

223
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,000
BUT I AM A PRIEST.
LEAVE IT TO ME!

224
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,000
UH, I'M SURE I HAVE
A BOOK ON IT.

225
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,750
- ( Vash sighs )
- MEOW.

226
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,583
- NEVER MIND, I'LL DO IT.
- OH OKAY. THANKS.

227
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,291
- MEOW.
- ( moaning )

228
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,000
- HELEN?
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY DAUGHTER?

229
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,083
OH MY GOD, NO.

230
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,791
- ( Vash gasps )
- HUH?

231
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,416
- ( unison )
TAKE CARE OF THE WOUNDED MAN!

232
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,041
- Meryl: OH GREAT.
- OH DEAR.

233
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,125
- HUH?
- HUH?

234
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

235
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,750
- DON'T ASK
RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS.

236
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,166
I'M GOING TO SAVE THE CHILD!
- WITH YOUR BARE HANDS?

237
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,625
- OH, SHIT!
HUH?

238
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,625
- YOU WOULD HAVE
GONE ANYWAY, HUH?

239
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,500
- OF COURSE I WOULD.

240
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,750
- I SEE 'EM, I SEE 'EM!
THERE'S LOTS OF THOSE BIG GUYS!

241
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,541
HEY, BUT THOSE ARE
NOTHING FOR THE LIKES

242
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,625
OF VASH THE STAMPEDE, RIGHT?

243
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,541
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

244
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,333
- MY STOMACH KINDA HURTS.
- OH, COME ON NOW, TOUGH GUY.

245
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,541
GET OVER IT. YOU'RE NOT
THAT FRAGILE, ARE YOU?

246
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,750
- I GOT SHOT BY THE
LEADER OF THE BAD LADS

247
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,000
ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO.

248
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,583
- YOU GOT SHOT BY
BRILLIANT DYNAMITES NEON?

249
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,750
( laughs )
NOW THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

250
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,416
YOU DO LEAD AN EXCITING LIFE,
JUST LIKE THEY SAY.

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,750
WE GOTTA GO.

252
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,791
- YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE AND
THEN AGAIN YOU DON'T!

253
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,375
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
- A CHILD'S LIFE IS ON THE LINE.

254
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,458
SHE NEEDS HELP.

255
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,083
- JUST LOOK FOR A
SECOND, WILL YOU?

256
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,708
THEY USE THAT THING ON THE END

257
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,625
TO DETECT OBJECTS
WHICH RADIATE HEAT.

258
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,875
- ( clattering )
- HEY, LISTEN TO ME!

259
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,583
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO JUST
SIT AROUND AND CHITCHAT!

260
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,833
( groans )
OH, THIS IS BAD.

261
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,458
THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.
I'M IN TROUBLE!

262
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,625
- Warning. Your I.D.
has not been registered,

263
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,666
therefore you may
not enter this area.

264
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,750
- HUH?

265
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,208
- You will now be
removed by force.

266
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,958
- ( screaming )

267
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,500
- GET DOWN!
- FIRE!

268
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,541
- THAT'S HIM ALL RIGHT.

269
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,000
HEY, NICE SUPPORT!

270
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,958
- AND YOU WERE A NICE DECOY.

271
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,500
OH!

272
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,125
- AND THAT'S WHAT'S KNOWN
AS A NICE COVER.

273
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,541
YOU WERE THE DECOY
THAT TIME!

274
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,541
- HUH, GUESS SO.
NICE SUPPORT!

275
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,833
- ( grunts )

276
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,000
- WHAT IS IT?!
- OVER THERE!

277
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,791
- ( crying )

278
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,625
- SHE'S STILL ALIVE AND SHE
LOOKS OKAY. PRAISE THE LORD!

279
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,625
- Both: HUH?
- MAMA!

280
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,208
- ( thinking )
HE'S FAST, UNBELIEVABLY FAST!

281
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,500
THAT SOUNDED LIKE
A SINGLE GUNSHOT!

282
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,750
- ( gunshots )

283
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,458
- THANKS A LOT, VASH.
BEHIND YOU!

284
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,250
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE JUST ABOUT DONE.

285
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,333
- ( girl screaming )
- HUH? NUTS!

286
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
- ( girl screams )

287
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,916
- ( men scream )
OH NO, IT'S QUICKSAND!

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,291
( both screaming )

289
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,875
- WHAT AN EMBARRASSING WAY
TO GO.

290
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,291
- Wolfwood:
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

291
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,833
- WE REALLY FELL INTO IT NOW.

292
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,666
WE'RE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THEIR TERRITORY.

293
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,833
- WHAT?

294
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,208
- THIS IS THE INSIDE
OF AN ALIEN SHIP.

295
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,333
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
WE DISCOVERED SOME KIND

296
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,750
OF SPACESHIP THAT
CRASHED HERE A LONG TIME AGO?

297
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,666
- I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW
WHAT'S INSIDE THE BELLY

298
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,125
OF THIS MONSTER WHALE.

299
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,750
- ( whirring )
- HUH?

300
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,875
- ( shrieks )

301
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,208
- NOW I KNOW WHY THE
SHORT-HAIRED GIRL

302
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
IS ALWAYS SO PISSED OFF
AT YOU ALL THE TIME!

303
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,416
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND

304
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,125
THINGS ALWAYS SEEM
TO GET MUCH WORSE.

305
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,250
MY BRAIN'S ABOUT
TO EXPLODE INTO PIECES!

306
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,000
IT'S YOUR FAULT,
DO SOMETHING!

307
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,708
- YOU FELL IN ALL BY YOURSELF.
- YOU'RE THE OUTLAW!

308
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,416
- WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

309
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,083
( shrieking )

310
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,708
- ( both panting )

311
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,666
- I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE FIVE HERE.

312
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,208
- ALL THIS IS
MAKING ME HUNGRY.

313
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,250
THERE!

314
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,125
HERE.

315
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,958
- THAT'S FUNNY.
WITH THE CHILDREN

316
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,750
YOU SEEMED TO BE
A BIT MORE GENEROUS.

317
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,416
- I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT IT.
- AHHH!

318
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR HUMANITY

319
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,291
IN THIS MOST EXTREME
SITUATION.

320
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,458
- OKAY, THAT WAS FUN.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?

321
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,333
- I LOST $$80 BILLION AT POKER,
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE LEFT.

322
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,333
- A REAL MAN WOULD LAY IT
ALL ON THE TABLE.

323
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,083
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
LET'S FIND OURSELVES A CASINO.

324
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,208
- Wolfwood:
THE PLANT'S FULLY OPERATIONAL.

325
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,416
THIS IS AN AWFULLY BIG CASINO!

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,250
WELL THEN,
WHERE ARE THE CARDS?

327
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,416
- RIGHT HERE.
- HUH?

328
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,583
- I'LL GO.
YOU COVER ME.

329
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,125
- HEY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I'VE NEVER FIRED A GUN BEFORE!

330
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,458
BESIDES IF I GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THIS ONE,

331
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,041
DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING
IN THERE COMPLETELY UNARMED?

332
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,500
YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY!

333
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,750
- WHY DON'T YOU GO THEN?
I'LL WAIT HERE.

334
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,583
- I'LL SHOOT THE GUN.
- OKAY, SHUFFLE THE DECK.

335
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,291
IT'S TIME FOR A GAME.
- JUST ONE MOMENT.

336
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,208
- WHAT IS IT?

337
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,083
- MAY YOU GO WITH THE PROTECTION
AND LOVE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.

338
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,750
IT'S THE USUAL MANTRA
FOR THE BIG GUY.

339
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,291
- DOES IT WORK?
- THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

340
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,083
- WONDERFUL MANTRA
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

341
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,500
- BELIEVERS WILL BE
REDEEMED IN THE END.

342
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,250
- OKEY-DOKEY THEN.

343
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
SHALL WE BEGIN?

344
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,833
- OKAY, LET'S GET IN THE GAME.

345
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,125
- ( thinking ) HE'S GOOD.
THAT'S PRECISE SHOOTING.

346
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,791
I KNEW HE WAS
NO ORDINARY PRIEST.

347
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,750
- ( whirrs )

348
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,250
- I'LL GET IT!
( clicks )

349
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,291
HUH?!

350
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,083
DAMN!
- ( laser blast )

351
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,583
- ( grunts, gasps )

352
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,125
- Please show
your I.D. number.

353
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,916
- LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY!

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,791
- Unable to confirm identity.
Conclusion: intruder.

355
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,791
- ( growls ) WOULD YOU
JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY?!

356
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,250
( groans )
THIS IS BAD!

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,833
- ( laser blasts )

358
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,625
- ( mutters )
NO NO NO--

359
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,708
HUH?

360
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,375
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

361
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,583
HUH?

362
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,791
HEY, VASH?

363
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,000
HE'S ALIVE.

364
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,958
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY!

365
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,583
- ( thinking )
YOU CAN STOP NOW.

366
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,166
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT
TO PROTECT.

367
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,666
- ( beeping )

368
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,083
- GOOD NIGHT.

369
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,333
( footsteps )

370
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,750
- WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

371
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,791
- DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME.

372
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,500
I'M ASKING WHAT YOU
DID BACK THERE.

373
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,416
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN GOD.
IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION.

374
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,416
- ( banging )
- WHAT'S THAT?!

375
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,791
- ( banging )

376
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,375
- OH NO, THERE'S MORE!

377
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,750
- HELLO? ARE THE TWO OF YOU
DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE?

378
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,125
CAN YOU HEAR US?

379
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,958
- IT'S US, MILLY AND MERYL.
WE'RE HERE TO SAVE YOU!

380
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,416
- Meryl: IF YOU'RE THERE,
GIVE US A SIGN.

381
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,166
- ( groaning )

382
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,791
- I THINK THEY'RE MAYBE...

383
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,291
- ...A LITTLE LATE, I'D SAY.
- ( yelps )

384
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,458
- ( snoring )

385
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,125
- Wolfwood: YOU CAN GET
OUT OF THE WORST

386
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,750
PREDICAMENTS IMAGINABLE,

387
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,625
JUST LIKE THEY SAY,
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

388
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,708
- I'D MUCH RATHER LEAD
AN UNEVENTFUL LIFE

389
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,458
IF IT WAS UP TO ME.

390
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,583
- YOU COULDN'T IF YOU TRIED.

391
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,875
- HUH?
- CAN I SIT HERE?

392
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,166
- HUH?
UH, YEAH, GO AHEAD.

393
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,083
- ( yawns )
- HUH?

394
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,625
- HEY, YOU'RE REALLY
COMFORTABLE.

395
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,125
- ( door shuts )

396
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,083
- UGH!

397
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,208
BOY, THAT GUY
SURE HAS A LOT OF NERVE.

398
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,791
ACTUALLY, HE REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE I KNOW.

399
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,041
- YEAH, ISN'T HE HORRIBLE?
I THINK WE SHOULD TELL HIM OFF!

400
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,458
YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.
- ( sighs )

401
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,458
- ( passengers grumbling )

402
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,083
- MM, MY BACK HURTS.

403
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,166
- THANKS A LOT FOR
ALL THE SUPPORT, VASH.

404
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,916
IT WAS A FUN
AND INTERESTING TRIP.

405
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,083
- YOU'RE LEAVING NOW?

406
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,916
- I GOTTA GET BACK
TO WORK, YOU KNOW.

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,291
- HEY, PREACHER MAN!
- ( all groaning )

408
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,958
- HERE!

409
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,833
- HEY, THANKS A LOT!

410
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,916
- DAMN, THAT THING'S HEAVY!

411
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
- THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS BECAUSE
IT'S SO FULL OF MERCY.

412
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,000
SEE YOU LATER!

413
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,541
TRY TO STAY OUT
OF TROUBLE, VASH.

414
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,958
EVERYONE AROUND YOU WILL BE
A WHOLE LOT HEALTHIER FOR IT.

415
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,916
AND WITH ANY LUCK,
WE'LL MEET AGAIN SOON.

416
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,541
MAY YOU ALL GO
WITH GOD, MY FRIENDS.

417
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,666
- HE WAS A STRANGE
AND UNUSUAL MAN.

418
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,000
- YEAH.

419
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,041
- AND THERE WENT WOLFWOOD.

420
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,208
OKAY, I THINK I'LL GO GET
SOMETHING YUMMY TO EAT!

421
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,333
- Milly: MMM,
THAT SOUNDS GOOD!

422
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,125
- Vash: BUT FIRST, I NEED YOU
TO RETURN THE MONEY I LENT YOU.

423
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,250
- Meryl: ALL RIGHT, ALREADY!
WE'LL GIVE IT BACK!

424
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,041
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO FIND US OR ANYTHING.

425
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,916
- ( theme music playing )

426
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,625
( singing in Japanese )

427
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,291
- Vash: I THINK I'D LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR SOMEBODY.

428
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,333
I THINK IT'S GOOD
IF YOU SMILE AT SOMEONE

429
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,166
AND THEY SMILE IN RETURN.

430
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,791
VOLUNTARY LOVE
ENCOURAGES PEOPLE

431
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,333
TO CREATE A SENSE
OF FRIENDLINESS.

432
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:30,208
LOVE THAT IS UNCONDITIONAL
GIVES US RESPECT AS PEOPLE.

433
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,250
HOWEVER, IT'S WRONG
TO FORCE LOVE

434
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,291
TO TRY TO KEEP IT ALIVE.

435
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,791
IT THE STRAIN GOES ON,

436
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,291
EVENTUALLY IT'LL BLOOM
INTO THE FLOWER CALLED LIE,

437
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:42,708
THE DECEPTIVELY THORNY FLOWER
THAT HURTS PEOPLE.
