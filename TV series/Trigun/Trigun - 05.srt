YOU'RE ACTING
AWFULLY CAUTIOUS.

IT'S OKAY.
HE'S DEAD.

IT'S HIM LYING THERE.

YOU REEK OF TOMATOES.

TRYING TO RUN AWAY,

46
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,000
IT GOT DUMPED ALL OVER ME.

47

ME FOR MY DRY CLEANING?

00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,333
HEY, WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE IN SUCH A RUSH?

56
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,833
COME ON, LET'S JUST
TALK IT OVER.

57
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,375
- WHO THE HECK ARE YOU, MISTER?

58
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,583
- OH, I GET SO EMBARRASSED
WHEN I HAVE INTRODUCE MYSELF.

59
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,875
BUT SINCE YOU ASKED,

60
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,375
I'M LIKE A HUNTER OF PEACE,

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,291
ONE WHO CHASES THE ELUSIVE
MAYFLY OF LOVE--

62
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,875
OR, WELL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

63
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,500
- ( gasping )

64
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,875
- I'LL KILL HIM MYSELF!
- ARE YOU INSANE?

65
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,125
DO YOU WANT TO DIE, STUPID?
HE JUST SHOT US ALL.

66
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,916
NEXT TIME, HE MIGHT
USE REAL BULLETS.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,125
- IT'S OKAY.  SHOOT IF YOU WANT.
TRY YOUR LUCK.

68
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,958
- ( screaming )
- NO, WAIT! DON'T PROVOKE HIM!

69
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,541
- I'M GONNA CLAW YOUR
FRICKIN' HEAD OFF--

70
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,083
- ( both scream )
- ( gun clicks )

71
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,291
- HUH?
- GIVE IT UP.

72
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,833
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THIS GUY,

73
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,250
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE USED UP
ALL YOUR BULLETS ALREADY.

74
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,958
- ( gasps )

75
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,500
- ( wind rushes )
- Robber: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

76
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,958
HOW COULD YOU TELL?
- Vash: I COUNTED.

77
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,166
GEE, I REALLY HOPE
IT'S NOT COLD OUTSIDE FOR THEM.

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,958
- HMM? ( laughs )

79
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,416
- HERE'S YOUR GUN, PARTNER.
IT REALLY HELPED.

80
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,083
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- AHH.

81
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,041
( sighs )

82
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,791
- Old Man: THAT WAS
QUITE IMPRESSIVE, YOUNG MAN.

83
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,375
A DANGEROUS SITUATION,

84
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,833
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
SURVIVED LIKE THAT

85
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,625
WITHOUT SHOOTING ANYONE?
- 'CAUSE IT'S TOO WASTEFUL.

86
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,708
AFTER ALL, I CAN COME INTO
A RESTAURANT LIKE THIS

87
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,291
AND ORDER AN ENTIRE
STACK OF PANCAKES

88
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,291
FOR THE PRICE
OF ONE SILLY BULLET.

89
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,000
- YOU ARE A STRANGE ONE.

90
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,041
IT SEEMS VERY ODD THAT YOU 
CONSIDER YOURSELF A GUNMAN.

91
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,375
- ( muffled )
YOU GOT A POINT THERE.

92
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,041
( laughs )

93
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,708
- ( laughs )

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,583
- ( gun clicks )

95
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,291
- ( Vash laughs )
- I'M VERY SORRY.

96
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,041
- HUH?

97
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,791
- ( clicks )
- I REALLY HATE TO DO THIS, SON.

98
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,583
BUT YOU ARE MR. VASH
THE STAMPEDE, AREN'T YOU?

99
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,583
- UH...
- I AM SORRY.

100
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,000
PLEASE DIE
WITHOUT A FUSS, OKAY?

101
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,041
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,
MR. VASH, SIR.

102
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,083
- HEY, NO BIGGIE.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,500
- ( wind rushes )

104
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,750
- Milly: OH MY GOSH.

105
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,000
HALF THE CITY
IS BURIED IN SAND.

106
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,958
- Meryl: THEIR PLANT
PROBABLY BROKE DOWN 

107
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,083
AND STOPPED WORKING.

108
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
- WELL, THEN,
THEY SHOULD FIX IT.

109
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,833
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

110
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,083
HOW MUCH REPAIRS TO
A PLANT THAT SIZE CAN COST?

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,375
- WHY? IS IT EXPENSIVE?

112
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,375
- ( sighs )
- ( both gasp )

113
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,291
- ( explosions )
- ( sirens wail )

114
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,083
- Milly: THIS TIME, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

115
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,416
- ( sighs )

116
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,833
- YOU'RE SMILING.

117
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,666
- HUH? I AM NOT SMILING.

118
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,375
NOW WE HAVE TO GO RUN
RISK PREVENTION

119
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,708
AND GET THIS DOCUMENTED.

120
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,833
THIS TIME, WE WILL FIND
THE REAL VASH THE STAMPEDE

121
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,583
AND BRING ABOUT
HIS DOWNFALL.

122
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,125
- ( screams )

123
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,666
AAH!
CAN THIS BE THE END?!

124
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,250
( grunts )

125
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,875
- Man: THERE HE IS!
IN HERE!

126
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,875
GET HIM!  SHOOT HIM!
- OH CRAP!

127
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,416
- ( gunfire )
- THERE HE GOES.

128
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,625
- DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.

129
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,875
- THAT'S HIM!
WE'VE GOT YOU NOW.

130
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,083
- OH, REALLY?  DO YOU MEAN ME?

131
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,916
- ( gunfire )
- ( screams )

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,500
NOT AGAIN! WOAHHH!

133
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,000
OWW! OOH! AH!
- Man #2: WHERE'D HE GO?

134
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,875
THAT BASTARD!
- Man #3: SHOOT HIM!

135
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,125
- ( gunfire continues )
- EVERYONE'S SO BUSY TODAY.

136
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,708
- ( meows )

137
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,333
- <i>MAMAN,</i> WHY DOES THIS
KEEP HAPPENING TO ME? 

138
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,291
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG,
BUT I'M ALWAYS IN TROUBLE

139
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,750
AND EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS
PICKING ON ME.

140
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,375
WHAT DO I DO, <i>MAMAN?</i>

141
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,750
( blows )

142
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,375
WHY AM I CRYING IN FRENCH?

143
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,208
HMM?
( screams )

144
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,916
- ( bell rings )
- IT'S HIM!

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,458
HE'S UP THERE.

146
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,875
- HE'S ALL MINE!

147
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,333
- GET ME OUT OF HERE!

148
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,416
- ( banging )
- Milly: UH-OH.

149
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,250
LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE GETTING
PRETTY HEATED UP DOWN THERE. 

150
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,625
- WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING

151
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,291
BEFORE THE ENTIRE CITY
AND EVERYONE IN IT

152
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,458
IS BLOWN AWAY.

153
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,958
BUT IF THEY'RE
THIS AGITATED,

154
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,291
I WONDER IF...

155
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,250
IT REALLY MIGHT BE HIM.

156
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,000
LET'S STOP THIS NOW.
COME ON.

157
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,208
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, MERYL.
COME BACK.

158
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,958
MERYL!

159
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,750
- ( shouts )
- ( rumbling )

160
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,750
- ( man screams )

161
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,458
MY ARM HURTS SO BAD!
- ( girls scream )

162
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,958
- I CAN'T STAND IT!

163
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,583
- ( gunfire )
- WHOSE IDEA WAS IT

164
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,875
TO USE THE GRENADE?

165
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
HE CAN'T BE IDENTIFIED
FOR THE REWARD

166
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,333
IF HE'S A PILE OF PULP,
YOU DUMB ASS!

167
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,500
- THIS IS BAD.
PEOPLE OUT OF CONTROL,

168
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,291
COMPLETE MAYHEM...
- ( growls )

169
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,041
- ATTENTION! EXCUSE ME!

170
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,916
- IF YOU'D JUST
LISTEN FOR A MOMENT!

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,958
I'M VERY SORRY 
TO DISTURB YOU.

172
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,375
MY NAME IS MERYL STRYFE

173
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,333
FROM THE BERNADELLI
INSURANCE SOCIETY. 

174
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,125
AND I AM HERE TO SAY--
- ( rumbling )

175
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,750
- ( screams )
THE MAN YOU'RE ALL AFTER,

176
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,583
THE ONE WHOSE NAME
IS VASH THE STAMPEDE,

177
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,416
IS A VERY DANGEROUS MAN.

178
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,083
IN ORDER TO PROTECT
YOUR PRECIOUS LIVES

179
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,583
AND ALL OF YOUR VALUABLE
POSSESSIONS

180
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,375
FROM ANY FURTHER HARM...
- ( chimes play )

181
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,625
- ( Man through P.A. ):
THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM

182
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,000
MISSION CONTROL.
TEMPORARILY SUSPEND ALL PURSUIT

183
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,625
OF VASH THE STAMPEDE.

184
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,750
EVERYBODY PROCEED
TO BASE AT ONCE. 

185
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,125
- UH, TEMPORARILY?!

186
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,625
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH THEM?

187
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,583
STOP ALL PURSUIT NOW!

188
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,791
- ( chattering )

189
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW, CHAIRMAN?

190
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,583
THE DAMAGE AND CASUALTIES

191
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,375
ARE JUST GETTING WORSE
BY THE MOMENT.

192
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,166
- ( groans )
I CANNOT BELIEVE

193
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,416
WE STILL HAVEN'T
CAUGHT THIS GUY 

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,833
AFTER FOUR HOURS
OF FIGHTING.

195
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,416
- CAUGHT HIM?
THE GUY'S IMPOSSIBLE.

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,375
HE'S MANAGED TO RUN AWAY WITHOUT
RETURNING A SINGLE BULLET.

197
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,083
- HE'S JUST TOO GOOD FOR US.

198
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,583
IF WE MAKE HIM MAD,
THERE'S NO TELLING...

199
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,208
- CHAIRMAN, PERHAPS
WE SHOULD STOP THIS

200
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,583
WHILE THE CITY
IS STILL STANDING.

201
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,583
- Meryl: THAT GOES
WITHOUT SAYING.

202
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,666
- HUH?

203
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,208
- WHERE CAN I FIND
THE MAN IN CHARGE?

204
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,250
I NEED TO SPEAK TO HIM.

205
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,583
- AND JUST WHO ARE
YOU PEOPLE?

206
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,000
- LET ME SEE
THE MAN IN CHARGE!

207
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,583
- ( rumbling )
- ( meows )

208
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
- Meryl: HOW CAN YOU ALLOW
THIS TO HAPPEN?

209
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,416
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,208
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY TAKE OUT
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON

211
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,125
NO MATTER HOW MANY THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE YOU SET ON HIM.

212
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,750
- UH, YES, I KNOW THAT
THE RISK IS VERY HIGH.

213
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,916
BUT, MISS,
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,375
THAT WE REALLY NEED
THAT 60,000,000,000$$.

215
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,083
- IT'S FOR THE PLANT.
ISN'T IT?

216
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,416
- Chairman: THAT'S RIGHT.

217
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,458
BECAUSE OF A SUPPORT SYSTEM BUG,

218
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,083
OVER HALF OF THE PLANT
IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.

219
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,916
- BUT IF YOU MESS
WITH MR. VASH

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,333
AND THE ENTIRE CITY
GETS WRECKED,

221
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,583
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE

222
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,125
THAN JUST THE PLANT
TO WORRY ABOUT.

223
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,916
- Chairman: OH NO.
- HUH?

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,083
- IT MAY ALREADY
BE TOO LATE.

225
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,166
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,375
SO THAT'S WHEN I CALLED IN
OUR LAST RESORT.

227
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,625
- AND, SIR, JUST WHAT IS
OUR LAST RESORT?

228
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,916
- ( sighs )
THAT.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,958
- Girls: "THAT"?

230
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,333
- ( rumbling )
- ( deep grunting )

231
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,666
( sputters )

232
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,041
( whistles )

233
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,041
- ( gasps )

234
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,833
- IT'S OVER.
IT'S ALL OVER.

235
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,583
- ( screaming )

236
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,250
- ( cries )

237
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,750
- CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHO OR WHAT THAT IS?

238
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,458
- IT'S THE NEBRASKA FAMILY.

239
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,500
- ( cries )
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S THE IDIOT

240
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,458
THAT PARKED THIS CAR HERE?

241
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,583
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE
MY SON TRIP, OR WHAT? 

242
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,833
LOOK, YOU HURT HIM!

243
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,208
MOVE IT NOW, YOU DUMB,
IGNORANT DRIVERS.

244
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,500
- LET ME BORROW THAT THING
RIGHT NOW!

245
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,875
- NEBRASKA FAMILY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

246
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,500
BOTH OF YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE SERVING

247
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
A JAIL TERM
OF 700 YEARS.

248
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,916
- SHUT YOUR STINKING TRAP!

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,625
WE RELEASED OURSELVES YESTERDAY
AT OUR OWN DISCRETION.

250
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,125
- THAT-- THAT IS CALLED
A JAILBREAK!

251
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,333
- ( snickers )
GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.

252
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
AND I WAS GETTING QUITE
FOND OF THE QUIET LIFE.

253
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,833
BUT THEN AGAIN, 
WHO CAN LIE IDLE

254
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,333
KNOWING THAT 60,000,000,000$$
IS THERE FOR THE TAKING?

255
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,416
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GOFSEF?

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,916
- ( sputters, whistles )

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,041
- THE INFAMOUS
NEBRASKA FAMILY,

258
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,375
CONVICTED FELONS OF OVER
150 CLASS-A OFFENSES AND...

259
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,416
( gasps )

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,750
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT

261
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,625
GONNA SICK THAT BIG OAF
ON VASH THE STAMPEDE NOW?

262
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,416
- WELL, IT SEEMED LIKE
A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME.

263
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,916
- OH! I'M SICK OF THIS!

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
WHY DOES EVERY SITUATION
WE RUN INTO

265
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,541
TAKE THE WORST POSSIBLE TURN?
I CAN'T STAND IT...

266
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,708
ANYMORE!

267
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,375
- Girl: WE CAUGHT
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

268
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,708
- HUH?
- DOWN HERE.

269
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,958
I SAID WE CAUGHT
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

270
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,208
- EH?
-  LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

271
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,208
WE CAUGHT
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

272
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,500
- DO YOU MEAN
YOU REALLY CAUGHT HIM?

273
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,958
- ( running footsteps )

274
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,416
( panting )

275
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,291
WELL, MAYBE THEY'VE DECIDED
TO GIVE UP, AFTER ALL.

276
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,083
HUH?

277
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
( extravagant sigh )

278
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,791
I'M ALIVE!

279
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,791
- ( gun clicks )
- OH?

280
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,000
- DON'T MOVE, MR. VASH.

281
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,375
- HUH? UH-OH.
- ( guns click )

282
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,833
- HEY, SANDY, GO TELL CONTROL
THAT WE'VE CAUGHT HIM.

283
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,291
WE'VE CAUGHT VASH THE STAMPEDE.
TELL THEM TO HURRY.

284
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,375
- RIGHT.
- BE QUICK NOW.

285
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,875
- ( door closes )

286
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,250
- BOUNTY HUNTERS IN APRONS?
- HUH?

287
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,166
- WOULDN'T WANT CHILDREN
TO SEE THIS.

288
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,500
- ( gasping )

289
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,208
- THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T
WANT THEM TO SEE THIS!

290
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,583
BUT WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
WE DESPERATELY NEED MONEY.

291
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,791
I HAVE A SON
LYING SICK AT HOME,

292
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,916
BUT THE TOWN DOCTOR
DECIDED TO TAKE OFF

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
AND ABANDON
THIS DYING CITY.

294
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,250
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BOY.

295
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,291
I CAN'T JUST STAND BACK
AND WAIT.

296
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,250
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT
TO HELP HIM HERE.

297
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,416
THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY I--

298
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,708
- THE PEOPLE, THE LAND,
EVERYTHING WENT WRONG

299
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,791
AFTER THE PLANT MALFUNCTIONED.

300
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,458
- BUT NOT EVERYONE
IS RICH ENOUGH

301
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,041
TO LEAVE THIS DAMNED CITY.

302
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,916
- WE NEED MONEY TO CALL
THE ENGINEERS TO FIX THE PLANT.

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,250
UNLESS IT'S REPAIRED, 
THIS CITY IS FINISHED!

304
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,333
ALONG WITH EVERYONE IN IT.

305
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,583
- ONLY ONE PERSON HAS TO DIE
TO SAVE THIS CITY.

306
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,000
SO PLEASE, MR. VASH,
GIVE YOURSELF UP.

307
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,625
HUH? PLEASE DON'T MOVE.

308
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,583
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION
BETTER THAN YOU KNOW.

309
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,083
HOWEVER...

310
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,125
- NO, PLEASE, SIR.

311
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,791
DON'T DO THAT.
( gasps )

312
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,833
- UNTIL I SEE THIS
MAN YOU'RE AFTER, 

313
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:42,125
I HAVE NO CHOICE,
BUT TO KEEP MOVING.

314
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,125
- ( ragged breathing )

315
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,583
- NOW PLEASE,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,

316
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,958
DON'T SHOOT THAT GUN.

317
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,958
- ( rumbling )

318
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,458
- ( rattling )

319
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,583
- ( women gasp )
- EVERYBODY GET DOWN!

320
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,958
- ( gasping )

321
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,583
- ( screaming )

322
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,708
- OVER THERE.
- RIGHT, I SEE IT.

323
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,125
- VASH THE STAMPEDE 
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

324
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,916
- BINGO!

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,916
THAT WAS SO EASY,
ALMOST TOO EASY. 

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,458
ARE YOU DONE
AFTER ONLY ONE SHOT?

327
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,625
- ( laughs )
- THAT'S FUNNY.

328
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,208
THAT IS SO FUNNY.
( laughs )

329
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,666
- ( whirring )

330
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,541
- ( townspeople gasp )
- ( grunts )

331
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,250
- ( people mutter )
- BUT WHERE'S VASH THE STAMPEDE?

332
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,291
- UGH!

333
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,583
- HA! HUH?

334
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,333
WHAT THE HELL?!

335
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,041
OH?

336
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,125
- ( gasps )

337
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,625
( gasping )

338
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,041
- THAT'S HIM,
THE DEVIL'S HELPER

339
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,583
WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY REDUCED

340
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,916
A CITY OF 1,000,000 PEOPLE
TO ASHES.

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,166
THE LEGENDARY OUTLAW
VASH THE STAMPEDE

342
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,125
IS JUST OVER THAT HILL.

343
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,416
( gasps )

344
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,583
THAT--

345
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,958
THAT CAN'T--

346
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,500
NO WAY!

347
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,208
- ( snickers )
MY MY, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

348
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,083
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

349
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,500
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

350
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,750
THEY MUST KNOW
THAT MAN CAN'T BE HIM.

351
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,333
VASH THE STAMPEDE
IS A HORRIBLE FIEND.

352
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,458
IF YOU GET IN HIS WAY,
HE CAN DESTROY CITIES.

353
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,666
AND HE CAN GET OUT OF
THE WORST SITUATIONS IMAGINABLE.

354
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,958
EVEN IF HE'S UP AGAINST
1,000 MEN,

355
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,666
HE'D FIND A WAY TO EMERGE
WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

356
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,333
THAT-- THAT'S WHO--

357
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,333
- Nebraska: WHAT NOW,
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

358
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,875
- ( gasps )

359
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,250
THAT'S HIM.

360
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,166
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

361
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BUDDY BOY?

362
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,166
ARE YOU CHICKENING OUT? HUH?!

363
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,958
HMM?

364
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,583
HMM, WELL, AREN'T YOU
A NICE GUY?

365
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,625
HEY, TIME'S UP,
WONDER BOY.

366
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,958
THROW THE FEAR OF DEATH
INTO HIM, GOFSEF,

367
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,666
- ( grunts )

368
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,958
- ( gasps )
- ( Gofsef roars )

369
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,958
- ( loud bang )
- MOMMY!

370
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,375
- CHAIRMAN, THAT DAMN
NEBRASKA'S A LOOSE CANNON.

371
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,458
- ( frightened muttering )
- I'M SORRY.

372
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,958
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO GET HURT.

373
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,458
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

374
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,416
- ( laughs )

375
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,458
HUH?

376
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,041
- ( sighing )

377
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,000
- WHOA.

378
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOTH
ARE STILL ALIVE AND WELL!

379
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,916
I WAS KIND OF HOPING

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,541
YOU'D DITCH THE WOMAN
AND SAVE YOUR OWN SKIN.

381
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,916
- VASH, WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HE ISN'T THAT KIND OF PERSON.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,958
- ( gasps )

383
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,250
COME TO THINK OF IT...

384
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,041
- Nebraska: SO YOU WON'T KILL
NO MATTER WHAT, HUH?

385
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,333
YOU ARE DISGUSTING! 
YOU KNOW WHAT, VASH?

386
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,375
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A DAMN HYPOCRITE! 

387
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,750
THERE'S NO WAY YOU 
HAVEN'T HAD TO KILL

388
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,083
TROUBLEMAKERS
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.

389
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,958
HOW DO I KNOW?

390
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,708
BECAUSE NOBODY COULD SURVIVE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

391
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,208
WITHOUT HURTING SOMEBODY.

392
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,750
THE 60,000,000,000$$
BOUNTY ON YOUR HEAD

393
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,666
IS PROOF OF THAT.

394
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,916
WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF,

395
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,458
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

396
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,250
- WHY WON'T HE SAY ANYTHING?

397
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,250
- WHY IS HE JUST
STANDING THERE, 

398
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,791
TAKING THAT KIND OF ABUSE?

399
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,208
- HMM.

400
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,791
HMM?

401
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,833
YOU'RE FINALLY READY
TO FIGHT, ARE YOU?

402
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,083
OH, SO YOU WANT TO DRAW?

403
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,750
IT'S POINTLESS NO MATTER
WHAT CALIBER PISTOL YOU USE,

404
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,000
LIKE TRYING TO STOP A CAR

405
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,583
FROM RAMMING AT
120 ILES AN HOUR.

406
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,250
YOU FELT IT TWICE ALREADY.

407
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,916
EVEN YOUR PUNY BRAIN
CAN REALIZE

408
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,041
MY SON'S FIST IS A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH

409
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,333
OR DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU'LL SURVIVE ANOTHER ONE?

410
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,833
THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE TO RUN.

411
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,041
ALTHOUGH, NO MATTER
HOW FAST YOU ARE,

412
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,166
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES,

413
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,958
YOU'LL BE SMASHED
INTO TINY PIECES.

414
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,250
( laughs )

415
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,833
NOW PAY ATTENTION
BECAUSE AS A COURTESY,

416
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
I'M GOING TO LECTURE YOU
ON JUST

417
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,083
WHAT A STUPID FOOL
YOU REALLY ARE,

418
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,583
USING THIS TECHNIQUE.

419
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,416
MY HUMAN MINCEMEAT
SPECIAL COURSE!

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,458
( laughs ) 
- ( gasps )

421
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,958
- GO HELP THEM, QUICK.

422
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,791
ENJOY BEING A HERO
FOR A MOMENT.

423
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,958
THEN DIE IN A MOST
HUMILIATING WAY.

424
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,125
- ( grunts )

425
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,291
- ( heartbeats )
- ( silent )

426
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,125
( silent )

427
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,583
- ( heartbeats continue )

428
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,000
- ( heartbeats increase )

429
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:06,416
- ( Gofsef grunts )
- ( gunshots )

430
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,458
- ( Gofsef screams )

431
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,833
- OH.
- HE DID IT.

432
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,125
- AH.
- IT CHANGED COURSE.

433
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,625
- THAT WAS GREAT.

434
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,125
- ( blubbers )
- ( strangled scream )

435
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,916
HE CAUSED MY SON'S FIST
TO VEER OFF COURSE

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,583
WITH SIX LITTLE BULLETS!
- NOT QUITE, DOC.

437
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,791
I HAVE ONE LEFT.

438
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,458
COULD BE MY SPECIAL ONE.

439
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,333
- ( screams )

440
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,000
- ( gunshot )

441
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,708
- ( groans )

442
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,750
( blubbers )
- MY BABY! ( cries )

443
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,916
- ( shouting )
- Woman: GET OUT OF THE WAY!

444
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,750
- ( muttering )

445
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,750
- WHOA.

446
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
DID YOU SEE WHAT HE DID?

447
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,708
HE REALLY BEAT HIM.

448
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,625
AND HE DID IT WITH
ONLY SIX BULLETS.

449
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,916
UNBELIEVABLE.

450
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,708
- Meryl: SUDDENLY,
IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR TO ME

451
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,791
WHY HE IS CALLED
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON.

452
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,458
IT'S ACTUALLY HIM.

453
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,250
HE'S FOR REAL.
THE LEGENDARY OUTLAW,

454
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,791
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

455
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,333
- Tonis: YOU'RE AMAZING.

456
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,833
- ( both laughs )

457
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,958
- THAT'S NICE OF YOU GUYS
TO SAY THAT,

458
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,083
BUT I'M NO MORE AMAZING
THAN YOU ARE.

459
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,041
- IT AIN'T OVER YET!
- ( gun cocks )

460
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
- ( popping )
- WHAT?

461
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,041
WHAT THE--

462
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,750
- THAT'S TWICE
YOU'VE SAVED ME TODAY.

463
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,166
- ( chuckles )
- Nebraska: DIE!

464
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,291
DON'T--
DON'T IGNORE ME, YOU!

465
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,416
DON'T-- DON'T THINK--

466
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,083
DON'T THINK YOU WON
EVEN FOR A SECOND. 

467
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,250
- LET'S CALL IT QUITS ALREADY.
- HUH?

468
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,708
- AFTER ALL NOW,
THIS LAND IS MADE OF

469
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,416
LOVE AND PEACE!

470
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,541
- HUH?

471
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,041
- HUH?
