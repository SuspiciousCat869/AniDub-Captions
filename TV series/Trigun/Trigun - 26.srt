1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,916
- ( wind blowing )

3
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,291
- Knives: VASH.

4
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,250
VASH!

5
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,041
- ( groans )

6
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,375
- COME ON, VASH.
STAND UP, ALREADY.

7
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,125
- ( grunts )
- LET'S GO.

8
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,875
HEY!  DON'T BE THAT WAY.

9
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,750
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME HERE.

10
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,208
WE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY
TO ACT LIKE BROTHERS.

11
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,666
- MURDERER!
YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE!

12
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,625
YOU KILLED REM, THE CREW!

13
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,458
YOU KILLED THEM ALL!

14
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,250
- ( chuckles )
YEAH.  SPECTACULAR, HUH?

15
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,916
THEY ALL DIE,

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,250
EXCEPT OF COURSE FOR THE
FRACTION WHO WILL SURVIVE

17
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,166
BECAUSE OF REM'S
INCESSANT MEDDLING.

18
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,291
- Vash: WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,791
- THERE'S NO USE STAYING HERE.
COME ON.

20
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,833
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
JUST LAY THERE

21
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,083
AND CRY YOUR LITTLE EYES OUT?

22
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,833
THIS IS
A TERRIBLE ENVIRONMENT,

23
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,416
JUST AS I PREDICTED
IT WOULD BE.

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,541
IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANY GARBAGE TO LIVE HERE.

25
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,916
- Vash: IT CAN STILL WORK OUT
IF THEY HAVE THE PLANTS.

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,250
- YEAH, PROBABLY.
THEY'LL SURVIVE

27
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
BY LEECHING OFF
THE BLOOD OF OUR SIBLINGS,

28
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,250
GORGING THEMSELVES
LIKE PARASITES.

29
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,416
I CAN HEAR THE SCREAMS
OF OUR BRETHREN NOW.

30
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,666
THE ANGUISHED DEATH CRIES
OF OUR FRIENDS.

31
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,166
- IS THAT WHY YOU KILL PEOPLE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,500
I KILL SPIDERS TO SAVE
THE BUTTERFLIES.

33
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,166
IT'S SIMPLE LOGIC.

34
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,083
- ( breathing heavily )

35
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,250
Vash's voice:
DON'T FORGET-- HE KILLED THEM.

36
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,125
THAT'S RIGHT, HE KILLED...

37
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,583
( grunts )
REM, HELP.

38
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,666
- NO ONE EVER HAS THE RIGHT
TO TAKE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.

39
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,125
- ( crying )

40
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,458
HUH?
- Knives: VASH!

41
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,500
COME ON, HURRY UP!
LET'S GET GOING!

42
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,333
- ( water running )

43
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,208
- ( breathing heavily )

44
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,625
 ( gulps, yells )
- HEY!

45
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,083
- ( people shouting )

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,208
- THAT IS THE TRUE NATURE
OF THESE PATHETIC BEASTS

47
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,416
KNOWN AS HUMANS.

48
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,041
THEY'RE ALL SELFISH,
ARROGANT, INSOLENT,

49
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,083
GROSSLY IMPERFECT ORGANISMS.

50
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,583
THEY MAKE ME SICK
TO MY STOMACH.

51
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,583
- ( humming )

52
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,666
- ( people screaming )

53
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,583
- Vash: WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

54
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,625
- ( grunts )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,250
- WHEN YOU AND I WERE BORN,
WE HAD FREE WILL.

56
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,333
WE'RE NO LONGER MERELY THINGS
TO BE USED BY HUMANS.

57
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
- Vash's voice:
WHAT IS HE SAYING?

58
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,291
- ( wind blowing )

59
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,166
- ( Knives laughs )
I FOUND IT.

60
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
THE DAMAGE ISN'T ALL THAT BAD.

61
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,833
IT'S USEABLE.

62
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,500
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO WITH THIS?

63
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,541
- I HAVE TO GO AFTER
SOMETHING I LEFT BEHIND.

64
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR IT.

65
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,375
THIS MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE WHILE.
I SUGGEST YOU STAY HERE.

66
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,125
- BUT, KNIVES...

67
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,791
IT'S HARD TO BE ALONE.

68
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,625
I DON'T WANNA BE ALONE.
- ( footsteps )

69
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,166
- SOMEONE-- ( gasps )

70
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,458
KNIVES!
- ALL DONE.

71
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,541
- KNIVES!
( panting )

72
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,458
HEY, NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- ( explosion )

73
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,541
- ( yelps )

74
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,250
- ONLY A 13% OUTPUT.

75
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,166
THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN GET.

76
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,083
- WHA-- WHAT IS THAT?

77
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,125
- THESE ARE OUR NEW SIBLINGS,

78
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,916
AND THIS ONE WILL BE YOURS.

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,291
WE WILL USE THESE GUNS
TO DISPOSE OF MANKIND.

80
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,166
- ( gasps ) I--
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT!

81
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
- YES, YOU WILL!
- NEVER!

82
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,666
- THEN WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME
AND WAIT UNTIL I RETURNED?

83
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,083
BECAUSE YOU'RE HOPELESS ON
YOUR OWN. ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

84
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,750
- ( exhales sharply )
- VERY WELL, WATCH ME THEN.

85
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,166
- ( gasps )

86
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,208
DON'T!
- ( both grunting )

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,625
- ( gun cocks )

88
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,958
- AFTER 15 YEARS,
ARE YOU STILL SO AFFECTED

89
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,791
BY THAT RIDICULOUS NONSENSE?

90
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,791
THAT FANTASY WORLD
CREATED FOR YOU

91
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,083
BY THE WOMAN WHO LIVED
AND DIED BY CONTRADICTION?

92
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,375
- ( grunts )

93
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,625
I WON'T LET YOU KILL
ANY MORE PEOPLE!

94
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,291
- SORRY, DEAR BROTHER,

95
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,333
I THINK
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME.

96
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,625
YOU'RE AIMING
AT THE WRONG PERSON.

97
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,083
- THEY'RE STILL ALIVE.  ALIVE.

98
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,166
I PROMISED REM THAT
WE WOULD MAKE THIS LAND--

99
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,916
- EXACTLY.  WE WILL.

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,166
YOU AND I WILL MAKE THIS LAND
INTO OUR VERY OWN EDEN.

101
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,583
JUST FOR US.

102
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,125
- Vash's voice:
IT'S WRONG.

103
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,416
THIS IS WRONG.

104
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,041
IT'S WRONG!
- ( gunshot )

105
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,375
- ( grunts )

106
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,041
MY LEG.

107
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,583
MY LEG, IT HURTS.  WHY?

108
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,208
WHY?

109
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,458
THERE'S SO MUCH PAIN
IN MY LEG!

110
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,916
DID YOU SHOOT ME?

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,041
DID YOU ACTUALLY SHOOT ME?

112
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,791
- ( breathing shakily )

113
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,541
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
DID YOU REALLY SHOOT ME?!

114
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,541
- ( yells )

115
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,708
( crying )
- NO!  WAIT!

116
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,000
VASH!
( screaming )

117
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,541
- R-- REM.

118
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,250
WHERE AM I?

119
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,625
- ( gunshot )

120
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,541
- ( beeping )

121
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
- ( gasps )

122
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,333
THIS MAN IS RELATED TO REM.

123
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,416
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

124
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,458
I HAVE TO TELL HIM ABOUT REM.

125
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,916
( gasps )

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,416
- HEY THERE, VASH.

127
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,625
- ( crying )

128
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,541
- NOW EVERYTHING THAT JOINED
YOU AND REM TOGETHER

129
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
IS FINALLY GONE.

130
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,583
- IS THAT YOUR EXCUSE
FOR KILLING?

131
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,625
- HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING
OVER THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS?

132
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,166
THE SCARS THEY CARVED
INTO YOUR BODY

133
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,625
WILL NEVER REGENERATE.

134
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,041
SYMBOLIC OF YOUR
FOOLISH WASTE OF ENERGY

135
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,208
ON THIS HUMAN GARBAGE.

136
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,916
- REGARDLESS OF HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM,

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,625
THEY ARE LIVING BEINGS.
THEY DESERVE TO LIVE!

138
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,458
- WHAT'S THE USE OF GROWING UP

139
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,750
IF THE ONLY THING THAT GROWS IS
YOUR USELESS SENTIMENTALISM?

140
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,416
YOU'RE STILL
A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

141
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,625
PATHETIC WIMP! 
- ( gun cocks )

142
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,083
- ( grunts )

143
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958
( whimpering )

144
00:10:58,916 --> 00:10:59,916
- ( snaps )

145
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,250
- ( crackling )

146
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,458
- WHAT-- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

147
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,375
- THIS IS OUR GIFT, BROTHER.

148
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,375
NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE OUT

149
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,083
THIS WORTHLESS HUMAN GARBAGE
FOREVER!

150
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,083
- AAH!

151
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,708
- ARE YOU GOING
TO SHOOT ME AGAIN?

152
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,166
- ( screaming, groaning )

153
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,958
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY
GONNA SHOOT ME AGAIN?!

154
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,583
HUH?!

155
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,916
MAKE VASH SUFFER.

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,333
MAKE HIM SUFFER
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

157
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
- I WILL, MY MASTER.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,208
I PROMISE THE MAN BELONGING
TO THIS ARM WILL SUFFER.

159
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,291
- NOW'S THE END OF
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

160
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,875
YOU AND THIS TOWN
DIE TOGETHER!

161
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,083
( grunts, groans )

162
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,208
- YOU'RE NAIVE.

163
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,875
HAD I BEEN SO INCLINED,

164
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,750
I COULD HAVE KILLED YOU
AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW.

165
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,583
- DID YOU KILL THEM OR NOT?

166
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,083
- DAMN, YOU ARE A NOISY ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

167
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,875
WHAT IF I DID, CHICKEN SHIT?

168
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,333
( groans )

169
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,208
( groans loudly )

170
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,083
- COME ON.

171
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,041
I THINK YOU'RE DEAD.
READY?

172
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,875
- RUN!

173
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,333
- WHAT IS THAT?!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

174
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,541
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?!

175
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,916
- RUN!  RUN!

176
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,000
- IT SHOULD NEVER END THIS WAY.

177
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
- WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE
DO I HAVE

178
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,000
IF WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE?

179
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,125
OUR LIVES ARE
TOO DIFFERENT, VASH.

180
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,666
AND HE'S NOT ALONE.

181
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,500
- I FAILED.
I FAILED TO SAVE SOMEONE AGAIN.

182
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,458
- JUST BE MORE CAREFUL
THE NEXT TIME.

183
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,958
- COME ON, IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE.

184
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,458
YOU HAVE FREE WILL.

185
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,625
- Meryl and Mllly:
NO!  AAH!

186
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,750
- ( laughing )

187
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,708
( maniacal laughter )

188
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,041
THE HUMANS TREAT YOU WELL?

189
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,041
DID YOU HAVE FUN,
DEAR BROTHER?

190
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,666
- I DID, YEAH.

191
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,625
BEST THING THAT EVER
HAPPENED TO ME.

192
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,291
- ( rock music playing )

193
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,541
- ( gunshot )

194
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,625
- ( grunts )

195
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,750
( panting )

196
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,250
HEH.

197
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,541
- ( grunts )

198
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,000
- ( guns cock )

199
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,000
- ( breathing heavily )

200
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,500
AAH!

201
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,458
( groaning )

202
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,708
- HMM!

203
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,500
HE CANCELLED ME OUT.

204
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,291
I DIDN'T CREATE THESE WEAPONS
TO BE WASTED LIKE THAT.

205
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,500
- USING THEM THIS WAY IS
THE ONLY THING THAT

206
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,833
GIVES THEM ANY MEANING
AT ALL.

207
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,958
- IT'S HOPELESS, ISN'T IT?

208
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,416
- I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

209
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,666
- YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN BEING.

210
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,541
YOU'RE A PLANT.

211
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,958
- I KNOW THAT.

212
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,666
- YOU'RE A SUPERIOR BEING.

213
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,958
- I DISAGREE.

214
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,666
- YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT THIS, VASH.

215
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,916
- I WON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

216
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,791
( breathing heavily )

217
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,583
- ( breathing heavily )

218
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,750
- ( gun cocks )

219
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,041
- ( groans )

220
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,541
- HA.

221
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,541
- ( exhales )

222
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,958
- Wolfwood's voice: WHAT ARE
YOU DOING, NEEDLE NOGGIN?!

223
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,666
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
USE IT, DAMN IT!

224
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,708
- AAH.

225
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,750
( screams )

226
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,333
( groans loudly )

227
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,583
AAH!

228
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,750
- ( breathing heavily )

229
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
- ( groaning )

230
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,750
- I...

231
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,125
I WILL...

232
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,666
SURVIVE.

233
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,958
- ( rumbling )

234
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,583
- ( townspeople cheering )

235
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,541
- MERYL!

236
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,041
WATER!

237
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,875
WE HIT WATER!
- YEAH.

238
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,083
- ( laughs )

239
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,041
VASH WILL COME BACK,
WON'T HE?

240
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,458
- OF COURSE HE WILL.

241
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,583
HE WOULDN'T DARE KEEP
A GOOD WOMAN LIKE ME WAITING.

242
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,583
RIGHT?
- ( giggles ) RIGHT.

243
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,250
- REM...

244
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,916
I WILL CONTINUE
TO BELIEVE IN YOU.

245
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,166
BUT FROM NOW ON,

246
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,125
I'LL LOOK TO MY OWN WORDS
FOR GUIDANCE.

247
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,291
- ( end theme playing )

248
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,375
- ( singing in Japanese )
