- Milly: MERYL, LOOK!
- OH.

8
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:59,333
- Woman:
MERYL? MERYL?

9
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,541
MERYL, WAKE UP!

10
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,666
- OH, HI KAREN.

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,083
- INTERESTING MAKEUP JOB.
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR REST?

12
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,666
- ( laughs )

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,625
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
AROUND FOR SO LONG,

14
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,250
I GUESS I HAVEN'T QUITE
REGAINED MY LAND LEGS YET.

15
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,125
- IT MUST BE STRANGE
TO BE HOME.

16
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,958
AFTER ALL, MISS STRYFE,
YOU WITNESSED THE HOLE

17
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,875
BEING BURNED
INTO THE FIFTH MOON.

18
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,708
HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU LOOKED UP?

19
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,958
- THIS IS NOT SOME TOURIST
INTERVIEW, MARK. STOP IT!

20
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,333
YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO SPENT FIVE MONTHS

21
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,666
ON THE OUTSIDE, WORKING
WITH THE ULTRA DANGEROUS

22
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,458
MAN WHO'S BEEN LABELED
A HUMAN DISASTER.

23
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,583
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED TO HER OUT THERE,

24
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,375
IT'S A MIRACLE THAT
SHE CAME BACK ALIVE.

25
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,750
- Meryl: YES, BUT...
- Both: HMMM?

26
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,541
- ACTUALLY IT WASN'T
AS BAD AS ALL THAT.

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,583
SURE, IT GOT A LITTLE BIT
SCARY AT TIMES,

28
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,541
AND THERE WAS
SOME DANGER INVOLVED,

29
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,791
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,583
DESPITE HIS FRIGHTENING
AND AWFUL REPUTATION,

31
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,625
VASH TURNED OUT TO BE
MORE OF A REGULAR GUY

32
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,875
THAN YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

33
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,916
- REALITY CHECK, MERYL.
THAT ATTITUDE OF YOURS

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,666
GETS ALL OF THE ODDBALL JOBS,
WORKING WITH DANGEROUS SLIME.

35
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,916
IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE
SO COMPETENT AND WILLING,

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,958
BUT IF YOU KEEP RISKING
YOUR LIFE OUT THERE,

37
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,916
I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL
EVER ACHIEVE WOMANLY HAPPINESS!

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,375
- EXCUSE ME, IS THIS SOCIAL
TIME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?

39
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,041
- ( gulps )

40
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,916
- UH, GOOD MORNING.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, CHIEF!

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,458
- MERYL, WILL YOU PLEASE
STEP INTO MY OFFICE?

42
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,583
- UM, SIR?

43
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,500
- Both: HMM.
- Meryl: I HAVE TO WHAT?!

44
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,125
- HUH?
- MILLY?

45
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,833
MILLY, WHERE ARE YOU?

46
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,833
- I'M OUT HERE.
GOOD MORNING, MERYL.

47
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,583
- ( groans ) WHAT HAVE YOU
GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO NOW?

48
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,708
- I'M BEING PUNISHED
FOR COMING IN LATE

49
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,958
FOR WORK 20 TIMES IN A ROW.

50
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,791
- WHY DO I EXPECT HER
TO CHANGE? I'M DREAMING.

51
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,291
GUESS WHAT?
WE GOT ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT TODAY.

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,750
VASH THE STAMPEDE SHOWED
UP IN LITTLE JERSEY

53
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,166
AND WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES QUALIFIED.

54
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,875
WE LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.
- YAY, THEN IT'S REALLY TRUE?

55
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,916
VASH IS STILL ALIVE? DOESN'T
THAT MAKE YOU INCREDIBLY HAPPY?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,958
- HMMM-- OOOH!

57
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT.

58
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,750
OUR JOBS ARE
ON THE LINE HERE, MILLY.

59
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,791
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM THIS TIME

60
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,458
BEFORE HE STIRS UP
TROUBLE AGAIN.

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,750
NOW COME ON, YOU'RE WASTING
TIME. LET'S GET GOING.

62
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,583
- WAIT. HOLD ON A
SECOND, MERYL.

63
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,250
AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE HASTY?
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

64
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,500
IF HE'S ALIVE, HE COULD HAVE
AT LEAST MENTIONED IT.

65
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,541
HE PROBABLY GETS A KICK OUT
OF MAKING PEOPLE BITE HIS DUST.

66
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,583
THAT BUM.

67
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,041
- Karen: MERYL!

68
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,291
- I'LL BRING YOU BACK AN
A.A.P. BAG AS A SOUVENIR!

69
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,666
SEE YOU LATER, KAREN!

70
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,541
- OH WELL.
IT'S NO USE.

71
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,458
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

72
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,166
I SUPPOSED THERE'S
JUST SOME GIRLS

73
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,125
WHO NEED TO RISK THEIR LIVES.

74
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,458
- IF YOU'RE DEAD, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

75
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,916
BUT IF YOU'RE ALIVE,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,541
I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU
FELLOWS WOULD SAY SOMETHING.

77
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,416
I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

78
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,541
- ( unison )
UH, GEE, BLESS YOU, MISTER.

79
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,041
- YEAH, I AM PRETTY DAMN
HAPPY TO BE ALIVE!

80
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,416
OH.
- ( gulping )

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,208
- WHY IS IT THAT I ALWAYS
RUN INTO SO MUCH TROUBLE

82
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,750
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND?

83
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,041
- ( laughs ) YOU'RE NOT A VERY
METHODICAL PERSON, ARE YOU?

84
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,083
NORMALLY WHEN
YOU BUY A USED BIKE,

85
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,458
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
REPAIR IT, YOU KNOW?

86
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,375
MAKE SURE IT'S IN DECENT
CONDITION BEFORE YOU DECIDE

87
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,416
TO TAKE IT OUT AND RIDE IT.

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,708
- ARE YOU DISSING MY BEAUTIFUL
SHINY ANGELINA II, VASH?

89
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,791
- ACTUALLY I'M DISSING YOU, NOT
YOUR STUPID BROKEN MOTORCYCLE.

90
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,000
- COME AGAIN, NEEDLE-NOGGIN?

91
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,625
- HEY, WHO YOU CALLIN'
NEEDLE-NOGGIN?

92
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,791
- I'D SAY IT'S
PRETTY DARN OBVIOUS.

93
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,833
- ( both shout )

94
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,333
( screaming )

95
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,958
- Wolfwood: NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, YOU IDIOT!

96
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,000
- OH, SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT, HUH?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

97
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,916
- SHUT UP BACK THERE
OR I'LL HAVE TO THROW YOU OUT!

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,708
- OH!
( both laugh )

99
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,958
YES SIR. WE'RE REALLY SORRY.
- ( groans )

100
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
ALL RIGHT, NOW WHERE
ARE YOU GUYS HEADED?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,375
- KANSAS!
- NEW OREGON!

102
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,041
- Both: HUH?
- ( growls ) NEW OREGON?

103
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,250
WE'RE GOING TO THE TOWN
WITH ALL THE DISAPPEARANCES

104
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,708
IN SOUTHERN CORNELIA.
- NO, I WANNA GO TO NEW OREGON!

105
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,416
IF YOU WANNA GO TO KANSAS,
GO THERE BY YOURSELF!

106
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
- WHAT DID YOU SAY? -
Driver: I SAID SHUT UP, YOU TWO!

107
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,083
- OH, WE'RE SORRY.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,375
- Meryl: THIS PLACE IS
REALLY FALLING APART.

109
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,333
- Man: THE LOCAL RIFFRAFF
WERE MAKING TROUBLE AS USUAL.

110
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,875
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS GUY
STEPPED IN TO HELP.

111
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,833
SEEMED LIKE A PRETTY
WELL-MEANING FELLA.

112
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,750
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT.

113
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,250
- ONCE AGAIN HE'S POKED
HIS NOSE INTO MORE TROUBLE.

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,750
HONESTLY, THAT MAN NEVER LEARNS.
- Milly: MERYL!

115
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,208
I JUST FOUND OUT WHERE VASH IS
AND THEY SAID HE'S OKAY.

116
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,375
- VASH?!

117
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,916
- YEP, THE ONE AND ONLY
HUMANOID TYPHOON.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,375
- HUH?
- HE CARRIES THE DUBIOUS TITLE

119
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,916
OF MANKIND'S FIRST
LOCALIZED HUMAN DISASTER.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,958
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WHEN I SAW HIM

121
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,083
HE WAS WEEPING AND EATING PILES
OF DONUTS AT THE SAME TIME!

122
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,250
JUST LIKE THIS!
- DONUTS ARE HIS FAVORITE FOOD.

123
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
- IT'S REALLY HIM?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,791
THIS NUTCASE IS ACTUALLY
THE LEGENDARY GUNMAN?

125
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,166
- SO WHERE DID YOU GET
YOUR INFORMATION, MILLY?

126
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,583
- OVER THE SATELLITE.
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

127
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
THE REPORT SAID THAT HE'S
HEADED FOR NEW OREGON

128
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,250
AT A SPEED OF 3,000
YARZ AN HOUR!

129
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,000
ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE?
HE CAN MOVE REALLY FAST.

130
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,583
- THAT'S A LITTLE MORE
INFORMATION THAN I NEEDED.

131
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,250
- YEAH, I KNOW.
AND ONE OF THE LOCALS

132
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,916
WAS EVEN RUNNING AROUND,
TELLING EVERYONE TO BE CAREFUL!

133
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,708
- Man:
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

134
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,958
- Man #2: THE DAY
BEFORE YESTERDAY

135
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,375
MOST OF THE POLO FAMILY
WENT OUT OF TOWN,

136
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,250
LEAVING NO ONE THERE
BUT THE FOURTH SON SLATER.

137
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,000
ALSO I FOUND THERE'S A SHUTTLE
THAT GOES TO NEW OREGON.

138
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,541
IT'S IDEAL. A CHANCE LIKE
THIS DOESN'T COME TWICE.

139
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,000
- I-- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

140
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,750
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.
- Others: HUH?

141
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,666
- I THINK WE ALL AGREE
THE POLO FAMILY

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,541
CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO HAVE
THEIR WAY ANY MORE.

143
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,208
HUH? AREN'T I RIGHT?
- RIGHT. WELL, SORT OF.

144
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,583
AT LEAST THIS TIME
WE'LL HAVE MR. LURALD

145
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,791
WITH US TO BACK US UP.

146
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,541
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
- THAT SETTLES IT THEN.

147
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,625
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS IT.

148
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,291
WE'LL MEET HERE AGAIN
AT SUNUP TOMORROW.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,958
- Man on P.A.:
Shut up and listen up!

150
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,083
Today, I'm going
to school you people.

151
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,416
Today's lesson is
about typhoons.

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,916
Since you probably
don't know, here I go.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,916
A typhoon is a little phenomenon
where the wind blows like crazy

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,583
and carries your houses
and kids off into the sky.

155
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,458
Her name is Jacqueline!
And this lovely young lady

156
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,791
has come to wipe you out!

157
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,833
- WHAT'S ALL THIS
ABOUT, MR. TYPHOON?

158
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,333
ARE YOU EXPECTING A RELATIVE
OF YOURS SOMETIME SOON?

159
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,500
- SO IS THAT
WHAT A TYPHOON IS?

160
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,791
A FURIOUS BEAUTY
WHO LEVELS ENTIRE CITIES

161
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,375
WITHOUT EVEN A WARNING?
HUH.

162
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,208
- HMM, A BEAUTY?

163
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,875
SOUNDS PRETTY TOUGH.
HUH?

164
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,125
HEY, BY THE WAY,

165
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,708
WHO'S PICKING UP THE TAB
FOR THIS LITTLE FOOD?

166
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,208
- YOU, OF COURSE.
- ME? WHY ME?

167
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,625
I WAS THE ONE
GRACIOUS ENOUGH

168
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,833
TO GIVE IN TO YOUR
STUPID WHINING

169
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,750
AND COME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO NEW OREGON!

170
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,416
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO THAT!

171
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,291
- ( growls ) NOW LISTEN UP,
THIS TOWN MAY LOOK PEACEFUL,

172
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,875
BUT THINGS ARE LIKELY TO GET
BLOODY AROUND HERE AT ANY TIME.

173
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,041
- UH?

174
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,458
- I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS,

175
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,333
BUT THE POLO AND FRIS FAMILIES
ARE STILL QUARRELLING

176
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,958
OVER THE RIGHTS
TO THE SATELLITE.

177
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,333
A GIRL WHO WAS A DISTANT
COUSIN OF THE FRIS FAMILY

178
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,916
WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.
IT'S A HIGH-STAKES FEUD.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,166
- ( sighs )
- MMM.

180
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,708
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

181
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,166
I DON'T WANT THIS TOWN TO TURN
INTO ANOTHER LITTLE JERSEY.

182
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,125
LET'S TAKE OFF
BEFORE IT'S DESTROYED.

183
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,375
- ( whimpering )
- HMM?

184
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,791
KNOCK IT OFF!

185
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458
- BUT DOESN'T THAT
STORY GET YOU UPSET?

186
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,125
WHY DO THINGS LIKE
THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN?

187
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
- IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S ANYTHING NEW.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,375
THIS KIND OF THING
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

189
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,916
EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL FOLK
WILL TAKE UP ARMS

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,791
IF SOMEONE HAPPENS TO THREATEN
OR KILL A FAMILY MEMBER.

191
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,041
BOTTOM LINE IS WE SHOULD GO
BEFORE WE GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

192
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,583
- MEOW MEOW.

193
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,000
- I ALWAYS HAD MY SUSPICIONS
THAT YOU WERE NO MERE MORTAL,

194
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,958
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED
YOU WERE ACTUALLY A CAT.

195
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,291
WAIT, WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING?
WHERE IS THAT IDIOT?

196
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
- SIR?
- ( chokes )

197
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,041
- ALTOGETHER YOUR MEAL
COMES TO EXACTLY $$30.

198
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,458
- PUT IT ON MY TAB?
- NO DICE.

199
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,750
- ( Wolfwood growls )
ROTTEN NEEDLE-NOGGIN!

200
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,583
- ( door opens )
- UH, MR. SLATER!

201
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,250
THERE'S A HICK OUTSIDE
ASKING TO BE LET IN, SIR.

202
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,625
SIR?

203
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,541
- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ANY
BEGGARS OR JOB HUNTERS.

204
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,125
JUST SEND HIM AWAY.

205
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,500
- Vash: A FRIEND OF
MINE WORKS HERE

206
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,875
AND I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

207
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,708
I JUST THOUGHT I'D DROP
BY TO SAY HI TO HIM.

208
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,291
- HEY! I DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD
COME IN HERE, STREET WORM.

209
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,541
- WHO ARE YOU HERE TO SEE?
- HIS NAME IS MAX SIMON!

210
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,208
- THAT OLD CODGER
ACTUALLY HAS FRIENDS?

211
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,125
GO AHEAD, ENTERTAIN HIM.
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS A LOT.

212
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,916
I APPRECIATE IT. BYE.
- ( sighs )

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,125
SURE ABOUT THIS, BOSS?

214
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,250
- DO I REALLY HAVE A CHOICE?

215
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,583
HE'S A FRIEND OF MAX'S

216
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,166
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO
START ANY TROUBLE NOW.

217
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,916
- Meryl:
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,375
WE DID THE RIGHT
THING TO SPLURGE

219
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,625
ON A ROOM IN SECOND-CLASS!

220
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,916
- YEAH, THE LAST TIME
WE RODE ONE OF THESE,

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,208
IT WAS FULL OF BANDITS.

222
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,916
THE WHOLE
EXPERIENCE WAS RUINED!

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
- IF WE RUN INTO HIM
IN NEW OREGON,

224
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,791
THINGS ARE GOING
TO GET REAL BUSY.

225
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,875
LET'S ENJOY THE PEACE
WHILE IT LASTS.

226
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,208
- I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE'RE GONNA GET DRAGGED

227
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,291
INTO TROUBLE AGAIN, HUH?

228
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,750
- ( both gargling )

229
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,000
- ( gunshots )
- ( both yelp )

230
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,416
- Man: BANDITS!

231
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,916
- HANDS IN THE AIR
AND MOUTHS SHUT!

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,583
YOU'D BETTER NOT
TRY ANYTHING FUNNY,

233
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,916
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,958
- ( both whimper )
NOT AGAIN!

235
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,458
- ( laughs )

236
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,708
I SUGGEST YOU ALL BEHAVE,
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES!

237
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,416
- ( grunts )

238
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,416
- MAKE THIS EASY ON
YOURSELF AND DON'T MOVE.

239
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,666
I PROMISE, YOU WON'T BE HARMED
IF YOU JUST COOPERATE.

240
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,625
- YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO STOP THIS RIGHT NOW

241
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,000
AND THE LAW WILL
BE MORE LENIENT.

242
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,041
- I GAVE UP MY LIFE
A LONG TIME AGO.

243
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,916
BESIDES, THERE'S A DAMN
GOOD REASON I'M DOING THIS

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,291
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE COST IS.

245
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,166
- ( gasps )

246
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,291
- WE'VE ALMOST
REACHED OUR DESTINATION!

247
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,166
- MAKE SURE YOU
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

248
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
- GOT IT!

249
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,041
- IF SHE WERE ALIVE, SHE'D BE
ABOUT YOUR AGE NOW, YOU KNOW?

250
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,750
- ( girls sigh )

251
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,375
- ( knocks )

252
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,875
- I'M NOT FINISHED
WITH THE FORECAST.

253
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,708
BEAT IT! LEAVE ME ALONE.

254
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,125
- I CAN SEE YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT, OLD MAN.

255
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,708
- VASH! IT'S BEEN
A VERY LONG TIME!

256
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,875
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE OLD SNAPPY OUTFIT?

257
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,375
- I GUESS I KIND OF WORE
IT OUT ON MY LAST JOB.

258
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,458
- ( laughs )
WELL, WELCOME BACK.

259
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,708
YOU ARE HERE ON BUSINESS

260
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,666
OR JUST COME TO PEEK
UP JACQUELINE'S DRESS?

261
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,416
HMM? HAS IT REALLY BEEN 10 YEARS
SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT, VASH?

262
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,416
- ( chuckles ) WHOA!
- ( crashing )

263
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,916
- OH!

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,416
WHAT WAS THAT?

265
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
- ( robbers yelling )
FIND THAT POLO SON!

266
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,500
- NO MERCY,
KILL ANYONE WHO RESISTS!

267
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,333
- ( panting )

268
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,041
WHERE IS HE?!
I WANT HIM!

269
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,833
- HOLY COW!
A MONSTER IDIOT

270
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,083
JUST CRASHED A SAND STEAMER
INTO MY EXALTED PLACE OF WORK!

271
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,416
I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE
FALLING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL,

272
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,250
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
- ( panting )

273
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,000
- HUH? MR. S?

274
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,708
- ( gunshots )
- ( screams )

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,666
- Wolfwood: PARDON ME,
COMING THROUGH.

276
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
EXCUSE ME, LADIES,
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

277
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,916
- ( shrieks )
- OOH, THIS IS BAD.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,041
LOOKS LIKE A RAID!

279
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,500
- P.A.: Citizens of New Oregon,
listen carefully.

280
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,708
The Fris family has seized
this satellite facility!

281
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,125
The injustice we have
suffered at the hands of the

282
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,166
greedy vicious Polos has
left us with no choice.

283
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,291
We have but one demand:

284
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,625
bring us the head
of the Polo family!

285
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,125
WE HAVE A GUEST WE THINK WILL
BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO HIM.

286
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,375
- Slater: Help me.
Somebody help me!

287
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,708
- ( thinks )
SO THAT'S HOW IT IS.

288
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,750
- P.A.: If our demands are
not met within three days,

289
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,375
I will not be able
to guarantee his safety.

290
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,875
- THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
IS IN NEO COLORADO.

291
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HE'LL NEVER
MAKE IT BACK WITHIN THREE DAYS.

292
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,333
ARE YOU GOING IN?

293
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,208
- YOU KNOW ME, MAX. IT'S JUST
MY NATURE. I HAVE TO DO IT.

294
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
- ALL RIGHT!
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

295
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,541
IS KILL POLO, USE JACQUELINE
FOR COVER, AND MAKE TRACKS.

296
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,916
PIECE OF CAKE.
- WHO'S JACQUELINE?

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,750
- IT'S THE NAME OF THE TYPHOON
WHICH IS HEADING FOR THIS TOWN,

298
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,958
AND IT'S COMING SOON,
LITTLE LADY.

299
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,833
- HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE REAL
STORM KIND OF TYPHOON.

300
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,916
HOW IN THE WORLD DID
YOU MIX THAT UP, MILLY?

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,041
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

302
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,833
- I FEEL SO SILLY.
IT SLIPPED MY MIND.

303
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,458
DARN IT!
I HATE BEING WRONG.

304
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,500
- Meryl: THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

305
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,416
- ( clangs )
- ( moaning )

306
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,791
- ( Milly laughs )

307
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,208
- COME ON, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE, MILLY!

308
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,250
- ALL RIGHT.

309
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,958
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- I DON'T THINK SO!

310
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,833
- HUH?

311
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,916
( groans )

312
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,625
I... I SAW WHITE ANGELS.
( moans )

313
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,500
- THEY SEEM TO HAVE
THE HOSTAGES UNDER CONTROL.

314
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,875
HE SAYS WE CAN DO WHATEVER
WE WANT WITH THE OTHERS.

315
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,041
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

316
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,125
- SOUNDS GOOD. I SAY
WE GO HAVE SOME FUN.

317
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,458
I JUST LOVE PARTY TIME.

318
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,791
- Vash: YOU TWO SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

319
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,041
- Both: HUH? OOOH!

320
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,458
- VASH, AMAZING. ARE YOU
STILL DOING THINGS THIS WAY?

321
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
- UH, YEAH.

322
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,791
( gunshot )

323
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,333
- WHAT THE HELL?
- ARE YOU A POLO BODYGUARD?

324
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,875
- NO, I'M NOT.

325
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,458
- IF YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH,
GENTLEMEN, TRY TO TAKE US DOWN!

326
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,833
BUT BEFORE YOU DO, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS MAN IS

327
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,625
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

328
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,208
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?!

329
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,291
- AW, COME ON, MAX.
- CAN YOU AT LEAST ACT THE PART?

330
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,125
THEY'LL CHICKEN OUT AND RUN AWAY
AND WE WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.

331
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,291
- DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?
( clicks )

332
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
- ( whimpering )

333
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,250
( footsteps )
- HUH?

334
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,375
- ( panting )

335
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,208
- ( man yawns )

336
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,833
- ( whimpering )

337
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,875
- EASE UP THERE, BENSON.

338
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,333
THERE'S NO ONE
TO SHOOT HERE.

339
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,458
NOW TAKE YOUR FINGER
OFF THE TRIGGER.

340
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,250
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

341
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,250
I'M SORRY.
- Man: LISTEN UP!

342
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,041
- Both: HUH?
- Lurald: WHAT IS IT?

343
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,166
- IT'S THE GUNMAN.
IT'S VASH THE STAMPEDE!

344
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,750
HE'S COMING OUR WAY.
HE'S COMING!

345
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,333
- YOU SAW HIM?
- BUT WHY?

346
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,583
WHAT WOULD VASH THE STAMPEDE
BE DOING HERE?

347
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,458
- THIS IS LIKE A BAD DREAM.
- ENOUGH, CALM DOWN!

348
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,000
- HUH?
- ( growls )

349
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,333
RUMORS LIKE THIS
ARE ALWAYS EXAGGERATED.

350
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,458
AND EVEN IF HE IS
THE REAL THING...

351
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,583
HE STILL HAS TO TAKE
THAT PASSAGE TO GET HERE.

352
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,750
IT'S THE ONLY WAY IN.

353
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,750
REMEMBER IT'S THE REASON
WE CHOSE THIS LOCATION.

354
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,125
- HUH. OH YEAH.
- ( footsteps )

355
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,791

368
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,291
- GOD, WHAT HORRIBLE LYRICS!

369
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,041
- STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

TO SCARE YOU.

371

I KNEW IT WOULDN'T WORK.

372
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,166
- HUH?

373
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,458
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

374
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,291
- Lurald:
YEAH, WHAT?

375
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,958
- WOULD YOU PREFER TO
CALL OFF OUR LITTLE GAME

376
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,916
LIKE A SENSIBLE ADULT,

377
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,416
OR WOULD YOU RATHER GET INJURED
AND BE OUT OF THE GAME FOR GOOD?

378
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,750
- HOW ABOUT A NEW GAME?

379
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,208
I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
WITH ANOTHER QUESTION:

380
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,250
NOW THAT I'LL PLAY, DO YOU
WANT A BELLY FULL OF LEAD?

381
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,291
- OH, WHAT A SHAME!

382
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,416
A NEGOTIATIONS BREAKDOWN.

383
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,958
( footsteps )
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

384
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:17,958
( grunts )

385
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,625
- WHAT? SHIT, THIS GUY
CAN'T BE FOR REAL!

386
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,625
- ( all gasp )

387
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,208
- ( yelping )

388
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,791
- HEY, MR. LURALD.

389
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,125
HE'S GONE.

390
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,458
( moans )

391
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,458
- HAH.

392
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,208
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
THE FIGHT IS OVER.

393
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,416
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LET
GO OF THE HOSTAGE NOW.

394
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
- NEVER!

395
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,750
ACTUALLY
I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU.

396
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,458
NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,
I'M GONNA GET TO KILL HIM!

397
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,791
- I'LL WHACK YOU, MISTER.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY

398
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,708
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

399
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,791
- ( growls )

400
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,416
- NOW COME ON. GIVE
THE GUY A BREAK.

401
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,250
- FORGET IT!
- AHH, WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?!

402
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,583
- HE KILLED HER!
- UH.

403
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,791
- ( whimpering )

404
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,083
- THIS BASTARD KILLED HER.

405
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,000
HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER
AND HE'S GONNA DIE.

406
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,833
( over P.A. ) He's going to pay
for her death with his life!

407
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,416
- ( murmuring )

408
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,291
- ( thinking )
WE'RE NOTHING LIKE GOD.

409
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,125
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE
LIMITED POWERS,

410
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,333
WE SOMETIMES ARE DRIVEN
TO BECOME THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

411
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,166
- ( whimpering )

412
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,291

- ( grunts )

414
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,500
- THAT WAS MY DAUGHTER.

415
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,791
MY DAUGHTER...

416
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,750
- Man: THIS IS HORRIBLE.

417
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,583
DEAR GOD, NOT AGAIN.

418
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,916
I KNOW SHE'S RELATED
TO THE FRIS,

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,583
BUT SHE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!

420
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,250
- EH, I'LL MAKE IT FAST.

421
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,083
- UH--
- ( cocks )

422
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,708
ONCE I'M FINISHED HERE, YOU CAN
HAND ME OVER TO THE SHERIFF

423
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,125
OR EVEN THE CAVALRY
FOR ALL I CARE!

424
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,958
- Slater: DON'T DO IT! PLEASE!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

425
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,125
( sobs ) FORGIVE ME.
FORGIVE ME, PLEASE!

426
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,208
I'M SORRY.

427
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,375
- HOW DARE YOU BEG
FOR YOUR LIFE?

428
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,583
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER
BEGGING FOR HERS?

429
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,416
WHEN I SAW WHAT YOU DID
TO MY LITTLE AILEEN,

430
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,708
MY AILEEN... NO HUMAN BEING
COULD DO SUCH AN EVIL THING!

431
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,083
YOU PEOPLE...
YOU PEOPLE AREN'T HUMAN

432
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,041
AND YOU ALL NEED TO DIE!
- DON'T LET ME DIE!

433
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,625
STOP! STOP!

434
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,750
OH, STOP PLEASE.

435
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,625
- JUSTICE AT LAST.

436
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,916
- ( whimpering )

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,416
- DON'T, IT'S WRONG!
- I MUST AVENGE HER.

438
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,875
- ( wailing )

439
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,291
- GET OFF! WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

440
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
YOU COULD NEVER
UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL!

441
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,666
( blows thud )
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP!

442
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,666
( grunting )

443
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,083
LET GO OF ME!

446
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,458
- DADDY! DADDY!
- ( sighs )

447
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,375
- ( Slater sobbing )
DADDY! DADDY!

448
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,458
- ( growls )

449
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,000
HOW MANY TIMES DID MY
DAUGHTER SCREAM FOR HER DADDY?

450
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,833
- ( sobbing )
- HOW MANY TIMES?!

451
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,333
- DON'T TAKE
THIS MAN'S LIFE!

452
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,583
DON'T KILL HIM, PLEASE!

PLEASE DON'T SHOOT HIM!
DON'T DO IT, I'M BEGGING YOU!

454
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
- ( sobbing over P.A. )

455
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,333
- THIS IS SO STRANGE, AILEEN.

456
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,250
I-I CAN'T SHOOT HIM.

457
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,041
WHY CAN'T I DO IT?

458
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,083
I WANT TO AVENGE YOU...

459
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,791
WHY CAN'T I DO IT?
HE SHOULD DIE!

460
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,666
( sobbing )

461
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,708
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

462
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,958
- HUH?

463
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,541
- IT'S NOTHING. I'M JUST
GLAD IT'S OVER NOW.

464
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,416
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
TO GET BOTH OF THEM

465
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,625
AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS WE CAN
BEFORE THE CAVALRY ARRIVES.

466
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,916
- Man: GET A STRETCHER
OVER HERE!

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,916
- The shootout which began
late this afternoon

468
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,666
was brought to a
safe conclusion with

469
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,458
one swift charge of the cavalry!

470
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,250
The 12 idiots who were
held hostage, myself included,

471
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,500
were freed. For an incident
involving the humanoid typhoon,

472
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,375
the damage wasn't that bad!
But the day after tomorrow,

473
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,333
a real typhoon is
coming to town.

474
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,750
Be very very careful,
boys and girls.

475
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,750
- Wolfwood: GO EASY ON
THE NICE-GUY STUFF, OKAY?

476
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,958
YOU'VE GOTTA START
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.

477
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,041
LUCK AND PERSISTENCE
WON'T WORK FOREVER.

478
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,208
SO LONG.

479
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,250
- UH?

480
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,291
- ( giggles )

481
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,708
- Vash:
LONG TIME NO SEE.

482
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,333
- YEAH.

483
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,583
- I HAVE NOW FOUND HIM.

484
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,250
I WILL TOTAL EVERYTHING

485
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,916
SO MY CONCLUSION
WILL THEN BE FINAL.

486
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,291
THERE IS NO DOUBT.

487
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,666
VASH THE STAMPEDE

488
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,791
HAS BEGUN TO MOVE,
MR. LEGATO.

489
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,458
- ( theme music playing )

490
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,458
( singing in Japanese )

491
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,416
- Vash: IN TIMES OF HARDSHIP,
IN TIMES OF SADNESS,

492
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,625
THERE IS A PLACE THE TRAVELER
CAN LET HIS MIND RETURN TO...

493
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,166
HOME.

494
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,250
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A PAST THE TRAVELER ABANDONED

495
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,333
WHEN HE LEFT
HIS HOME BEHIND.

496
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,583
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF SORROW HE BEARS.

497
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,291
BUT THE TRAVELER CAN
KEEP WALKING FORWARD

498
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,750
BECAUSE HE HAS SOMETHING
WHICH SUSTAINS HIM,

499
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,750
A PLACE WHICH ACCEPTS HIM.

500
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,625
HE CAN WALK FORWARD
STEP BY CAREFUL STEP.
