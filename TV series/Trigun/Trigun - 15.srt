1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,125
( theme music continues )

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,916
- ( creaking )

4
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,250
- BOY, MERYL,
THE RIDE IS COMFY, ISN'T IT?

5
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,541
- IT SURE IS.

6
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,583
THIS IS ONE INCREDIBLE
PIECE OF MACHINERY.

7
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,083
- THE ONLY WAY
IT COULD BE BETTER

8
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,458
IS IF IT WERE
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

9
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,916
NOW THAT WOULD BE DREAMY.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,208
- I'M DOING THE BEST
I POSSIBLY CAN.

11
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,583
GIVE ME A BREAK.

12
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,541
- MY GOODNESS, MERYL,
THIS CAR CAN ACTUALLY TALK!

13
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,791
- THERE'S NO WAY, MILLY.

14
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,208
YOU'RE JUST HEARING THINGS.

15
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,083
- GEE, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

16
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,000
- GIRLS ONLY
CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES.

17
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,583
- DO YOU HAVE ANY RIGHT TO
SAY THAT AFTER WRECKING OUR CAR?

18
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,208
I THINK NOT. YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

19
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,833
- ARE WE THERE YET?

20
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,916
ARE WE THERE YET?!

21
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,291
- ( crowd chattering )

22
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,583
- ( saxophone playing jazz )

23
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,416
- ( grunts )

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,125
- LOOK,
IT'S THE RODERICK THIEVES.

25
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,458
- YEAH.  BUT WHO
ARE THOSE GIRLS?

26
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,250
- THEY MUST BE CAPTIVES.

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,375
- THEY REALLY MAKE ME SICK.

28
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,416
- HEY, LIQUOR BOY. BRING US 
THE BEST BOOZE IN THE HOUSE.

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I'M THIRSTY.

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,250
- UH, COMING.
COMING RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

31
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,583
( murmurs )
- ( chuckles )

32
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,916
- ( gasps, screams )

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,583
- ( laughing )

34
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,916
- BANG.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,666
- ( screaming )

36
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,000
- AIN'T THIS FUN?

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
( chuckles )

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,041
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

39
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,750
HEY, THAT GUY,

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,750
HOW LONG HAS HE
BEEN SITTING THERE?

41
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:55,833
- BEATS ME.

42
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,541
- HUH?

43
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,625
( groans )

44
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,166
- ( screams )

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,833
( grunts )
- YOU BITCH!

46
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,166
YOU WERE LOOKING AT HIM.

47
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,583
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
STAND IT WHEN YOU DO THAT.

48
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,916
I CAN'T STAND IT.
- ( whimpering ) 

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,916
- HOW DARE YOU
DISRESPECT ME.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,458
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
HE'S BETTER THAN ME?

51
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,416
DO YOU?  DO YOU?

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,583
- ALL RIGHT, NAGI,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

53
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,541
- BUT SHE WAS
LOOKING RIGHT AT HIM.

54
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,875
- YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HIM ANYWAY.

55
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
( chuckles )

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,333
IT'S TOO BAD.

57
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,750
LOOKS LIKE A LADY KILLER.

58
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
THE KIND THE WOMEN
ALL GO AFTER.

59
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,000
WELL, MR. HANDSOME,
THAT'S REAL CRUEL OF YOU.

60
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,250
YOU SEE, THESE GIRLS
ARE TOO DELICATE.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,916
LAST NIGHT THEY GAVE UP
EVERYTHING THEY HAD.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,583
THEIR FAMILIES,

63
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
THEIR LOVERS,

64
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,916
THEIR ENTIRE PAST.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,666
HOW CAN YOU JUST SIT THERE

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,916
REMINDING THEM
OF WHAT THEY LOST?

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,083
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.
NOW WE'LL HAVE TO HELP THEM

68
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,916
FORGET IT ALL OVER AGAIN,
WON'T WE?

69
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,583
- YOU LISTENING, SLICK?

70
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR US?

71
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,125
HEY, PUNK!

72
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,416
YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION!

73
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,041
( chuckles )

74
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,583
- A FORK, PLEASE?

75
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,666
- ASSHOLE!

76
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,833
- ( gunfire )

77
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,791
- IT'S NOT WISE
TO BE HASTY.

78
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,291
- HUH?

79
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,083
- I INTEND TO EVENTUALLY

80
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,416
DESTROY ALL OF MANKIND

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,416
RIGHT DOWN TO
THE VERY LAST SPECK OF DUST,

82
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,125
YET WHY IS IT
THAT YOU INSIST

83
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,791
UPON MEETING
YOUR DEATH SOONER?

84
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,125
- ( chuckles )

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,666
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,666
YOU'RE JUST TALKING 
A BUNCH OF NONSENSE.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,333
HMM?

88
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,791
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- HUH?

89
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,583
( grunting )

90
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,625
- YOU VOLUNTEERED FIRST,
THAT'S ALL.

91
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,958
- WHAT THE--

92
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,583
WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING?

93
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,625
- IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU'RE THE FIRST TO DIE.

94
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,125
- ( groaning )

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,583
( grunts )

96
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,583
IT HURTS!

97
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,500
- NAGI?

98
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,916
- MAKE IT STOP!

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,916
- ( gasps )

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,291
- ( overlapping chatter )

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,375
- YOUR TURN!

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,833
- ( groans )

103
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,916
- BUT-- BUT WHY?
- HUH?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
- ( groans )
- ( murmuring )

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING? 

106
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,666
- ( overlapping shouting )

107
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,250
- DAMN IT!  BASTARD!

108
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,250
AAH!

109
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,666
- ( overlapping shouting )

110
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,000
- PLEASE, STOP IT.

111
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,583
DON'T KILL ME!

112
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,416
- ( chuckles )

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,291
- ( gunfire )
- ( jazz playing )

114
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,541
- IT REALLY IS A SHAME
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

115
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,583
- ( crying )

116
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,250
- BUT NOW AT LEAST YOU KNOW

117
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,583
JUST HOW MUCH PAIN 
THERE IS IN LIVING.

118
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,250
- ( sobbing )

119
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,000
- ( whimpers )

120
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,750
- THE DAY IT ALL ENDS
IS NEAR.

121
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,416
I ADVISE YOU TO MAKE GOOD USE
OF THE TIME YOU HAVE LEFT.

122
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,708
- ( gasping )

123
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,583
- ( door closes )

124
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,708
- ( sighs )

125
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,250
- ( gasps )

126
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
- ( gasps )

127
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,750
- ( breathes heavily )

128
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,916
- Legato:
THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR ME.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,583
I DON'T USUALLY WASTE MY
TIME ON VERMIN LIKE THAT.

130
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,208
( chuckles )

131
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,916
IT MUST BE THE WAY
YOU LOOK,

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,541
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

133
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,416
YOUR VERY EXISTENCE
SEEMS TO CAUSE ME

134
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,375
UNDUE IRRITATION.

135
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,916
- AT LAST,
WE'RE FINALLY HERE.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,250
- YOU LOOK BAD.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

137
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,750
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN HAVE
THE NERVE TO ASK ME THAT?

138
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,500
HUH?

139
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,750
- ( singsong laugh )

140
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,250
- ( grunts )
- OH?

141
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,250
- ( gulping )

142
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,583
I'M ALIVE AGAIN!

143
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,083
BOY, THAT WAS REALLY CLOSE.

144
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,916
WELL, I THINK I'LL HAVE
A DRINK SOMEWHERE

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
TO PERK MYSELF UP.

146
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,250
WHERE'S THE NEAREST SALOON?
I'M THIRSTY.

147
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,875
- WHOA.
- ( laughing )

148
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
I KNOW THERE'S GOT TO BE
ONE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

149
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,583
- OTHER THAN MR. VASH, THIS CITY
CERTAINLY IS QUIET, ISN'T IT?

150
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,916
- IT CERTAINLY IS.
- I GUESS I WAS RIGHT BEFORE.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,916
OH, LOOK.
HERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,416
I'M GOING IN.

153
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,125
HI!

154
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- UH, NOTHING, REALLY.

155
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,666
NOTHING AT ALL.

156
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,583
Vash: WHO?

157
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,125
WHO DID THIS?

158
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,250
- THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU,
AREN'T THERE?

159
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,458
YOU PLANNING TO
MOVE IN FOR THE KILL?

160
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,666
- ( chuckles ) I FIND IT
AWFULLY HARD TO BELIEVE

161
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,125
THAT THE VICE-CHIEF
WAS KILLED BY A FOOL LIKE YOU.

162
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,458
SO WHAT KIND OF TRICK
DID YOU PULL ON HIM ANYWAY?

163
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,583
- HUMANS, HOW PATHETIC.

164
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,916
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,583
THE RODERICKS
ARE BOUND BY BONDS

166
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,291
THAT GO INFINITELY 
DEEPER AND STRONGER

167
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,458
THAN A SIMPLY FAMILY
RELATIONSHIP.

168
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,291
WE WILL AVENGE OUR BRETHREN,

169
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,250
NO MATTER WHO THE FOOL IS.

170
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,416
THAT'S THE RODERICK WAY.

171
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,250
THIS HERE'S GOOD-BYE,
LADY KILLER.

172
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,916
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,916
WAIT!  COMMANDER,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,916
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, IDIOT?
LET GO OF ME NOW.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,416
- MY HANDS-- THEY'RE MOVING
ALL BY THEMSELVES.

176
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,250
- CUT THE CRAP.
- YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME!

177
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,916
- SUCH FRAGILE 
BONDS THEY ARE.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,916
HMM?

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,916
- REALLY, I CAN'T!
- STOP IT!

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,208
- YES, YOU HAVE A POINT.

181
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,458
IT ISN'T NICE
TO BE SO GREEDY.

182
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,916
- YOU ALWAYS TALKING...

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,208
TO YOURSELF?

184
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,583
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE ALL OF THEM.

185
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,250
JUST KILL HALF OF THEM
THIS TIME AROUND.

186
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,666
- KILL HIM!
- ( shouting )

187
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,000
( screaming )

188
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,666
- ( gunfire )

189
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,750
- ( screaming, shouts continue )

190
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,416
- YOU'RE DEAD MEAT.

191
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,916
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,250
LAUNCH A COUNTER-OFFENSIVE!

193
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,458
- ( men groaning )

194
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,666
- GAHH.

195
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,708
- ( beeping )

196
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,250
- ( screams )
- HUH?

197
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,625
( screams )

198
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,291
- ( men screaming )

199
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,541
- ( men groan, shout )

200
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,500
- Legato: WHY DO YOU THINK I
SPARED HALF YOUR MEN, COMMANDER?

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MY REASON HAPPENS TO BE
PERFECTLY RATIONAL.

202
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,250
YOU SEE, IF YOUR BONDS

203
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,583
ARE INDEED DEEPER
THAN FAMILY,

204
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,750
THEN YOU MUST HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY

205
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,333
TO GIVE YOUR FRIENDS
A PROPER BURIAL.

206
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,791
HOWEVER...

207
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,291
- ...THIS IS NOT
AN ACT OF MERCY.

208
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,291
THIS IS TO TEACH YOU
THE PAIN OF LIVING. 

209
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,833
- AAH!
( screams )

210
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,958
- ( gunshot )

211
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,791
- EXCELLENT WORK,
COMMANDER.

212
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,583
- GRAY THE NINELIVES,

213
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,791
DOMINIQUE THE CYCLOPS,

214
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,583
ZAZIE THE BEAST,

215
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,083
LEONOF THE PUPPET MASTER,

216
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,333
HOPPERED THE GAUNTLET,

217
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,083
RAI-DEI THE BLADE,

218
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,583
E.G. MINE,

219
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,333
CAINE THE LONGSHOT,

220
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,083
AND MYSELF,
YOUR FAITHFUL

221
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,916
MIDVALLEY THE HORNFREAK.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,791
WE ALL OFFER YOU
OUR SUPPORT.

223
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,250
- CHAPEL APPEARS TO BE ABSENT.

224
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,250
- HE SEEMS TO BE AS
UNTRUSTWORTHY

225
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,583
AS THE RUMORS CLAIM.

226
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,083
- IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH.

227
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,916
YOUR TARGET IS
VERY CLOSE BY.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,583
IT SHOULDN'T BE
ANY PROBLEM.

229
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,000
- THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
OF TALENT HERE.

230
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,125
YOU PLANNING TO USE
ALL OF US ON THIS ONE TARGET?

231
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,958
- HARDLY.
I WOULD NEVER WASTE

232
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,625
ALL THAT TALENT
ON ONE TARGET. 

233
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,583
MY RESPECT FOR YOU
IS HIGHER THAN THAT.

234
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,916
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
DOMINIQUE?

235
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,875
- YES, I'M ALL YOU NEED
FOR THIS JOB.

236
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,916
LEGATO,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,250
- ( pounding on door )

238
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,250
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING!

239
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,416
OPEN THE DOOR!

240
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,583
( sighs )

241
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,708
- WAIT, VASH, WHAT'S WRONG?

242
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,625
- ( panting )

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,916
- ( gasps )

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,958
( gasps )

245
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,583
- WAIT, PLEASE.
I MEAN YOU NO HARM.

246
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,958
IF YOU TELL ME WHO DID THIS,
WE CAN STOP HIM.

247
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250
WAS IT LEGATO
THAT DID IT? 

248
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,750
TELL ME, WAS HE WEARING
A WHITE COAT?

249
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,666
- ( screams )

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,666
- AAH!

251
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,291
- I DON'T FEEL
SORRY FOR YOU ONE BIT.

252
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,000
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR
TRYING TO FORCE YOUR WAY

253
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,375
INTO A PRIVATE RESIDENCE.

254
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,416
- Vash: HE'S SOMEWHERE
IN THIS TOWN.

255
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,250
I'M SURE OF IT.
BUT WHERE?

256
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,416
WHERE?

257
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,791
- YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET.

258
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,208
DOES YOUR FINGER
REALLY HURT THAT MUCH?

259
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,166
- ( gasps )

260
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,583
WHY THAT FILTHY--
- Both: HUH?

261
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,125
- ARE YOU CRAZY
OR SOMETHING?

262
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,291
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

263
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,000
- Vash:
WHAT IS HE UP TO THIS TIME?

264
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,000
- Milly:
WE'RE BEING LEFT BEHIND.

265
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,416
- HE WAS SO TIRED
A MOMENT AGO.

266
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,750
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM.

267
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,583
- SHOULD I SHOOT HIM?
- WOULD YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,083
- ( gasps )

269
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,916
CORPSES.

270
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
( sighs )

271
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,916
- YOU'RE NAIVE.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,250
HAD I BEEN SO INCLINED,

273
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,583
I COULD HAVE KILLED YOU
AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW.

274
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,125
- IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU
ENJOY DROPPING IN ON PEOPLE

275
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,958
JUST TO STIR THEM UP.

276
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,291
FUN HOBBY, LADY.
WHO ARE YOU?

277
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,583
- ONE OF THE GUNG-HO-GUNS.

278
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,708
- ARE YOU ON LEGATO'S TEAM?

279
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,583
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S
ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.

280
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,583
I'M THE SECOND
GUNG-HO-GUN.

281
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,208
I'M KNOWN AS
DOMINIQUE THE CYCLOPS.

282
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,583
- IS THIS YOUR DOING?

283
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,541
I MERELY TOOK OUT 
SOME OF THE TRASH.

285
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,750
THEY JUST USE PEOPLE
IN ORDER TO LINE

286
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,083
THEIR OWN POCKETS.

287
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,208
CALL IT A SPRING CLEANING
OF SORTS.

288
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,416
WELL?

289
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,333
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER?

290
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,583
- ( sighs )

291
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,625
YOU KILLED THEM.

292
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,250
EVEN THOUGH THEY DID
TERRIBLE THINGS,

293
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,791
THE DECISION OF WHO
AND SHOULD NOT LIVE

294
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,416
WAS NEVER AND NEVER WILL BE
YOURS TO MAKE!

295
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,833
I SHOULD SLAP YOU.
- ( chuckles )

296
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,333
- NOT TO MENTION THAT
DURING THIS CONVERSATION

297
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,583
I COULD HAVE GROPED YOU
AT LEAST FIVE TIMES.

298
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,791
OKAY, SO LET'S SAY
MAYBE FOUR TIMES. 

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,083
- ( chuckles )

300
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,333
- WELL, WHAT NOW?

301
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,875
SHALL WE FIGHT?

302
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,083
- OF COURSE.

303
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,583
YOU DECIDED TO
UP THE ANTE,

304
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,125
AND I'M NOT GOING TO FOLD.

305
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,083
AT LEAST NOT BEFORE
LOOKING AT THE CARDS.

306
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,416
NOW THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

307
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,416
- I WOULDN'T DO THIS
IF I WERE YOU.

308
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,625
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

309
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,291
- ( chuckles )
WHAT BLIND OPTIMISM.

310
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,750
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY
YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF FIGHTING

311
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,291
IS SO SIMPLISTIC
AND UNSOPHISTICATED.

312
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,833
YOU HAD SOME SUCCESS
WITH YOUR BARBARIC STYLE,

313
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,583
BUT THIS IS THE LAST DAY
YOU'LL BE SAVED BY

314
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,125
A SIMPLE QUICK DRAW.

315
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
- ( gunshots )

316
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,958
- CHECKMATE.

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,375
( chuckles )
THAT'S VERY CUTE.

318
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,916
- WHAT KIND OF FREAK
ARE YOU, LADY?

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,125
THAT WAS DEFINITELY
NOT HUMAN.

320
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,916
- YOU'RE AN UNPREDICTABLE MAN,
GUNFIGHTER.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,583
I ACTUALLY LIKE
YOUR TYPE.

322
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,916
- ME UNPREDICTABLE?

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,625
I'M NOT THE ONE TELEPORTING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

324
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,625
- I'LL COMPLIMENT YOU UPON 
COUNTERING MY ATTACK TWICE.

325
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,958
BUT JUST HOW LONG DO YOU 
THINK YOU CAN KEEP IT UP?

326
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,916
GO AHEAD AND TRY AGAIN
IF YOU LIKE,

327
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,916
BUT YOU'D BETTER
SHOOT ME THIS TIME.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,916
- Vash:
THAT'S NO EMPTY THREAT.

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,125
UNFORTUNATELY,

330
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
SHE HOLDS THE CARD
OF MANEUVERABILITY.

331
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,375
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO TAKE HER DOWN.

332
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,375
LOOK.  LOOK AT HER.

333
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,708
LOOK HARD.

334
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,708
SHE'S GOING TO MOVE.

335
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,333
DON'T YOU DARE MISS IT.

336
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,000
- ( chuckles )

337
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,750
YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT,
GUNMAN.

338
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,916
BUT IT IS TO NO AVAIL.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,250
LIKE I TOLD YOU,

340
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,916
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,375
HOW FAST YOU ARE.

342
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,666
YOU SEE?

343
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,666
- ( gasps )

344
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,875
- ( gunshot )

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,583
- ( panting )

346
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,208
Vash:
I CAN'T FOLLOW HER.

347
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,250
- YOU'RE VERY SLOPPY,
GUNFIGHTER.

348
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,625
THAT MAKES IT THREE TIMES
THAT YOU'VE MADE ME MISS.

349
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,791
- I'M SLOPPY?

350
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,750
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MISSED.

351
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,083
I'M USING ALL OF MY SENSES,

352
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,750
YET WHEN SHE MOVES,
IT'S LIKE SHE VANISHES.

353
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,458
HOW CAN THAT BE?

354
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,583
HOW CAN SHE MOVE THAT FAST?

355
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
SHE DID IT THEN.

356
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,708
AND THEN.

357
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,416
I GET IT.

358
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,750
- HAVE YOU RESTED ENOUGH?

359
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,083
I WOULD LIKE TO
END THE SHOW SOON

360
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,375
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU.

361
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,041
WELL, HAVE YOU GIVEN UP?

362
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
OR ARE YOU PLAYING AT SOME
KIND OF PATHETIC MARTIAL ART?

363
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,875
- ( exhales )

364
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,208
( breathes heavily )

365
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,541
( grunts )

366
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,458
( groaning )

367
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,916
- IT'S NOT--

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
NOT POSSIBLE.

369
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,458
IMPOSSIBLE!

370
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,291
( gasps )

371
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,833
- ( gunshot )

372
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,250
- ( moans )

373
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,916
( grunts )

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,250
BUT HOW?

375
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,791
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

376
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,958
- YOU NUMB THE PERCEPTIONS
OF YOUR OPPONENT

377
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,583
THROUGH HYPNOTIC CHARM.

378
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
THE SPELL SOMEHOW
COMES FROM YOUR EYE.

379
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,208
THAT'S THE CARD YOU HOLD.

380
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,250
- THE DEMON'S EYE SHOULD
AFFECT ALL FIVE SENSES

381
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
WHETHER YOUR EYES
ARE OPENED OR CLOSED.

382
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,583
SO HOW--

383
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,916
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,583
YOU ESCAPED THE DEMON'S EYE

385
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,500
BY FOCUSING ALL OF YOUR
CONCENTRATION ON PAIN? 

386
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,458
DON'T SCREW WITH ME.

387
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,458
NO MORTAL COULD
POSSIBLY DO THAT.

388
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,458
DIE!

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,625
( gasps )

390
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,166
- GAME'S OVER.

391
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,958
INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME

392
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,333
CLEANING UP PEOPLE,

393
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,750
YOU SHOULD BE CLEANING HOUSE
FOR THE MAN YOU LOVE.

394
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,083
LIKE ME FOR EXAMPLE.

395
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,708
I AM KIDDING,
YOU KNOW.

396
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,708
( chuckles )

397
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,708
- Meryl: VASH?

398
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,750
- ( both panting )

399
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,458
- ( gasps )
- HMM?

400
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,208
- ( grunts )

401
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THIS
POOR DEFENSELESS WOMAN,

402
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,125
YOU ANIMAL.

403
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,583
- DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
THAT WAS GOING ON HERE AT ALL?

404
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,750
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

405
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,375
- COME ON!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

406
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,208
- THIS ISN'T OVER,
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

407
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,500
- IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU
WORE A DRESS THE NEXT TIME.

408
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,666
- ( sighs )

409
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,958
- HUH? 
- UH...

410
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,291
- ( groans )
- SHE DISAPPEARED.

411
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,708
- VASH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

412
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,750
- HUH?

413
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,166
- ( exhales )

414
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,750
I THOUGHT--
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS DEAD.

415
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,208
- ( panting )

416
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE SAW
THROUGH THE DEMON'S EYE.

417
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS BEATEN BY THAT

418
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,208
FEATHER-BRAIN
OF A MAN.

419
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,625
( gasps )

420
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,583
- MR. VASH,

421
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,791
I WANT AN EXPLANATION

422
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,041
OF JUST EXACTLY
WHAT WENT ON HERE TODAY.

423
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,000
- ( saxophone playing )
- All: HUH?

424
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,250
- ( gasps )

425
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,916
- WHAT WAS THAT?

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,250
- IT'S TIME TO DECIDE.
- HUH?

427
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,583
- I'M SORRY...

428
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,791
BUT THIS IS AS FAR
AS WE CAN TRAVEL TOGETHER.

429
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,000
- WHY?

430
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,333
- BECAUSE

431
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,916
IT'S BECOME TOO DANGEROUS.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,125
- I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

433
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,583
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

434
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,750
- IT'S YOUR JOB
OR YOUR LIFE.

435
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,083
- OHH.

436
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,083
- WHICH IS MORE
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

437
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,458
- UH...

438
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,791
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW.

439
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,583
IF I DID,
YOU'D BE PUT IN DANGER.

440
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,291
SO, IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN,

441
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,166
BUT, WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL.

442
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,166
STAY BACK.

443
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,125
- ( both sigh )

444
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,416
- Vash: IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT THIS WAS ALL A FARCE

445
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,583
JUST TO GET ME RILED?

446
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,583
IF SO,
I WILL TURN THE TABLES.

447
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,791
LEGATO,

448
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,916
THIS TIME IT'S MY TURN
TO HUNT YOU.

449
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,916
I'LL FIND YOU.

450
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,916
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

451
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,291
- ( theme music playing )

452
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

453
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,125
- Vash:
THE FRAGMENT OF MEMORY

454
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,375
LOST IN THE GAP
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

455
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,125
IS IT SOMETHING WHICH
WILL POINT THE WAY

456
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,000
TO SPIRITUAL AWARENESS?

457
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,083
THE SILVER METALLIC GUN
CRUSHES,

458
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,416
AND MY RIGHT ARM
METAMORPHOSES.

459
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,250
MY PAST, MY PEOPLE,
MY MOTHER...

460
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,333
THE MOMENT I WAS REUNITED WITH
EVERYTHING I EVER PROTECTED.

461
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,333
THE LIGHT TOOK AUGUSTA,

462
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,333
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON,

463
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,916
THE 60 BILLION
DOUBLE DOLLAR MAN,

464
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,583
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

465
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,583
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF MY PAST.

466
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,583
THIS IS THE END
OF MY JOURNEY.
