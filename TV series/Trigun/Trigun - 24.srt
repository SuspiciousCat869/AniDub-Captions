1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,083
- WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

3
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,750
A FORTUITOUS OCCASION INDEED.

4
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,083
JUST WHO I WANTED TO SEE.

5
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,291
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME,
AREN'T YOU?

6
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,666
APPARENTLY YOU'RE
UNHAPPY THAT I FORCED YOU

7
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,541
TO KILL NICHOLAS
D. WOLFWOOD.

8
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,375
- ( grunts )

9
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,791
AAH!

10
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,041
( pained groaning )

11
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,583
- YOUR SCENE IS OVER NOW,
CHAPEL.

12
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,833
NOW THE CURTAIN'LL RISE
FOR THE FINAL ACT.

13
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,291
- ( groans )

14
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,791
- ( rumbling )

15
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,708
- ( gasps )

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,791
- ( whimpering )

17
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,000
- I'M CURIOUS.
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

18
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,250
- I-- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO LIVE

19
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,916
WITHOUT BEING ABLE
TO PAY OFF A DEBT.

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,916
- THAT'S NONSENSE.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,750
ANIMALS RUN INSTINCTIVELY
WHEN THEY SENSE DANGER.

22
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,125
BUT YOUR BEHAVIOR IS
COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.

23
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,291
( laughs )
YOUR SACRIFICE IS MEANINGLESS.

24
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,625
YOU DON'T EVEN DESERVE
TO BE CALLED A FOOL.

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,625
THE ONLY REASON THE HUMAN RACE
CAME TO POSSESS THE CAPABILITY

26
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,875
OF COMPASSION IN THE SENSE
OF MORALS

27
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,833
WAS BECAUSE THEY SOMEHOW
MISTAKENLY BELIEVED THEMSELVES

28
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,250
TO BE A SUPERIOR BREED OF BEAST.

29
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,916
THE MOMENT THEY TASTE
THE FEAR OF KNOWING

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,416
THERE'S A SUPERIOR BREED,
SOMETHING SEEMS TO TAKE CONTROL

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
OVER THEM EVERY TIME.

32
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
AND FOR SOME REASON,
HUMANS ACT MERELY BY INSTINCT

33
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,000
FROM THAT POINT ON.

34
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,750
- THE CORNERED MOUSE
ATTACKS THE CAT,

35
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,041
EVEN KNOWING THE CAT
HAS THE UPPER HAND.

36
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,250
- BUT THE CAT IS WISE
 TO THE MOUSE'S GAME.

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,250
THE MOUSE SEEKS DEATH
IN ORDER TO AVOID THE PAIN.

38
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,083
- ( whirring, zapping )

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,375
- ( groans )

40
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,250
- IMAGINE THE PLACE
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,916
- AAH!

42
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,416
- YES, THE PAIN YOU FEEL IS
YOUR VERY ESSENCE,

43
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,833
THE ESSENCE OF THE CRUDE ANIMAL
KNOWN AS HOMO SAPIEN.

44
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,791
- ( screams )

45
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,583
- GARBAGE-- ONLY GOOD FOR
CONSUMING RESOURCES.

46
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,875
( softly chuckles )

47
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,625
- I UNDERSTAND.

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,916
MASTER?

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,750
VASH THE STAMPEDE
WILL EXPERIENCE ETERNAL PAIN

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,750
AND SUFFERING.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,875
- ( townspeople chattering )

52
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,791
- HEY, LADY.
- HMM.

53
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,416
- OH, MISS, MAY I HAVE 
SOME DOUGHNUTS, PLEASE?

54
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,416
- OH, YEAH?

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,708
HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?

56
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,625
- 30 DOUBLE DOLLARS WORTH.

57
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,916
OH, AND COULD YOU PLEASE
MAKE THEM FRESH ONES?

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
I DON'T WANT ANY DAY-OLDS, OKAY?

59
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,458
- FINE, YEAH.
WHATEVER.  DON'T WORRY.

60
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,416
- ( Vash humming )

61
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,416
( exhales )

62
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,083
A POPULATED CITY AT LAST.

63
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,333
SURE FEELS GOOD TO SEE
HAPPY PEOPLE AROUND AGAIN.

64
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,125
IT'S A LUCKY LUCKY DAY.

65
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,375
<i>BONJOUR!  JE T'AIME!</i>

66
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,583
MM.  THAT SMELLS GREAT.

67
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,000
WHAT A HEAVENLY AROMA.

68
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,166
SMELLS LIKE LITTLE CAKES
MADE FROM HONEY.

69
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,416
AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,083
( laughs maniacally )

71
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,250
( chomping )

72
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

73
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,916
SUPER TASTY!

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,250
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE ALIVE!

75
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,666
- Boy #1: COME BACK!

76
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,375
- Boy #2: MOM SAYS SHE'S GONNA
BUY US SOME NEW TOYS!

77
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
HURRY UP!
- I'M RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN!

78
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,416
- Man: HAVE YOU BEEN
TO MAGGIE'S STORE?

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,833
SHE HAS NEW BULKS OF THAT NICE
FABRIC YOU LIKE SO MUCH.

80
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,833
- Woman: I HAD NO IDEA.
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.

81
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,958
- Woman #2: THANKS A LOT!

82
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,208
- I HAD THE OUTLAW.
 WHICH GIRL IS SHE?

83
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,375
- NEVER MIND.
I'LL GO TELL HER MYSELF.

84
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
- AT LEAST TELL ME HER NAME.

85
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,125
- Man #2: IT TAKES THREE DAYS
TO GET THERE BY SAND STEAMER.

86
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,541
FORGET IT!

87
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,291
- TRUST ME, YOU GOT ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,458
IT'LL BE FINE.
- ALL RIGHT, IF YOU SAY SO.

89
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,666
- ( chatter continues )

90
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,583
- Man #3: HA, I'M GONNA
GET YOU FOR THAT.

91
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,208
- WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
LINDA.

92
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,166
- ( crying )

93
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,625
( voice breaking )
THESE ARE GOOD... 

94
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,958
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

95
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,416
WHY ARE THEY SO...

96
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,583
- ( echoing )
VASH!

97
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,791
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

98
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,500
WHY DO ALL THESE TERRIBLE THINGS
ALWAYS HAVE TO HAPPEN

99
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
WHENEVER YOU'RE AROUND?

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,583
WHY DID MR. WOLFWOOD
HAVE TO DIE?

101
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,875
( normal voice ) WHO IS HE?
YOU MUST TELL ME NOW.

102
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:26,958
- YOU HEARD ABOUT IT.

103
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,500
- YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

104
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,291
- I AM TO BLAME.

105
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,041
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME
THAT FRIENDS DIE.

106
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,083
THEY ALL GOT INVOLVED
BECAUSE OF ME.

107
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,041
I'M SORRY.

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,208
BUT THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T STAY WITH ME.

109
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,250
- ( exhales )

110
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,583
I ASKED YOU
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION,

111
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,250
AND I EXPECT A DECENT ANSWER.

112
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,958
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

113
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,708
PLEASE, FOR ONCE,

114
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,666
I NEED YOU
TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

115
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,750
- AS LONG AS HE LIVES,
I COULD NEVER DIE HONORABLY,

116
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,833
AS LONG AS KNIVES IS ALIVE.

117
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,333
- WHO'S KNIVES?

118
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,583
- MY BROTHER,
I'M SORRY TO SAY.

119
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,083
- ( gasps )

120
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,125
- ( soft rock music playing )

121
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,916
- ( inaudible )

122
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,416
- WELL, THAT'S IT.

123
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,250
NOW I NEED TO SPEND
A LITTLE TIME ALONE, OKAY?

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,958
- ( door opens )

125
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,916
- AND BESIDES,

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,583
THERE'S A GIRL IN PAIN
WHO COULD REALLY USE

127
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,541
YOUR SUPPORT RIGHT NOW.

128
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,625
- ALL THIS TIME.

129
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,041
- Milly:
ARE YOU SURE?

130
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,208
- HUH?

131
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,500
- I MEAN, DON'T YOU WANNA
FOLLOW HIM?

132
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,458
- FRANKLY, I'M GLAD THAT NO-GOOD
TROUBLEMAKER IS GONE.

133
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
LET'S GET THE REPORT IN QUICK,

134
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,291
AND GET THEM TO TAKE US OFF
THIS DETAIL ONCE AND FOR ALL.

135
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,208
THERE'S SO MANY BETTER THINGS
OUT THERE.

136
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
BESIDES, WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH LIVES--

137
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,083
- I CAN HANDLE IT, MERYL.

138
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,458
- BUT YOU--

139
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,750
- UNLESS WE GO AFTER HIM NOW,

140
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
THERE'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT
WE MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN

141
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,500
IN THIS LIFETIME.

142
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,750
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,
MERYL?  HMM?

143
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,083
( giggles ) I'M COMPLETELY,
TOTALLY, PERFECTLY FINE NOW.

144
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
IN FACT, I NEED TO
GET UP AND GO.

145
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,666
AND BESIDES,
AS WE BOTH KNOW,

146
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,000
IF WE DON'T WORK,
WE DON'T GET PAID.

147
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,375
- MILLY.

148
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,000
- ( sniffles )

149
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,500
ALL RIGHT,
FIRST THING'S FIRST--

150
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,541
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHICH WAY HE WENT?

151
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,791
- YES.

152
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,875
- GREAT, THEN WE HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

153
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,458
I'LL BE READY
IN A FEW MINUTES.

154
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,000
GATHER ALL OF YOUR THINGS
TOGETHER TOO, MERYL.

155
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,708
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
LEAVE A THING BEHIND,

156
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,250
BECAUSE WE WON'T
HAVE TIME TO COME BACK.

157
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,250
- ( crying )
YES.

158
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,625
OF COURSE.

159
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,208
- Boy #1:
HEY, THIS GUY'S CRYING.

160
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,458
- YEAH, AND HE'S A GROWN-UP.

161
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,625
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

162
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,791
EVERYONE FEELS LIKE CRYING
SOMETIMES.

163
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,625
- WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

164
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,291
- A FRIEND OF MINE
WENT AWAY, AND I'M SAD.

165
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,625
- WHY?
- BECAUSE--

166
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,208
- HE DIED BECAUSE OF YOU,
DIDN'T HE?

167
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,000
- ( gasps )

168
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,625
- IT WAS YOUR FAULT. YOU'RE THE
ONE KILLED WOLFWOOD, AREN'T YOU?

169
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,041
- YEAH, IF YOU HADN'T SWAYED HIM
WITH YOUR STUPID IDEAS,

170
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,375
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE.

171
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,791
YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE.

172
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,375
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

173
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,333
- Both: UH...

174
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,625
- ( gasps )

175
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,750
- I DECIDED TO DO THIS
AS MY HUMBLE WAY

176
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,125
OF EXHIBITING GRIEF
AT THE LOSS OF A GOOD FRIEND.

177
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,458
HOW'D I DO?

178
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,750
- YOU AGAIN.

179
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,958
DAMN YOU!

180
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,208
- ARE YOU GOING TO DRAW?

181
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,958
- PLEASE STOP.
DON'T DO IT.

182
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
SOMEONE ELSE WILL DIE
IF YOU DO THIS.

183
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,500
ANOTHER ONE WILL DIE.

184
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY DRAW.

186
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,000
YOU SEEM TO THINK
YOU'VE NEVER KILLED ANYONE,

187
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,458
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
VERY SADLY MISTAKEN.

188
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,416
YOU'VE MANAGED TO FOOL
NO ONE BUT YOURSELF.

189
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,916
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,458
BECAUSE YOUR HANDS AREN'T DIRTY,

191
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,833
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PERSONALLY
PULL THE TRIGGER,

192
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,375
THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT.

193
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,500
WHEN IN ACTUALITY,
YOU'VE KILLED COUNTLESS PEOPLE.

194
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,083
INCLUDING THE GUNG-HO GUNS
AND YOUR FRIEND...

195
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,458
NICHOLAS D. WOLFWOOD.

196
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,083
- I WAS FORCED TO DO THAT!
I HAD NO CHOICE!

197
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,250
- EVERY TIME YOU MAKE THAT FACE,
IT'S STRANGE.

198
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,625
MY LEFT ARM BEGINS
TO SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY,

199
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,208
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE
THE VERY ARM

200
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,416
THAT ATTACHED YOUR ARM
TO YOUR BODY.

201
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,416
- ( gasps )

202
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,791
- I WILL BE WAITING
FOR YOU ON THAT HILL.

203
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,500
IF YOU WISH TO SHOOT ME NOW,

204
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,708
GO AHEAD.

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
- ( Boy #1 groans )

206
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,541
- ( gasps )

207
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,791
- WHAT HAPPENED?
MY HEAD FEELS FUNNY.

208
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,291
- WHAT THE HELL?
- ( townspeople murmuring )

209
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,250
- ( groans )

210
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,541
- HOW DARE YOU.

211
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,125
HOW DARE YOU BE SO DAMN CASUAL

212
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,125
TO TOY WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.

213
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,583
- YOU'D DO THE SAME THING.
- ( gasps )

214
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,916
- YOU ALONE TURNED JULY
AND AUGUSTA TO RUBBLE

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,875
AND PUT A HUGE HOLE
IN THE FIFTH MOON AS WELL.

216
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,583
YOU CAN DENY IT,
BUT YOU'RE A MONSTER.

217
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,625
- Child:
MOM, WHERE ARE YOU?!

218
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,291
- YOU AND HE ARE EXACTLY
THE SAME BREED.

219
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,875
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

220
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,875
- I'M THE 11th GUNG-HO GUN,

221
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,083
MIDVALLEY THE HORNFREAK.

222
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,375
THE MAN WHO PLAYS 
THE GREATEST MUSIC

223
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,083
ON THE GREATEST STAGE
OF ALL.

224
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,250
IT'S TIME TO PLAY.

225
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,750
JOIN ME ON A NUMBER.

226
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,666
WON'T YOU, VASH THE STAMPEDE?

227
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,208
- VASH?  THE STAMPEDE?

228
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,166
- OH, NO.
NO WAY, IT CAN'T BE!

229
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,166
- ( townspeople screaming )

230
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
- ( rock music playing )

231
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,916
- ( saxophone playing )

232
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,458
- AAH!

233
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,291
WHAT THE--?

234
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,041
SOMEHOW HE'S ABLE
TO SYNCHRONIZE THE SOUND WAVES

235
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,708
FROM HIS HORN WITH THE PHYSICAL
SENSATION OF PAIN.

236
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,250
AAH!

237
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,791
- HMM.

238
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,416
SYLVIA IS RESPONDING
RATHER WELL TODAY.

239
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,916
HEY, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW,

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,833
BUT UP CLOSE,
THE SOUND THAT'S PRODUCED

241
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,041
BY EVEN A FAMOUS
TOP-QUALITY INSTRUMENT

242
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,416
CAN ACTUALLY SOUND
RATHER FLAT SOMETIMES.

243
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,041
OF COURSE THERE ARE
VARYING DEGREES,

244
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,708
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
ABLE TO BRING OUT

245
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,958
THE GREATEST SOUND.

246
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,041
A BEAUTIFUL MELODY IS 
GREETED WITH APPLAUSE.

247
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,041
THE AUDIENCE SHOUTS
WITH APPRECIATION. 

248
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,708
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF A SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.

249
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,166
- WHY DIDN'T YOU FINISH ME OFF?

250
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,791
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU COULD HAVE

251
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,166
TAKEN ME OUT BY NOW.

252
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,708
- THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE.

253
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,416
I'M UNDER HIS ORDERS.
THE CHOICE IS NOT MINE.

254
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,666
- KNIVES...

255
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,041
- CAN'T DEFY HIM.

256
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,833
ANYONE WORKING FOR KNIVES IS
AT HIS BECK AND CALL.

257
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,875
YOU RELINQUISH ALL RIGHTS
AND FREE THOUGHT.

258
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,750
END OF DISCUSSION.
- YOU'RE WRONG!

259
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,416
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT!

260
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,416
- A SUPERIOR BEING
TRYING TO SHOW MERCY?

261
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,166
- HELP ME, I--

262
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,083
I CAN'T STOP MYSELF!

263
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,416
OH, NO!
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!

264
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,666
- LEGATO AGAIN.

265
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,916
- HMM!

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,916
- ( saxophone playing )
- NO!

267
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,250
- NO, PLEASE!

268
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,166
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

269
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,083
- AAH!

270
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,083
- SOMEBODY HELP STOP ME!
PLEASE!

271
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,791
HELP ME!

272
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,250
- ( panting )

273
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,500
AAH!

274
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,541
WELL, THAT'S IT. NOW I NEED TO
SPEND A LITTLE TIME ALONE, OKAY?

275
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,625
- ( animal bellows )

276
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,041
- DON'T START BROODING, MERYL.

277
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,625
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY.

278
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,291
AND BESIDES,
YOU'LL REGRET IT LATER,

279
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,500
SO JUST STOP.

280
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,083
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

281
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,291
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

282
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,791
THIS IS NO TIME
TO LOSE MY NERVE.

283
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,750
GOTTA KEEP GOING, RIGHT?
MERYL?

284
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,375
LET'S GO!

285
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,083
- ( grunts, groans )

286
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,750
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

287
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,791
HERE, DRINK SOME WATER.

288
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,083
( gasps )

289
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,500
- ( all groaning )

290
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,958
- TALK ABOUT IRON WILL.

291
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,291
- ( groans )

292
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,500
- YOUR DEDICATION IS
COMMENDABLE.

293
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,833
IT'S NOT OVER YET.
THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

294
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,833
- ( gasping )

295
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,541
- STOP IT!

296
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,583
- YOU GOTTA BE COOL.

297
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,625
- AAH.

298
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,750
- ( air hisses )

299
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,916
- DAMN!

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,291
MY "B"-FLAT!

301
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,250
MY "B"-FLAT'S GONE!

302
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,750
- SORRY, THE SHOW'S OVER.

303
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,916
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,916
YOU BEEN TRYING
FOR A RICOCHET SHOT?

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,416
( chuckles )

306
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,208
MAYBE, BUT IT'S NOT QUITE TIME
FOR THE CURTAIN CALL YET.

307
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,166
HA.

308
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,875
I HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS
AS MY FATE.

309
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,708
THE DESTINY
OF THE DYING.

310
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,791
- DON'T, STOP IT!

311
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,958
IF YOU SHOOT NOW...

312
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,666
DON'T!  NO!

313
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,625
- HEH.

314
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,791
- LEGATO...

315
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,083
- WE SHOULD HAVE DIED A VERY
LONG TIME AGO, YOU AND I.

316
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,625
THE INSTANT WE FELL UPON
THIS SANDY LAND WITHOUT PAIN

317
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,625
AND WITHOUT SORROW.

318
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,291
NOW THE SCHEDULE HAS 
MERELY BEEN SET BACK.

319
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,125
THE END IS NEAR.

320
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,916
IT IS TIME TO EMBRACE IT.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,750
THAT IS WHY I MUST...

322
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,083
I MUST END IT.

323
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,875
END IT NOW.

324
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,750
THIS IS THE CLIMAX,

325
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,916
VASH THE STAMP--

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,916
- ( gunshot )

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,875
- ( breathing heavily )

328
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,916
- SO DO YOU HATE ME?

329
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,250
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

330
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,750
IF YOU DO,
I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU.

331
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,750
SO MANY SAD THINGS
HAPPENED TO YOU.

332
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,083
WHETHER THEY ARE FRIEND
OR ENEMY,

333
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,750
THE PEOPLE YOU MEET DIE.

334
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,250
IT'S ENOUGH
TO SAP ONE'S TEARS.

335
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,250
- SHUT UP!

336
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,708
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT
FINISHED YET.

337
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,875
DID YOU REALLY EXPECT THE END
TO COME SO EASILY?

338
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,750
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE NOT HUMAN?

339
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,875
IT IS TIME TO REALIZE
EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE. 

340
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,916
- NO.
PLEASE, IT CAN'T BE.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,458
- THERE'S POWER IN THAT LIGHT.

342
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,791
POWER THAT YOU HAVE
ALWAYS POSSESSED.

343
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,625
EVEN MORE, THIS REPRESENTS
WHAT YOU ARE.

344
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,708
- AAH.
( grunts )

345
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,666
AAH!

346
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,291
I-- I CAN'T--

347
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,500
NOT AGAIN.

348
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,333
NOT AGAIN!

349
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,375
( breathing heavily )

350
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,458
- HAVEN'T YOU GIVEN UP
YET, VASH?

351
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,458
IT'S REALLY QUITE ANNOYING.

352
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,750
- ( gunshot )
- AAH.

353
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,583
( groans )

354
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,416
BASTARD.

355
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,750
- YOU'RE OUT OF OPTIONS.

356
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,541
FIGHT BACK OR YOU'LL DIE.

357
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,541
- ( gunshot )

358
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,500
- ( groans )

359
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,875
- ( softly chuckles )

360
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,208
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD?

361
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,416
I WOULD WELCOME THIS
TO BE MY TIME.

362
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,583
AFTER ALL, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR SUCH AN EGOCENTRIC,

363
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,791
INCOMPLETE LIFE

364
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,041
LIKE MINE TO BE ALLOWED
TO CONTINUE ANYWAY.

365
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,375
GIVE ME THE GIFT OF NOTHINGNESS.

366
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,041
GIVE ME DEATH.

367
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,291
MY MASTER IS WAITING FOR YOU.

368
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,458
HE'S LOOKING FORWARD
TO YOUR VISIT.

369
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,041
I WAS COMPELLED
TO ATTACH THIS ARM TO MYSELF.

370
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,916
I HAD TO, BECAUSE YOU
REFUSED TO BE BY HIS SIDE.

371
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,625
- ( grunts )

372
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,500
- KILL ME.

373
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,958
- I CAN'T.

374
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,708
- GO AHEAD.

375
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,416
- I CAN'T!

376
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,083
- ( woman panting )

377
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,083
- ( gasps )
- ( grunts )

378
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,625
- MILLY!

379
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,291
- ( thuds )
- ( both groaning )

380
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,458
- STOP THEM.
NO MORE!

381
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,208
- Both:
AAH!

382
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,833
- I SAID STOP IT NOW!

383
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,833
- THEN SHOOT ME!

384
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,541
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
KILL ME.

385
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,708
IT'S SIMPLE.

386
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,500
ALL YOU NEED DO IS
PULL THE TRIGGER.

387
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,041
ONCE YOU HAVE KILLED ME,

388
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,625
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER.

389
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,916
COME ON,
TIME TO CHOOSE.

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,625
YOU HAVE FREE WILL.

391
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,416
- STOP IT.
DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT.

392
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,125
- Milly and Meryl:
NO!

393
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,375
- Milly:
NO, PLEASE!

394
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,833
( whimpering )

395
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,208
- YOUR FAITH IS
HOPELESSLY OBSTINATE.

396
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,416
TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THE PRATTLINGS OF A WOMAN

397
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,916
WHO SPEAKS IN IDEALISTIC TERMS
THAT ARE WORTHLESS.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,791
- ( gasps )
- I GUESS THAT KIND OF THINKING

399
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,375
IS REASONABLE FOR
SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED

400
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,666
FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY.

401
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,666
BUT THAT--
THAT WAY OF LIFE IS PATHETIC.

402
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,458
EVEN COMICAL.

403
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,875
REM SAVEREM.

404
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,833
( chuckles )
A WASTED EXISTENCE

405
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,208
WHO ONLY SPOKE
IN AGGRAVATING LOGIC.

406
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,375
A WORTHLESS HUMAN BEING...

407
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,083
JUST LIKE ME.

408
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,625
BUT UNLIKE YOU.

409
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,708
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

410
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,416
- Wolfwood's voice: 
LUCK AND PERSISTENCE

411
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,916
WON'T WORK FOREVER.

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,541
- ( gunshot )

413
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,458
- Rem's voice: AS WE JOURNEY
THROUGH OUR LIVES,

414
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,958
WE MUST ALWAYS SEARCH FOR WAYS
TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

415
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,750
- ( girls groaning )

416
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,375
- Wolfwood's voice: DON'T FORCE
YOUR WAY OF LIFE UPON OTHERS.

417
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,833
- Rem's voice:
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT

418
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,625
TO TAKE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.

419
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,125
- Wolfwood's voice:
DON'T TELL ME YOUR DREAMS

420
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,083
IN A WORLD LIKE THIS.

421
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,541
- IF YOU KEEP YOUR VISION CLEAR,
YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THE FUTURE.

422
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,125
- Girls:
PLEASE, NO!

423
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,333
- ( gasps )

424
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,083
- Legato:
I UNDERSTAND...

425
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,250
MASTER.

426
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,416
VASH THE STAMPEDE
WILL EXPERIENCE

427
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,375
ETERNAL PAIN AND SUFFERING.

428
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,541
- ( laughing )

429
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,208
( maniacal laughter )

430
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,166
- ( end theme playing )

431
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

432
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,250
- Vash:
I WAS DREAMING, REM.

433
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,291
EVERYTHING WAS SO HORRIBLY DRY.

434
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,250
THEY'RE ON THAT PLANET.

435
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,583
EVEN PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

436
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,833
AS I WATCHED THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVED THERE FROM FAR AWAY,

437
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,500
I KEPT WONDERING
WHY THEY WENT ON LIVING...

438
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,250
HOW THEY KEPT ON LIVING.

439
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,083
REM, LISTEN TO ME, REM...

440
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,583
I DID A BAD THING.

441
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,583
I DID A BAD THING.

442
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,666
TELL ME,

443
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,625
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
