00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,875
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DOING JUST FINE.

12
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,791
( yawns )
GOOD MORNING. I'M SLEEPY.

13
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,041
- MILLY, YOU STAYED
UP ALL NIGHT...

14
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,208
- ...WRITING HOME TO YOUR
FAMILY AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?

15
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,958
- ( nervous chuckle )
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

16
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,500
WHEN YOU WRITE
TO EACH OF THEM SEPARATELY,

17
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,458
DOWN TO THE LAST
LITTLE NIECE AND NEPHEW.

18
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,916
- TADAH!
AT LEAST IT PAYS OFF.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,083
I'M GETTING RAVE REVIEWS.

20
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,666
THEY CALL MY LETTERS
"THE MILLY MONTHLY."

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,500
- QUALITY ASIDE, YOU COULD'VE
WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS BY NOW.

22
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,833
- WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT THAT?
DON'T YOU WRITE HOME?

23
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,458
- UH...

24
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,583
YEAH, WELL,
I USED TO WRITE AT FIRST,

25
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,875
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

26
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,833
BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE,
THAT'S NORMAL.

27
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,708
BESIDES, WHAT WOULD
THEY SAY IF I TOLD THEM

28
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,041
I WAS HANGING OUT
WITH VASH THE STAMPEDE?

29
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,333
- SO YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO WRITE, MERYL?

30
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,666
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT
TO WRITE TO THEM.

31
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,208
I GUESS
IT SOUNDS PRETTY LAME

32
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,041
TO SAY THAT
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

33
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,791
- ( gunfire )
- ( both gasp )

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,500
( both yell )

35
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,625
- ( people gasp,
chattering )

36
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,333
- OH GEE, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

37
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,750
I MUST'VE ACCIDENTALLY
PULLED THE TRIGGER.

38
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,125
- HOW DARE YOU!

39
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,458
YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE,
YOU IMPUDENT SCOUNDREL!

40
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,500
- WE'RE NOT DUMB ENOUGH
TO BE SCARED BY YOU

41
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,791
AND YOUR ROTTEN FRIENDS!

42
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,666
- OH YES, IT'S BECOME
CLEAR TO ME NOW.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,041
THERE'S A LOT OF MEANING
BEHIND THOSE WORDS, FRIENDS.

44
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,000
SO STAND UP WITH
YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH

45
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,500
AND SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY!

46
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,916
- WE WON'T GIVE UP OUR LAND
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO US!

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,791
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE THIS ANYMORE,

48
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,416
AND YOU CAN GO BACK
AND TELL THAT TO MORGAN!

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,291
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID,
YOU OLD GEEZERS?

50
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,583
- HEY, COME ON NOW.

51
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,291
MY GUN WENT OFF BY MISTAKE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,750
- Old man: A MISTAKE MY ASS,
YOU FAT-LIPPED GOLEM!

53
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,541
- WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

54
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,833
A GOLEM?  HA!

55
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,000
I'M LAUGHING SO HARD,

56
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,750
MY PISTOL'S TWITCHING.

57
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,416
- ( both yell, grunt )

58
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,333
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DANGEROUS THAT WAS!

59
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,250
( humphs )
IF YOU MAKE THIS BROOM HEAD MAD,

60
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,041
I GUARANTEE HE'LL LEAVE YOU
WITH A LOT MORE

61
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,000
THAN INJURIES
AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

62
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
GOOD GOD!

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,875
- YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO ARE DANGEROUS,

64
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,666
CLOTHESLINING HIM
FROM BEHIND LIKE THAT!

65
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,750
- ( chattering continues )
- ( clatters )

66
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,875
- HUH?
- ( creaking )

67
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,958
- ( screams, whimpers )

68
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,916
- MERYL,
THAT'S A SMALL SACRIFICE

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,375
FOR A GREAT CAUSE.
- I KNOW!  THAT'S RIGHT!

70
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,750
- WAY TO GO, MILLY!
- THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY?

71
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,208
- DID YOU SAY BODYGUARDS?
- EXACTLY.

72
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,083
IF YOU TWO WERE HERE
TO PROTECT US,

73
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,208
WE'D FEEL A WHOLE LOT SAFER.
- I'M SORRY.

74
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,125
THANKS, ANYWAY,
BUT COMPANY REGULATIONS

75
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,541
STRICTLY FORBID US
FROM TAKING ANY PART-TIME JOBS.

76
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,791
- I UNDERSTAND. HOW ABOUT
YOU, SON? ARE YOU INTERESTED?

77
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,625
- WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU ASKING HIM?!

78
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,333
- THE WAY THAT HE MOVED
WHEN HE PROTECTED US BACK THERE,

79
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,166
HE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY BRAVE.
- YOU DON'T SAY!

80
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,291
WELL, IT'S NOTHING.
I DO THE BEST I CAN.

81
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,166
( laughs )
- ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!

82
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,083
( growls )
HOW COULD YOU ASK HIM?!

83
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,041
DON'T YOU KNOW WHO
THIS BROOM HEAD IS, MISTER?

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,916
- WHAT IS IT, LITTLE LADY?
YOU WANT THE JOB NOW?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,666
- ( whimpering )
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,375
ONLY YOU WOULD THINK
OF USING YOUR POSITION

87
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,416
TO HELP OUT PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRULY IN NEED.

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,375
- UH, WELL,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

89
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,625
I THINK THE
SITUATION REPRESENTS

90
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,916
THE CATEGORY OF
RISK-PREVENTION TO THE "T."

91
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,291
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED
TO COME WITH US, MR. VASH?

92
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,166
- ( chuckling )
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

93
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,375
I GUESS SOMETHING WAS
BOTHERING ME, THAT'S ALL.

94
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,458
- Meryl: KEEP OUT OF THIS ONE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

95
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,083
- Vash: YES, MA'AM.

96
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,333
- YOU SEE THAT?
THAT'S OUR LAND THERE.

97
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,791
- ( Meryl gasps )

98
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,666
- ( birds chirping )

99
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
- Meryl:
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

100
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,875
HOW IS ALL OF THIS HERE

101
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,583
IF THERE'S NO ACCESS TO A SHIP?

102
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,041
- AMAZING.
IT'S JUST LIKE A GEO PLANT.

103
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,000
- NO, IT'S NOT JUST LIKE IT.

104
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,333
THIS IS A GEO PLANT.

105
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
- YES, WE BELIEVE
THAT A GEO PLANT

106
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,416
RAN ALONG A MINERAL VEIN
TO FORM THIS OFFSHOOT.

107
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,708
THE LAND VALUE HAS
SKYROCKETED SO HIGH,

108
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,333
IT'S WORTH AS MUCH
AS A SHIP 300 YARDS WIDE.

109
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,166
- THAT MAY BE,
BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN

110
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,583
THIS FAR
WITHOUT A LOT OF HELP.

111
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,666
IT WOULD'VE TAKEN
A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF EFFORT.

112
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,083
- I REMEMBER IT CLEARLY,
20 YEARS AGO IT WAS A TINY BUD.

113
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,083
BUT I COULDN'T
BELIEVE MY EYES.

114
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,583
JUST IMAGINING
HOW WE COULD RAISE

115
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,666
SUCH LUSH, BEAUTIFUL LAND
ON AN ARID PLANET LIKE THIS--

116
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THAT KEPT US GOING.

117
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,833
THAT'S RIGHT.
OUR LIVES, OUR DREAMS

118
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,375
AND OUR HOPES
ARE ALL HERE.

119
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,625
- IT IS AMAZING
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE,

120
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,958
BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH YOUR HIRING BODYGUARDS?

121
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,250
- YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE IN TOWN.

122
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,208
THAT WAS NOT
THE FIRST TIME.

123
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,416
THE LANDOWNER MORGAN

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,291
HAS BEEN THREATENING
US TIME AND AGAIN

125
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,750
TO HAND OVER
THE DEED OR ELSE.

126
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,041
BUT THAT IS
ALL GOING TO END TOMORROW.

127
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,208
ONCE WE GET THIS DEED
OVER TO CITY HALL,

128
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,583
THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO.

129
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,666
Man: HEY, GUYS,
IT'S TIME TO CHANGE SHIFTS.

130
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,083
- ( door opens )

131
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,125
- OH, IT'S FREEZING OUT THERE.
- IT GETS COLD AT NIGHT.

132
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,541
- I APPRECIATE
ALL OF YOUR HELP.

133
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,041
- HEY, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS,

134
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,583
THIS PLACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
OUR PLAYGROUND, HUH?

135
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,083
- YEAH, AND WE'RE
NEVER GONNA GIVE IT UP.

136
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,500
- BESIDES, WE GOT THESE 
TWO GORGEOUS GIRLS TONIGHT

137
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,208
TO KEEP US COMPANY.
- ( women laugh nervously )

138
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,583
- YEAH, I ALMOST WISH THAT
MORNING DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.

139
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,166
- ( all laugh )

140
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,958
- THAT REMINDS ME:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT BROOM BOY?

141
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,500
- I THOUGHT THAT FOR NOW WE
SHOULD HANDLE THIS WITHOUT HIM.

142
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,500
I TOLD HIM TO GO BACK
TO TOWN IN THE MEANTIME.

143
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,625
- WHAT'S THIS?  A LITTLE FIGHT
WITH THE BOYFRIEND?

144
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,583
- ( coughs )
HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND!

145
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,583
- ( both laugh )

146
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,375
- STOP IT. I DON'T
EVEN LIKE HIM.

147
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,041
LET'S GO, MILLY.  WE HAVE
TO GO DO THE ROUNDS NOW.

148
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,541
- COMING!
- HUH?

149
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,041
OH.

150
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,416
- ( shivers )
IT SURE IS COLD.

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,208
HEY, MERYL,
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

152
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,500
- IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

153
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,083
IT'S JUST THAT
I KNOW I'VE SEEN THE FACE

154
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,583
IN THAT PICTURE
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

155
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,791
THE ONLY THING IS
I CAN'T SEEM TO PLACE IT.

156
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,125
- OH, YOU MEAN LIKE
A PASSING FANCY?

157
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,708
- A PASSING LIKENESS.

158
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,583
I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE
I'VE SEEN THAT FACE BEFORE.

159
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,541
- ( rustling )
- ( guns cock )

160
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,958
Women:
WHO GOES THERE?

161
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,958
OOH.  WAIT.
DON'T SHOOT!

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
- ( both gasp )
- OH NO, IT'S THAT MAN.

163
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
- WELL,
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE--

164
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,291
THE TWO OF YOU ONCE AGAIN.

165
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,291
YOU CAN PUT
YOUR GUNS AWAY, LADIES,

166
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,041
OBVIOUSLY
I'VE COME HERE UNARMED.

167
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,083
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

168
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,458
- I CAME TO TRY
AND TALK DAD OUT OF THIS.

169
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,500
MORGAN MEANS
BUSINESS THIS TIME.

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,958
- "TALK DAD OU--" OH?

171
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,291
AH!  THE PICTURE!

172
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,416
- ( chuckles )
YUP, THAT'S ME, ALL RIGHT.

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,875
THE UNWORTHY SON.

174
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,250
NOW WHERE IS HE?
- ( both grunt )

175
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,000
- WHAT REASON
COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE

176
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,791
TO POINT A GUN
AT YOUR PARENTS?

177
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,041
- OH.
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,

178
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,291
BUT IF YOU MUST KNOW,

179
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,291
IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT FOR
NOT LISTENING TO REASON.

180
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,791
I HAD TO DO IT OR THEY'D
NEVER GET THE HINT.

181
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,791
- ( grunts )
YOU... FAT-HEADED JERK!

182
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CUT IT OUT!

183
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,375
- STOP IT!  MILLY!

184
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,750
MILLY!
- YOU ROTTEN INGRATE!

185
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,500
EVIL AND STUPID GOOD
FOR NOTHING, AWFUL SON!

186
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,583
- WHAT?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

187
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,666
- ( door opens )

188
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,708
- Old man: WHAT'S ALL
THE COMMOTION?

189
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,458
- HUH?
- WHO'S FIGHTING OUT THERE?

190
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,916
OH.  BADWICK.

191
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,291
- YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT THE
HELL YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

192
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,666
LOOK AT YOU GUYS
STANDING THERE.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,250
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN CARE
OF A DAMN THING!

194
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,166
- UH, WELL, BADWICK WANTED
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE

195
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,375
TO PERSUADE HIS PARENTS,

196
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,916
SO WE DIDN'T REALLY
SEE ANY HARM IN THAT,

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,708
SO WE JUST--
- ( growling )

198
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,250
- ( men whimpering )
- HE DID, DID HE?

199
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
I HIRED HIM
FOR HIS DILIGENCE,

200
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,750
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT IF HE CAN'T
EVEN KILL HIS OWN PARENTS?

201
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,791
EVIDENTLY, I MADE
AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT,

202
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,375
HAVING ANY FAITH IN HIM.

203
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,250
- ( thundering footsteps )
- HMM?

204
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,750
- ( men yelp )
- WHAT WAS THAT?

205
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,750
- HEY!
- ( mumbling )

206
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,791
- ( men yelp )

207
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,958
- ( crying )
- ( men scream )

208
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,250
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

209
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,041
THAT'S MY CAR
YOU JUST DESTROYED!

210
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,208
- ( crying continues )
- OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME!

211
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,500
YOU PROBABLY DID SOMETHING
CROOKED TO GET IT, ANYWAY.

212
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,125
LISTEN, MR. MORGAN,

213
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,125
MY FATHER
AND LITTLE BROTHER'S BAIL MONEY

214
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,250
IS RIDING ON THE SUCCESS
OF THIS LITTLE SCENARIO.

215
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,916
IF YOU TRY TO TAKE IT
OUT OF OUR PAY,

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURSELF FLATTENED.

217
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,333
- UH, UH... YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

218
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,916
I CAN APPRECIATE
THE VALUE OF FAMILY.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,250
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT CAR ANYHOW.
- Men: HUH?

220
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,750
- GREAT!
NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,

221
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,000
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE STRENGTH OF
OUR STEEL-PLATED FAMILY BONDS!

222
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,208
- ( shouts )
- LOOK OUT BELOW!

223
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,083
- Badwick: SO YOU DECIDED
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LISTEN TO ME

224
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,166
NO MATTER WHAT.
- WE WILL NOT GIVE HIM THE DEED.

225
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,958
- YOUR LITTLE BAND OF
VIGILANTES ISN'T GONNA BE ABLE

226
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
TO HELP YOU IF YOU DO THIS.
YOU'LL ALL BE SLAUGHTERED.

227
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,291
- I THINK OF MORGAN
AS A CHILD WHO WANTS

228
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,208
A PRICELESS TREASURE
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT!

229
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,208
- ( growling )
- IF NOT CARED FOR PROPERLY,

230
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,375
THIS LAND WOULD QUICKLY
DRY UP AND DIE.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
BADWICK MY SON,
THIS LAND LIVES AND BREATHES.

232
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,458
- YOU THINK LAND IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN YOUR OWN LIFE?

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,708
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU CAN SO WILLINGLY CONTINUE

234
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,041
TO KEEP SACRIFICING
EVERYTHING FOR THIS LAND!

235
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,000
DAMN YOU!
MAX WAS RIGHT.

236
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,500
HE CHOSE TO DIE INSTEAD OF BEING
RAISED BY WORTHLESS PARENTS!

237
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,458
- ( both gasp )

238
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,333
- ( gasps )
- ( whistling )

239
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,416
- HUH?
- Both: HUH?

240
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
- ( whistling louder )
- HUH?

241
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,000
- ( rock music playing )

242
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,250
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- RAIN?

243
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,583
- ( yells )
- Both: HUH?

244
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,291
- ( men gasp )
- ( laughing )

245
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,416
- ( whimpers )
- HUH?  WHERE'S HE GOING?

246
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,750
- ( yells )
- WHERE'S HE GOING?

247
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,708
- ( squeals ) YEAH,
THAT WAS REALLY SMOOTH, MOM.

248
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,208
NOW PLACE THE NEXT SHOT
ABOUT FIVE YARDS OVER THERE.

249
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,708
- PLEASE DON'T HIT THE TREES.
THAT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

250
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,250
- HUH?
- I SEE NO POINT IN IT.

251
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,458
- JEEZ, YOU'RE RUINING
ALL MY FUN.

252
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,583
WAIT, HOLD ON A MINUTE!

253
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,166
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHO WE ARE?

254
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,791
PATRICIA, TONCHIKI,

255
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,166
CHINPEI AND THE ONE
HEADING HOME IS KANTA.

256
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,750
ALL TOGETHER WE ARE,
THE TOTALLY INVINCIBLE TEAM

257
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,208
OF MARILYN NEBRASKA
AND FRIENDS!

258
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,708
- ( moans )

259
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,791
- ( laughs )
- ( moans )

260
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,125
- WHAT? "YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING,

261
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,416
SO DON'T HOG THE LIMELIGHT"?

262
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,083
OH MOM, YOU'RE FUNNY.

263
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,541
DON'T BE SUCH
A STICK IN THE MUD.

264
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,833
- I SURE HOPE THAT THEY'RE
WORTH ALL THE MONEY

265
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,708
WE'RE PAYING THEM.

266
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,708
- ALL RIGHT, MOM!
COME ON!

267
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,791
NOW LET'S GIVE CHINPEI A WHIRL!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

268
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,625
- ( moaning )
- READY... TAKE AIM...

269
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:04,458
AND FIRE!  WHOO-HOO!
- ( grunts )

270
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,833
- ( men shouting, laughing )

271
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,458
- HEY, THEY'RE COMING!

272
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,958
- WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!

273
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,541
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

274
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,916
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE YET.

275
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,208
WHAT DO THEY EXPECT ME
TO DO NOW?

276
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,583
- COME ON,
IT'S JUST ABOUT SHOWTIME.

277
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,666
- UM, YEAH, RIGHT, BUT--

278
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,250
- ( crashes )
- ( women groan )

279
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,291
- ( Badwick laughs )
IT FIGURES.

280
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,000
- Women: HUH?

281
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,375
- ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD JUST RUN FROM THEM.

282
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,208
- Old man: THAT MAY BE SO.
- All: HMM?

283
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,291
- ( gasps )
- MOM?  DAD?

284
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,625
- GO AHEAD AND RUN IF YOU WANT.

285
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,166
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO STAY HERE AND DIE WITH US.

286
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,125
- Badwick: WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

287
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,125
- ( explosions )
- ( screaming )

288
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,583
- THOSE GUYS ARE REALLY SERIOUS,

289
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,625
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.

290
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,125
- ( Patricia moaning )

291
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,083
- ( laughs )

292
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,750
- Man: WE NEED MORE BULLETS!
- ( gunfire )

293
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,250
- ( panting )

294
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,583
- THIS WHOLE THING HAS
TURNED INTO A REAL MESS!

295
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,333
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, MERYL?

296
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,583
MERYL?

297
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,291
- ( explosions )
- ( screaming )

298
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,625
- DARN!
WE JUST CAN'T STOP 'EM!  HUH?

299
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,041
- I AM SORRY THIS HAPPENED.

300
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,166
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW
AND THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

301
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,041
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.
( crying )

302
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
- HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

303
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,583
- WELL, HAVE WE COME
TO AN UNDERSTANDING, OLD MAN?

304
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,166
- SURE, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT A SCOUNDREL

305
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
AND A PIG YOU REALLY ARE.

306
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,458
- DAD, STOP THAT!
- DON'T WORRY.

307
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,000
THERE'S NO WAY MORGAN'S
GOING TO SHOOT HIM.

308
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,791
AT LEAST NOT YET, ANYWAY,

309
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,083
BECAUSE THE LAND WOULD
NEVER BE HIS WITHOUT THE DEED.

310
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT CRAZY OLD MAN.

311
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,541
WHY'S HE DOING THAT?  OW!

312
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,625
- ARE YOU REALLY
THAT MUCH OF AN IDIOT?  HMM?

313
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,166
HE'S DOING IT TO SAVE
THE LAND, ME AND YOU.

314
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T SEE THAT.

315
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,458
- HUH?

316
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,000
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT

317
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,666
ABOUT YOUR FATHER
ALL THESE YEARS,

318
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,416
BUT I'M SURE HE LOVES YOU

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,625
AND IS WILLING TO RISK
HIS LIFE FOR YOU.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,875
- I'M AFRAID IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THIS LOVEY-DOVEY CRAP.

321
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,916
UNLESS WE GIVE IN, MA,
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE HERE.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,083
- THIS LAND JUST EATS MONEY.

323
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,083
I'M NOT SURE WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO YOU,

324
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,416
BUT IT'S A BURDEN
I'M WILLING TO TAKE ON.

325
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,416
HERE IS A NEW CLAIM,

326
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,750
A WAY OUT OF THIS MESS THAT
IS ACTUALLY WORTH SOMETHING.

327
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,166
I'LL FILL IN
THE AMOUNT RIGHT NOW,

328
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,375
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL ME
HOW MANY ZEROES YOU WANT.

329
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,416
- ( gunshot )
- HMM?

330
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,416
- I THINK
MY ANSWER'S PRETTY CLEAR.

331
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,625
NOW BEAT IT!

332
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,458
- SO YOU WANT AN
EARLY DEATH, DO YOU?

333
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,208
VERY WELL,
I'LL ACCOMMODATE YOU.

334
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,916
- Meryl's voice:
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,458
- GO AHEAD AND KILL ME.
BUT THE MOMENT YOU DO,

336
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,708
YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.

337
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,625
CAN'T YOU SEE ALL THE
WITNESSES STANDING HERE?

338
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,375
- ( laughing )

339
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,291
- ( guns cocking )

340
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,291
- DID YOU SAY "WITNESSES"?

341
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,250
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
I WON'T LEAVE A SOUL STANDING.

342
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,958
MY JOB WON'T BE FINISHED HERE
UNTIL THE LAST MAN IS DEAD,

343
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,333
I ASSURE YOU.
- ( both gasp )

344
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,250
- Milly: YOU CAN'T!
( pants )

345
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,208
- ( clangs )
- HUH?

346
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,333
- NO, MILLY!
- EXCUSE ME,

347
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,291
BUT DIDN'T YOUR FATHER
EVER TEACH YOU THAT IT'S WRONG

348
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,208
TO TAKE THINGS
THAT BELONG TO SOMEONE ELSE?!

349
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,875
- BE CAREFUL, LITTLE LADY.

350
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,208
- ( laughs )
ARE YOU THE TOUGH LITTLE HELPER?

351
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,458
- YES, I AM.
NOW YOU BE QUIET.

352
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,708
- MILLY.

353
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,208
- Morgan: YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME, LITTLE LADY.

354
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,458
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

355
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,208
YOU'RE ALL DESTINED TO
BECOME CORPSES, ANYWAY.

356
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,416
- ( whimpers )
- ( breathing hard )

357
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,833
- ( Morgan humphs ) CHARMING AS
THIS IS, I'M GETTING TIRED.

358
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,166
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

359
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,750
- Meryl: I DON'T THINK
SO, MR. MORGAN.

360
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,333
- All: HUH?

361
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,958
- NOW THAT I'VE HEARD
YOUR GRUESOME PLAN,

362
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,166
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
LET YOU OFF THAT EASILY.

363
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,916
MAKE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST TWITCH

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,333
AND I'LL BE ALL OVER YOU AND
YOUR SICK LITTLE BAND OF THUGS.

365
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,125
- OH, MERYL,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

366
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,791
I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT NEXT TIME

367
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,833
YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE
BEFORE YOU ACT, MILLY.

368
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,958
YOU MIGHT LIVE A LOT LONGER.
- RIGHT.

369
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,958
- ( groaning )

370
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,625
- ( running footsteps )
- Old woman: BADWICK.

371
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
- ( grunts )
- BADWICK!

372
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,208
- FREEZE.  I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF YOU.

373
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,625
WHY DID IT
HAVE TO COME TO THIS?

374
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,166
IF YOU HAD ONLY TAKEN
THE MONEY AND SOLD THE LAND,

375
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,541
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO DIE

376
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,916
AND WE'D ALL BE SAFE FROM HARM.

377
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,458
I SAID FREEZE!
- ( cocks )

378
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,875
YOU KNOW, MILLY,
WHEN YOU GOT ANGRY BEFORE

379
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,291
YOU WERE RIGHT
IN CONFRONTING THEM.

380
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,916
WE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED
WHEN SOMEONE THREATENS

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,708
THEIR OWN PARENTS AND DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO STOP THEM.

382
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,583
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
- ( Morgan laughing )

383
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,291
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

384
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,291
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN TURN THE TIDE

385
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,541
WITH THOSE TINY DERRINGERS?
- UHH...

386
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,166
YEAH. WANNA FIND OUT
WHAT I CAN DO WITH THEM?

387
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,708
THAT IS IF YOU
HAVE THE GUTS

388
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,125
AND WANT TO RISK TAKING
A CHANCE ON THE ODDS.

389
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,125
- GO ON.
( humphs )

390
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,125
- ( Patricia grunts )

391
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,291
- ( motorcycle revving )
- WHAT?

392
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,250
- HUH?
- ALL RIGHT, MORGAN, ENOUGH!

393
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,666
I'VE GOT THE DOCUMENT!

394
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,333
I'VE GOT WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN ASKING FOR!

395
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,583
- SON, DON'T DO IT!

396
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,125
- AH.  WELL DONE.

397
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,125
HUH?

398
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,916
- ( all gasp )

399
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,208
- ( growls )
GET HIM NOW!

400
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,375
- ( yelling )
- ( gasps )

401
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,333
- ( both gasp )

402
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,541
- ( grunts )
- ( gun clicks )

403
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,791
IT CAN'T-- NO!

404
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,458
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

405
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,583
Meryl's voice:
BUT I HAVE TO TRY.

406
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
- ( yells )
- ( screams )

407
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,583
( groaning )

408
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,125
- ( Patricia and Morgan gasp )

409
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,125
- THAT WAS
REALLY AMAZING, MERYL!

410
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,583
- I DID THAT?

411
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,166
- THAT MAKES US EVEN NOW FOR
YOUR HELP ON THE SANDSTEAMER.

412
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,541
HUH?  HEY!

413
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,833
IS THAT ALL THE TIME I GET?!

414
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,708
- WELL THEN,
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

415
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,625
DON'T SAY SHE DIDN'T WARN YOU.

416
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,625
NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE WRATH
OF MERYL'S DERRINGERS!

417
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,916
CONSIDER YOURSELF FORTUNATE
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE!

418
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,375
HER NEXT TARGETS ARE GOING
TO BE YOUR HEARTS AND BRAINS

419
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,875
AND THEN YOU'RE THROUGH.

420
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,583
- ARE YOU INSANE?

421
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,666
THAT WAS NOTHING MORE
THAN A LUCKY SHOT.

422
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,250
THAT GUN COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE DONE THIS.

423
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,416
HUH?  COULD IT HAVE?
- ( whimpering )

424
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,833
-  Marilyn: NO!

425
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,333
- ( Patricia crying )
- ( crying ) HOW COULD THIS BE?

426
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,791
OUR SUPER COOL TECHNIQUE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

427
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,666
TOTALLY INVINCIBLE!

428
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,333
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
STOP THAT THIS INSTANT,

429
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,166
YOU BLITHERING COWARD.
THAT ADVANCED PAYMENT

430
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,083
I MADE YOU WASN'T CHEAP,
AND I EXPECT RESULTS!

431
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
SO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER RIGHT
NOW! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

432
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,791
( screams )
- ( crying continues )

433
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,791
- Morgan: OH!  OH!
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MOTHER.

434
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,500
I'M SURE CHINPEI IS FINE.

435
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

436
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,541
- Man: SO GO HELP HIM.

437
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,791
OF COURSE, IF YOUR SON
MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU,

438
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,916
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
THROWING HIM AROUND?

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,250
- GET OFF.  GET OFF!

440
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,125
- Man: I CAN'T HANDLE
ANY MORE OF THIS.

441
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,541
LET'S BEAT IT.
- Man #2: RIGHT.

442
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,541
- ( crying continues )

443
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,625
- ( old man groans )

444
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,833
- Old woman: WHAT'S
WRONG, MY DEAR?

445
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,125
- I THINK I MIGHT'VE
PULLED SOMETHING.

446
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,750
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

447
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,916
- YES, I'M SURE IT WILL.
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

448
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,375
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

449
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,375
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TRUST HIM.

450
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,541
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND
THE WORDS TO THANK YOU BOTH

451
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,916
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
- ( both laugh )

452
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,416
- ESPECIALLY YOU, MS. MERYL.

453
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,958
I WANT TO SHARE
SOMETHING WITH YOU...

454
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,250
FROM AN OLD MAN
WHO RAISED AN IDIOT SON.

455
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,750
EVERYONE MAKES
THEIR OWN CHOICES.

456
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,458
NOTHING COULD
COMPARE TO THE LOVE

457
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,416
BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD.

458
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,083
LOVE FOR THEM DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE A BURDEN.

459
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,750
INSTEAD OF WORRYING
ABOUT IT,

460
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,625
DO SOMETHING MORE SIMPLE,
YET VERY IMPORTANT.

461
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,916
WALK YOUR OWN PATH
WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH.

462
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,208
YOUR LIFE IS THEIR LIFE.

463
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,416
THE FACT THAT
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE

464
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,750
HELPS THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE
TO LIVE THROUGH YOU.

465
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
- Badwick's voice:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SO GREAT

466
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,041
ABOUT THIS STUPID DEED.

467
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,666
( groaning )

468
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,291
- THIS IS THE REAL DEED?
- Badwick: YEAH.

469
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,791
NOW IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.

470
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,083
- HEY!  HOLD ON A MOMENT, SIR.
- HUH?

471
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,750
- THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE MORE
CLAIM TRANSFER IN THE ENVELOPE.

472
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,083
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IT.

473
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,250
THE BENEFICIARY,
AS WRITTEN HERE,

474
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,916
IS BADWICK.
ISN'T THAT YOU?

475
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
- ( gasps )

476
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,291
( breathes shakily )

477
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,833
YES.  THAT'S ME.

478
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,625
- Milly: YIKES!

479
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,500
MERYL, WE'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT!

480
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,458
- I'M SORRY, MILLY! THIS TIME
IT WAS ACTUALLY MY FAULT

481
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,750
FOR STAYING UP
ALL NIGHT WRITING.  AH!

482
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,875
- ( meowing )

483
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,958
- Milly: MERYL!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

484
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,208
VASH'S BUS IS
GETTING READY TO GO!

485
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,833
THEY'RE GONNA LEAVE
WITHOUT US!

486
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,333
- I'M COMING, I'M COMING!

487
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,250
- ( theme music playing )

488
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,083
( singing in Japanese )

489
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,791
- PEOPLE JUDGE PEOPLE.

490
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,500
LIVES ARE BEING CUT SHORT

491
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,541
BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S
PERSONAL LOGIC--

492
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,541
MOTHERS, FATHERS, FRIENDS--

493
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,583
THEIR ENTIRE PAST INSTANTLY
VANISHES INTO THIN AIR.

494
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,416
THE QUESTION IS:
SHOULD THIS TAKE PLACE

495
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,083
ON THE WHIM
OF ONE INDIVIDUAL?

496
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,875
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
STOOD BEFORE THE CORPSES

497
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,250
OF THE RODERICK THIEVES.

498
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,750
SHE TOLD ME THAT
SHE WAS MERELY DISCARDING 

499
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,375
SOME USELESS GARBAGE.

500
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,125
DOMINIQUE THE CYCLOPS

501
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,333
TOLD ME TO JUST THINK OF IT
AS SPRING CLEANING.
