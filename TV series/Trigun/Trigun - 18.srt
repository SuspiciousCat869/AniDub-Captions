1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,708
- HEY, VASH.

3
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,208
- ( breathing heavily )

4
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,875
- NOW EVERYTHING THAT BROUGHT
YOU AND REM TOGETHER IS GONE.

5
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,833
- IS THAT YOUR EXCUSE
FOR KILLING?!

6
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,166
- HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING
OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS?

7
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,041
YOU CAN'T EVEN
REGENERATE THE SCARS

8
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,875
THEY CARVED
INTO YOUR BODY.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,250
IT'S SYMBOLIC OF YOUR
FOOLISH WASTE OF ENERGY

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,750
ON THIS GARBAGE.

11
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,541
- IT'S NOT YOUR RIGHT TO DECIDE
WHETHER THEY LIVE OR DIE.

12
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,916
THEY DESERVE A CHANCE!

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,916
- WHAT'S THE USE IN GROWING UP

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,958
IF THE ONLY THING THAT GROWS
IS YOUR SENTIMENTALISM?!

15
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,958
YOU'RE STILL A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
PATHETIC WIMP!

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,166
- ( grunts )

17
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,125
AAH!

18
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,833
WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT?

19
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,375
- THIS IS WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF.

20
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,625
IT'S TIME TO TAKE THIS GARBAGE
AND GET RID OF IT FOREVER!

21
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,000
- ( screaming )

22
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,750
- ARE YOU AIMING AT ME AGAIN?

23
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,208
- ( pained groaning )

24
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,916
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY 
AIMING AT ME AGAIN?

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
AAH!

26
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,833
- Lina:
ERICS!  ERICS!

27
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,291
- ( door opens )

28
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,041
- HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING
ON STAYING IN BED, ERICS?

29
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,833
COME ON NOW, GET UP.

30
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,291
ERICS!

31
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,125
- THERE HE IS!
- ( people clamoring )

32
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,958
- COME ON, YOU GOTTA LET US
ON THIS BUS.

33
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,458
- HE MIGHT TRY
AND TAKE THIS TOWN.

34
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,416
- I HAVE MONEY,
LET ME ON THIS BUS.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,708
WHILE WE'RE STANDING HERE
ARGUING, IT COULD BE TOO LATE.

36
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,166
- YOU NEED A TICKET TO RIDE,
MISTER, AND I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

37
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!
DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

38
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,125
JUST NAME YOUR PRICE.
I'LL PAY ANYTHING!

39
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,416
- ( guns cock )

40
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,083
- ( grunts )

41
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,041
- ( people clamoring )

42
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,291
- THERE SURE SEEMS TO BE
AN AWFUL LOT OF TENSION

43
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,750
IN THIS TOWN.

44
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,750
- HAVEN'T SEEN YOU BEFORE.
I TAKE IT YOU JUST ARRIVED.

45
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.

46
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,500
- WELL, YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY,

47
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,666
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA LEAVE THIS TOWN.

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,458
- ( all scream )

49
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,958
- WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE?

50
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,125
- THIS TOWN HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
TAKEN OVER BY BANDITS.

51
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,958
- HMM?
- AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,250
THEY SAY THAT CRAZY FELLA,
VASH THE STAMPEDE,

53
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,666
IS RUNNING THE SHOW.

54
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,375
THE SHERIFF WENT OUT
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VARMINTS,

55
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,500
BUT WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE HAD
DOUBLED HIS WEIGHT IN LEAD.

56
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,583
WALKING INTO THIS TOWN
IS LIKE WALKING INTO A

57
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,500
GIANT SPIDER'S WEB.

58
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,958
- THE LEGENDARY GUNMAN'S
BEHIND THIS?

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,541
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

60
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,083
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

61
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,458
HE IS THE MAN WHO TURNED TWO
OF THE SEVEN CITIES INTO ASHES

62
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,291
AND WAS CALLED "MANKIND'S
FIRST LOCALIZED DISASTER."

63
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,291
SOME FOLKS SAY HE PUT
THAT HUGE CRATER IN THE MOON.

64
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,583
I GUESS YOU'D HAVE TO BE NUTS
TO BELIEVE THAT.

65
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,208
- ANYWAY, WHETHER THE LEGEND
IS TRUE OR NOT,

66
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,583
THE ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THIS
TOWN IS IN SOME BIG TROUBLE.

67
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,208
- BY THE WAY, FRIEND,
WHAT IS THAT THING?

68
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
- I'M A TRAVELING PRIEST.

69
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD TIMING.

70
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,541
YOU'LL BE USEFUL HERE.

71
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,833
DON'T NEED ANYTHING FORMAL,

72
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,625
JUST SOME HELP
WITH THE FUNERALS.

73
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,291
THEY TOOK OUT THE CHAPLAIN
A WHILE BACK.

74
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,291
- ( guns cock )

75
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,833
- HMM?

76
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,500
- UH-OH.  UM...

77
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,041
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA,
YOU GUYS?!

78
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,833
- OH, IT'S ONLY LINA.

79
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,166
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"ONLY LINA"?

80
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,458
LET GO OF ME, ERICS.
( humphs )

81
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,333
- LINA, WHAT'S THE BIG HURRY?

82
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,666
- I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU COULD HIDE ME SOMEWHERE.

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,583
- WHAT'D YOU DO THIS TIME?

84
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,666
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO QUIT.

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,666
SHE WAS JUST HAVING SOME 
HARMLESS FUN, THAT'S ALL.

86
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,166
- THE GUY'S A PEDOPHILE. 
HE DESERVED A GOOD THUMP.

87
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,666
- NOT REALLY.  ALL HE DID WAS
GRAB HER REAR-END.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,208
- ( grunts )
- ( yelps )

89
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,916
- WILL YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT?

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?

91
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,208
OH, MY DEAR.

92
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,416
- YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO.

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,916
AND THEY WEREN'T REAL HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,916
BUT AT LEAST I DON'T THINK 
THEY SAW ME COMING IN HERE.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,833
- HEY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY, KID.
- OHH!

96
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,500
- IF WHAT SHE SAYS IS TRUE...

97
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,458
- ( wind blowing )

98
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,458
- ( all scream )

99
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,041
- HEY, I WASN'T DONE
EATING YET.

100
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,791
- ALL RIGHT,
WHERE'S THE LITTLE GIRL

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,500
WHO STRUCK MY FACE
WITH HER HEEL?!

102
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,541
SHE'S GOT A PRICE TO PAY
AND I'M HERE TO COLLECT!

103
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
- THAT HEEL LOOKS MORE 
LIKE A WHOLE FOOTPRINT.

104
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,875
- AH, QUIET, YOU!

105
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
- I COULD SEE WHY HE'S UPSET.

106
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,083
IT DOES RUIN
HIS BOYISH GOOD LOOKS.

107
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,250
- THIS GUY SAYS
HE SAW HER ENTER THAT BAR.

108
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,791
IF HE'S WRONG, HE'S DEAD.

109
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,125
WHY?  BECAUSE I LIKE TO KILL
SCUM WHO WASTE MY PRECIOUS TIME.

110
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,166
IN ANY EVENT,
THIS PROBLEM WILL BE SETTLED

111
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,625
IN APPROXIMATELY
THREE MINUTES, TWO SECONDS.

112
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,083
THREE...
- ( all gasp )

113
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,083
- ...TWO...

114
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,500
ONE!  HE DIES!

115
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,041
HMM?

116
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,041
- ERICS, WAIT A SECOND!

117
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,583
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!

118
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,958
- OH, HEY.
HI THERE, MR. BANDIT MAN.

119
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,875
WE'RE SORRY YOU DIDN'T
FIND IT THAT FUNNY.

120
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,250
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT
SHE'S ONLY A LITTLE 12-YEAR-OLD.

121
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,083
COME ON NOW.
HAVE A HEART, WON'T YOU?

122
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,708
( screams )

123
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,625
- SEND OUT THE KID NOW,
OR ELSE.

124
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,625
- I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

125
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,666
LOOKS LIKE YOU WANNA KILL HER
OR CAUSE HER SOME KIND OF HARM.

126
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,166
I WON'T EVEN ASK 
FOR A FREE FAVOR.

127
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,458
HOW ABOUT IF I DO THIS?

128
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,458
- ( gasps )

129
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,916
- WILL YOU LET HER
OFF THE HOOK?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,416
- ERICS...

131
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,916
- SORRY, BUT THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH, BLONDIE.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,625
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN
ON ALL FOURS,

133
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,458
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS
ACT LIKE A DOG,

134
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,083
AND I EXPECT
SOME REAL COMMITMENT.

135
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,125
NATURALLY THAT MEANS
GETTING NAKED.

136
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,333
- ( gasps ) 
- All: UH...

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,750
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S A DEAL.

138
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,916
YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP YOUR WORD.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,166
- All: OH...

140
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,833
- I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THIS, ERICS!

141
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,958
PLEASE, STOP!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT!

142
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,916
ERICS!
- ( buckles jingle )

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,458
- ( gasps, murmurs )
- ERICS...

144
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,791
- ( chuckling )

145
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,750
HUH?

146
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,708
- OH, MY GOD.

147
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,250
- ( cries )

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,416
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, KID.
HE'S GOT HIS REASONS.

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,333
WE'VE GOTTA TRUST THAT
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

150
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,583
- BUT WHY?

151
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
- THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE IS.

152
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,250
- ( howling )

153
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,166
( barking )

154
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,208
- I'M GONNA THANK YOU 
FOR THE CANINE TRICKS.

155
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,208
I'VE DECIDED TO YOU GIVE YOU
A NICE, BIG TIP.

156
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,208
OH?

157
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,583
( groans )

158
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,666
LET'S GO.

159
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,083
- ( chuckles )

160
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,541
- ( crying )

161
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,041
- SHOOT HIM.
- ( gun cocks )

162
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,250
- ( gunfire )

163
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,708
- ERICS!

164
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
- OH.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MAN?

165
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,250
- HE'S BEEN SHOT.
YOU GOTTA HELP HIM!

166
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,250
- ERICS AGAIN.
WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS TIME?

167
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,583
- I CAN'T TELL IF THE BULLET'S
STILL INSIDE HIM, DOC.

168
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,416
- IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
YOUR LIFE AND YOUR PRIDE,

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'D DO?

170
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,250
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT I WOULD
NEVER STRIP BUCK-NAKED

171
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,666
AND BARK LIKE A DOG. 

172
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,291
- TALENT LIKE THAT COMES EASY
FOR A WIMP LIKE ERICS.

173
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,291
- ( both grunt )

174
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,583
- IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT WIMP,

175
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,250
YOU TWO WOULD BE DEAD.

176
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,250
- OH, ERICS!

177
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,041
- Lina: GRANDMA!
- HUH?

178
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,750
- MY POOR ERICS.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, GRANDMA.

179
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,291
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
THE BULLET OUT IF HIM SAFELY.

180
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,916
- I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HIM.
HE'S ONE LUCKY DEVIL.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,375
- I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS
LEGENDARY GUNMAN THINKS HE IS,

182
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,375
BUT WHAT IN THE HELL
GIVES HIM THE RIGHT

183
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,416
TO STEAL WHAT PRECIOUS
LITTLE FAMILY I HAVE LEFT?

184
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,416
DAMN HIM, ANYWAY!

185
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,916
- HEY HEY, EASY THERE.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,416
NOW DON'T GO DOING THAT.

187
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,208
- YOU WON'T LAST TWO SECONDS
AGAINST HIM.

188
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,666
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

189
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,333
- Grandma:
OH, LET ME GO!

190
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,916
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT YOU
GOING IN MY PLACE?!

191
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,083
( laughs )
SEE?

192
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,458
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF COWARDS.

193
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,875
YOU WEAK,
YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPERS

194
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,875
HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ORDER ME AROUND!

195
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,916
- YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSELF
KILLED, YOU STUPID OLD BAT!

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,041
- OH, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

197
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,750
- GRANDMA, DON'T SAY THAT.

198
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,000
- I CAN'T, LINA.
- ALL OF THIS IS MY FAULT.

199
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,500
IF I HAD JUST STAYED AWAY
FROM THEM,

200
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,875
HE WOULDN'T HAVE--
HE WOULDN'T HAVE--

201
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,875
( crying )
I'M SO SORRY, ERICS.

202
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,958
- IF YOU'RE QUITE FINISHED HERE,

203
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,541
COULD YOU PLEASE KEEP
THE NOISE DOWN?

204
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,041
THERE ARE OTHER PATIENTS HERE.

205
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,625
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME, DOCTOR.

206
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,666
- I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

207
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,291
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

208
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,916
I'LL HAVE ERICS MOVED
TO THE WARD RIGHT AWAY.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,666
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

210
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,333
LINA, LET'S FETCH HIM
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

211
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,333
- OKAY.
( sniffles )

212
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,791
- LET'S MOVE HIM
AND GET THIS PLACE CLEANED UP.

213
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,458
HMM?
OH, HELLO.

214
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

215
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,291
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW,
I ASSURE YOU.

216
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,791
- I KNOW THAT.
NO PROBLEM.

217
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,583
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO SEE IF I COULD HELP OUT.

218
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,750
( sighs )

219
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,166
YOU JUST GONNA SLEEP?

220
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,666
SNAP OUT OF IT!

221
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,666
- WHAT THE HELL ARE
 YOU DOING TO HIM?!

222
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,875
- HE NEEDED IT!

223
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,916
- DOCTOR, LOOK AT THAT!
OH, MY GOSH!

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,875
- HUH?
- HEY!

225
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,750
- WHAT AN AMAZING RECOVERY.

226
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,708
YOU'VE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
SO QUICKLY.

227
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,666
- EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR?

228
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,958
BUT COULD YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

229
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,625
- WELL, YES, I SUPPOSE.

230
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,791
DON'T LET HIM STRAIN HIMSELF,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

231
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,416
- ( door opens, closes )

232
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,458
- WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,

233
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,250
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

234
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,208
- ( rock music playing )

235
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,875
- I FINALLY FOUND YOU,
YOU DUMB JERK.

236
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,125
WHAT'S A LEGENDARY GUY LIKE YOU
DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

237
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,041
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

238
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,666
I COULD HAVE DESTROYED
THIS ENTIRE PLANET

239
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,166
WITH THAT ANGEL ARM
OF MINE.

240
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,041
IT GETS WORSE.

241
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,083
THERE'S A LOSS OF MEMORY.

242
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,708
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT I DID.

243
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,583
- THAT MAY BE TRUE.

244
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,416
BUT YOU DO KNOW
YOU DID IT, RIGHT?

245
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
- OH, YEAH, I KNOW.

246
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,416
I HAVE FRAGMENTED VISIONS.

247
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,416
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING...

248
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,708
THERE'S AN ACHE IN MY HEART
THAT TELLS ME I DID IT.

249
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,083
I KNOW I'M THE ONE WHO PUT 
THE HOLE IN THE FIFTH MOON.

250
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,375
IT WAS ME.

251
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,958
- OKAY, SO YOU DID
THIS TERRIBLE THING.

252
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,416
NOW WHAT? ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF WHAT YOU CAN DO,

253
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,041
YOU'RE LIVING
IN EASY RETIREMENT?

254
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,041
- NO.

255
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,625
IT'S JUST THAT I WANNA
LIVE QUIETLY FOR ONCE.

256
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,375
SO I DECIDED TO CHANGE MY NAME

257
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,500
AND MY WAY OF LIFE.

258
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,000
( softly groans )

259
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,583
WHY ARE YOU HERE, WOLFWOOD?

260
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,416
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THIS TOWN?

261
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,583
ARE YOU HANGING AROUND
FOR A GOOD LAUGH?

262
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,166
- ACTUALLY, I CAME TO
TAKE YOU AWAY.

263
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,541
- AWAY WHERE?

264
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,208
- WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
FOR A FINAL DESTINATION,

265
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,166
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

266
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,041
HOWEVER, THE ONE THING
I DO KNOW IS I NEED YOUR HELP.

267
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,750
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
COMBING THROUGH AUGUSTA,

268
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,500
TRYING TO FIND YOU.

269
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,291
DOES THE NAME FRANK MARLON
HAPPEN TO RING A BELL?

270
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,375
ALL I DID WAS MENTION YOUR NAME,
AND HE FIXED THE GUN FOR FREE.

271
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,208
- MAYBE.

272
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,416
WHY GIVE IT TO ME?  HUH?

273
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,791
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED IT.

274
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,083
- WHAT I NEED?

275
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,916
WHAT I WANT IS TO LIVE
MY LIFE HERE...

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,791
WITH THEM.

277
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,875
- WHY WAS HE HOSPITALIZED
THE LAST TIME, LINA?

278
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,916
- HE TRIED TO STOP
A VIOLENT DRUNK AT THE BAR,

279
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,916
AND ENDED UP
GETTING PUNCHED HIMSELF.

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,625
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE TIME BEFORE THAT?

281
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,416
- HE FELL OFF A THOMAS.

282
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,750
- ( clicks tongue )
AWW.

283
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,875
BE SURE YOU REMEMBER
TO THANK HIM.

284
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,625
- I KNOW.

285
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,583
I'LL REMEMBER, GRANDMA.

286
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,541
OH.

287
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,875
( echoing ) 
HELLO THERE.

288
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,041
UH, ARE YOU OKAY?

289
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,666
OH...

290
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,166
- YOU'RE IN HORRIBLE SHAPE.
YOU POOR THING.

291
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,833
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
THROUGH AN AWFUL LOT.

292
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,916
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,250
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

294
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,458
- SO YOU'RE STAYING HERE, HUH?

295
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,250
- WHENEVER I DO ANYTHING,

296
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,416
PEOPLE DIE.

297
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,916
- ALL RIGHT.

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,916
IF YOU WANT THIS PATHETIC
LITTLE EXISTENCE SO BAD

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,750
THAT YOU'D GIVE UP
EVERYTHING ELSE...

300
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,125
THEN GO FOR IT.

301
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,750
BY THE WAY,

302
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,375
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
A TOWN CALLED CARCASSES?

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,375
IT'S A TINY TOWN
ON THE SOUTHERN CORNELIA REGION.

304
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,875
SOMETHING REALLY
STRANGE HAPPENED THERE

305
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,916
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,583
SEEMS THE ENTIRE POPULATION

307
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,041
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
WITHOUT A TRACE.

308
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,041
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST STRUGGLE.

309
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,916
EVERYTHING IN TOWN
LOOKED COMPLETELY NORMAL,

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
EXCEPT THAT ALL THE PEOPLE
HAD VANISHED,

311
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,791
LIKE A MIRAGE.

312
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,791
THEY SENT IN THE CAVALRY
AND SEARCHED THE PLACE OVER,

313
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,000
BUT DIDN'T FIND A SOUL.

314
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,958
ONE CAVALRYMAN DID DISCOVER
SOMETHING ODD, THOUGH.

315
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,958
THERE WAS A MAN'S NAME
PAINTED ON THE MONUMENT

316
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,625
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE TOWN SQUARE.

317
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,750
IT WAS ONE WORD,

318
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,250
CAREFULLY WRITTEN IN RED.

319
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,458
KNIVES.

320
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,416
- DAMN YOU, KNIVES.

321
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,458
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER
HOW FAR I TRAVEL,

322
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,750
MY DESTINY IS ALWAYS FOLLOWED
BY BLOOD AND GUN SMOKE.

323
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,750
THE RESULT IS THE SAME
EVERY TIME--

324
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,041
MOUNTAINS OF DEATH
AND DEBRIS.

325
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,458
- YOU GOT TO COME WITH US, VASH!

326
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,500
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US!

327
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,791
- Rem:
VASH, TAKE CARE OF KNIVES.

328
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,458
- ( inaudible )

329
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,291
- NO, REM, COME BACK!

330
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,291
- ( crying )

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
WHAT--?

332
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,750
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

333
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,791
- Grandma: YOUR GUN.
GIVE ME YOUR GUN, HURRY!

334
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,583
- GRANDMA SHERYL,
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT?

335
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,625
- IT'S LINA-- THEY GOT HER!

336
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,833
- WHAT?  HOW?

337
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,416
- JUST GIVE IT TO ME, NOW!

338
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
- STOP!  YOU'LL THROW
YOUR LIFE AWAY!

339
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,875
BESIDES, THEY'VE PROBABLY
ALREADY KILLED HER.

340
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:33,875
- OH, SHUT UP!
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME!

341
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
JUST GIVE ME THE GUN.

342
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,541
- SHERYL SHERYL, WAIT!

343
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,500
- ( door opens )

344
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,458
- HMM...

345
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,208
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS KINDA FOND

346
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,375
OF MY NEW LIFE HERE.

347
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,416
I REALLY HATE TO LEAVE.

348
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,375
- SORRY, THEM'S THE BREAKS.

349
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,041
SOMEONE'S GOTTA GET TOUGH
AROUND HERE,

350
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,625
OR THOSE MANIACS ARE
GONNA DESTROY THIS TOWN.

351
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,250
- ( running footsteps
approaching )

352
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,375
- THEY'RE BOTH GONE.

353
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,708
"PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW US.

354
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,375
TELL EVERYONE TO STAY
WHERE THEY ARE.

355
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,875
WE'VE GONE TO GET LINA."

356
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,833
BY THEMSELVES?

357
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,916
- HOW MANY ARE THERE?

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,541
- ABOUT 200.

359
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
- 100 FOR EACH OF US, HUH?

360
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,166
- YEP.

361
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,458
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY FAIR TO THEM.

362
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,666
- UH-- HEY!  I DON'T WANT YOU
KILLING ANYONE, ALL RIGHT?

363
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,541
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK ME
NOT TO BREATHE?

364
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,708
- "THOU SHALT NOT KILL,"
REMEMBER?

365
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,708
WHAT KIND OF CHURCH MAN
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

366
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,583
- HMM?
( chuckles )

367
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,708
WHOA, DEJA VU.
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

368
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,333
NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
LIKE YOUR OLD SELF.

369
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,750
- ( cackling )

370
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,250
- ERICS!

371
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,250
- OH.

372
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,666
- ( men laughing )

373
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
- TIME TO KILL!

374
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,458
- Both: SHOWTIME.

375
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,791
- WHY DID I HAVE TO GO AND TALK
TO SOMEONE THIS FILTHY, ANYWAY?

376
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,041
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
I GUESS I MUST BE CRAZY.

377
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,000
( softly chuckles )

378
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,750
- Man #1: WHAT A MESS!

379
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,250
HOW THE HELL
DID THOSE TWO MANAGE

380
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,583
TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THEM
THUGS BY THEMSELVES?

381
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,458
- Man #2: I HAVE NO IDEA.

382
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,083
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE 
SO HORRIFYINGLY STRONG.

383
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,291
- Grandma:
SO YOUR MIND IS MADE UP THEN?

384
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,583
- YES, I'M SORRY.

385
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
IT'S TIME I GO.

386
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,000
EVEN THOUGH I HATE TO DO THIS
TO YOU AND LINA.

387
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,166
- ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO, ERICS?

388
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,208
MAYBE IF YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT,
I COULD HELP SOMEHOW.

389
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
- THANK YOU, BUT I CAN'T.

390
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,333
BECAUSE, YOU SEE, IF I DID...

391
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,250
I'D ONLY BE PUTTING
YOU AND LINA IN DANGER.

392
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,041
- HERE YOU HAVE A HOME.

393
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,083
YOU COULD END UP ALONE AGAIN,
WITH NO ONE THERE TO HELP.

394
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:49,083
THAT'S WHAT WORRIES US
THE MOST ABOUT YOUR LEAVING.

395
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,833
- I'M SORRY.

396
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,416
- WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT
ERICS WAS VASH THE STAMPEDE.

397
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,416
UNBELIEVABLE.
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

398
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,125
- AND TO THINK
THAT ALL THIS TIME

399
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,125
WE WERE CONVINCED
THAT THIS PIG MAN WAS VASH.

400
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,708
SO, YOU THINK THE
LEGENDARY GUNMAN'S

401
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,250
GONNA STICK AROUND THESE PARTS?

402
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,083
- SHOOT, DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

403
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,750
HAVEN'T WE SUFFERED ENOUGH?

404
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,958
- YEAH!  WE OUGHTA
RUN HIM OUT RIGHT NOW.

405
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,833
- SHE CRIED, HUH?
THAT'S A SHAME.

406
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,041
I DIDN'T KNOW.
GEE, NOW I FEEL BAD.

407
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,000
I GUESS MAYBE I WAS ACTING
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO PUSHY.

408
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,333
- YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

409
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,333
MR. PREACHER...

410
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,666
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF ERICS.

411
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,166
UNLIKE YOU, HE'S A BUMBLING FOOL
OF A GOODY-GOODY

412
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,875
AND A SWEET GENTLE SOUL.

413
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,875
LINA AND I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN 
SOMEWHERE DEEP IN OUR HEARTS,

414
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,333
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

415
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,708
WE KNEW ERICS WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE TO LEAVE US SOMEDAY.

416
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,166
YET WE CHOSE NOT TO BELIEVE IT.

417
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,041
BLESS HIM.

418
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,500
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE
FACT THAT WE'RE LOSING

419
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,250
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

420
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,458
PLEASE, MR. WOLFWOOD,

421
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,458
DON'T FORGET THAT.

422
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,083
- I'M TRULY SORRY.

423
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,750
I REALLY AM.

424
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,708
I'M-- I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,916
- THERE.
IT'S ALL DONE.

426
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,750
( crying )

427
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,708
- LINA.

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,541
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,541
- I ONLY WANTED
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

430
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,750
BUT SOMEHOW...

431
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,416
IT TURNED OUT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

432
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,625
I WAS TOO WEAK.

433
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,583
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

434
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,291
- THANK YOU.

435
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,583
I'M SORRY.

436
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,041
- NO, LINA.

437
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,041
IT'S ME WHO SHOULD BE
SAYING THAT.

438
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,916
- ( crying continues )

439
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,875
- LINA...

440
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,875
THANK YOU.

441
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,833
AND GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.

442
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,958
- ( end theme playing )

443
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

444
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,375
- Vash:
STRONG WILL CAN STIR THE HEART.

445
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,375
BUT A WILL TOO STRONG CAN CUT
OFF THE HEART'S VISIBILITY.

446
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,125
THE SORROW OF A MAN
BEREAVED OF HIS FAMILY

447
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,583
TURNS INTO HATE,

448
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,291
WHICH EVENTUALLY
METAMORPHOSES INTO

449
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
THE INTENT TO KILL.

450
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,916
THE MAN'S FINGER
REACHES FOR THE TRIGGER.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,916
SINS CHANGE PEOPLE.

452
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,666
SIN BEGETS SIN.

453
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,666
BUT I, I STILL WANT TO BELIEVE.

454
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,500
I WANNA BELIEVE IN THE HEART,

455
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,791
THE HEART THAT FEELS THE SIN.
