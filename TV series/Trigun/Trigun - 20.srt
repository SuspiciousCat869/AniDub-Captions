1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,125
( theme music continues )

3
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,250
- Reporter: The typhoon
is currently gaining strength

4
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,583
and will be passing
approximately 30 isles

5
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,916
away from New Oregon.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,250
The gale is expected
to last until 40.

7
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,208
Please be advised
that high wind warnings

8
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,583
are still in effect
until further notice.

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,125
- SO THIS IS A TYPHOON.

10
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
I'VE HEARD THAT
WIND CAN BE STRONG,

11
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,666
BUT I NEVER DREAMED IT COULD 
BLOW WITH THIS KIND OF FORCE.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,083
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,666
IN FACT,
THIS ONE IS SO HUFFY

14
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,583
SHE MUST BE RELATED TO--
( chuckles ) MR. VASH!

15
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,458
HER NAME IS JAQUELINE--

16
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,708
- ( both scream )

17
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,666
- ( knocks on door )

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,916
- MR. VASH, EXCUSE ME,
BUT MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,583
TO SPEAK WITH YOU?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
( sighs )

21
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,000
HUH?

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,583
- Vash: "PLEASE DON'T
LOOK FOR ME. VASH."

23
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,208
- DAMN, HE GOT US.

24
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,583
EITHER HE'S INCREDIBLY SLIPPERY

25
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,791
OR HE'S JUST GONE
COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS MIND.

26
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'D ACTUALLY
GO OUT IN THESE CONDITIONS.

27
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,250
- NO PROBLEM. WE'LL FIND HIM.
- HUH?

28
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,333
- I SUSPECTED
HE MIGHT TRY THIS,

29
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,750
SO WHEN I BROUGHT HIM
BREAKFAST EARLIER THIS MORNING,

30
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,291
I SLIPPED ONE OF THESE
INTO THE FOOD ON HIS PLATE.

31
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,958
- OH MY GOSH.
THAT'S A TRANSMITTING DEVICE.

32
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,291
I'M AMAZED THE COMPANY LET
YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,291
- ( chuckles )
SINCE I'M ALWAYS MESSING UP,

34
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,083
THE CHIEF GAVE IT TO ME 
AS A GOING AWAY PRESENT.

35
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,250
HE SAYS IT'LL KEEP ANYONE
FROM OUTWITTING ME.

36
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,083
- ( chuckles )
MILLY, I HATE TO TELL YOU,

37
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,541
BUT THAT'S NOTHING
TO BRAG ABOUT.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,583
- ( beeping )

39
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,083
- LOOK, LOOK.
HE'S REALLY CLOSE BY.

40
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,416
WE'RE CATCHING UP ALREADY.

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,625
YEAH!

42
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,291
WARMER, WARMER.

43
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,916
WARMER.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,916
- ( beeps )

45
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:14,875
- ( meowing )

46
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,958
- OH MY GOD.

47
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,750
HE CHANGED INTO 
A CAT THIS TIME.

48
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,833
- MILLY!

49
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,250
- Knives: VASH.

50
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,250
VASH!

51
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,416
- ( groans )

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,416
- COME ON, VASH.

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,625
STAND UP ALREADY.

54
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,916
- ( sighs )

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,208
- LET'S GO.

56
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,583
- ( grunts )

57
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,250
- HEY.

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,666
DON'T BE THAT WAY.

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,500
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME HERE.

60
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,291
WE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY
TO ACT LIKE BROTHERS. 

61
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,291
- ( gasps )

62
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,916
MURDERER.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IS A LIE.

64
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,083
YOU KILLED REM,

65
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,541
THE CREW.

66
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,583
YOU KILLED THEM ALL!

67
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,916
- YEAH.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,250
SPECTACULAR, HUH?

69
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,791
THEY ALL DIE.

70
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,541
EXCEPT OF COURSE
FOR THE FRACTION

71
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,166
WHO WILL SURVIVE BECAUSE OF
REM'S INCESSANT MEDDLING.

72
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,250
- KNIVES.

73
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,791
YOU--

74
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,250
YOU AREN'T EVEN HUMAN!

75
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,541
( grunts )

76
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,458
- DAMN STRAIGHT I'M NOT.

77
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,916
HOW DARE YOU COMPARE ME
TO THOSE IMPERFECT THINGS.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
HOW DARE YOU.

79
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,000
NEVER COMPARE ME TO THEM.

80
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,583
- ( groans )

81
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,791
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT GARBAGE.

82
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,916
I WILL KILL YOU ALL.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,250
ONLY WE WILL BE
LEFT ON THIS PLANET.

84
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,250
- REM...

85
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,708
- NOW VASH,
TAKE CARE OF KNIVES.

86
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,250
- I KNOW WHAT
I HAVE TO DO, REM.

87
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,583
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
IT'S TIME TO FACE HIM.

88
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,500
I HAVE TO BE READY.

89
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,708
- JAQUELINE'S ANGLE SHOULD
PASS NEAR THE CRAGGY BLUFF

90
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,250
BLOWING TO THE SOUTHEAST
AT EXACTLY 1:22 PM.

91
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,500
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU,
OLD CHUM.

92
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,583
( grunts )

93
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,541
IF YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THIS,
YOU CRAZY OLD GEEZER,

94
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
I'LL HUNT YOU
TO THE GRAVE!

95
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,708
WHOA!

96
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,458
YEOW!

97
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,916
( groans )

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,291
( gasps )

99
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,916
I STILL FEEL LIKE I'M HAVING
A FREAKING HEART ATTACK

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,125
EVERY TIME I DO THIS.

101
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,250
THIS THINGS GOING
BADA-BOOM BADA-BOOM.

102
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,416
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMMITTING SUICIDE. 

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,541
- SUICIDE?

104
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,000
I STRONGLY DISAPPROVE
OF SUICIDE.

105
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,583
IT'S JUST A--
HUH?

106
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,041
WOLFWOOD?!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

107
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,750
- FIRST YOU'RE CRYING
YOUR EYES OUT

108
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,125
LIKE AN ABANDONED BABY,

109
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
AND THEN YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND
JUMPING OFF CLIFFS.

110
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,083
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU ANYWAY?

111
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,083
- I'M VISITING.

112
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,625
- ( grunts )
SAY WHAT?

113
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,291
- I'M VISITING THE FOLKS.

114
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,875
- ( laughs )

115
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,083
YEAH, RIGHT.
WHAT DO THEY HAVE,

116
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,583
A SUMMER COTTAGE
IN THE SKY?

117
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,583
I'M REALLY GETTING
SICK OF YOUR LIES.

118
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,250
HUH?  HEY,
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

119
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,583
- JUST WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

120
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,750
IT'S A SHIP THAT
DIDN'T QUITE CRASH

121
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,583
130 YEARS AGO.

122
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,916
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
WHO'D HAVE KNOWN THAT
THE LOST TECHNOLOGY

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,583
WAS STILL PRESERVED
LIKE THIS.

125
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,916
WAIT.  DID YOU SAY
YOU'RE VISITING YOUR FOLKS?

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,208
DOES THAT MEAN PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY LIVING UP HERE?

127
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,250
- I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE THEIR
FIRST HOUSE GUEST TO VISIT

128
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,916
IN OVER 20 YEARS.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,583
- MISTER LEGATO,

130
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,250
IT HAS HAPPENED
AS EXPECTED.

131
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,833
HE HAS MADE HIS MOVE.

132
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,000
ALSO, VASH THE STAMPEDE
APPEARS TO BE WORKING

133
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,458
WITH A MINISTER
CLAD IN BLACK. 

134
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,958
I SUSPECT THIS MAN IS--

135
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,291
- NEVER MIND HIM.

136
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,000
YOUR TASK WILL 
REMAIN THE SAME

137
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,416
NO MATTER WHO HE IS.

138
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,916
- YES.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,291
UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

140
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,291
- YOU'RE SUCH A FOOL.

141
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,000
HAD YOU BEHAVED,
YOU MIGHT HAVE LIVED

142
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,958
TO SEE DOOMSDAY.

143
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,583
BUT I MUST SAY,
I AM PLEASED.

144
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,666
FOR NOW I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO FULFILL ANOTHER

145
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,333
OF MY MASTER'S WISHES.

146
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,291
( chuckles )

147
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,583
- ( typing on computer )

148
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,250
- DOCTOR,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS.

149
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,791
- ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME THAT SOMEONE IS HERE

150
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,916
FROM THE OUTSIDE?

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,250
- UH, YEAH.

152
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,583
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
BUT HE'S BACK.

153
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,583
SO, BRAD,

154
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,083
HAVE YOU EVER MET HIM BEFORE?

155
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,583
- WELL, YEAH I HAVE.

156
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,125
BUT I WAS JUST A KID
BACK THEN.

157
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,125
- ( chuckles )
THEN THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME

158
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,666
YOU'VE MET A REAL LEGEND.

159
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,958
HE'S CHANGED OVER THE YEARS.
COME WITH ME.

160
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,083
- SO HE REALLY IS BACK.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

161
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,666
- THIS IS AMAZING.

162
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,000
HOW MANY YEARS
HAS IT BEEN

163
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,500
SINCE I LAST
OPENED THIS DOOR?

164
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,250
- ( winces )

165
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,916
IS HE THERE?
IS THAT HIM?

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,250
- ( screams )
- ( gasps )

167
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,916
- MERCY, MERCY, MERCY!

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW

169
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,583
I CAN'T COME IN?
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,

170
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,000
YOU NEEDLE-NOGGINED IDIOT?

171
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,250
- OH, HEY, DOC.

172
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,708
- ( grunts )
- ( screaming )

173
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,375
- IS THAT YOUR
GREAT LEGEND? 

174
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
IS THAT FOOL HIM, HUH?
- ( chuckles )

175
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,625
WHAT A RELIEF.
HE HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

176
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
- OHH.

177
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,083
- YOUR NAME'S BRAD,
ISN'T IT?

178
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,916
MAN, YOU SURE GOT TALLER.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333
- YEAH, RIGHT.

180
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,250
BY THE WAY, WHO'S HE?
- ( chuckles )

181
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,791
YOU KNOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

182
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,250
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

183
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,583
- LOOK, I DON'T MIND
YOU WANDERING AROUND THE PLACE.

184
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,541
BUT OUTSIDERS
ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.

185
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,916
- OH, NOW DON'T BE LIKE THAT,
BIG GUY.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,125
( gasps )
OKAY.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,125
HUH?

188
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,583
- DON'T STARE.
COME ON INSIDE.

189
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,250
- GET USED TO IT.

190
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,583
- YOU WIN.
I'LL BEHAVE.

191
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,958
- VASH!
- All: HUH?

192
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,625
VASH!

193
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,791
- AHH.

194
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
- VASH!

195
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,041
- ( sighs )

196
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,041
- VASH!

197
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
OHH!
- ( crying )

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,791
- GEE, THIS IS ALL
RATHER SUDDEN, YOUNG LADY.

199
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,583
I MAY HAVE A REPUTATION
OF BEING EASY,

200
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,125
BUT EVEN I NEED A BIT
OF ADVANCE WARNING.

201
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,583
- ( giggles )

202
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,916
- JESSICA!
- THAT'S RIGHT.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,458
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU REMEMBERED ME.

204
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,750
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.

205
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,791
- ( grumbles )
- ( gasps )

206
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,416
( chuckles )
- WELL, VASH,

207
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,083
THIS MUST BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, HUH?

208
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,916
YOU ARE ONE LUCKY DEVIL.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,791
- SHH, SHH!

210
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DID I EMBARRASS YOU?

211
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,750
- ( growls )

212
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,291
- SORRY.

213
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,291
BUT I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH THE
DOCTOR FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

214
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,625
- HEY!

215
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,041
NOW THAT'S NOT FAIR.

216
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,916
- JESSICA.
- HMM.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
COME SEE ME AFTER,
OKAY,

218
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,125
LIKE RIGHT AFTER?

219
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,750
I'LL HATE YOU
IF YOU DON'T.

220
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,583
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

221
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,916
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,583
- SO, VASH, HOW'S MAX?
IS HE WELL?

223
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,250
- OH, YEAH.
HE'S DOING GREAT.

224
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,791
HE HAS STARING CONTESTS
WITH FORECAST CHARTS.

225
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,041
- HUH?
- ( crying )

226
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,250
- HMM.  WELL NOW,
I HAVEN'T INTRODUCED MYSELF.

227
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,250
MY NAME IS WOLFWOO--

228
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,250
- CAN YOU BLAME HER?

229
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,791
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
ON THIS SHIP

230
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,541
AREN'T ABOUT TO TRUST
A BUNCH OF OUTSIDERS 

231
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,041
BRINGING IN
WAR AND VIOLENCE.

232
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,750
YOU MAKE THIS PLACE
STINK LIKE GUNPOWDER.

233
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,458
STAY PUT UNTIL HE GETS BACK.

234
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,958
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE,
GOT THAT?

235
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,000
- ( sighs )

236
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,291
YOU COULD AT LEAST OFFER ME
A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,291
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,

238
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,083
I AM NOT THE LEAST BIT HAPPY
ABOUT THIS, MILLY.

239
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,500
WE HAD JUST FOUND HIM AGAIN,

240
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,333
AND THEN WE LET HIM SLIP
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER OUR NOSES.

241
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,333
- I KNOW ALL THAT,
BUT WE CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

242
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,333
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

243
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,583
- WE HAVE TO.

244
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,583
AND BESIDES,
DANGER IS PART OF THE JOB.

245
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,750
( gasps )

246
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,958
- ( both scream )

247
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,250
- ( crowd chattering )

248
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,583
- Wolfwood: AN ENTIRE CITY
SURROUNDED BY LOST TECHNOLOGY.

249
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,916
I'M SEEING INTO YOU
LITTLE BY LITTLE, NEEDLE-NOGGIN.

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,916
( grunts )

251
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,791
- GET OUT OF HERE, MISTER!

252
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,541
- ( gasps )
I'M SO SORRY.

253
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,083
- IT'S COOL.
- BUT HE'S RIGHT.

254
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,416
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I FEEL THE SAME WAY HE DOES.

255
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,208
I'M BEGGING YOU,
FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF US,

256
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,125
PLEASE LEAVE THIS PLACE.

257
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,958
- ( crowd shouting )

258
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,375
- WHY, SO YOU CAN ALL JUST
CARRY ON WITH YOUR PERFECT

259
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,708
COZY LITTLE SHELTERED LIVES?

260
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,458
- HUH?
- YOU NEED TO REALIZE

261
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,458
YOUR PLANTS ARE NOT
INEXHAUSTIBLE.

262
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,916
THEY COULD VERY EASILY
BREAK DOWN SOME DAY.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,583
YOU CAN'T CLING
ONTO THEM FOREVER.

264
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,666
THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS
A FINITE LIFESPAN.

265
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,083
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING US?

266
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,416
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

267
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,791
TO MAINTAIN THESE SYSTEMS.

268
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,333
WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON 
ANYTHING SHUTTING DOWN

269
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,875
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

270
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
- AND ANYTHING'S BETTER
THAN LIVING OUT THERE. 

271
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,583
- I'VE HEARD THAT PEOPLE'S
LIVES ARE MEANINGLESS TO YOU,

272
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,666
SO WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN TO
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY? 

273
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,583
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

274
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,083
- ( all gasp )

275
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,791
- NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

276
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
YOU BETTER GET
USED TO THE IDEA

277
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,000
THAT SOME DAY YOU'RE GONNA
ALL LIVE ON THAT DESERT PLANET.

278
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,791
- ANYTHING NEW HAPPEN
WHILE I WAS AWAY?

279
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,458
- NO, NOT MUCH.

280
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,083
THEY'RE STILL SLEEPING 
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

281
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,333
- REALLY?

282
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,458
- WE WERE ALL
WORRIED SICK.

283
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,541
YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF TOUCH
FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS.

284
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,916
- I'M SORRY.

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,666
- SURE.
LIKE YOU EVEN CARE.

286
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,250
FIVE YEARS IS PROBABLY
NOTHING MORE THAN

287
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,791
THE BLINK OF AN EYE
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

288
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH, BRAD.

289
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,250
VASH IS NOT
THAT KIND OF PERSON.

290
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,041
- PERSON?
( scoffs )

291
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,583
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

292
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,250
- SINCE YOU HAVE RETURNED,

293
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,916
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,875
DID YOU COME INTO
CONTACT WITH HIM 

295
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,000
DURING THE FIFTH MOON
INCIDENT?

296
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,583
- NOT DIRECTLY.

297
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,958
BUT MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT HE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

298
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,291
I'VE ABSOLUTELY
NO MEMORY OF IT HAPPENING,

299
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,291
JUST LIKE THE TIME BEFORE
IN JULY.

300
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,625
- TELL ME, VASH,

301
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,958
DID YOU FIRE IT?

302
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
- HEY, MISTER LEGEND...

303
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,791
( grunts )
SINCE YOU'RE THE ONE

304
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,208
THAT FIRED OFF THE BIG WEAPON,

305
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,875
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU
MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN KNIVES?

306
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,916
- I SAID ENOUGH, BRAD!
- WELL, DOESN'T IT?!

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,916
- BRAD!

308
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,250
- THAT'S RIGHT.

309
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,416
I SUPPOSE IT DOES.

310
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,916
- THAT IS NOT FUNNY.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,583
THAT IS NOT FUNNY!

312
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,291
IT'S THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE!

313
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,583
- DON'T YOU THINK
I AM AWARE OF THAT?

314
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,583
HOWEVER, THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS
BEEN ABLE TO OPPOSE KNIVES,

315
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,750
FIGHT OFF HIS DEMONS,

316
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,875
AND SURVIVE THEM
IS THAT GENTLE MAN

317
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,458
YOU'RE HOLDING
BY THE NECK.

318
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,541
- ( groans )

319
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,750
- I'M ASKING YOU TO
PLEASE TRUST ME.

320
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,291
- ( growls )

321
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,791
- PLEASE.

322
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,625
- ( grunts )

323
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,333
- ( door opens )

324
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,666
- I'M SORRY.

325
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
- HE'S RIGHT.

326
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,333
I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

327
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,416
TO SIMPLE AND ORDINARY PEOPLE
I MUST SEEM LIKE A MONSTER.

328
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,666
- HA!  WELL, THAT'S
HALF HIS PROBLEM.

329
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,666
HE'S HOPELESSLY
IN LOVE WITH JESSICA,

330
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,125
AND HE JUST TOLD HER
FOR THE FIRST TIME. 

331
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,666
- JESSICA.

332
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,666
- I'M SORRY, BRAD,
BUT I'M GONNA MARRY VASH.

333
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,333
- ( gasps )

334
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,583
- I'M GONNA MARRY VASH.

335
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,125
VASH, VASH!

336
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,458
- SO THAT'S THE OTHER HALF
OF BRAD'S PROBLEM.

337
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,666
( laughs )

338
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,958
- WHAT'S IN THERE?

339
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:03,958
( gasps )

340
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
- A LITTLE SOMETHING 
YOU MIGHT BE NEEDING.

341
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,000
- ( humming )

342
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,583
HE HASN'T BEEN MUCH FUN,
BUT I'M SURE GLAD HE'S BACK.

343
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,333
AT LEAST HE HASN'T CHANGED.
HE HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.

344
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,083
HEY, VASH!  WAIT.

345
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,416
WAIT FOR ME.

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,833
( sighs )

347
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,500
LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME,
I'M IN LOVE.

348
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,291
( giggles )

349
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,708
- THIS DAMN SHIP IS FULL
OF NOTHING BUT ROTTEN,

350
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,125
IGNORANT PEOPLE.

351
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,958
DOESN'T ANYONE TRUST
THE WORD OF A PRIEST ANYMORE?

352
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,875
- ( screaming )
- ( gasps )

353
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,583
HEY, OPEN UP IN THERE.

354
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,291
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG?

355
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,250
- ( gunshot )
- ( screaming )

356
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,916
- WHAT THE HELL'S 
GOING ON IN THERE?

357
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
- ( panting )

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,208
- ( men gasp )

359
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,125
- ( crowd shouting )

360
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
- IT WASN'T ME.

362
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,583
IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THIS
WHEN I GOT HERE.

363
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,916
- ( crowd gasps )

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,458
- HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

365
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,625
- WHAT HAPPENED?

366
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,958
- BRAD, IT'S TERRI AND NATASHA.

367
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,166
- SHOW HIM, BRAD.
SHOW HIM.

368
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,708
- IT WASN'T ME, BRAD.

369
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,750
- ( gasps )

370
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,458
- I'M ASKING YOU,
PLEASE TRUST ME. 

371
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,541
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN
PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE.

372
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,916
- THIS IS GREAT, DOC.

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,541
IT'S BY FAR
THE SMOOTHEST ONE YET.

374
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,916
- I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,791
NOW WE'D BETTER HURRY.
IT'S GOTTEN VERY LATE.

376
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,208
JESSICA WILL BE
FURIOUS WITH YOU.

377
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,125
STRANGE.
SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE HERE.

378
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,166
HUH?

379
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,041
OH, YES, THAT PRESENT.

380
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,291
SHE WANTED TO
GIVE IT TO YOU.

381
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,583
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO YOUR RETURN

382
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,291
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

383
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,708
- DOC, WHAT IS THIS?

384
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,666
- HMM?
( gasps )

385
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,000
- I'LL SAY IT 
ONE MORE TIME.

386
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,416
I DIDN'T KILL THEM.

387
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,125
- SHUT UP. YOU'RE A KILLER
AND A LIAR, OUTSIDER.

388
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,333
- YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

389
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,958
YOU REALLY WANT TO
FIGHT ME, HUH?

390
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:48,375
- ( groans )
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

391
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,625
JOSEPH!

392
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,083
- MOVE IT!
- WHAT?

393
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,375
( pants )

394
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,583
YOU DID THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

395
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,250
BACK OFF NOW, BRAD.

396
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,125
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
SURVIVE A FIGHT

397
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,625
AGAINST THIS BREED
OF BAD GUY.

398
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,416
- WHOA.

399
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,666
- LEONOF, I PRESUME.

400
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,333
- OH?

401
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,083
SO YOU KNOW MY NAME.

402
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,250
WELL, I MUST SAY,
I'M HONORED.

403
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,416
I'M AFRAID WE'VE NEVER MET,
BUT I HAVE HEARD OF YOU.

404
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,416
AN INTERESTING REPUTATION,

405
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,083
YOU ARE THE MAN WHO
RINGS THE BLACK FUNERAL BELL.

406
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,458
CHAPEL--
- DON'T DAY IT!

407
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,666
ENOUGH WITH YOUR PUPPETS.

408
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,416
- HOLY SHIT.

409
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,166
- THIS IS JUST A WARM-UP.

410
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,125
BOTH FOR HIM
AND FOR ME. 

411
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,083
- YOU ARE SMART,
PREACHER.

412
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,458
IT WOULD BE EASY
TO DESTROY YOU AT THIS POINT,

413
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,250
BUT THAT WOULD BE BORING.

414
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,250
TO MAKE THE GAME 
MORE INTERESTING,

415
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,416
I'VE ADDED A SWEET ELEMENT.

416
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,916
- JESSICA!

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,458
- I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
THROUGH HIS EYES

418
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,250
THE ENTIRE TIME.

419
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,250
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
VERY STRONG FEELINGS

420
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,833
FOR THIS YOUNG LADY.
VERY TOUCHING.

421
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,750
YOU DO KNOW WHAT
I HAVE IN MIND, DO YOU NOT?

422
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,291
- ( exhales )

423
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,458
- ( gun cocks )
- YOU PACIFISTIC FOOL.

424
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,416
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THIS IS A TRAP?

425
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,625
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

426
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,458
- THEN LOWER YOUR PIECE.

427
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,916
- I CAN'T.

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,750
I JUST DON'T SEE ANY WAY
OUT OF THIS DAMN SITUATION!

429
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,208
- THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

430
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,666
IF WE SIMPLY IGNORE
THE GIRL'S PLIGHT,

431
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,250
WE'LL DEFINITELY
MAKE IT THROUGH.

432
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,375
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

433
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,791
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

434
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,250
- I THINK THAT'S THE BEST OPTION
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

435
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,750
IT'S THE ONLY LOGICAL WAY

436
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,250
ANY OF US WILL
SURVIVE AGAINST THEM.

437
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,916
- NO, YOU CAN'T.
- HOWEVER,

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,083
I DO KNOW OF A GUY
OF WHINES, CRIES, 

439
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,083
AND THROWS TANTRUMS,
AND HE SOMEHOW MANAGES

440
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,416
TO FIND A WAY
TO SAVE EVERYONE.

441
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,875
- ( gasps )

442
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,833
- HE'S A CRAZY MAN
WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

443
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,500
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEEN
SCARRED FROM HEAD TO TOE,

444
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,125
HE'LL ALWAYS BE THERE.

445
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,333
- ( gunshots )

446
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,000
- AHHH.

447
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,916
- ( gasps )

448
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,541
- JESSICA!

449
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,916
JESS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,541
THEY DIDN'T HURT YOU,
DID THEY?

451
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,750
- I GUESS THEY DIDN'T.

452
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,083
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

453
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,625
- A FLOWER.
A RED FLOWER.

454
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,291
- ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

455
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,083
THEY CALL THIS ONE
A GERANIUM.

456
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,291
THERE ARE MANY OTHER
TYPES OF FLOWERS ON EARTH

457
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,958
OF ALL DIFFERENT
COLORS AND SHAPES AND SIZES.

458
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,541
THEY HOLD A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE IN PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

459
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,250
- CAN YOU EAT THEM, REM?

460
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,583
- SOME FLOWERS
CAN BE EATEN. 

461
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,208
- DO YOU LIKE FLOWERS?

462
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,666
- I LOVE FLOWERS.

463
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,208
ESPECIALLY RED ONES.

464
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,416
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN BE
VERY SYMBOLIC.

465
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,666
EVEN THE TINIEST FLOWERS
WHICH BRAVE THE ELEMENTS

466
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,875
BEHOLD A MAGNIFICENT STRENGTH.

467
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,916
AND VASH,

468
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,416
IN THE LANGUAGE
OF THE FLOWER, 

469
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,666
RED GERANIUMS REPRESENT...

470
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,291
DETERMINATION AND COURAGE.

471
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,625
- HEY, WAIT A SEC.

472
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,125
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE RED COAT?

473
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,958
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

474
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,583
IT'S VASH THE STAMPEDE.

475
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,750
- ( giggles )
- AAH!

476
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,583
- OH, VASH, VASH, VASH.

477
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,916
I WAS SO SCARED.

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,333
I JUST KNEW YOU'D
COME BACK FOR ME.

479
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,250
- KNOCK IT OFF.
COME ON, WILL YOU STOP IT?

480
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,750
YOU'RE NOT UPSET,
ARE YOU?

481
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,333
- ( Leonof laughing )
- ( all gasp )

482
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,416
- Leonof: YOU ACT LIKE
IT'S ALL OVER,

483
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,125
BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU,
SOME OF MY CHILDREN

484
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,458
ARE STILL THERE.

485
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,791
BESIDES,
DID YOU REALLY THINK

486
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,083
THAT THE GUNG-HO-GUNS
ONLY COME TO CALL

487
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,333
ONE AT A TIME?

488
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,541
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

489
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,416
THREE OF THEM.

490
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,916
- THAT IS CORRECT.

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,208
I HAVE SENT THREE DEMONS.

492
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,583
THEY HAVE ARRIVED,

493
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,666
AND WILL BE VISITING YOU
VERY SOON.

494
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,791
- Leonof: WELCOME.

495
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,125
THIS IS YOUR BIG
COMEBACK CELEBRATION,

496
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,833
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

497
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,500
- ( both screaming )

498
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,208
- ( theme music playing )

499
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

500
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,500
- Vash: THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

501
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,458
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO PROTECT.

502
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,875
THERE'S A TIME
YOU MUST TAKE A STAND,

503
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,333
NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF
PAIN AWAITS US.

504
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,583
THE MAN CLAD IN THE RED COAT

505
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,333
TOOK UP HIS GUN
ONCE AGAIN

506
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,250
IN ORDER TO STOP
THE SADNESS.

507
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,333
IN ORDER TO STOP
THE HATE.

508
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,916
I KEEP THE WORD
OF THE RED GERANIUM

509
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,750
WHICH I WAS TAUGHT
SO LONG AGO.

510
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,250
I KEEP THE COURAGE
AND DETERMINATION 

511
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,250
DEEP IN MY HEART.
