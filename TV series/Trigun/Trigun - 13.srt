1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,875
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,083
- ( panting )

3
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,750
WELL, AREN'T YOU
GONNA SHOOT ME? 

4
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,083
- WHERE DO I FIND YOUR BOSS?

5
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,750
- UH...

6
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,416
I WAS BOUGHT.
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,083
THE MAN I THOUGHT 
TO BE MY FATHER...

8
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,458
TURNED OUT TO BE
NOTHING MORE THAN AN AGENT.

9
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,875
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE.
I SWEAR.

10
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,541
( groans )

11
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,041
HEY, IT'S DANGEROUS
TO BE TOO TRUSTING.

12
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,833
WHAT IF I DECIDED TO GET UP
AND SHOOT YOU IN THE BACK? 

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,583
- I'M NOT THAT TRUSTING.
I KEPT MY FINGER ON THE TRIGGER

14
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,083
THE WHOLE TIME.

15
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,083
- ( murmuring )

16
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,125
- WHAT NOW, VASH?

17
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,833
- ( typewriter keys clacking )

18
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,333
- Meryl:
ROUTINE REPORT, DATE: JULY 20th.

19
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,166
TWO DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT 
CAUSED BY A MAN NAMED MONEV,

20
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,666
TENSION STILL RUNS HIGH
IN THE CITY.

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,250
THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THERE
MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING

22
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
ALL OVER AGAIN.

23
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,166
IT'S AN AWARENESS
WHICH BECOMES OBSCURED

24
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,458
AS I KEEP REGULAR
CONTACT WITH HIM.

25
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:22,250
THAT BEING THE REASON
VASH THE STAMPEDE

26
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,916
IS CALLED
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,750
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,750
WHY IS IT
THAT SO MUCH TROUBLE

29
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,375
FALLS INTO THIS MAN'S LAP?

30
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,375
LAST DECEMBER,
FOUR MONTHS AGO,

31
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,208
WE, MERYL STRYFE
AND MILLY THOMPSON,

32
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:41,250
EMPLOYEES OF THE BERNARDELLI
INSURANCE SOCIETY MAIN OFFICE,

33
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,916
WERE HANDED DOWN OUR ORDERS.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,500
OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH VASH THE STAMPEDE--

35
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,083
A MAN WANTED FOR
60 BILLION DOUBLE DOLLARS

36
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,916
UNDER SUSPICION OF CLASS "G"
PROPERTY DAMAGE.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,750
UPON LOCATING
THIS HUMANOID TYPHOON,

38
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,583
IT WAS OUR MISSION TO MINIMIZE
ANY TROUBLE INVOLVING HIM,

39
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,916
AND BRING A QUICK RESOLUTION

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,625
TO SITUATIONS THAT
HAD ALREADY STARTED.

41
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,666
- WHAT ABOUT VASH?
AND WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

42
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,958
DON'T TELL ME YOU TWO
INNOCENT-LOOKING THINGS

43
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,083
ARE AFTER THAT
60 BILLION-DOUBLE DOLLAR REWARD.

44
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
- OH, NOT AT ALL.

45
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,791
- YEAH, ACTUALLY, WE'RE JUST
PASSING THROUGH HERE

46
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,500
ON BUSINESS.
- BUSINESS?

47
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,041
WELL, I DIDN'T EXACTLY
SEE HIM MYSELF.

48
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,583
AS FAR AS I COULD TELL, HE WAS
GONE FROM THE CITY BY DAWN.

49
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,333
LAST I HEARD, HE WAS
HEADED OUT TO THE EAST.

50
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
- CAN YOU TELL ME
ANY MORE ABOUT HIM?

51
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:31,000
- HMM, WELL, HE STANDS
 ABOUT 12 FIELDS TALL.

52
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,000
AND HE WIELDS A HUGE WEAPON.
- HUH?

53
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,958
- HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A MOHAWK AND NERVES OF STEEL.

54
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,166
APPARENTLY HE'S GOT
TONS OF HENCHMEN,

55
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,625
AND A REPUTATION AS THE WORST
WOMANIZER ANYONE'S EVER SEEN.

56
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,125
- WOMANIZER!
- I HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

57
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,625
HUGE WEAPON AND A MOHAWK.

58
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,833
THAT'S OUR MAN, ALL RIGHT.

59
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,166
- ( typewriter keys clacking )

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,666
- HAVING OBTAINED
INFORMATION OF SOMEONE

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,416
MATCHING VASH'S DESCRIPTION,

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,333
WE FINALLY ACHIEVED CONTACT 
WITH HIM AFTER THREE MONTHS.

63
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,791
- NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

64
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,958
- I'M VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

65
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,458
MY NAME IS MERYL.
I-- I'M MERYL STRYFE,

66
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,416
AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING
THE BERNARDELLI

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,708
INSURANCE SOCIETY.

68
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,625
- AND I'M MILLY THOMPSON.

69
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,750
- THIS, UH, IS A SMALL
TOKEN OF OUR GOOD WILL.

70
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,416
- NICE GOING, MERYL!

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

72
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,416
ARE YOU HERE WITH HIM?

73
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,416
- ( chuckles )

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,791
- Meryl:
IT WAS HIM--

75
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,958
THE OUTLAW,
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

76
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,875
- THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

77
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,375
- I TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF
LICENSE TO KEEP IT INTERESTING.

78
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,416
COME ON, MILLY,
DO YOU WANNA GET A PROMOTION

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,416
OR DON'T YOU?
- ( chuckles nervously )

80
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,250
- AT FIRST GLANCE,
I MUST ADMIT,

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,375
IT WAS A BIT DIFFICULT TO TELL
IF IT WAS HIM.

82
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,083
THIS WAS BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T ACT ANYTHING LIKE

83
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,000
THE LEGENDARY GUNMAN

84
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,666
THAT I'D HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,291
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING
LEGENDARY ABOUT HIM

86
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
WAS HIS HUGE APPETITE.

87
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,083
- ( screaming )
- JUST ONE DRINK, BRO!

88
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,083
- DISGUSTING.
JUST IGNORE THEM.

89
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,916
- HEY, INSURANCE GIRLS!

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,833
- MERYL, WAIT.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

91
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,000
I NEED YOUR HELP!

92
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,333
HOW CAN YOU JUST
LEAVE ME LIKE THIS?

93
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,958
- HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
MAKE-UP KISS, BROTHER?

94
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
- Meryl:
HE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING BUT

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,250
A VULGAR,
HOPELESS TROUBLEMAKER.

96
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,833
- HMM.

97
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,916
- ( giggles )

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,916
- HUH?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
- ( humming )

100
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,583
- UGH.

101
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,750
AND EVEN WORSE YET,

102
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,083
HIS INCORRIGIBLE LECHERY

103
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,625
MADE HIM AN EXASPERATING IDIOT.

104
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,583
- YOU CAN DEFINITELY
COUNT ON ME, MR. CLIFF.

105
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,833
- UGH.

106
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,625
- I DON'T LET ANYONE
IN MY SIGHTS GET AWAY.

107
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,083
AND I'M KNOWN FOR MY BULLETS
NEVER MISSING THEIR MARK.

108
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,041
- ESPECIALLY IF IT'S THE HEART
OF A BEAUTIFUL LADY.

109
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,041
BANG!

110
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,208
- AAH!
( groans )

111
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,208
- MERYL, YOU OKAY?

112
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,166
- ( groans )

113
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,583
JUST REMEMBERING
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY

114
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,833
GIVES ME CHEST PAINS.

115
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,750
I FEEL LIKE MY HEART'S
GOING TO BURST A VESSEL.

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,208
- I THOUGHT VASH WAS
REALLY FUNNY BACK THEN.

117
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,458
I LAUGHED ALL THE TIME.

118
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,291
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE WASN'T FUNNY.

119
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,666
HE WAS DOWNRIGHT WEIRD.

120
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,916
MILLY, NOBODY IN
THEIR RIGHT MIND

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,416
COULD TELL THAT
GOOFBALL WAS HIM.

122
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,791
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?

123
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,541
- BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS HIM
FROM THE START.

124
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,375
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT.

125
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,708
DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT MUCH
THAT I COULD BE RIGHT ABOUT HIM?

126
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,041
- MILLY, HAVE YOU FINISHED
WRITING THE PAPERS YET?

127
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,708
- NO, BUT I'LL KEEP AT IT.

128
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,166
- AHH.

129
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,625
- ( keys clacking )

130
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,416
- HE TRIED TO FOOL US
WITH HIS PERFECT PORTRAYAL

131
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,583
OF A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING,
DIMWITTED LOSER,

132
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,041
BUT IT SOON BECAME
CLEAR TO ME

133
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,708
THAT HIS ANTICS WERE MERELY
PART OF HIS LITTLE GAME.

134
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,958
I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM
HIS TRUE IDENTITY

135
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,833
AS I WATCHED HIM RESOLVE
EVERY INCIDENT

136
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,083
HE WAS INVOLVED IN.

137
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,041
- SUICIDE?

138
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,250
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

139
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,791
I DISAPPROVE OF SUICIDE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

140
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,541
- HMM!

141
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,375
- ALL RIGHT,
THE BOOMERANG IT IS.

142
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,375
AAH!

143
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,541
WHAT?

144
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,416
- AY-YI-YI-YI-YI!

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
- ( groans )

146
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,791
- DANGEROUS TOYS ARE FUN,

147
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,083
BUT YOU COULD GET HURT.

148
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,541
- YOU BASTARD!

149
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,500
( screams )

150
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,625
- WATCH OUT!
- BOSS!

151
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,750
- ( metal clinks )
- ( girls gasp )

152
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,083
- HUH?

153
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,083
- ( snorts )
SCARY!

154
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,083
- DAMN YOU!

155
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,583
- AAH!

156
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,916
OH!
( yelping )

157
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,166
- ( gasps )

158
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,375
- JUST NO SKILL.

159
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,041
- OW!

160
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,791
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

161
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,458
- I'M YOUR BODYGUARD
AND ACE GUNMAN,

162
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,625
JUST AS ADVERTISED.

163
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,708
- ( gunshot )

164
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,083
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

165
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,041
TRYING TO PLAY
THE HERO, COWBOY?

166
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,500
- NO, NOT REALLY. I'M NOT AS
GREAT AS YOU MIGHT THINK I AM.

167
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,375
- ( air hissing )

168
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,000
- AH, GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.

169
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,416
YOU'VE GOT A FLAT TIRE.

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,250
WELL, I GUESS YOU WON'T BE
ESCAPING IN THIS.

171
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,208
- ( all shouting )

172
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,416
- ( gasps )
- ( chuckles )

173
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,458
HUH?

174
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,750
( straining )

175
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,166
SON OF A--

176
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,083
OH, YOU-- AAH.

177
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,666
- HOW'D HE DO THAT?

178
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,250
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

179
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,125
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO, MISTER?

180
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,083
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS
THE ONE AND ONLY

181
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,375
INFAMOUS HUMANOID TYPHOON.

182
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,875
HE'S VASH THE STAMPEDE!

183
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,375
- ( groaning loudly )
- THAT'S FUNNY.

184
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,458
PARDON ME.

185
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,625
BUT I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

186
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,125
THAT HE WAS A LOT MORE HANDSOME.

187
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,583
- ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT
I AM NOT VASH THE STAMPEDE?!

188
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,583
- MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND OUT.

189
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,000
- Meryl: HE WAS A SUPERB GUNMAN
JUST AS THE RUMORS CLAIMED,

190
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,458
AND EVERY INCIDENT HE WAS IN

191
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,458
WAS SWIFTLY, SWIFTLY--

192
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,458
HE DID IT SO HAPHAZARDLY.

193
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,791
HOW COULD THOSE INCIDENTS HAVE
BEEN ANYTHING BUT DUMB LUCK?

194
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,166
ANY OF THEM!

195
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,750
( groans )
DARN IT!

196
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,250
UGH!

197
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,750
- SAFE!

198
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,708
- ( meows )
- HUH?

199
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,625
- STILL...

200
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,250
STILL, IT IS
THE UNMISTAKABLE TRUTH

201
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,916
THE HE SOLVED EACH INCIDENT
WITHOUT THE USE OF HIS GUN.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,916
HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED
TO HARM ANYONE,

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,250
EVEN WHEN CITIZENS
TRIED TO KILL HIM

204
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,583
TO COLLECT THE
BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD.

205
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,666
- AAH!

206
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,250
CAN THIS BE THE END?!

207
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,250
( grunts )

208
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,750
- THERE HE IS.
IN HERE!  GET HIM!

209
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,125
- OH, CRAP!
- ( gunfire )

210
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,625
- AAH!
- GET BACK HERE, YOU!

211
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,125
- THERE HE GOES!
- WE'VE GOT YOU NOW!

212
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,541
- OH, REALLY?

213
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,541
YOU MEAN ME?

214
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,208
- ( gunfire )

215
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,958
- NOT AGAIN!

216
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,333
WHOA!

217
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>MAMAN,</i> WHY DOES THIS
KEEP HAPPENING TO ME?

218
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,375
I HAVEN'T ANYTHING WRONG,
BUT I'M ALWAYS IN TROUBLE

219
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,916
AND EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS
PICKING ON ME!

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,416
WHAT DO I DO, <i>MAMAN?</i>

221
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,416
( sniffles )

222
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,291
WHY AM I CRYING IN FRENCH?

223
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,625
AAH!

224
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,166
- Meryl: WHY DOES HE
ACT THE WAY HE DOES?

225
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,125
I CAN ONLY SPECULATE,

226
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,625
BUT PERHAPS PART OF THE
REASON CAN BE FOUND

227
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,375
IN THE TESTIMONY OF
MISS MONICA ALLEN

228
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,791
OF INEPRIL CITY.
- GET ME OUT OF HERE!

229
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,000
- ONLY ONE PERSON HAS TO DIE
TO SAVE THE CITY.

230
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,791
SO, PLEASE, MR. VASH,
GIVE YOURSELF UP.

231
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
( murmurs )
PLEASE DON'T MOVE.

232
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION
BETTER THAN YOU KNOW.

233
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,541
HOWEVER--

234
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,291
- NO, PLEASE, SIR,
DON'T DO THAT.

235
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,458
( gasps )

236
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
- UNTIL I SEE THIS MAN
YOU'RE AFTER,

237
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,541
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO KEEP MOVING.

238
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,291
- ( breathes heavily )

239
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,791
- NOW, PLEASE...

240
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,791
- ( yawns )

241
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,125
WHO DO YOU THINK
MR. VASH WAS REFERRING TO

242
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,375
WHEN HE MENTIONED THE MAN
MONICA WAS AFTER?

243
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,083
- ( typewriter keys clacking )

244
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,291
- AND SO, HE FINALLY TOOK
HIS GUN INTO HIS HAND.

245
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,958
HE PULLED THE TRIGGER
FOR THE FIRST TIME

246
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,375
TO SAVE THE VERY PEOPLE

247
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
WHO HAD TRIED TO KILL HIM.

248
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,166
- ( rock music playing )

249
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,041
- HEY, TIME'S UP, WONDER BOY.

250
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,041
THROW THE FEAR OF DEATH
INTO HIM, GOFSEF.

251
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,583
- ( grunting )
- ( gasps )

252
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,583
- MOMMY!

253
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,083
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

254
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,083
- ( cackling )

255
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,083
HUH?

256
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,583
- WOW...

257
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,083
( all murmuring )

258
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOTH
 ARE STILL ALIVE AND WELL.

259
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,958
I WAS KINDA HOPING
YOU'D DITCH THE WOMAN

260
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,125
AND SAVE YOUR OWN SKIN.

261
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,583
- VASH WOULDN'T DO THAT.

262
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,625
HE ISN'T THAT KIND OF PERSON.

263
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,583
- SO YOU WON'T KILL 
NO MATTER WHAT, HUH?

264
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,166
YOU ARE DISGUSTING!

265
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,416
YOU KNOW WHAT, VASH?

266
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,416
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A DAMN HYPOCRITE.

267
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,458
- ( exhales )

268
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,250
- THERE'S NO WAY
 YOU HAVEN'T HAD

269
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,750
TO KILL TROUBLEMAKERS
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.

270
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,125
HOW DO I KNOW?

271
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,166
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN SURVIVE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

272
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,791
WITHOUT HURTING SOMEBODY.

273
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,625
A 60 BILLION-DOUBLE DOLLAR
BOUNTY ON YOUR HEAD

274
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,291
IS PROOF OF THAT.

275
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,583
WELL?  WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF,

276
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,208
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

277
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,500
HMM.

278
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,833
HMM?

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,833
YOU FINALLY READY 
TO FIGHT, ARE YOU?

280
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,083
OH, SO YOU WANNA DRAW?

281
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,041
YOU FELT IT TWICE ALREADY.

282
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,625
EVEN YOUR PUNY BRAIN
CAN REALIZE MY SON'S FIST IS

283
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,000
A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH,

284
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,875
OR DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU'LL SURVIVE ANOTHER ONE?

285
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO RUN.

286
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
ALTHOUGH, NO MATTER
HOW FAST YOU ARE,

287
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,250
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES,

288
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,750
YOU'LL BE SMASHED
INTO TINY PIECES.

289
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,916
( laughs )

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,708
NOW PAY ATTENTION,
BECAUSE AS A COURTESY,

291
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,916
I'M GOING TO LECTURE YOU

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,666
ON JUST WHAT
A STUPID FOOL YOU REALLY ARE.

293
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,166
USING THIS TECHNIQUE.

294
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,166
MY HUMAN MINCEMEAT
SPECIAL COURSE.

295
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,458
HA-HA.
- ( slightly gasps )

296
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,791
- GO HELP THEM, QUICK.

297
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,583
ENJOY BEING A HERO
FOR A MOMENT,

298
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,416
THEN DIE IN A MOST
HUMILIATING WAY.

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,916
- ( grunts )

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,125
- ( heartbeats )

301
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,458
- ( gunshots )

302
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,208
- WHOA!

303
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,458
- HE... DID IT.

304
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,750
- WOW...
- IT CHANGED COURSE.

305
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,208
- THAT WAS GREAT!

306
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,750
- AAH!
- ( blubbering )

307
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,583
- IT CAUSED MY SON'S FIST
TO VEER OFF-COURSE

308
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,083
WITH SIX LITTLE BULLETS.

309
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,166
- NOT QUITE, DOC.

310
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,750
I HAVE ONE LEFT.

311
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,291
COULD BE MY SPECIAL ONE.

312
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,000
- ( screams )

313
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,625
- ( groans )

314
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,625
- MY BABY!

315
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,791
- ( townspeople screaming )

316
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,708
- WHOA.

317
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
DID YOU SEE WHAT HE DID?

318
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,708
HE REALLY BEAT HIM.

319
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,708
AND HE DID IT
WITH ONLY SIX BULLETS.

320
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,666
UNBELIEVABLE.

321
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,541
- Meryl: SUDDENLY,
IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR TO ME...

322
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,750
WHY HE IS CALLED
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON.

323
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,791
IT'S ACTUALLY HIM.

324
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,250
HE'S FOR REAL--
THE LEGENDARY OUTLAW.

325
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,666
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

326
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,416
OH, YEAH!
- ( keys clacking quickly )

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,416
- NO MATTER WHAT,
I THINK THIS MAN...

328
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,250
IS VASH THE STAMPEDE.

329
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,083
- Vash: LOVE AND PEACE!
- HUH?

330
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,083
- LOVE AND PEACE!

331
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,083
LOVE AND PEACE!

332
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,166
LOVE AND PEACE!

333
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,791
LOVE AND PEACE!

334
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,291
- AAH!

335
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,291
- YOU'RE REALLY FUN TO WATCH.

336
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,916
( yawns )

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,416
- MEOW.

338
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,916
- MMM. <i>MILLE-FEUILLE...</i>

339
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,541
- VASH THE STAMPEDE...

340
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,708
EVERY TIME I OBSERVE
HIS ACTIONS,

341
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,875
I CAN'T HELP BUT SENSE...

342
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,250
SOMETHING HIDDEN
DEEP WITHIN HIM.

343
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,708
SOMETHING WE CAN'T
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND.

344
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,333
BUT THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN...

345
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,041
EVERYONE WHO HAS BECOME
INVOLVED WITH HIM

346
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,000
HAS SOMEHOW REGAINED AN EMOTION
WHICH WAS ONCE LOST.

347
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,666
- FATHER!

348
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,333
FATHER, I'M COMING!

349
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,208
- I'M-- I'M ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

350
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,875
- ( gasping )

351
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,750
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

352
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,541
IT WAS YOU ALL THE TIME?

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,875
- LIKE I'VE MENTIONED
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE,

354
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,333
NOTHING BEATS HARD-WON FAME.

355
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,583
- ( chuckles )

356
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,250
- MM-MM.

357
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,250
FROM THIS POINT ON,
WE'RE GONNA GO ON LIVING

358
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,083
WITHOUT RELYING ON ANYONE.

359
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,750
IT'LL BE JUST THE TWO OF US.
- ( giggles )

360
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,458
- THAT'S NICE OF YOU GUYS
TO SAY THAT.

361
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208
- Meryl:
BUT I STILL WONDER...

362
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,250
- HUH?  OH.

363
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,208
MR. VASH.

364
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,208
- STAY BACK!

365
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,708
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

366
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,500
- WHO IS HE?

367
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,750
THAT'S NOT VASH.
THAT IS NOT THE SAME MAN.

368
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,416
WHO IS THAT MAN?

369
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,583
CAN HE POSSIBLY BE
THE REAL VASH THE STAMPEDE?

370
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,083
THE EVIL 60 BILLION-DOUBLE
DOLLAR OUTLAW

371
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,625
WITH THE FIRE OF HELL
BURNING IN HIS EYES? 

372
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,958
- ( screams, grunts )

373
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,625
HE'LL PAY.

374
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,500
HE WILL PAY FOR THIS.
- ( footsteps approaching )

375
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,458
- HUH?

376
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,125
- THEY'RE DEAD.

377
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,833
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

378
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,500
- WHO THE HELL CARES?

379
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,291
( groans )

380
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,291
AAH.

381
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,416
- YOU KILLED ALL THE PEOPLE!

382
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
THEY'RE ALL DEAD,
AND YOU KILLED THEM ALL!

383
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,250
- ( groans loudly )

384
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,500
- AND YOU WERE THE ONE
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE.

385
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,750
- AAH, AAH, AAH...

386
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,250
- NOW IT IS YOUR TURN TO DIE!

387
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,625
- ( slightly gasps )

388
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,833
( sighs )

389
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,416
THERE ARE SO MANY SIDES TO HIM.

390
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,375
WHICH IS THE REAL VASH?

391
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

392
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,708
- ( snoring )
- Man: WE'RE ALL SCARED.

393
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,416
WE CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT.

394
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,291
- Man #2:
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

395
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,083
- CAN'T WE GET SOMEONE TO TELL
HIM TO GET OUT OF THIS HOTEL?

396
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,375
- TELL VASH THE STAMPEDE
TO GET OUT?

397
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,208
HA!  ARE YOU INSANE?!

398
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,541
- ( rumbling, crashing )
- HUH?!

399
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,208
- ( Vash yelping )

400
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,250
- HUH?

401
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,791
- ( whimpers )

402
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,250
- VASH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

403
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,958
- ( both gasp )

404
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,458
- ( exhales )

405
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,333
- MM.  AAH.

406
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,166
- ( girls deeply sigh )

407
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,291
- SO THOSE SCARS
ARE THE PRICE YOU PAID

408
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,625
FOR DEALING WITH
YOUR OPPONENTS

409
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,375
WITHOUT KILLING THEM.

410
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,750
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY
SOMETHING I LIKE GIRLS TO SEE.

411
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,750
I THINK MANY OF THEM
WOULD RUN AWAY.

412
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,875
- I WOULDN'T RUN AWAY.

413
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,166
WHAT I MEAN IS
THEY WOULDN'T RUN AWAY.

414
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
UH, VASH?

415
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,416
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU
THIS FOR A WHILE NOW.

416
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,125
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG,

417
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,958
YET TERRIBLE THINGS KEEP
HAPPENING TO YOU ALL THE TIME.

418
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,083
THE TOWNSPEOPLE LOOK AT YOU

419
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,666
LIKE YOU'RE SOME
SORT OF CRIMINAL.

420
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,416
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

421
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,083
HOW CAN YOU GO ON
LIVING THIS WAY?

422
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,666
IT SEEMS SO AWFUL.

423
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,666
- I CAN'T.

424
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,500
I CAN'T DO THAT.

425
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,833
I HAVEN'T YET
BURIED MY PAST.

426
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,875
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN LIVE IN PEACE

427
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
UNTIL I'VE COME
TO TERMS WITH IT,

428
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,000
AND I'M ABLE TO
FINALLY PUT IT BEHIND ME.

429
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,041
- YOU'RE LEAVING?

430
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,708
- HEY, THANKS, SHERIFF,
FOR LETTING ME GO LIKE THIS.

431
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,541
- I'M ONLY DOING IT 'CAUSE
I DON'T WANT YOU IN MY TOWN.

432
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,916
AND I DON'T WANT YOUR THANKS.

433
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,958
I JUST WANT YOU
TO GET THE HELL OUT.

434
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,000
- ( chuckles )
YEAH, I GUESS I WILL.

435
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,041
- DO YOU PLAN TO
FOLLOW HIM THIS TIME?

436
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,416
- OF COURSE I AM.
I HAVE TO; IT'S MY JOB.

437
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,833
- THAT'S TRUE.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.

438
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,791
I CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE
THE TWO OF YOU ALONE TOGETHER,

439
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,583
SO I SUPPOSE
I BETTER COME ALONG.

440
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,083
- UGH, ANYONE EVER TELL YOU 
YOU'RE JUST SIMPLY ANNOYING?

441
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,583
- OH, REALLY?!

442
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,458
YOUNG LADY,
WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL ALONE

443
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,250
IN THE DESSERT,
IT CAN BE VERY PERILOUS.

444
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,750
BUT IF YOU ACT NOW, YOU CAN HIRE
YOUR VERY OWN BODYGUARD

445
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,750
FREE OF CHARGE!
AND MY WORK IS GUARANTEED.

446
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,750
- OH, GREAT!
I TAKE MY EYES OFF HIM

447
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,375
FOR A MINUTE,
AND HE'S AT IT AGAIN.

448
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,833
- WAIT!  WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

449
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,500
HEY!  DON'T JUST WALK AWAY.

450
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,000
COME ON NOW.

451
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,250
YOUNG LADY!

452
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,416
- Meryl:
VASH THE STAMPEDE...

453
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,708
( chuckles )

454
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,666
- ( chuckles )

455
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,333
- ( end theme playing )

456
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

457
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,791
- Vash:
IF YOU ONLY FACE FORWARD,

458
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,583
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU WILL MISS SEEING.

459
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,000
IT IS A VIRTUE
TO DEVOTE ONESELF TO SOMETHING,

460
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,000
FIRMLY BELIEVING
IN ONE'S OWN IDEALS.

461
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,458
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
IT'S ALL RIGHT

462
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,250
TO BELITTLE THE IDEALS
OR FEELINGS OF OTHERS.

463
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,291
IF YOU LEAD SUCH A BUSY LIFE,

464
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,500
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE 
HOW YOUR PARENTS FEEL,

465
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,958
IT'S ONLY SELF-SATISFACTION.

466
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,291
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO STOP
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN...

467
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,083
IF YOU WANT A MOMENT'S REST,

468
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,416
IF YOU WANT TO FEEL
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL.
