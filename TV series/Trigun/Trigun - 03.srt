1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,500
- ( distant music playing )

3
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,458
- ( sloshes )

4
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,416
- THAT SURE PAID OFF, HUH?

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,416
- YES SIR, I'D SAY THAT
LADY LUCK IS ON OUR SIDE!

6
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,708
- ( laughing )
- ( slurring ) YO, BROTHER.

7
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,958
- HMMM?

8
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,000
- YOU SURE SEEM LIKE A
MIGHTY PROSPEROUS FELLA.

9
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,333
HUH?
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

10
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,916
- I AIN'T GOT NO CASH.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,083
HOW ABOUT BUYING ME
A DRINK, HUH?

12
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,791
I'LL TAKE ANYTHING
THAT'S GOT ALCOHOL IN IT.

13
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,083
ETHYL, METHYL,
COUGH SYRUP, WHATEVER.

14
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,291
- HUH.

15
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,750
SCREW OFF,
YOU STUPID DRUNK!

16
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,541
- DON'T BE BRINGING YOUR REEKING
CORPSE IN HERE EVER AGAIN!

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,458
- I WON'T GIVE YOU ALCOHOL,

18
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,458
BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE
YOU A NICE HOT LEAD BULLET

19
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,750
BETWEEN THE EYES.

20
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,625
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER?

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,416
ARE YOU TOO SCARED
TO TALK NOW, MISTER?

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,416
- ( both laugh )
- ( yelps )

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,958
- AND DON'T SHOW YOUR UGLY FACE
AROUND HERE EITHER.

24
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,791
- ( laughs, door closes )

25
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,041
- ( laughing )

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,333
THE STUPID IDIOTS.

27
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,250
- Milly: SO, MERYL, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO SEARCH FOR TODAY?

28
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,291
A GIANT MAN?
A RED COAT?

29
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,250
BLONDE HAIR
OR A GUY WITH A MOHAWK?

30
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,958
LET'S SEE NOW, AFTER THAT,
WHAT WAS NEXT?

31
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,750
- I'VE HAD IT WITH RUMORS.

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,500
FROM NOW ON, I'LL ONLY BELIEVE
WHAT I SEE FOR MYSELF.

33
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,875
THERE'S A GUNMAN OUT THERE
THAT'S SO AMAZING,

34
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,000
THEY PUT $$60 BILLION
ON HIS HEAD.

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,541
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING
TO BEGIN OUR SEARCH TODAY.

36
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,750
- THAT'S AWFULLY VAGUE, MERYL.
CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

37
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,916
- ( sighs )
ALL I'M SAYING

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
IS THAT WE NEED TO
PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION

39
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,875
TO ANYONE THAT
MIGHT BE LIKE THAT!

40
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,416
- BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE SUCH
A PEACEFUL, QUIET TOWN.

41
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,791
- YOU'VE GOT TO ALWAYS
BE ALERT, MILLY.

42
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,708
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
VASH THE STAMPEDE

43
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,708
IS GOING TO SHOW UP
AND THEN KABOOM.

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,458
- Milly: OH WOW! HI, VASH!
- HMMM?

45
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,083
HUH?
- ( gulps )

46
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,416
- WELL, HEY THERE!

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,333
IT'S THE INSURANCE GIRLS.
ARE YOU WORKING?

48
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,875
- OH YES, WORKING HARD.
- ( growls )

49
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,958
- HMMM, WELL, YOUR COMPANY
MUST BE VERY PROUD OF YOU.

50
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,583
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
- OKAY, MR. VASH, WE WILL.

51
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,500
- SEE YOU AROUND, LADIES.

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,250
- ( giggles )
GEE, MERYL,

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,458
HE MATCHES
THE DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY.

54
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S VASH?

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,333
- WELL, BECAUSE HE
RAISED HIS HAND

56
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,833
WHEN I CALLED HIS NAME.

57
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,583
- HE ONLY RAISED HIS HAND
BECAUSE YOU CALLED OUT TO HIM.

58
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,125
IT'S A NATURAL RESPONSE
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS OUT TO YOU.

59
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
LISTEN, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A HORRIBLE FIEND

60
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
WITH A PRICE ON HIS HEAD.

61
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,375
NOT A OBNOXIOUS IDIOT
LIKE THAT MAN.

62
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,750
- ( sneezes )
I THINK I HAVE A COLD.

63
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,791
- ( slurring )
I'M GOING!

64
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,291
- ( both yelp )

65
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,750
- DAMN, THAT REALLY HURT.

66
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,083
HUH?

67
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,125
- ( muffled shouts )
- ( animal groans )

68
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
- OVER HERE, BUDDY!
- HUH? HMM HMM?

69
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,750
- TALKING TO YOU, PAL.
YOU BUMP INTO SOMEONE,

70
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,083
THEN YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

71
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,375
- HUH?
- ( stammering )

72
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,625
HI.
CATCH YOU LATER.

73
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,083
- HOLD IT-- OW OW!

74
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,333
MY FRIGGING SHOULDER HURTS

75
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,250
'CAUSE YOU SLAMMED
INTO ME BACK THERE.

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,833
( moaning )

77
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,291
HOW ABOUT BUYING ME A DRINK?
- HUH?!

78
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,125
- I DON'T EXPECT ANY MONEY.

79
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,916
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BUY ME A DRINK.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,958
- NO NO NO NO NO.
- HEY, DON'T BE SHY!

81
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,833
- ( shrieking )
- HEY, WE'RE PALS, AREN'T WE?

82
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,666
- BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!
- AW, COME ON, BUDDY!

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,666
GIVE IT UP.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

84
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,291
- Vash: STOP! STOP IT!
- WHAT THE--?

85
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,916
- JUST ONE DRINK, BRO!

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,083
YOU OWE ME.
SHOW A LITTLE GENEROSITY HERE.

87
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,583
- HUH?
- Drunk: COME ON.

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
- DISGUSTING.
JUST IGNORE THEM.

89
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,583
- Vash: INSURANCE GIRLS!
- BUT, MERYL, WAIT.

90
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,583
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
I NEED YOUR HELP!

91
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,583
HOW COULD YOU JUST
LEAVE ME LIKE THIS?!

92
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,125
- HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
MAKE-UP KISS, BROTHER!

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,416
- Vash: AAH! HELP!

94
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,625
- HEY, BARTENDER,
BRING ME THE BEST IN THE HOUSE!

95
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,750
- YOU GOT MONEY, FRANK?

96
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,666
- ( grunts ) MY BOY HERE IS
THE SON OF A MILLIONAIRE!

97
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,250
- BRING IT ON! NOTHING
BUT THE FINEST!

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,708
- HE'S LYING, PLEASE JUST
BRING US THE CHEAPEST

99
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,541
IN THE HOUSE, ALL RIGHT?

100
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,125
( sighs )

101
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,708
HMMM?

102
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,333
- I DON'T WANT NOBODY
MAKING TROUBLE IN HERE,

103
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,708
SO, MISTER, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LET ME

104
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,250
HOLD YOUR GUN UNTIL YOU LEAVE.

105
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,958
- HUH? ALL RIGHT.

106
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,750
- THIS IS A STRANGE GUN.

107
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,250
- IT WAS GIVEN TO ME.

108
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,458
I THINK
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD GUN.

109
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,375
- Frank: NO, IT ISN'T.

110
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,250
- YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY SHARP.

111
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,916
YOU MUST KNOW GUNS.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,708
IT'S THREE INCHES OFF
FROM ONLY 10 YARZ.

113
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,458
- ( cork pops )

114
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,166
- IT WOULDN'T KILL HER TO BE
MORE FRIENDLY, NOW WOULD IT?

115
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,750
I PROPOSE A TOAST
TO NEW FRIENDS!

116
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,041
- OH, YEAH!

117
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,041
- AHH, SWEET!

118
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,583
OUT OF ALL THE
GREATEST INVENTIONS

119
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,250
MAN CREATED IN HISTORY,

120
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,041
ALCOHOL IS HIS GREATEST!
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, MY PAL?

121
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,208
- UH, BY THE WAY,

122
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,750
I WASN'T REALLY INTENDING
ON BUYING YOU DRINKS,

123
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,166
BUT SINCE I AM, COULD YOU
LISTEN TO MY REQUEST?

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,375
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- FRANK MARLON, DO YOU KNOW HIM?

125
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,916
- NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- HEY, GRANDMA!

127
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,083
OH, I MEAN, MISS?

128
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,500
HE IS FAMOUS, ISN'T HE?
- YEAH, HE'S FAMOUS, ALL RIGHT.

129
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,583
HE'S THE HERO
OF THIS HERE TOWN.

130
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:54,416
A LONG TIME AGO, THIS TOWN
WAS ATTACKED BY VICIOUS BANDITS.

131
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,208
SO MARLON THE GUNSMITH
WENT AROUND TOWN

132
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,250
HANDING OUT GUNS
HE MADE HIMSELF,

133
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,583
TEACHING FOLKS HOW TO USE
THEM AGAINST THE BANDITS.

134
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,416
- HUH.

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,958
- NOW YOU KNOW THE STORY.

136
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,125
SO WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS
WITH FRANK MARLON?

137
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,000
- I JUST WANTED HIM TO FIX
MY OLD HEAP, THAT'S ALL.

138
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,000
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
HE'D JUST PAWN IT FOR BOOZE

139
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,916
AND YOU'D HAVE TO BUY
YOURSELF A NEW G--

140
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,625
- HEH.
( laughs )

141
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,291
YOU REALLY WANNA GIVE YOUR GUN
TO A COMPLETE STRANGER, MISTER?

142
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,458
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE YOURSELF
TO BLAME

143
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,541
IF YOU GET SHOT IN THE BACK.

144
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,916
YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A DAMNED IDIOT.

145
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,291
THAT'S RIGHT, NOTHING BUT
A HOPELESS OLD FOOL.

146
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,083
HUH?

147
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,416
- WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

148
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,208
THERE'S REALLY NO SHERIFF
IN THIS TOWN?

149
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,000
- THAT'S RIGHT, MISS.

150
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THAT'S RIGHT?

151
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,958
- MY DEAR, THIS IS
A VERY QUIET TOWN.

152
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,291
NOTHING SERIOUS
EVER HAPPENS HERE.

153
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,916
I'M PROUD TO SAY
THAT WARREN CITY

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,916
IS A SAFE PLACE FULL
OF HAPPY PEOPLE.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,541
- THE WORST IT EVER GETS
ARE A FEW CRAZY DRUNKS.

156
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,750
- MR. MAYOR, I DON'T MEAN
TO ALARM YOU, SIR,

157
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,208
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT

158
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,583
I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOW.

159
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,625
- ( mayor laughing )
- ( meow )

160
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,541
- THE LEGENDARY CRIMINAL
HERE IN MY TOWN?

161
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,666
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

162
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
- I ASSURE YOU IT'S NO
LAUGHING MATTER!

163
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,541
- WELL, IF HE'S REALLY
THAT GREAT,

164
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,041
I THINK IT WOULD BE KINDA FUN
TO HAVE HIM ATTACK

165
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,666
AND SPICE THINGS UP
AROUND HERE.

166
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,541
- I'M SORRY, MR. MAYOR, BUT I
DON'T FIND THIS FUNNY AT ALL.

167
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,583
- ( cackling )
- Man: HEY, BIG BRO!

168
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,750
- HUH?
- THEY WAS RIGHT.

169
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,375
IT'S JUST LIKE WE HEARD!

170
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,166
A BIG ARMORED TRUCK'S
GONNA BE COMING

171
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,166
TO THAT TOWN'S BANK AT NOON.

172
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,750
- EXCELLENT, DEAR BROTHER.

173
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,708
- IT'S 4,000 YARZ
TO THE NEXT TOWN.

174
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,583
THEY HAVE NO SHERIFF.

175
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,583
WE COULDN'T ASK FOR
A BETTER LOCATION!

176
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,750
- AND LISTEN TO THIS,
I HEARD A RUMOR GOING AROUND.

177
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,250
THEY SAY VASH THE STAMPEDE
SHOWED UP AND HE'S REAL CLOSE.

178
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,333
DO YOU MEAN VASH
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON?

179
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,583
- YEAH.
- ( cackles )

180
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,583
- Both: HUH?

181
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,791
- ( grunts )

182
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,458
ALL RIGHT.
( cackles )

183
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,708
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

184
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,541
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

185
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,083
( laughs )
I HAVE A PLAN.

186
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,083
WE WILL HAVE THE HUMANOID
TYPHOON, VASH THE STAMPEDE,

187
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,333
ATTACK THE ARMORED CAR.
I CAN SEE IT NOW.

188
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,416
THIS IS PERFECT.
( cackling )

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
- ( meows )

190
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,125
- GET THE HELL OUT!

191
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,375
- HEY, WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

192
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,583
WE WERE JUST ENJOYING A DRINK,
YOU SELFISH WITCH.

193
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,291
- GIMME-GIMME BACK
MY GUN, GRANDMA.

194
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,291
- HUH?
WHAT HAPPENED, BROTHER?

195
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,791
- I DON'T KNOW.
MY HEAD JUST STARTED TO HURT.

196
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,916
- OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
I HAVE AN IDEA.
- YOU HAVE AN IDEA?

198
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,000
- LET'S GO TO MY PLACE
AND DRINK IT BETTER.

199
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,750
- Meryl: WHAT ARE
YOU TWO DOING THERE?

200
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,208
- HUH?
- UH-OH.

201
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,708
- Vash: OH,
IT'S THE INSURANCE GIRLS!

202
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,416
- YOU SURE LOOK HAPPY,
MR. VASH!

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,833
- ( laugh )
HAVING A HECK OF A GOOD TIME.

204
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,708
BY THE WAY, WHAT ARE THE
TWO OF YOU DOING OUT SO LATE?

205
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,791
- WE'RE HERE ON NIGHT PATROL!

206
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,291
MY PARTNER IS CONVINCED
THAT VASH THE STAMPEDE

207
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,958
IS GONNA SHOW UP
IN TOWN TONIGHT!

208
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,458
- HE DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW
WHY WE ARE OUT SO LATE, MILLY.

209
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,291
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, MERYL.

210
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,583
- NIGHT PATROL?!
WOW, THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

211
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,833
AREN'T THESE GIRLS
WONDERFUL?

212
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,291
- HERE'S TO
THE WONDERFUL WOMEN!

213
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,416
- ( both laugh )
CHEERIO!

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,083
( drunken singing )

215
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,458
- GEE, MERYL, THEY LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE HAVING A BLAST.

216
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,541
- I DON'T THINK SO. PEOPLE ONLY
DROWN THEMSELVES IN ALCOHOL

217
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,791
WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING
THEY WANT TO FORGET!

218
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,750
IT'S AN ESCAPE
FROM REALITY.

219
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,708
- Frank: ARE YOU STILL
DRINKING, BROTHER?

220
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,958
- YEAH, TONS.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

221
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,250
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA BE IN ANY SHAPE

222
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,541
TO GO TO WORK TOMORROW.

223
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,291
- I GOT IT COVERED.
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

224
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,458
I ONLY DO CHARITY WORK.
DON'T GET PAID,

225
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,625
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER I'M COHERENT OR NOT.

226
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,208
- HUH?

227
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,833
- MY FRIEND, THE WORLD IS FULL
OF THE WEAK AND THE SUFFERING.

228
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,125
I'VE ALWAYS MADE IT MY BUSINESS

229
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,250
TO HELP OUT THOSE
IN TIME OF NEED.

230
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,583
- AHH.
- ( gulps )

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,666
BUT THEN I FOUND A WAY TO HELP

232
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,458
THOSE WHO AREN'T
SUFFERING AT ALL.

233
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,750
- WHAT? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

234
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,625
- THEY SAY IT'S WRONG
TO DISCRIMINATE, RIGHT?

235
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:57,875
YOU HELP SOMEONE,
AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE SUFFERS.

236
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,625
THAT IS HOW
THIS WORLD WORKS.

237
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,458
- OH.
- THAT IS WHY

238
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,166
I'VE DECIDED TO DO NOTHING.

239
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,125
THAT'S ALL I DO,
NOTHING BUT DRINK.

240
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,416
THERE YOU HAVE EQUALITY.

241
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,666
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

242
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,458
- ( Frank snoring )

243
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,791
- Man: YOU WANT TO SEE
FRANK MARLON? ( laughs )

244
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE IT UP, PAL.

245
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,666
HE JUST AIN'T THE MAN
HE WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

246
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,166
NOW HE'S JUST DAMNED DRUNK.

247
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,875
AS A GUNSMITH, HE WAS
SOMETHING OF A GENIUS.

248
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,458
BUT THEN IN ONE DAY
HIS WHOLE LIFE CHANGED

249
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,166
WHEN HIS WIFE AND KID
WERE KILLED IN A BANK ROBBERY.

250
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,125
- HUH?

251
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,500
- ( gunshots )

252
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,458
- Tailor: THEY HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE BANK AT THE WRONG TIME.

253
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,083
THEY JUST GOT CAUGHT
IN THE CROSSFIRE.

254
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,458
BUT TO FRANK,
THE REAL TRAGEDY WAS...

255
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,208
HE HAD MADE THE GUNS
THAT THE ROBBERS USED.

256
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,958
IN FACT, HE HAD GIVEN THEM
THE GUNS PERSONALLY.

257
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,291
- ( gags )

258
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,750
( running footsteps,
retches )

259
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,791
- ( moans )

260
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,375
HUH?
WHAT THE...

261
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,416
WHERE'D HE GO?

262
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,750
- Man: OH MY GOD!

263
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,291
- HUH?
- VASH THE STAMPEDE IS HERE!

264
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,375
HE'S ATTACKING
THE ARMORED CAR!

265
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,500
- EH, VASH THE STAMPEDE?

266
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,583
- ( gunshots, laughter )

267
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,083
- YOU'D BE REAL SMART
TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!

268
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,125
'CAUSE THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
IS NONE OTHER THAN

269
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,375
THE $$60 BILLION MAN...

270
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,583
VASH THE STAMPEDE,
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON!

271
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,458
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!
IF YOU GET HIM REAL MAD,

272
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,791
HE MAY JUST DECIDE TO BLOW
THIS TOWN TO SMITHEREENS.

273
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,250
- HMMM, HOW PLEASANT.

274
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,416
SURE WOULD BE NICE
IF ALL THE TOWNSFOLK

275
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,791
WERE THIS HELPFUL.

276
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,125
- UH, EXCUSE ME, MR. VASH?

277
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,833
MY NAME IS MERYL STRYFE
AND I'M HERE WITH MY PARTNER

278
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,250
REPRESENTING THE BERNARDELLI
INSURANCE SOCIETY.

279
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,041
AND WE WERE SENT HERE TO--

280
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,166
- HEY, SHUT UP AND
JUST LOAD THE BAGS!

281
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,625
- Both: YES SIR!

282
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,250
- I FEEL HORRIBLE, MERYL.

283
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,083
- IF ONLY I WOULD HAVE
BOUGHT HIM A BOX OF DONUTS.

284
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,000
- YOU'D BETTER GET
THE LEAD OUT, LADIES.

285
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,666
- Both:
YES SIR, WE WILL.

286
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,083
- COUNTERMEASURE #1:

287
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,875
TAKE THE PLACE OF A HOSTAGE.

288
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,875
( muffled groan )
- WON'T WORK.

289
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,041
- #2 THEN:

290
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,416
SEND EVERYBODY INTO A MAD PANIC
BY SHOUTING "EARTHQUAKE!"

291
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,833
YEOW!
- EVEN WORSE.

292
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,458
- ( growls ) WELL THEN,
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

293
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,833
- I HAVE TO GO WITH #3:

294
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,166
YOU KNOW, JUST STAND BACK HERE
WHERE IT'S SAFE,

295
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,458
LET 'EM TAKE THE MONEY
AND SHUT UP.

296
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,541
- I DON'T THINK SO.

297
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,750
- WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
STICKING YOUR NECK OUT?

298
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,875
JUST KEEP QUIET,
YOU JUST MIGHT STAY ALIVE.

299
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,291
AND THERE'LL BE A LOT LESS
DAMAGE AROUND HERE TOO.

300
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,250
- LOOK, DO YOU SEE
THAT LITTLE GIRL?

301
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,750
- YEAH.

302
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,291
- HER MOTHER PROMISED TO BUY
HER SOMETHING WITH HER MONEY

303
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,916
THAT USED TO BE IN THE BANK
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
- YOU KNOW HER?
- NAH, JUST MADE IT UP.

305
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WORRYING
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY?

306
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,916
I MEAN, WHAT GOOD'S
IT GONNA DO YOU?

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,958
- NOTHING AT ALL.

308
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,791
EXCEPT THAT THIS
SITUATION IS NOT EQUAL.

309
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,458
- Both: HUH?

310
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,750
- HUH?

311
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,208
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

312
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,833
- ( whispers ) BIG BRO.
- HMM?

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
- ( gunshot )

314
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,333
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

315
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,000
TRYING TO PLAY THE HERO, COWBOY?

316
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,958
- NO, NOT REALLY. I'M NOT AS
GREAT AS YOU MIGHT THINK I AM.

317
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,750
AW, GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU'VE GOT A FLAT TIRE!

318
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,583
WELL, I GUESS YOU WON'T BE
ESCAPING IN THIS.

319
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,416
- ( screaming )

320
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,041
- YOU LITTLE--

321
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,583
- ( screams, gasps )

322
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,791
- ( laughs )

323
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,583
HUH? LET--

324
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,000
SON OF A--

325
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,416
WHOA, LET GO, YOU--
( moaning )

326
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
- HOW'D HE DO THAT?
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

327
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,416
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO, MISTER?

328
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
IS THE ONE AND ONLY

329
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,208
INFAMOUS HUMANOID TYPHOON.

330
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,208
HE'S VASH THE STAMPEDE!

331
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,958
- NOW THAT'S FUNNY.

332
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,625
PARDON ME.
- ( bones crack )

333
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,458
- BUT I UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT HE WAS A LOT MORE HANDSOME.

334
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,958
- ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT
I AM NOT VASH THE STAMPEDE?!

335
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
- MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND OUT.

336
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,625
- HUH? UHH.

337
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,208
( thinking )
WHY?

338
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,750
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

339
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,375
- WE CAN USE FORCE
IF WE HAVE TO.

340
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,416
- RIGHT!

341
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,250
- WHY?!

342
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,208
- Bartender:
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

343
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,708
- HUH?
- HUH?

344
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,625
- ( groans )

345
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,250
- ( wind blowing )

346
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,666
- ( both gasp )

347
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,916
- THIS GUN IS AN ORIGINAL
FRANK MARLON SPECIAL!

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,583
AND DON'T THINK I'LL MISS
JUST 'CAUSE I'M A WOMAN!

349
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,833
- AM I SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID
OF THIS FRANK MARLON?

350
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,541
IT'S A RUSTED PIECE OF CRAP!

351
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,583
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE YOU'LL
HIT ME WITH THAT THING?

352
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,708
- ( sloshes )
WHY?

353
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,125
WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT?

354
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,750
AND WHY AM I JUST
STANDING HERE?!

355
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,125
- THAT THIS SITUATION
IS NOT EQUAL.

356
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,041
- HUH? HMM?

357
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,500
WHAT THE--?

358
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,708
- UH?

359
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,333
- ( laughs ) APPARENTLY
YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE WON.

360
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,041
YOU THINK WRONG!
- ( cocking )

361
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,208
- A PIECE OF PARTING ADVICE:

362
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,750
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SAVE
YOUR ACES FOR LAST!

363
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,416
( cackles )

364
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,625
( gulps )

365
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
- CHECKMATE, MISTER.

366
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,083
- ( gulps )

367
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,041
- SHOOTING FROM BEHIND'S
JUST NOT MY STYLE.

368
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,125
- YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!
- ( screaming )

369
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,125
- YOU WILL PAY!
- ( all grunt )

370
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,750
- WOW, THEY REALLY
STICK TOGETHER.

371
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,125
HUH?

372
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,416
- HMPH, WASN'T EVEN LOADED.

373
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,208
- HUH, SURE WASN'T.

374
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,208
- ( all cheering )

375
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,666
- HE'S ACTUALLY DUMBER
THAN I THOUGHT.

376
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,083
THAT GUY IS UNBELIEVABLE.

377
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
- ( excited chatter )

378
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,250
- HERE'S TO ALL THE GREAT FOLKS
WHO SAVED THE TOWN!

379
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,833
IN YOUR EYE!

380
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,666
AHA HA HA!
GRANDMA, WHAT YOU WAITING FOR?

381
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,333
FILL 'ER UP!

382
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,291
I MEAN, PLEASE FILL 'ER UP,
MISS, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND?

383
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,458
- THAT'S BETTER!

384
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,166
- ( laughs )
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND HIM.

385
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,125
- THINGS TURNED OUT WELL
AFTER ALL.

386
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,875
THERE'S NO DAMAGE
TO THE TOWN.

387
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,208
THE CHIEF WILL PROBABLY
GIVE US BOTH PROMOTIONS!

388
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,416
- BUT THE BANDIT WAS A FAKE.
IT WASN'T REALLY HIM.

389
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,791
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
GOTTEN OUR CHANCE

390
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,208
TO MEET VASH THE STAMPEDE.

391
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,958
- Milly: BUT SOMEONE
MATCHES HIS DESCRIPTION!

392
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,708
- HUH?

393
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,375
- OH MAN, I'VE GOTTA
FIND THE CAN.

394
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,416
- Frank: STICK 'EM UP.

395
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,208
- ( laughing )

396
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,375
- I WOULDN'T EXACTLY COUNT
ON THIS FOR EVERYDAY USE

397
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,250
IF I WERE YOU.

398
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,041
- HUH?
- BUT HERE, TAKE IT.

399
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,958
I'VE CHANGED THE CYLINDER
AND HAMMER PARTS FOR YOU,

400
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,166
AND I GAVE IT
A FULL TUNE-UP.

401
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,625
- HEY, THANKS.

402
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,500
- AW HECK, YOU DON'T
NEED TO THANK ME.

403
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,958
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
I WANT TO KNOW.

404
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,041
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT GUN?

405
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,875
- I INTEND TO USE IT
TO CREATE EQUALITY

406
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,291
AND PEACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD!
- HUH?

407
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,083
WELL, IF YOU EVER
WEAR IT OUT AGAIN,

408
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,708
BRING IT BACK,
I'LL FIX IT AS GOOD AS NEW!

409
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,291
- GREAT. AND WHEN I DO, I'LL
BRING THE BOURBON NEXT TIME.

410
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,250
- NO THANKS,
I'VE GIVEN UP ALCOHOL.

411
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,708
I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
INSTEAD OF DRINKING.

412
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,375
- Milly: WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

413
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,208
- SHH!
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

414
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,750
I JUST REALIZED, PAL,
I NEVER DID GET YOUR NAME.

415
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,250
- WELL-- I'M--

416
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,291
( gags )

417
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,875
( retching )

418
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,250
- YOU DRINK TOO MUCH!

419
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
- Vash: I'M SORRY!
- Frank: DISGUSTING.

420
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,333
- ( animals groaning )

421
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,708
- YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO ADMIT

422
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,875
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM, DO YOU, MERYL?

423
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,875
- NO, AND I AM NOT FOLLOWING
HIM, FOR YOUR INFORMATION.

424
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,750
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE GOING
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

425
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,083
- BANG BANG.

426
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,250
- ( theme music playing )

427
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,791
( singing in Japanese )

428
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,875
- Vash: A PAST THAT
CAN'T BE FORGOTTEN

429
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,375
AND CAN'T BE BURIED.

430
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:21,291
A PAST THAT CAN'T EVEN BE SHAKEN
FOR JUST A LITTLE TIME.

431
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,750
THE SENTIMENT DEEP INSIDE
EACH OF THEIR HEARTS

432
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,916
IS STRONG AND EQUAL.
FOR BELOVED PARENTS,

433
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,250
AND FOR A BELOVED DAUGHTER.

434
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,125
TWO MEN CAN ONLY FIND THE ANSWER
FROM BEHIND THEIR TRIGGERS.

435
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,375
THE MOMENT THE SENTIMENTAL
BULLETS FLEW TOWARDS EACH OTHER,

436
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,541
THE MEN STOOD SILENT,
YET WERE WEEPING.

437
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,125
THE PAST ENSLAVES.
