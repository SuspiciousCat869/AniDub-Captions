A BIG PILE OF MONEY LIKE THAT

DON'T EXPECT YOUR INSURANCE
TO COVER IT.

00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,416
IT'S THE LATEST TASSELED BEAGLE!

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,125
- Man #4: HOLY MOLEY!
HOW ABOUT THIS MUCH?

THEY'RE WORTH WAY
MORE THAN THAT!

00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,250
THEY ARE THE LEFTOVERS FROM
THE PANDORA'S BOX GOD GAVE US

155
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,708
THAT ALLOW YOU AND I TO EXIST
IN THIS POOR ENVIRONMENT.

156
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,958
I CAME TO THIS PLACE
TO REPAIR THE PLANT

157
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,833
AND TO KEEP THAT HOPE ALIVE
FOR THESE PEOPLE.

158
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,000
- THEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?

159
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,083
- FIRST I HAVE A SPECIAL JOB
I WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME.

160
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,750
- IS THERE SOME KIND OF REWARD?
( whimpers )

161
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,791
- DON'T WORRY,
I WILL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.

162
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,583
- WHAT I WANT?
REALLY REALLY?

163
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,916
I'LL DO IT, I'LL DO IT!
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!

164
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,208
- OVER HERE!
EVERYTHING IS DIRT CHEAP!

165
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,541
- HERE'S A PIPING HOT ONE,
FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN.

166
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,166
- OOH, THANKS!
SMELLS DEE-LICIOUS!

167
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,

168
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,750
WHERE THE HELL DID THAT
MAN RUN OFF TO NOW?

169
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,875
- MEOW.
- ALL OF THESE EXTRA PEOPLE HERE

170
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,125
MAKES IT HARD TO FIND HIM.

171
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,916
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'D BE IN THERE.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,250
KEEP LOOKING, MILLY.
- WELL, HELLO THERE, CUTIE PIE!

173
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,041
I'M READY AND WILLING TO BE
YOUR OBEDIENT LITTLE DOGGY!

174
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,583
I RESPOND WELL TO DISCIPLINE.

175
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,416
- NICE TRY, PUNK, BUT YOU'RE
JUST A CHILD.

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,958
- THAT'S RIGHT! SHE MAY NOT
LOOK IT, BUT SHE'S 20--

177
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,750
- MILLY, HE DOESN'T
NEED TO KNOW THAT!

178
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,125
- Vash: YEAH, I'D ADVISE
AGAINST IT ANYWAY, PAL.

179
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,791
SHE'S REALLY BITCHY.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

180
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,541
- Milly: MR. VASH!
- WHAT? VASH?!

181
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,916
( screams )

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,958
- WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHAT HAVE YOU-- HUH?

183
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,791
WHO, MAY I ASK, IS THAT?
- Vash: A TOTAL BABE!

184
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,291
- THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEAN.

185
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,125
- I ASKED HIM TO SERVE AS
MY PERSONAL BODYGUARD

186
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,916
WHILE I'M HERE TO REVISE
THE PLANT SYSTEM PROGRAM.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,250
- Both: OH.

188
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,000
- COME ALONG, SPOT!

189
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,458
- ( barks, pants )
- Both: WHAT? SPOT?

190
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,250
- WHERE'S THE HOTEL?

191
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,250
- IT'S JUST UP AHEAD. WE'RE
ALMOST THERE, MASTER!

192
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,750
- THANK YOU, SPOT.
- ( growls )

193
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,458
- WELL, WE DID FIND HIM.
THAT IS GOOD, ISN'T IT?

194
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,250
- AREN'T WE GOING
TO GO FOLLOW HIM?

195
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,291
- I'D RATHER DO A MOUNTAIN
OF PAPERWORK

196
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,250
THAN WATCH OVER THAT IDIOT
FOR ONE MORE SECOND!

197
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,375
- Elizabeth: I'M BEGINNING
THE RESTORATION WORK

198
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,625
AT 6:00 A.M. SHARP,

199
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,333
SO, SPOT, DON'T BE LATE.
- NOT TO WORRY, MA'AM.

200
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,916
IN SOME PLACES I'M KNOWN AS
ROOSTER BOY OR EARLY BIRD

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
OR EVEN
MR. UP-AND-AT-'EM.

202
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,000
( groans )

203
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,666
HEY, AREN'T WE
IN THE SAME ROOM?

204
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,500
- AS SOON AS MY WORK
IS DONE, SPOT.

205
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,166
UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE GOING
TO SLEEP IN THE INNERMOST ROOM.

206
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,375
GOOD NIGHT NOW.

207
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,500
- ( sighs )

208
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,583
IT NEVER SEEMS
TO GO MY WAY.

209
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,000
HMMM?

210
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,500
SOMETHING'S COMING.

211
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,125
( shrieks ) STOP!
HEY, YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FAIR.

212
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,875
( gulps )

213
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,083
OHHH!

214
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,250
STOP THERE.
I DON'T LIKE SLEEPING WITH MEN,

215
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,666
ESPECIALLY UGLY ONES.

216
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,875
WOULD YOU PLEASE BE
GOOD ENOUGH TO GO NOW?

217
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,083
HEY, HE ACTUALLY DID
WHAT I ASKED HIM.

218
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,208
- ( beeping )
- HMM?

219
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,125
( panting )

220
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,250
- HUH? WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

221
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,166
THIS IS HORRIBLE!
- OH HI, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

222
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,250
GO BACK TO SLEEP!

223
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
- OH MY GOD, IT'S VASH
THE STAMPEDE!

224
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,791
( screams )
- I'M GLAD THAT I TOOK THE TIME

225
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,166
TO SWITCH OUR ROOM NUMBERS
IN THE HOTEL REGISTRY.

226
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,291
- THAT'S NO FAIR!
- AREN'T YOU PROTECTING ME?

227
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,333
- I'D AT LEAST LIKE
TO HEAR AN EXPLANATION.

228
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,125
- TOMORROW WILL DO.

229
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,291
- I LOST MY ROOM
SO CAN I SHARE YOURS?

230
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,333
- BUT YOU HAVE
A BED RIGHT OUT THERE.

231
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,375
- ( sobs )
- ( wind gusting )

232
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,291
- THAT'S SO COLD.

233
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,541
- Owner: I SURE AM GLAD YOU
BERNARDELLI PEOPLE ARE HERE.

234
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,208
HERE'S MY INSURANCE POLICY.

235
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,458
- Meryl: BY THE WAY,

236
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,791
FOR OUR RECORDS, WHO WAS
STAYING IN THIS ROOM?

237
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,291
- CAN'T YOU TELL
BY LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE?

238
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,416
IT WAS VASH THE
STAMPEDE OF COURSE.

239
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,208
- OH.

240
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,541
UH YEAH, THAT GUY.

241
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,250
- Elizabeth: THERE CAN
ONLY BE ONE REASON WHY

242
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,791
SOMEONE IS
TRYING TO KILL ME.

243
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,041
MOST OF WHAT CREATED THE PLANT
WAS LOST TECHNOLOGY.

244
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,291
AND I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
TO USE IT,

245
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,958
BUT THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN

246
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,625
THAT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE PLANT REALLY IS.

247
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,583
- WELL, HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED
UP TO THIS POINT?

248
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,000
- THE UNION HAS ALWAYS
PROVIDED AN ESCORT FOR ME

249
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,291
IN CASE THERE WAS
ANY TROUBLE, BUT THIS TIME,

250
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,125
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL
YOU WERE HERE FOR ME?

251
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,541
- I'LL DO MY BEST TO LIVE
UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS!

252
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,583
- Man: HEY, YOU!

253
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,500
- Man #2: YOU CAN'T
COME IN HERE!

254
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,958
THIS AREA'S RESTRICTED!

255
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,000
- I FOUND OUT YOU'RE
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE

256
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,041
FOR THE HOTEL EXPLOSION.

257
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,708
- WELL, YOU FOUND OUT WRONG.

258
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,583
- IT WAS YOUR FAULT, WASN'T IT?

259
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,625
- THE CHIEF IS
GONNA GET MAD AT US

260
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,500
FOR NOT DOING OUR JOB AGAIN!

261
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,583
- BUT I WAS THE VICTIM
IN ALL THIS!

262
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,083
BESIDES, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY CRYING, ARE YOU?

263
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,500
- ANYWAY, THIS PLANT IS
AN IMPORTANT PLACE

264
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,583
AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE IN HERE.

265
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,583
- BUT I REALLY NEED HIM HERE.

266
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,833
AFTER ALL, SPOT IS
GUARDING ME.

267
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,750
- HUH?

268
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,583
HE MAY APPEAR
TO BE HARMLESS,

269
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,500
BUT HE'S VASH THE STAMPEDE,
YOU KNOW.

270
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,833
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I NEED HIM.

271
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,791
- BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
WHEREVER THIS MAN GOES,

272
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,916
HE ALWAYS LEAVES TROUBLE
BEHIND HIM.

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,291
- CHIEF! THERE'S A MALFUNCTION
IN SECTION NUMBER THREE!

274
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,625
- GEE, WHAT AMAZING TIMING!
- NO-OOO!

275
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,625
- ( whirring )

276
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,833
- I DON'T GET IT.

277
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,541
THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM
IN PLANT NUMBER FOUR

278
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,291
SUDDENLY STARTED OPERATING.
- SHUT DOWN THE MAIN CONTROL.

279
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,666
- YES, MA'AM!
IT'S NO GOOD.

280
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,208
IT'S NOT SHUTTING DOWN!
- THIS IS REALLY BAD.

281
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,041
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND THE
PLANT ALL THE NEW DATA DIRECTLY.

282
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,041
SPOT?
- YES?

283
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,416
- COME.
- HUH?

284
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
- COMING!

285
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,583
- WAIT A MINUTE! WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

286
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,291
- TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

287
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,083
EVEN IF I HAVE TO SHAKE YOU
FROM ME, I'VE GOTTA GO!

288
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,916
- THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
WITH THE DYNAMICS
OF THE SITUATION HERE!

290
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,291
- I THINK
WE BETTER TAKE SHELTER!

291
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
THERE'S TROUBLE ALREADY
SWARMING AFTER HIM!

292
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,875
- ( panting )

293
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,333
- Elizabeth: FLIP THE SWITCH.
- RIGHT!

294
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,458
- GET IN.
- RIGHT AWAY! I'M ON IT.

295
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,166
( gasps )
GET BACK!

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,041
- ( evil laughter )
- RUN.

297
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,375
CAN'T YOU RUN?

298
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,458
NICE WARM-UP.
NOW LET'S PLAY.

299
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
- ( groans )
- ( both yelling )

300
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,583
- ( gurgling )

301
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU GOT IN HERE,

302
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,083
MY VICIOUS LITTLE FRIEND.
IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME.

303
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,583
- ( bangs )
- ( moans )

304
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,541
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
KIND OF CUTE!

305
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,083
- Elizabeth: I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO GET SOMEONE BETTER

306
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,250
TO BEAT YOU.

307
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,791
IT LOOKS LIKE
I'LL HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF.

308
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,958
- ( footsteps, screams )

309
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
HEY, WHAT DID
YOU DO THAT FOR?

310
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,375
AM I BEING PUNISHED
FOR SOMETHING?

311
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,375
- I WANT YOU TO DEAD.
- HUH?

312
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
- OH, ARE YOU AFTER
THAT STUPID REWARD?

313
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,750
- NO. I WANT YOU TO DIE FOR
WHAT YOU DID ON STAR DATE 0104,

314
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:58,000
JULY 21st, 2:06 P.M.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

315
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,083
I'D THINK THAT YOU WOULD,
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DAY

316
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,833
THAT YOU EARNED FIRST
CRIMINAL RECORD.

317
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,375
THAT'S RIGHT.

318
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,708
THAT DAY YOU TRANSFORMED THE
THIRD CITY OF JULY, MY HOMETOWN,

319
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,750
INTO NOTHING LESS
THAN HELL ITSELF.

320
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,041
( Elizabeth chuckles )

321
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF WITCHCRAFT YOU USED--

322
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,166
THE CITY WAS
SO BADLY DESTROYED,

323
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,708
AND YET NO ONE WAS KILLED.

324
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,625
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER?

325
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:30,416
1,400,000 PEOPLE BECAME
HOMELESS AND DESTITUTE,

326
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,916
THEIR BODIES AND SOULS
PARCHED TO THE BONE.

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,708
THEY ABUSED EACH OTHER,
STOLE FROM EACH OTHER

328
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,791
AND DESPISED ONE ANOTHER.
THAT'S RIGHT.

329
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,291
BECAUSE OF YOU
I WAS THROWN INTO HELL,

330
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,416
BUT I STILL HAD
TO GO ON LIVING!

331
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,125
- MOMMY, DADDY!

332
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,625
WHY AREN'T YOU MOVING?

333
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,625
( cries )

334
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,916
- Elizabeth: I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY,

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,625
WANDERING THROUGH THE RUBBLE
OF WHAT USED TO BE A CITY

336
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,000
AT THE AGE OF THREE.
- ( gasps )

337
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,166
( whimpering )

338
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,750
- I WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE

339
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,458
THE SAME PAIN
AND SADNESS I FELT.

340
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,541
IT'S YOUR TURN.
NOW IS THE TIME...

341
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,291
TO AVENGE
MY MOTHER AND FATHER!

342
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,250
REPENT...
REPENT AND DIE!

343
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,833
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

344
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,458
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

345
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,958
- IT'S NO GOOD. THE POWER
LEVELS AREN'T DROPPING!

346
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,250
- IF WE DON'T CONTROL IT,

347
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,250
IN A FEW HOURS IT WILL
TRIGGER AN OVERFLOW!

348
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,750
THEN MELTDOWN TIME.

349
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,875
- FIRE HAS ERUPTED AND SPREAD
INTO THE ENOMES GLASS.

350
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,875
- IF IT EXPLODES, IT'LL LEAVE
A CRATER 200 YARZ WIDE!

351
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,208
- Elizabeth:
I INPUT THE NEW DATA.

352
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,416
HOW ARE THE POWER LEVELS?

353
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,625
- Man: IT'S NO GOOD!
THEY'RE NOT DROPPING!

354
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,833
- EVERYONE EVACUATE
THE FACILITY. QUICKLY!

355
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,000
- YES MA'AM!

356
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,541
- MOVE IT PEOPLE, LET'S
MOVE, LET'S MOVE!

357
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,166
- EXCUSE ME,
WHERE'S MR. VASH?

358
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,583
- HE DECIDED TO STAY BEHIND.

359
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,875
- WHAT?

360
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,500
- THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S DECIDED
TO STAY OUT OF IT.

361
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,000
- BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY
FOR HIM TO STAY BEHIND!

362
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,166
I'M GOING TO GO GET HIM BACK!
- WAIT, MERYL,

363
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,750
DON'T GO IN THERE.
IT'S TOO LATE.

364
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,041
- BETTER GET OUT QUICKLY
OR YOU'LL BE KILLED.

365
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,375
- UH?

366
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,875
- ( grunts )
THE PLANT IS ACTIVATED.

367
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,375
DAMN! DID THAT WOMAN
LEAVE ME HERE TO DIE

368
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,083
WITH THAT IDIOT
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

369
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,458
THAT WASN'T OUR DEAL!

370
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,458
( groans )

371
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,833
WHAT THE HELL?

372
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,333
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

373
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

374
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING!

375
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,875
- AND IT WAS SO HARD
TO GET THE FUNDS TO REPAIR IT.

376
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,000
- WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

377
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,500
- BUT VASH IS STILL
IN THERE, MOM!

378
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,250
- Man: GET BACK!

379
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,125
- COME ON,
WE'D BETTER LEAVE.

380
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,416
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

381
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,291
- Meryl: THE PLANT!

382
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,916
- ( gasps ) WHAT?

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,750
- Man: THE LEVELS
ARE DROPPING!

384
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,666
- Man #2: BUT HOW
DID THAT HAPPEN?

385
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,916
- Man: HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
- IT CAN'T BE!
- IT COULDN'T BE!

387
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,000
- ( all gasp )

388
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,833
- ( townspeople clamoring )

389
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,916
- Both: ALL RIGHT, YES!

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,208
- VASH DID IT!

391
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
MR. VASH IS ALIVE!

392
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,416
HE STOPPED THE PLANT FROM
EXPLODING AND HE SAVED US ALL!

393
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,916
- UH, YEAH.

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,916
- THANKS, MR. VASH!
- NICE GOING, VASH!

395
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,416
- THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, VASH!
- YOU SAVED OUR BUTTS!

396
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,125
- HUH?

397
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,666
- AREN'T YOU GONNA GO SEE HIM?
- OH, UH...

398
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,916
HE JUST LIKES TO
SCARE PEOPLE. HE'S SO BAD.

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,458
COME ON, MILLY, LET'S GO
ORGANIZE OUR PAPERWORK.

400
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,500
- HUH?
HEY, MERYL, WAIT UP!

401
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,375
- Man: HEY, THANKS, VASH!
- Woman: THANK YOU, VASH!

402
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,458
- THANKS AGAIN!
- THANKS A LOT, VASH!

403
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,333
- Elizabeth:
YOU... HOW?!

404
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,458
- I'M VERY SORRY
THAT I DIDN'T DIE.

405
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,958
I JUST COULDN'T ALLOW EVERYONE
IN THE CITY TO BE DESTROYED.

406
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,958
- ( sighs )
HOW DARE YOU.

407
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,791
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
AFTER WHAT YOU DID!

408
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,791
- ( clicks )

409
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,833
- IF YOU HAD SUCCEEDED
IN DESTROYING THE PLANT,

410
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,666
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE SAME AS ME.

411
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,083
- I KNOW THAT,

412
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,375
BUT YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I WANT TO HEAR THAT FROM.

413
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,333
YOU DESTROYED JULY!
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A HYPOCRITE!

414
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,416
- I HAVE NO MEMORY
OF ANY OF IT.

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,625
- ( gasps )

416
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,208
- Vash: THAT RUINED CITY

417
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,791
WITH ALL THE PILES OF DEBRIS

418
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,375
WERE THE FIRST AND LAST THINGS
I SAW OF THAT PLACE.

419
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,916
IT'S STRANGE-- I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING BEFORE THAT...

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,125
EXCEPT FOR MEMORIES
OF MY EARLY CHILDHOOD.

421
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,041
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT WASN'T YOU?

422
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,125
- I DON'T KNOW.

423
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,916
- DON'T KNOW?

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,083
THEN JUST LET ME
BLAME YOU FOR IT!

425
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,416
LET ME HAVE MY REVENGE!

426
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,583
- Man: WAY TO GO, MR. VASH!

427
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,708
THE CITY IS SAVED!

428
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,958
- ( Elizabeth shuddering )

429
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,041
WHY DID IT HAVE
TO BE YOU?!

430
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,291
WHY DID SOMEONE LIKE YOU
HAVE TO TURN OUT TO BE

431
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,916
VASH THE STAMPEDE?!

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
( sobbing )

433
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,750
- I'M SORRY.

434
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,458
- ( gasps )

435
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,791
IT COULDN'T BE THE SAME MAN.

436
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,541
( ragged breathing )

437
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,875
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

438
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,291
IT WAS YOU ALL THE TIME.

439
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,291
( sobbing )
THAT CAN'T BE.

440
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,333
THAT CAN'T BE...
( sobbing continues )

441
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,833
- ( theme music playing )

442
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,750
( singing in Japanese )

443
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,916
- Vash: THE TRAGEDY
ENDLESSLY REPEATED

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,750
IN ORDER TO FULFILL DESIRES,

445
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,083
THE LUST FOR CONQUEST,
MAKING PEOPLE BEND TO YOUR WILL,

446
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,916
A THRILL INTENSE ENOUGH
TO MAKE YOU SHUDDER--

447
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,250
THERE'S A MAN WHO WAS
A SLAVE TO THAT ECSTASY.

448
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,250
THE LEADER OF THE BAD LADS,

449
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,916
A MAN WHO SHINES--
BRILLIANT DYNAMITES NEON.

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,791
THE SAND STEAMER WILL SHAKE
THE MOMENT THE HUGE DYNAMOS

451
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,875
ON EACH OF HIS SHOULDERS
START TO SPARK.

452
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:42,416
IN THE PITCH BLACK DARKNESS,
THE GRUESOME PARTY BEGINS.
