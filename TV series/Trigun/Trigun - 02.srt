1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,208
- HIM AGAIN.

3
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,250
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.

4
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,166
GOTTA GET SOME HELP.

5
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,916
- ( women sighing )

6
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,583
- MERYL, I DON'T SEE
A SOUL ANYWHERE.

7
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,083
- NOBODY TOLD ME THIS
BECAME A GHOST TOWN.

8
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,583
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

9
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,833
- I REALLY HOPE THERE'S
A WELL AROUND--

10
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,583
- WISHFUL THINKING DOESN'T HELP.
JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,

11
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,625
IT ONLY MAKES
THE TRUTH MORE PAINFUL.

12
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,916
- ( both shriek )

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
( both panting )

14
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,666
( screaming )

15
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,166
- Milly: YOU WERE RIGHT.
THE TRUTH HURTS.

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,791
- I HATE BEING RIGHT.
HUH?

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,083
LAND SUBSIDENCE?
- Man: TARNATION!

18
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,625
FIRST THE WATER DRIES UP,

19
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,500
THEN THAT DANGED CRIMINAL, THE
HUMANOID TYPHOON, SHOWS UP!

20
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,333
THIS TOWN AIN'T FIT
TO LIVE IN NO MORE!

21
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,750
- YEAH, VASH THE STAMPEDE!

22
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,041
THE NEW HIRED GUN AT
SCHEZAR'S MANSION!

23
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,541
- AW, SHUCKS, THIS TOWN
IS FINISHED!

24
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,333
- ♪ BAD TIME FOR HERE,
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA. ♪

25
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,166
- ( sighs, giggles )

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,083
- MMM, MERYL?
- UH-HUH.

27
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,708
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'M SO EXCITED.

28
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,583
NOW WE CAN GET WATER
FROM THAT MANSION!

29
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,000
- OH, I GIVE UP.

30
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,000
EXCUSE ME, IS THIS
THE SCHEZAR RESIDENCE?

31
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,583
MY NAME IS MERYL STRYFE

32
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,000
AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE
BERNARDELLI INSURANCE SOCIETY.

33
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,583
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE.

34
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,416
- YEAH, AND I'M HER
PARTNER MILLY THOMPSON

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,916
AND WE'RE VERY THIRSTY!

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,583
- HEY, DON'T SAY THAT!

37
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,708
I JUST NEED TO ASK
YOU A FEW QUESTIONS

38
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,916
ABOUT VASH THE STAMPEDE.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,791
I HEARD THAT HE WAS
STAYING HERE.

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,291
- ( both gasp )

41
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,833
- AHHH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

42
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,583
- YES, WE CERTAINLY
APPRECIATE THIS!

43
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,583
- ( both gasp )

44
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,250
- HELLO!

45
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,875
- HELLO!

46
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,750
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

47
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,375
- I WORK HERE NOW.
I'M MR. CLIFF'S HIRED BODYGUARD

48
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,416
AND I'M HIS EXCLUSIVE
ACE GUNMAN!

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,916
HEY, IS THAT FOR ME?
HOW NICE!

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,166
( chuckles )
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

51
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,541
- YOU'RE REALLY A BODYGUARD?

52
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,291
- MMMM, THESE ARE GOOD.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

53
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,208
- WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. ACE GUNMAN!

54
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,250
- ( muffled )
IT'S AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE!

55
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,416
THESE ARE REALLY DELICIOUS!
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE? HMM?

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,166
- YES, I'D LOVE ONE!

57
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,083
- HUH? YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP
YOUR MIND ON BUSINESS, MILLY.

58
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,083
- HUH?

59
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,166
- ALL RIGHT, ACE,
I WANT TO KNOW,

60
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,083
WHAT'S YOUR REAL REASON
FOR BEING HERE?

61
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,166
- MMMM.

62
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,583
- WELL NOW, THAT WAS
AN ODD RESPONSE.

63
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,416
- ( man laughs ) EXCUSE ME,
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU,

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,583
BUT ARE THESE YOUNG LADIES
FRIENDS OF YOURS, VASH?

65
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,750
- WHAT, VASH? HE'S NOT VASH!

66
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,125
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,750
- IN ANY EVENT, YOU TWO SEEM
TO BE HERE FOR A REASON.

68
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,000
- HUH?

69
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,666
- WE SHOULDN'T BE
DISCUSSING THIS OUT HERE.

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,125
WON'T YOU PLEASE COME IN?
- Milly: UH, YEAH, BUT--

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,208
I DON'T THINK THAT WE-- UH.

72
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,250
- ( distorted music playing )

73
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,708
- MY NAME IS CLIFF SCHEZAR.

74
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,333
I MAKE MY LIVING SELLING
WATER IN THIS TOWN,

75
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,083
BUT RECENTLY SOMEBODY'S
BEEN TRYING TO KILL ME.

76
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,916
THAT COULD BE BAD
FOR BUSINESS AND MY HEALTH.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,333
SO I ADVERTISED
FOR A GOOD BODYGUARD,

78
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,875
FOR SOMEONE TOUGH AND SMART
LIKE VASH THE STAMPEDE.

79
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,250
- OH.

80
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,333
- I ORIGINALLY PUT HIS
NAME DOWN AS A JOKE.

81
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT
IT WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

82
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
AND THAT THE REAL THING
WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW UP.

83
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,833
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, VASH?
- YUCK.

84
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,291
- YEAH, IT'S ME ALL RIGHT.

85
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,833
NOW THAT I AM HERE YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

86
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,625
THE MAN WHO WILL SLAUGHTER
THE INNOCENT,

87
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,208
DOES THE MOST EVIL OF EVIL DEEDS
WITH THE PRICE $$60 BILLION

88
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,083
ON HIS HEAD.

89
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,916
YES, I AM THAT MAN!
RAHR!

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,750
- WHAT A NICE DEPENDABLE GUY,
AND MODEST AS WELL.

91
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,916
( laughs )
- ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,750
WITH VASH AROUND, THE PEOPLE
OF THE MANSION WILL BE SAFE!

93
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,875
- ( groans )
THIS MAY SOUND RUDE,

94
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,791
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE YOUR EYES CHECKED!

95
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,041
- NOW LISTEN, YOUNG LADY,

96
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,333
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT
I HAVE A GOOD BODYGUARD.

97
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,833
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

98
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,083
HER NAME IS
MARIANNE ALLA CAYZEN.

99
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,250
SHE'S THE GRANDDAUGHTER
OF THE HEAD OF THE STANDTALL

100
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,541
FEDERAL BUREAU,

101
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,958
AND SHE'S STAYING
AT THE MANSION AS MY GUEST.

102
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,208
- Both: OH.

103
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
- THE TRUTH IS WE HAD AN
ATTEMPTED BREAK-IN HERE

104
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,583
FIVE DAYS AGO AND FRANKLY,
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.

105
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,625
- ( giggles )
- HUH?

106
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,375
- ( chuckles )
- ( Meryl groans )

107
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,750
- Cliff: I WOULDN'T HAVE
HIRED A BODYGUARD

108
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,750
IF I THOUGHT THEY WERE
COMING AFTER ME,

109
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,333
BUT MARIANNE'S SAFETY
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY

110
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,625
AND I DO NOT WANT
ANYTHING HAPPENING TO HER.

111
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,625
NOW YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY

112
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,250
AND THAT IS WHY I
NEED YOUR HELP.

113
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,250
- YOU CAN DEFINITELY
COUNT ON ME, MR. CLIFF.

114
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,625
- ( groans )

115
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,291
- Vash: I DON'T LET ANYONE
IN MY SIGHTS GET AWAY

116
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,958
AND I'M KNOWN FOR MY BULLETS
NEVER MISSING THEIR MARK...

117
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,416
- ( gasping )

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,583
- ...ESPECIALLY IF IT'S THE
HEART OF A BEAUTIFUL LADY.

119
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,083
BANG!
- ( moans )

120
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,791
- OOOP!
- MERYL, ARE YOU OKAY?

121
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,291
- I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU PROTECT
ME, MR. VASH, I REALLY AM.

122
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,750
- OH YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
THAT! I HEAR IT ALL THE TIME!

123
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,125
- IS THAT RIGHT?
I BELIEVE IT.

124
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,291
- YEAH, THEY REALLY DO!
( laughs )

125
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,791
- HEY, MERYL, YOU NEED HELP?
- UGH.

126
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,625
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

127
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MY DEAR?

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,791
- LISTEN TO ME, MR. CLIFF.
I THINK YOU'RE A NICE MAN,

129
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,583
HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT WEIRD GUY OUT THERE

130
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,291
IS VASH THE STAMPEDE,
THE LEGENDARY GUNMAN?

131
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,166
THAT DROOPY-EYED, COCKY,

132
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,916
UPSIDE-DOWN-HAIRED,
WOMEN-CHASING LUNATIC WHO'S NUTS

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,958
FOR DONUTS AND GORGES THEM
LIKE A STARVED HOG IN HEAT?

134
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,083
YOU HONESTLY THINK IT'S HIM?!
- SHE'S REALLY VERY NICE.

135
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,625
SHE BOUGHT THE DONUTS.

136
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,250
- Vash: SHE'S REALLY
VERY NICE AND LOUD.

137
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,500
- I AM TELLING YOU
FOR THE LAST TIME,

138
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,541
YOU ARE BEING DECEIVED
BY THAT MAN!

139
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,500
- ON THE CONTRARY.
I'M DOING THE DECEIVING.

140
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,666
- HUH?

141
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,083
- I THINK YOU GOT A GOOD
LOOK AT THE CITY.

142
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,875
WITH THAT KIND OF
MESS OUT THERE,

143
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,375
ALL IT TOOK WAS A
SIMPLE LITTLE RUMOR

144
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,416
THAT VASH THE STAMPEDE WAS
WORKING FOR ME AS A BODYGUARD.

145
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,083
THE TOWNFOLK PANICKED
AND HEADED FOR THE HILLS

146
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,125
AND I'M EXPECTING
MY ENEMY TO DO THE SAME.

147
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,416
- HELLO, THIS AD OF YOURS
CAUGHT MY EYE!

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,916
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS!

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,875
AS OF TODAY, YOU ARE NOW
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

150
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,250
- HUH?

151
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,083
- VASH THE STAMPEDE, IT'S A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

152
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,583
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY.
HE JUST SHOWED UP.

153
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,291
- I SEE.
HE'S A HUGE INCONVENIENCE,

154
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,916
BUT USING HIM IN YOUR PLAN
THIS WAY MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,166
- ACTUALLY THIS WHOLE THING'S
GONE A LOT FARTHER

156
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,625
THAN I EXPECTED.

157
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,791
THE SCOUNDREL WHO'S BEEN
AFTER ME IS A TALL, BLOND MAN,

158
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,125
PACKING A SILVER WEAPON AND A
REPUTATION AS AN ACE GUNFIGHTER.

159
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,166
- HUH?
DID YOU HEAR THAT, MILLY?

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,208
- YES, I DID, EVERY WORD!

161
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,666
- THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE GODSEND.

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,958
- WHAT HUMOROUS
PEOPLE THEY ARE.

163
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,625
- YEAH, IT'S USUALLY BEST
JUST TO LEAVE AIRHEADS ALONE.

164
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,583
- HEY, YOU KNOW, MR. CLIFF,

165
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,125
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

166
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,875
MY PARTNER MILLY AND I WOULD
LIKE TO BE YOUR BODYGUARDS TOO!

167
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,041
FOR EXTRA PROTECTION.

168
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,750
ONLY, NATURALLY, WE
WON'T DEMAND A FEE

169
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,166
LIKE THAT GREEDY
FAKER OVER THERE,

170
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,916
SO THERE'D BE NO RISK
TO YOU WHATSOEVER.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,541
- ( Cliff laughs )
THAT'D BE FINE WITH ME.

172
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,083
- Meryl: THANK YOU, SIR!
YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

173
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,875
THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED
TO DO AS A BODYGUARD.

174
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,083
- EVERY JOURNEY BEGINS
WITH A SINGLE STEP.

175
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,458
WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE
PATIENCE.

176
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
- IS IT READY YET?

177
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,166
- WE'LL TAKE IT OUT
WHEN IT IS.

178
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,916
- WOW, SCARY.
LATER.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,375
- I'D LIKE TO SHOW
THAT GUY SOMETHING SCARY.

180
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,416
NOTHING HAS GONE RIGHT
SINCE WE MET HIM.

181
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,125
- Milly: I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE AT ALL.

182
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,208
( slurping ) I'M HAVING
A WONDERFUL TIME!

183
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,708
PLUS WE GET TO HAVE
ALL THE WATER WE CAN DRINK.

184
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,125
- ( groans )

185
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,666
- BOY, HAS SHE GOT
A SHORT FUSE.

186
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,666
- ( shower running )

187
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,916
- I CAN HEAR THE SOUND
OF RUNNING WATER.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,125
AND I BELIEVE IT'S COMING FROM
THE SHOWER IN MARIANNE'S ROOM.

189
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,666
LIFELINE SECURE!

190
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,416
WIND FAVORABLE!

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,083
THE PLAN IS PERFECT.

192
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,916
I'VE GOT THE GUTS.

193
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,458
( whimpers )

194
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,083
I'M COMING, MARIANNE!

195
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,291
( screaming )

196
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,625
HUH?

197
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,625
- ( knocks )
- MISS MARIANNE,

198
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,083
SUPPER IS READ--
WHA--?

199
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,708
WHERE ARE YOU?

200
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,666
OH.

201
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,458
- HELLO!

202
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,958
- HELLO.
- ( sighs )

203
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,750
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING

204
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,083
HANGING OUTSIDE
THE WINDOW?

205
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,416
- I'M-- UH, WELL,

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,250
DILIGENTLY PATROLLING THE
ROOF AREA FOR SPOOKS.

207
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,875
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
- OH WOW.

208
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,333
THAT SOUNDS SCARY! YOU
BODYGUARDS SURE ARE BUSY PEOPLE!

209
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,333
OH YEAH! I ALMOST FORGOT TO
TELL YOU. SUPPER'S READY!

210
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,291
- ( laughs )
THANKS A LOT.

211
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,125
- MMM.

212
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,541
( thinking )
THIS IS MR. CLIFF'S STUDY.

213
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,041
MARIANNE?

214
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,291
- AHH, THIS PLACE
SURE IS FANCY!

215
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,250
IS WATER REALLY
THAT PROFITABLE, MR. CLIFF?

216
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,250
- THERE'S BEEN A DROUGHT
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS.

217
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,750
I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY

218
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,625
A FEW LUXURIES
BECAUSE MY FATHER,

219
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,750
WHO WAS A PLANT ENGINEER,

220
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,458
PURCHASED LAND
WITH A WATER SUPPLY.

221
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,291
IT'S A RARE COMMODITY
AROUND HERE.

222
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,083
- I'D IMAGINE THAT WOULD
TEND TO MAKE A LOT

223
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,500
OF PEOPLE JEALOUS.

224
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,833
- YEP, I'M AFRAID A LOT
OF FOLKS WANT MY WATER RIGHTS.

225
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,625
APPARENTLY THEY THINK
I'M MONOPOLIZING

226
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,875
IT FOR SELFISH REASONS

227
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,583
AND DON'T WANT TO SHARE
THE WEALTH WITH THEM.

228
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,916
BUT THE WATER SUPPLY
IS NOT LIMITLESS.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,625
UNLESS IT IS MANAGED PROPERLY
BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW,

230
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
IT WILL COMPLETELY DRY UP.

231
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,083
- BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE
FACT THAT YOU'RE PROFITING

232
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,500
FROM A NATURAL RESOURCE.

233
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,375
I'M SORRY, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

234
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,958
- NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, MY DEAR.

235
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,916
BUT I CAN'T LET THE WATER BE
STOLEN BY RECKLESS PEOPLE

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,958
WHO DON'T CARE
IF IT DRIES UP.

237
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,875
THEY MAY CALL ME A COWARD,

238
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,208
BUT I INTEND TO DO WHAT IT
TAKES TO PROTECT THE WATER.

239
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,416
- THAT'S MOST ADMIRABLE,
MR. CLIFF.

240
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,958
- ( chair crashes )
- OH!

241
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,416
- PLEASE EXCUSE ME, MR. CLIFF.
I'M NOT FEELING VERY WELL.

242
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,291
I THINK I AM GOING
TO GO TO BED EARLY.

243
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,708
- UHHHH...
- SHE MAY LOOK CALM,

244
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,375
BUT SHE'S PROBABLY FEELING
QUITE ILL-AT-EASE.

245
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,083
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT SUCH
A GOOD IDEA TO INVITE HER HERE.

246
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,583
- I SUPPOSE.
WELL, I THINK

247
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,000
I'LL MAKE THE ROUNDS AND MAKE
SURE THIS PLACE IS SECURE.

248
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
I SHOULD AT LEAST PRETEND
TO LOOK LIKE A REAL BODYGUARD.

249
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,000
- AS AN EXTRA SAFETY MEASURE,
I'VE ASKED MARIANNE

250
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,375
TO KEEP HER CURTAIN DRAWN.
- YOU-- AH--!

251
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,833
BUT I WOULD NEVER DREAM
OF DOING ANYTHING LIKE--

252
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,333
( grunts )

253
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,833
I MEAN, GOOD THINKING!
VERY SENSIBLE IDEA, MR. CLIFF.

254
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,625
( cackling )

255
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,875
LATER.

256
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,625
- HMMM.

257
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,833
- I'M REALLY EXHAUSTED, MERYL,

258
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,583
FROM ALL THE COOKING
WE HAD TO DO TODAY.

259
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,583
- THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

260
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,333
THERE'S NO TELLING WHEN
THE CULPRIT WILL SHOW UP.

261
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,125
WE HAVE TO BE ALERT
IN OUR DUTIES.

262
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,541
THERE WILL BE NO SLEEPING
FOR US TONIGHT.

263
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,375
- IF HE DOESN'T SHOW UP, THIS
WILL REALLY BE A WASTED EFFORT.

264
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,333
- Vash: MAY I COME IN?
- ( Marianne gasps )

265
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,166
ONE MOMENT PLEASE.

266
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,416
COME IN!

267
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
- EXCUSE ME.
- ( gasps )

268
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,833
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
- UH, NO!

269
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,416
- Vash: WERE YOU LOOKING
AT THE STARS?

270
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,083
- ( chuckles )
YES.

271
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,541
I WAS THINKING OF MY HOME
AND MY FAMILY,

272
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,875
EVEN THOUGH MOST OF MY MEMORIES
THERE ARE UNPLEASANT ONES.

273
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,250
- THOUGHTS OF HOME,

274
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,666
WHETHER GOOD OR BAD,

275
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,166
ARE POSITIVE INDICATORS OF
A JOURNEY OF THE HEART.

276
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,166
- ( chuckles )
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM

277
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,875
TO TRAVEL BY MYSELF
TO ANYPLACE I WANT.

278
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,708
BUT I COULD NEVER PERSUADE
MY FATHER TO LET ME DO IT.

279
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,708
SO I'VE ONLY BEEN
ALLOWED TO STAY

280
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,041
AT THE HOMES OF HIS
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

281
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,291
THIS IS HARDLY WHAT I'D CALL

282
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,166
A JOURNEY OF THE
HEART, YOU KNOW?

283
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,958
UH...

284
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,041
( groans )

285
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,625
- SOMEDAY YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO TAKE A JOURNEY

286
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,083
TO ANYWHERE YOU DESIRE.

287
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,333
ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT
EXACTLY BE BY YOURSELF.

288
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,333
- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.

289
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,750
- HMMM.
- HMMM.

290
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,916
OH, I THINK I JUST
SAW SOMETHING MOVE!

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,875
- ( gasps, sighs )
- THERE IT IS AGAIN!

292
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,166
- WAIT HERE.
I'LL GO HAVE A LOOK.

293
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,750
- ARE YOU SURE?
- IT'S MY JOB, MA'AM.

294
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:34,208
- DAMN IT!
- THAT HURT, YOU STUPID IDIOT!

295
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,791
- ( screaming )
- Vash: STAY STILL!

296
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,916
- HE'S HERE!
IT'S VASH THE STAMPEDE!!

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
LET GO OF ME.
I'LL SUE YOU!

298
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

299
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING-- HUH?

300
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,666
HEY, WHY THE HELL DID YOU
JUST ATTACK ME, YOU MANIAC?

301
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,375
- OH GEE, IT'S ONLY YOU.

302
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S ONLY ME?! HOW RUDE!

303
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,708
- MARIANNE AND I WERE HAVING
A HEATED DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR

304
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,208
FUTURE WHEN WE WERE INTERRUPTED
BY THE SOUND OF AN INTRUDER.

305
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,333
I JUST CAME OUT TO INVESTIGATE.
- SO WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

306
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,333
NOW THAT YOU'VE
APPREHENDED THE INTRUDER,

307
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE
A NICE CLEAN CONSCIENCE?

308
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,208
- WELL, NOT WHEN
IT COMES TO MARIANNE.

309
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,916
- GEE, MERYL, I HAD NO
IDEA THE TWO OF YOU

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,166
WERE ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS.

311
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,333
- HAVE YOU BEEN
PAYING ANY ATTENTION AT ALL?!

312
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,291
- HEY, MISS MARIANNE,

313
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
YOUR LITTLE HEAD!

314
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,791
I HAVE CAPTURED THE CULPRIT

315
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,500
SO ALL IS SAFE AND
WELL FOR YOU AGAIN!

316
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,291
- JUST WHO ARE YOU CALLING
A CULPRIT?

317
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,291
- OH?

318
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,583
- Meryl: ANYTHING?
- Vash: NO.

319
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,416
- Meryl: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

320
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,958
BOTH MISS MARIANNE AND MR.
CLIFF HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED,

321
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,916
APPARENTLY WITHOUT A TRACE.

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,958
- DO YOU THINK THAT
THEY WERE KIDNAPPED?!

323
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,875
- WE WERE OUTSIDE
THE ENTIRE TIME.

324
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,458
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
IMPOSSIBLE.

325
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,625
- AW, I'M SO WORRIED
ABOUT THEM!

326
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,791
- Milly: MERYL!
- Both: HMMM?

327
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,375
- THEY'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!
- WHAT IS THAT?

328
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,083
- MISS MARIANNE'S DRESS
AND SOME BLOODY BANDAGES.

329
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,208
- THERE WAS A MAN THAT TRIED
TO BREAK-IN FIVE DAYS AGO,

330
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,916
THEN WE FIND A DISCARDED DRESS
AND SOME BLOODY BANDAGES,

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,250
AND FINALLY MISS MARIANNE
WAS SEEN SNEAKING AROUND

332
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,750
AND ENTERING MR. CLIFF'S STUDY.

333
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,500
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH
EVIDENCE HERE

334
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,708
TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT
MARIANNE HAS BEEN AFTER HIM.

335
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,375
- Vash: YOU'RE WRONG!
- HUH?

336
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,666
- IT CAN'T BE! MARIANNE JUST
ISN'T THAT KIND OF GIRL!

337
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,375
- Meryl: HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
- AHEM.

338
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,458
- FROM THE MOMENT I SAW HER,
FROM THE LOOK IN HER EYES,

339
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,458
MISS MARIANNE HAS
A BEAUTIFUL HEART.

340
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,833
- YOU'RE THE EASILY
DECEIVED TYPE

341
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,916
WHO CRIES HIMSELF TO SLEEP
EVERY NIGHT, AREN'T YOU?

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,750
- PFFT! THANKS A LOT,
DREAM WRECKER.

343
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,333
- I KNOW! A GHOST MUST
HAVE GOTTEN MISS MARIANNE.

344
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,875
- Both: HUH?!
- YOU SAID YOURSELF

345
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,416
THERE WERE SPOOKS ON THE ROOF
WHEN I SAW YOU BY THE WINDOW.

346
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,041
- UH, THAT WAS... I MEAN...

347
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,333
WHAT I MEANT WAS, YOU KNOW,
SPOOKS, THEY'RE-- OOF.

348
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,291
- HUH?
- UH, SPOOKS, YOU KNOW...

349
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,208
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT THE ROOF?
- THEY'RE AROUND EVERYWHERE...

350
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,458
- HE WAS HANGING
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

351
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,250
BY MISS MARIANNE'S BATHROOM--

352
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,208
- AHA!
- YES?

353
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,958
- JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU WERE YOU DOING,

354
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,416
PEEKING INTO A LADY'S ROOM?!

355
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,666
YOU DISGUSTING SICKO!
- WAIT, TIME OUT, TIME OUT!

356
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,416
- YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE SLICK,
MR. HOT PANTS,

357
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,916
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT THIS TIME!

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,083
- WHOA, WAIT, TIME OUT,
TIME OUT!

359
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,291
- All: UHH.

360
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,208
- I KNEW HE WASN'T
TELLING THE WHOLE TRUTH.

361
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,250
- Cliff: WHAT A NAUGHTY
LITTLE PRINCESS!

362
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,250
- ( gasps )

363
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
- EVEN PRANKS HAVE
A LIMIT. EH?

364
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,375
HA! SO NOW THEY'VE STARTED USING
KIDS TO DO THEIR DIRTY WORK.

365
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,416
- THANKS TO YOUR
SELFISH MONOPOLIZATION

366
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,791
OF THE WATER SUPPLY,

367
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,500
ALL OF THE LAND IN THIS AREA
HAS DRIED UP AND DIED.

368
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,583
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY PEOPLE

369
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,416
HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE
OF YOUR GREED?

370
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,625
- SO LITTLE MISS MARIANNE
COMES TO GET THE EVIDENCE?

371
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,125
JUSTICE DOESN'T COME
THAT CHEAP.

372
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,875
- ( whimpering )

373
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,708
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I ALMOST FORGOT--

374
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,916
I SHOT YOU.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,541
- ( grunts )

376
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,166
- THE PEOPLE HAVE ALL
EVACUATED,

377
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,333
SO THERE WILL BE
NO WITNESSES.

378
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,125
SPREADING THE RUMOR
OF VASH THE STAMPEDE

379
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,208
DID MY BUSINESS A WORLD OF GOOD.
- ( moaning )

380
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,958
- I HAVE FAR TOO MUCH
INVESTED IN THIS PLACE

381
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,750
TO ALLOW THE LIKES OF YOU TO
COME IN AND RUIN THINGS FOR ME.

382
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,041
GAME OVER, MARIANNE.
- ( Vash yelling )

383
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,625
LOOK OUT BELOW!
( gurgling )

384
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,750
( laughs )
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

385
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,250
- IDIOT.

386
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,583
- Meryl: IS THAT WHAT HE
MEANT WHEN HE SAID

387
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,250
HE WAS GONNA SNEAK UP
BEHIND HIM?

388
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,875
- THIS MESS HAS GONE
FROM SPILL TO OVERFLOW.

389
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,375
- GREAT. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS

390
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,166
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING WE CAN DO NOW.

391
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,916
- OH. WELL, THIS EXPLAINS
YOUR LITTLE LUXURIES.

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,750
- HA!
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME HERE!

393
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,000
- RUN, GET OUT OF HERE QUICK!
HURRY!

394
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,625
- AHHHH.

395
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,750
THANK GOODNESS!

396
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,708
I KNEW IT. YOU ARE THE GIRL
I THOUGHT YOU WERE!

397
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,583
- WELL, VERY BRAVE.

398
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,916
- ( casing bounces )
- ( gasps )

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,166
- HUH?

400
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,250
- ( snorts )
SCARY!

401
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,791
- DAMN.

402
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,750
- AH, YIP, EEEE, OOOH!

403
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,458
YIKES!
OOOH OHHH.

404
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,958
- HE READS THE TRAJECTORIES
OF THE BULLETS

405
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,000
BY WATCHING THE GUN
MOVEMENTS AND TIMING.

406
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,458
INSANE.
( gasps )

407
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,208
- JUST NO SKILL.
- YEOW!

408
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,791
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ANYWAY?

409
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,583
- I'M YOUR BODYGUARD AND ACE
GUNMAN JUST AS ADVERTISED.

410
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,083
- ( laughs )
NOT BAD.

411
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,125
I GUESS I WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL
WHEN I CHOSE TO HIRE YOU.

412
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,833
DON'T YOU AGREE?
- ( guns cock )

413
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,083
- HUH?

414
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,541
- ( yelps )

415
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,208
- ( guns click )
- WHAT, HUH?

416
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,666
HOW DARE YOU?

417
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,750
- AS REQUESTED, I HAVE
PROTECTED YOUR GUEST, MR. CLIFF.

418
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,375
- BUT LOOK, THERE!
- HUH?

419
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,375
( shrieks )
- GUESS WHAT, MERYL?

420
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,666
HE DID IT.

421
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,000
- SHUT UP, THIS IS NO TIME
FOR CONGRATULATIONS.

422
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,166
- ( beasts squawk )

423
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,625
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. THE DAMMED
WATER JUST OVERFLOWED

424
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,750
ALL AT ONCE, THAT'S ALL.

425
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,208
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

426
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,083
IT WILL RETURN
UNDERGROUND EVENTUALLY

427
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,916
AND MAKE THE TOWN
PROSPER AGAIN.

428
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,333
AND I'M SURE
EVERYONE WHO LEFT

429
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,250
WILL BE ABLE TO
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES.

430
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,416
I'M VERY GRATEFUL.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

431
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,166
- COME ON, ALL IT WAS WAS A
SERIES OF LUCKY ACCIDENTS.

432
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,500
THAT'S ALL.

433
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,041
- DID YOU DODGE ALL THOSE
BULLETS JUST BY ACCIDENT

434
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,916
OR DID YOU DO IT ON PURPOSE?

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
- I SUPPOSE IT WAS MORE
LIKE A FLUKE ACTUALLY.

436
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,583
- BECAUSE IF YOU DID
THAT CONSCIOUSLY,

437
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,458
I'M AFRAID I'D REALLY
HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT...

438
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,000
YOU ARE IN FACT THE LEGENDARY
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

439
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,750
- UH...

440
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,500
- AND WHAT IF I WAS
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

441
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,000
- THEN I'D ARREST YOU.
- HA!

442
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,083
- I HAVE THE BOTH OF YOU
TO THANK AS WELL.

443
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,500
- YOU MUST BE GLAD IT'S OVER.
YOUR JOB IS COMPLETED.

444
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,333
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE JUST
GONE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

445
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,250
- OH, MERYL, DON'T LET IT
GET TO YOU.

446
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,416
- ( gasps )
ARE YOU LEAVING?

447
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,375
- MY JOB'S DONE HERE.

448
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,083
- THERE GOES THE BODYGUARD
WITH NO NAME.

449
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,458
I COULD REALLY FALL
FOR THAT GUY.

450
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,250
HE'S A REAL MAN.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

451
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,791
THAT GUY IS COMPLETELY
IRRESPONSIBLE!

452
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,875
- I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE
NO EYE FOR MEN.

453
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,208
- SAYS WHO?!

454
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,458
- MAYBE SOMEDAY I'LL
SHOW YOU, THEN YOU'LL SEE.

455
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,958
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE
TO SEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

456
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,416
- NOW, MERYL, DON'T LET IT
GET TO YOU.

457
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,833
- ( groans )

458
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,333
I WAS SO SURE IT WOULD
WORK OUT THIS TIME.

459
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,750
SHE WAS SUCH A CUTIE.

460
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,083
BUT I GUESS THERE'S NO WAY
IT COULD HAVE WORKED.

461
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,750
I DON'T WANNA GET ARRESTED.

462
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,791
THIS ONE WILL PROBABLY
BE BLAMED ON ME TOO.

463
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,625
AW, MAN!

464
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
( heavy sigh )

465
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,500
- ( theme music playing )

466
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,791
( singing in Japanese )

467
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,666
- Vash:
THOSE WHO MAKE MISTAKES

468
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,708
BLAME THEMSELVES
AND CLOSE THEIR HEARTS.

469
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,125
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIX THE MISTAKE.

470
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,791
MEN CAN'T RETURN TO THE PAST.

471
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,916
THAT'S WHY THEY DRINK.

472
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,416
LUSHES, DRUNKS, SLIDING ALCOHOL
DOWN THEIR THROATS

473
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,416
TO DILUTE THE MEMORIES
THAT CAN'T BE FORGOTTEN.

474
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,333
FRANK MARLON, THE GUNSMITH,
DOES NOTHING BUT DRINK

475
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,791
AND HE QUESTIONS THE GLASS
AFTER IT'S EMPTY.

476
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,583
AM I WRONG?

477
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,875
WAS I WRONG?
