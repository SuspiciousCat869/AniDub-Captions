1
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,958
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,750
- ( violin plays )
- ( laughing )

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,750
- HEY, BOSS.
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING

4
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,791
TO KEEP ME HELD UP 
IN THIS PLACE, HUH?

5
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,541
HE GOT TWO
OF OUR IDIOTS ALREADY

6
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,750
WHILE WE SAT AROUND
TWIDDLING OUR THUMBS.

7
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,500
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LET ME HANDLE IT.

8
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,916
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE DONE.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,625
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
I'LL LET YOU GO NEXT.

10
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,250
I'LL EVEN SET
THE STAGE FOR YOU.

11
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,791
I EXPECT YOU TO ENTERTAIN HIM

12
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,708
WITH A UNIQUE PERFORMANCE
OF TRICKS.

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,250
- ( laughs ) YOU CAN
BE REASONED WITH.

14
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,458
LET'S HOPE THE REWARD
IS REASONABLE.

15
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,458
- SO ARE YOU GONNA MAKE HIM
GO AT IT ALONE THIS TIME?

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,791
- ( chuckles )
HARDLY.

17
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,833
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER
THAT AN AUDIENCE

18
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,708
ALWAYS GETS MORE PLEASURE
FROM A DRAMA WITH A TWIST.

19
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,416
IT'S A SIMPLE FORMULA.

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,750
THE GREATER THE TRAGEDY,

21
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,750
THE GREATER
THE EMOTIONAL EFFECT.

22
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,125
- ( smirks )
- ( clinks )

23
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,250
- ( chatter )

24
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,916
- I'M WORRIED, MERYL.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
IT'S BEEN
TWO WHOLE WEEKS NOW.

26
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,416
- Vash: I'M SORRY. THIS IS AS
FAR AS WE CAN TRAVEL TOGETHER.

27
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,583
- Meryl: WHY?
- IT'S YOUR JOB OR YOUR LIFE!

28
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,458
WHICH IS MORE
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

29
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,625
- ( sighs )
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW.

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,375
IF I DID,
YOU'D BE PUT IN DANGER.

31
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:16,250
SO IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN, BUT,
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL.

32
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,291
- ( people chatter )

33
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,958
- POOR MR. VASH.
I WONDER HOW HE'S DOING.

34
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,416
- YOU KNOW HIM.
HE'S UNDOUBTEDLY GOOFING AROUND

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,375
IN SOME TOWN SOMEWHERE. I'M SURE
HE'S JUST FINE AND DANDY.

36
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,708
- Boy: WAIT FOR ME!

37
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,791
- Man #1: HEY, DID YOU HEAR?
- ( gasps )

38
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,333
- REMEMBER THE GUY
IN THE WHITE SUIT 

39
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,208
WHO HAD CAUSED THE SALOON RIOT
THE OTHER DAY?

40
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,583
WELL, HE APPARENTLY TURNED OUT
TO BE ONE OF VASH'S GANG.

41
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,583
- OH, YEAH, THAT
WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT.

42
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,125
INCLUDING WHY HIS METHODS
WERE SO DANG VICIOUS.

43
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,166
- Man #3: ( laughs )
BUT HE TOOK OFF.

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,750
- Man #1: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,708
I GUESS, AT THIS POINT,
WE SHOULD COUNT OUR BLESSINGS

46
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
THAT WE GOT OFF SO EASY.
- Man #3: YEAH.

47
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,208
HE'S A DEVIL
IN A RED COAT.

48
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,416
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,250
- Man #2: DAMN, I WISH
HE'D JUST DROP DEAD.

50
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,583
- HOW CAN YOU
STAND THERE AND SAY

51
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,666
SUCH AWFUL THINGS ABOUT HIM?
- Men: HUH?

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,583
- I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

53
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,875
WHAT KIND
OF PERSON HE IS.

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,375
I THINK YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

55
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,916
- HUH?

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,708
- GEE, MERYL.
- ( gasps )

57
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,625
( embarrassed laughter )

58
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,208
- WALK YOUR OWN PATH
WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH.

59
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,625
I JUST HAVE
TO KEEP SAYING IT.

60
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,333
RIGHT.  MILLY.
- YES.

61
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,500
- WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING.
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD.

62
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,791
LET'S STOP WASTING TIME.
- OKAY.

63
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,083
- IF NECESSARY, WE'LL FOLLOW HIM
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH.

64
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,583
IT'S NOT ONLY OUR JOB NOW,

65
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,625
IT'S BECOME OUR MISSION
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

66
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,875
- ( motor whirs )

67
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,958
- ( humming )

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,125
HELLO, CHAIR.
HOW YOU BEEN?

69
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,416
- ( gun cocks )
- OH, WHAA!

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,791
( whimpers )
- LEGATO, I AM THE ONE

71
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,583
THAT IS HUNTING YOU
THIS TIME.

72
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,083
I WILL FIND YOU
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

73
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,708
YEAH, RIGHT!
- ( relieved sigh )

74
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,208
- IT SOUNDS REAL COOL
IN MY HEAD,

75
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
BUT IN REALITY,
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE

76
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,250
AS TO HOW I'M GOING TO FIND HIM.
- ( men grumble )

77
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,250
- OH, MAN, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
- ( driver hums )

78
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,958
- ( sighs )

79
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
NOT ONLY THAT,
THE MORE TIME I HAVE

80
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,750
TO THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE FRIGHTENING IT BECOMES.

81
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,583
AND NOW MY KNEES ARE STARTING
TO KNOCK TOGETHER.

82
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,625
- ( humming continues )

83
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,250
- OH, MAN! I ACTUALLY
HAVE TO FIGHT THIS GUY!

84
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,125
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY
WIN SUCH A BATTLE 

85
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,833
OR EVEN HAVE A CHANCE
TO SURVIVE A FIGHT

86
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,875
WITH A GUY WHO SMILES 
WITH THOSE EVIL EYES?!

87
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,541
THE ANSWER IS I CAN'T.

88
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,000
I'M GONNA BE SLAUGHTERED,
THAT'S ALL.

89
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,250
IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

90
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,791
- HMM? HMM? HMM?
- I SHOULD JUST BACK OUT!

91
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,041
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO,
ALL RIGHT.

92
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,750
YEAH, YEAH, FOR ONCE,
I'M RIGHT.  YEAH.

93
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.

94
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,416
YOU CHANGE YOUR TUNE
FASTER THAN RADIO STATIONS.

95
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,708
- YEAH, LIFE OUGHT TO BE FUN,
AFTER ALL, RIGHT?

96
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,083
( chews noisily )

97
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,083
HEY, THAT'S SUPER TASTY, MISTER.

98
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,083
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER SALMON
SANDWICH, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

99
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,208
HMM?

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,375
- UH, UH.

101
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,166
AUGUSTA.
- ( gasps )

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,000
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT AUGUSTA, VASH THE STAMPEDE.

103
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,208
YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
MY REQUEST IMMEDIATELY.

104
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,416
IF YOU DO NOT
MEET MY REQUEST,

105
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,208
THIS IS A SAMPLE
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

106
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,208
- DON'T!
- ( gunshot )

107
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,208
- Men: ( shouting )

108
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,958
- WHY? WHO DID THIS?

109
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,208
THERE'S NO BLOOD.

110
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,291
- HUH? WHAT? DO YOU
ACTUALLY KNOW HIM?

111
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,791
THIS GUY, YOU KNOW HIM?!

112
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,916
( resumes humming )
- IT MUST BE HIM.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,666
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
CAPABLE OF DOING THIS.

114
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,916
LEGATO.
- YOU CALLED HIM?

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,708
HE'S YOUR FRIEND?
HEY, IS HE YOUR FRIEND?

116
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,875
- ( thinking )
DO YOU WANT ME THERE SO BAD

117
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,708
YOU WOULD KILL THE INNOCENT
TO GET ME?!

118
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,291
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO THERE, LEGATO.

119
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,666
I'LL FACE YOU
ON YOUR HOME GROUND.

120
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,583
- HEY, WHO ARE YOU?
- HUH?

121
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,041
- Vash:  ME?
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

122
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,958
- ( messenger panting )

123
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,875
- Bartender:
HEY, EASY THERE, PAL.

124
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,583
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

125
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,041
- LISTEN, IT'S--
IT'S VASH THE STAMPEDE.

126
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,583
HE'S HERE, I'M TELLING YOU.
- ( men mutter )

127
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,916
- ( worried chatter )

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,666
- OH MY GOSH,
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

129
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,833
- YEAH, HE'S RUNNING RAMPANT
THROUGH AUGUSTA,

130
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,375
BLASTING AWAY WITH THAT
BIG SILVER GUN OF HIS.

131
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,375
- IT'S TRUE.
THAT CRAZY BASTARD'S

132
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,458
GONNA DO TO AUGUSTA 
WHAT HE DID TO JULY.

133
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,916
- WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
WE FOUND HIM.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,375
- HMM.  WHAT IN THE HELL
COULD THAT MAN

135
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,958
POSSIBLY BE THINKING?

136
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,458
- ( gunshots )

137
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,875
- MY NAME IS...

138
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:38,958
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

139
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,958
- VASH?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

140
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,916
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
FORGIVE THE LACK OF WARNING,

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,458
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S TIME
FOR MY DAILY MASSACRE.

142
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,291
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
I'M THE REAL THING,

143
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,791
TAKE A LONG LOOK AT ME 
AND START FREAKING OUT.

144
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,583
OBSERVE MY RED COAT,
MY LOVELY BLONDE LOCKS.

145
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,416
AND IF YOU'RE
STILL HAVING DOUBTS,

146
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,875
CHECK OUT MY 100%
ACCURATE GUNMANSHIP.

147
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,750
- ( gunshot )
- OH, HE'S GOING TO KILL US!

148
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,083
- ( meows )

149
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,958
- ( gunfire )
- ( panicked chatter )

150
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,541
- IF YOU PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO DIE TODAY,

151
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,458
GET AT LEAST 100 ILES
AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 

152
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,666
AS FAST AS YOU CAN

153
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,541
AND LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER!

154
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,041
FINALLY, THAT'S
THE LAST OF THEM.

155
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,875
WHY COULDN'T THAT
NIHILISTIC JERK

156
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,750
HAVE PICKED
A BETTER LOCATION?

157
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,458
I USED UP ALL MY ENERGY 
JUST CHASING PEOPLE OUT.

158
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,125
I'M POOPED.

159
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,708
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

160
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,916
IT REMINDS ME
OF THE LAST TIME.

161
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,125
( gasps )

162
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,250
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.

163
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,916
I'M NOT SURE-- HUH?
- ( dripping )

164
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,875
- BLOOD! 
( gasps )

165
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,125
- DO YOU LIKE
MY DECORATIONS?

166
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,916
IN THIS GAME, LOSERS 
DON'T GET TO GO HOME.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,166
THEY GO TO HELL.

168
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,833
- DID YOU KILL THEM?

169
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,041
- I AM THE FIFTH GUNG-HO-GUN.

170
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,250
MY NAME IS E.G. MINE.

171
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,041
- DID YOU KILL THEM
OR NOT?!

172
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,291
- DAMN, YOU ARE A NOISY ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

173
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,250
WHAT IF I DID,
CHICKEN SHIT? 

174
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,250
YOU DON'T SEEM TO
WANT TO KILL ANYONE.

175
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,208
SO SOMEONE HAD TO STEP UP
AND COVER YOUR ASS.

176
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,000
AND BESIDES, BLONDIE,

177
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,291
YOU HAVE FALLEN
INTO MY COURT.

178
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,750
- GEE, AREN'T YOU
THE POETIC ONE?

179
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,333
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT 
I ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES?

180
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,250
TO DIE OR TO LET DIE?!

181
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,500
- WHOA, COWBOY, DON'T BE
SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.

182
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,750
ONLY ONE MORE HAS TO DIE.

183
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,333
JUST STAND THERE
LIKE A GOOD BOY.

184
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,791
AS SOON AS I TAKE YOU DOWN,
IT'LL ALL BE OVER!

185
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,416
- ( gun cocks )
- WHAT?!

186
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,958
HUH?
- ( grunts )

187
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,208
- WH-- WHAT'S GOING ON?

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,458
THAT BASTARD IS TRYING TO
CUT IN ON MY ACTION.

189
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,583
- HAD I NOT CHOSEN TO DISPATCH
MY SABER AT THIS TIME,

190
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,291
THIS SITUATION MAY HAVE
ESCALATED INTO A REAL PROBLEM.

191
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,416
YOU WOULD HAVE AT LEAST
BEEN KNOCKED SENSELESS 

192
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,708
BY YOUR HUMANOID TYPHOON,
THERE.

193
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,958
- SAY WHAT?

194
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,333
- WELL, NOW IT'S
GETTING INTERESTING.

195
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,833
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
THE FAVORITE.

196
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,833
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

197
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,916
- FORGIVE MY LACK
OF MANNERS.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,416
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

199
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,791
I AM THE NINTH
GUNG-HO-GUN OF JIGENZAN.

200
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,916
TRAINED BY THE MASTERS
OF THE ITTOU SCHOOL,

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
I AM RAI-DEI
THE BLADE.

202
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,083
I HOLD NO PERSONAL GRUDGE
AGAINST YOU,

203
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,250
BUT I WISH TO ENGAGE YOU
IN SHI-AI.

204
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,458
- SHI-AI?

205
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,500
I CAN'T READ THAT.

206
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,958
- ( wind whistles )
- HMPH.

207
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,000
IF YOU CANNOT READ JAPANESE,

208
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,083
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU
AN ABBREVIATED EXPLANATION.

209
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,458
IT'S A FIGHT 
TO THE DEATH.

210
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,125
- WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

211
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,583
YOU PLAYING ALONG WITH
LEGATO'S LITTLE FARCE AS WELL?

212
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,833
- I WOULD HAPPILY WALK
THE PATH OF CARNAGE

213
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,916
1,000 TIMES
AND 1,000 AGAIN

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,416
FOR THE MASTERY OF BUSHIDO.
- WHAT?

215
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,583
- BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING
ONLY VISIBLE

216
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,750
WHEN YOU STAND BEFORE
THE DEATH OF THE ABYSS.

217
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,291
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
SEEN THIS TOO, HAVE YOU NOT?

218
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,458
- I HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYTHING THERE AT ALL,

219
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,291
EXCEPT MY OWN FEAR.

220
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,500
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
I THINK YOU SHOULD EXPERIENCE...

221
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,791
( grunts )
THAT MENTAL STATE.

222
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,791
- ( metal clinks )

223
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,166
- COME ON, NOW.

224
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,416
IT'S MY JOB TO
SLICE AND DICE THIS GUY.

225
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,250
- RIDICULOUS.
IT WOULD APPEAR

226
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,916
YOU SIMPLY DID NOT HEAR
WHAT I TOLD YOU

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,583
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

228
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DIDN'T.

229
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,333
HUH? WHAT?

230
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,833
- YOUR MATCH WAS QUITE OVER
BEFORE MY ARRIVAL.

231
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,833
THAT FAST GUNMANSHIP,
WORDS FAIL

232
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,083
TO DESCRIBE
ITS GREATNESS.

233
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,500
THAT MAN WAS NEVER AN OPPONENT
TO BE HUMBLED BY YOU.

234
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,166
YOU WERE COMPLETELY
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

235
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,583
YOUR TURN IS OVER.

236
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,583
- NO!

237
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,875
- TAKE HEART IN THE FACT

238
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,250
THAT YOU MAY HAVE SERVED
TO AMUSE HIM

239
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,583
FOR A MOMENT.

240
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,458
- ( grunts )

241
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,083
- YOU SLIME!

242
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,958
- YES, LET IT BURN WITHIN YOU.

243
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,250
I FEEL IT
BUILD AND FESTER.

244
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,750
THE ANGRY AURA RELEASED 
THROUGH YOUR EVERY PORE,

245
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,125
MY KNEES ARE SHAKING.

246
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,125
THAT ALONE MAKES MY TRIP 
TO THIS PLACE WORTHWHILE.

247
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,875
IT IS THE SOURCE
OF MY GREATEST PLEASURE.

248
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,541
- COME ON.
- I'M IN YOUR DEBT.

249
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,041
READY?

250
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,250
- ( metal scratches )

251
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,875
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshots )

252
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,625
- H'YAH!

253
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,458
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
CAUSE ME REAL HARM! 

254
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,625
- YOU NEVER HEARD OF 
WARRIOR'S COMPASSION?

255
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,708
I CAN'T HIT YOU IN ANY WAY
IF IT'D KILL YOU.

256
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,916
- QUITE THE ARROGANCE.
A REAL EYESORE.

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,458
IT BLURS MY PATH
TO SPIRITUAL AWARENESS.

258
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,708
- MY FRIEND, PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE
THEIR WAYS THAT EASILY.

259
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
- HA HA! YOU ACTUALLY
THINK WE'RE PEOPLE?

260
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
ABSURD!
- HUH?

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,291
- YOU AND I ARE MEN,
YET NOT <i>OF</i> MEN.

262
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,416
WE ARE DARK,
DIABOLICAL PUPPETS.

263
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,375
WHAT WE ARE
ARE DEMONS!

264
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,458
( screams )

265
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
- ( metal scratching )
- ( rumbling )

266
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,500
- WOW, WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW,

267
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,416
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT A GOOD THING.

268
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
DO YOU THINK IT'S VASH?

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,208
WE'VE GOT TO HELP HIM.
LET'S GO!

270
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,708
- WAIT, MERYL!
- HUH?

271
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,041
WHAT'S WRONG?
- WE CAN'T THIS TIME.

272
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,500
MR. VASH SAID IT'S TOO BIG
FOR US TO HANDLE.

273
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,166
THIS IS SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS.

274
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,416
- I'M WELL AWARE
OF THE DANGER, MILLY.

275
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,625
- MERYL!

276
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,875
- ( pants )

277
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,541
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
WASTING TIME HERE 

278
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
AND FIGHT ME
LIKE YOU MEAN IT?!

279
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,583
AH! FIGHT ME!

280
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,791
- ( metal scratches )
- ( groans )

281
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,791
NOW, THAT WAS
A HUGE SHOCKWAVE.

282
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,083
WELL, NO BIG DEAL.
NOTHING I CAN'T DODGE.

283
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,875
- H'YAH!

284
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,708
- ( bullets clink )
- CAN'T YOU MAKE

285
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,541
THOSE BULLETS HIT ME, HUH?!

286
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,916
- ( metal scratches )

287
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,583
- HUH?

288
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,333
COME ON, MAMA'S BOY!

289
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,541
- ( gasps )

290
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,000
- COMPASSION IN
THE HEAT OF BATTLE?!

291
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,416
- ( groans )

292
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,166
- THIS IS A GROSS
DISAPPOINTMENT.

293
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,416
- ( coughs )

294
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,416
- AH!
( groans )

295
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

296
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,250
VASH THE STAMPEDE,
IS THIS ALL YOU AMOUNT TO?

297
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,166
- I SEE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

298
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,916
TELL ME! AT LEAST 
GIVE ME AN ANSWER,

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,416
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
RIGHT NOW, AT THIS MOMENT!

300
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,791
TELL ME!
- ( groans )

301
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,791
- Legato: DO YOU INTEND TO DIE,
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

302
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,583
- ( gasps )

303
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,166
- THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO USE IT. 

304
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,500
- ( straining )

305
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,000
- GO AHEAD, USE IT.

306
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,916
- ( strains )
- USE IT.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,083
IT'S SOMETHING
ONLY YOU CAN DO.

308
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,750
USE IT! QUICKLY!

309
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,041
- STOP IT, STOP IT!

310
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,250
STOP IT, STOP IT,
STOP IT!

311
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
STOP!

312
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,291
- COWARD.  I CANNOT BELIEVE
HE'S BEGGING FOR HIS LIFE. 

313
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,916
( gasps )

314
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?

315
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,750
- NO, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

316
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,458
NOT THE LIGHT!

317
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,541
- OH MY GOD.
- MR. VASH MEANT WHAT HE SAID.

318
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,833
JUST LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

319
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,458
- WHERE IS HE?
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.

320
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,125
( gasping )

321
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,083
- MERYL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

322
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,875
- LET GO OF ME! LET GO OF ME
RIGHT NOW, MILLY!

323
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,458
- ( gasping )

324
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,916
- PUT ME DOWN.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,625
MILLY, I WANT TO GO BACK.

326
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,125
WAIT, I HAVE
TO GO BACK THERE.

327
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,958
- ( static )

328
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,125
- WHAT IS THIS
STRANGE PHENOMENON?

329
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,916
IS THIS SOME SORT OF
TWISTED CHRISTIAN SCIENCE?

330
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,083
( gasps )

331
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,291
- ( screams )

332
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,791
( strains )

333
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,916
STOP, STOP IT NOW!

334
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,208
AH! STOP IT!

335
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,000
- WHAT IS THIS
INDESCRIBABLE HORROR

336
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,958
COURSING THROUGH
MY ENTIRE BODY? 

337
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,583
IS THIS IT?

338
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,083
IS THIS THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN SEEKING?

339
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,000
WILL I REALLY REACH 
SPIRITUAL AWARENESS?

340
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,625
NO! THIS THING BEFORE ME--

341
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,125
- RUN! RUN AWAY NOW!

342
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,583
- ( pants )

343
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,375
( screams )

344
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,166
- RUN!

345
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,625
- WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?!

346
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,208
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING!

347
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,750
- STOP IT! STOP IT!
- ( charge builds )

348
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,958
PLEASE, STOP IT!
- ( gunfire )

349
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,291
- ( screaming )
- ( gunfire continues )

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,916
- ( screams echo )

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,416
- WHAT THE--

352
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,958
- ( high-pitched whistle )

353
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,208
- ( silence )

354
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,375
( silence continues )

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,333
- ( rumbling )

356
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,583
- WHAT IS THAT
HORRIFIC LIGHT?

357
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,208
IS HE THE ONE CREATING THAT?
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

358
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,125
- YES, THIS IS
THE SECOND TIME.

359
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,958
THE FIRST WAS A GREAT EXPLOSION
WHICH TOOK JULY 23 YEARS AGO.

360
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,375
( chuckles )

361
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,625
( slurps )

362
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,583
- MILLY, PLEASE LET ME GO.
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

363
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,250
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
BESIDES, IF YOU DIE,

364
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,583
YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
- ( gasps )

365
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,083
- ( both scream )
- ( wind rushes )

366
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,291
- MERYL, LOOK!
- ( gasps )

367
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,875
A HOLE IN THE MOON.

368
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,333
- ( ragged breathing )

369
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
I FELT THE TERROR.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,458
- Wolfwood: ONLY YOU CAN
SURVIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

371
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,916
- ( grunts )

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,041
WHO-- WHO ARE YOU?

373
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,083
- WHAT HAPPENED TO
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

374
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

375
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,666
- DAMN.

376
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,666
- IF WE ACT QUICKLY,

377
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,250
WE MAY BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT THAT MAN,

378
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,916
THAT HORRIBLE
DEVIL OF A MAN.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,250
VASH THE STAMPEDE
IS TOO DANGEROUS 

380
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,541
TO BE LEFT ALIVE.
IF YOU HELP ME,

381
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,083
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER.
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

382
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,625
- ( gun cocks )
- HUH? ARE YOU INSANE?

383
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,666
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

384
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,541
YOU AND I ARE-- WE COULD--

385
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,833
- I'M SORRY.

386
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,208
SURE, NOBODY DIED
FROM THE BLAST,

387
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,000
BUT JUST LOOK AT THIS.
( blows smoke )

388
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,958
ANOTHER TOWN IN RUBBLE.

389
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,208
IS THIS THE PATH
YOU HAVE CHOSEN?

390
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,583
IS THIS IT,
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

391
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,916
- Man #4: HEY, DID YOU
HEAR THE RUMOR?

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
ABOUT HOW THE HUMANOID TYPHOON
SHOWED UP IN AUGUSTA?

393
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,583
- Man #5: I SURE DID.

394
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,500
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
HE MANAGED TO DESTROY

395
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,833
THE ENTIRE CITY
ALL BY HIMSELF.

396
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,416
FIRST JULY AND NOW AUGUSTA.

397
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416
WHAT IN THE HELL
CAN THAT MANIAC BE THINKING?

398
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,583
HE'S COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

399
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,916
IT'S JUST GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,708
THE BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD
WILL ONLY GET BIGGER NOW.

401
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,958
AND WHO'S TO SAY HE WON'T
DESTROY OUR TOWN

402
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,416
AND ANY OTHERS?

403
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,791
- Man #4: I'M STARTING
TO BELIEVE IT'S ALL HIS FAULT

404
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,291
THAT WE'RE STUCK
ON THIS PLANET. 

405
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,291
NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE
OTHER CRAP I'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM.

406
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,083
BUT THERE'S MORE.
THEY'RE SAYING NOW

407
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,708
THAT HE'S ALSO
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE

408
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,541
FOR THAT BIG
HOLE IN THE MOON.

409
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,250
IT MAKES ME SICK
JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT.

410
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,125
- Man #6: WHAT ARE YOU NUTS?
THERE ISN'T A MAN ALIVE

411
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,041
WHO CAN PULL OFF
A STUNT LIKE THAT.

412
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,500
- Man #4: COOL YOUR JETS,
WILL YOU?

413
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,083
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT I HEARD.

414
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,083
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.
- Man #6: HEY, AT THIS POINT,

415
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,708
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
BE THANKFUL

416
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,833
THAT WE'RE ALL STILL ALIVE.
- Man #5: YEAH,

417
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,458
YOU SAID IT.

418
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,083
- ( cries )

419
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,375
- ( door opens )

420
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,416
- UM, MERYL,
WE RECEIVED A LETTER

421
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
FROM THE MAIN OFFICE.

422
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,375
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

423
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,875
WELL, THEIR CORRESPONDENCE
CERTAINLY IS SLOW.

424
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,833
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
WAITING FOR TWO WEEKS. 

425
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,833
"MERYL STRYFE
AND MILLY THOMPSON

426
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,041
ARE TO RETURN TO
THE MAIN OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

427
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,250
FURTHERMORE, IN A CONFERENCE
HELD THE OTHER DAY,

428
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,208
IT WAS DECIDED THAT
VASH THE STAMPEDE

429
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,666
WILL BE DESIGNATED AS
MANKIND'S FIRST OFFICIAL

430
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,875
HUMAN DISASTER.

431
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,750
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

432
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,500
NO MATTER WHAT KIND 
OF DAMAGE HE CAUSES,

433
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,833
THE BERNADELLI
INSURANCE SOCIETY

434
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,166
WILL BE--"

435
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,500
"WILL BE--"

436
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,000
"WILL BE...

437
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,625
UNINVOLVED."

438
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,416
THIS CAN'T BE.
( cries )

439
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,583
THIS CAN'T BE.

440
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,041
WHAT DO THEY THINK WILL CHANGE

441
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,041
BY MAKING THIS DECISION NOW?

442
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,875
( cries )
- OH, MERYL.

443
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,916
- ( sobbing wails )

444
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,375
- MR. VASH, YOU'RE A JERK.

445
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,541
YOU MADE MERYL CRY.

446
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,500
I'LL NEVER
EVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

447
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,875
- ( wind rushes )

448
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,500
- ( theme music plays )

449
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

450
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,375
- Young Vash:
REM TOLD ME

451
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,500
THAT SOMEONE SHE LOVED
DIED ON EARTH.

452
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,750
SHE TOLD ME
SHE BOARDED THIS SHIP

453
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,916
SO SHE COULD START OVER.

454
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,625
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE

455
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,708
TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU LOVE
DIE?

456
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,833
I TRIED THINKING OF
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

457
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,375
IF REM DIED.

458
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,750
WHEN I DID, HOT WATER
CAME OUT OF MY EYES

459
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,750
AND IT WOULDN'T STOP
FOR A LONG TIME.

460
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,791
REM, I'LL ALWAYS 
BE THERE FOR YOU.

461
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,041
I WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE.
