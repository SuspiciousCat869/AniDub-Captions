1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,291
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,000
- ( music plays )

3
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,166
- Man: VASH THE STAMPEDE?

4
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S THE MAN WITH

5
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,500
THE SIXTY BILLION
DOUBLE DOLLARS ON HIS HEAD.

6
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,125
THEY SAY HE SHOWED UP
IN DANKIN TOWN RECENTLY.

7
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,083
MADE QUITE A MESS I HEAR.
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?

8
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,500
- ( chuckles )
THE WHOLE TOWN GOT ZAPPED.

9
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,416
MOUNTAINS OF CORPSES
ALL OVER DANKIN.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,208
THE COFFIN MAKER
GOT SO RICH

11
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,875
HE BUILT HIMSELF
A MANSION OF WOOD.

12
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,666
- ( whistles )
GUY SOUNDS PLAIN CRAZY.

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,791
- HE'S MORE THAN CRAZY.

14
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,375
I THINK WE'D BE WISE
TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE.

15
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,375
MESSING WITH VASH
IS LIKE DANCING WITH DEATH.

16
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,291
HE LEAVES A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION
WHEREVER HE GOES.

17
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,333
WOMEN, CHILDREN,
HE DON'T CARE.

18
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,916
HE'LL KILL 'EM ALL.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,875
THEY CALL HIM
"THE HUMANOID TYPHOON."

20
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,625
- HUH?
- ( crash )

21
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,791
- HUH?
- HMM?

22
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,750
- HUH?! OHH, AHHH!

23
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,291
- ( metal swishes )

24
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,500
- HUH?

25
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,500
- ( whirring )

26
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,125
- ( man grunts )

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,125
- HMM?
- HUH?

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,083
- ( ice clinks )

29
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,333
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

30
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,291
- ( gun cocks )

31
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,833
- both: HUH? AHHH!

32
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,291
- HUH?

33
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,833
- ( chuckles )

34
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,250
I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

35
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,416
- ( gunfire )

36
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,041
- Sherriff: ONE NIGHT AND
JUST LOOK AT THIS PLACE. 

37
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,333
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THE RUMORS,

38
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,166
BUT THIS GUY
REALLY IS A TYPHOON.

39
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,416
OVER HALF THE TOWN
AIN'T NOTHING BUT RUBBLE NOW.

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,625
- THAT'S A REAL SHAME, BUT
THE UNDERTAKERS MUST BE HAPPY.

41
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,833
SO HOW MANY DID
HE GET THIS TIME?

42
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,416
100, 200?

43
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,916
- ACTUALLY, ZERO.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT
OF INJURIES,

45
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,000
BUT SOMEHOW
NO FATALITIES AT ALL.

46
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,500
I GUESS WE HAD
A MIRACLE HERE...

47
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,875
WITHOUT GOD'S HELP.

48
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,125
- SO WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,541
- ( sighs )
WELL, HE WORE RED,

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
HAD EARRINGS--
A GIANT MAN WITH SHORT LEGS.

51
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,958
I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T GET
A REAL GOOD LOOK AT HIM MYSELF.

52
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,500
- THANKS, SHERIFF.

53
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,458
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
STAY AWAY FROM HIM

54
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,500
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

55
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,000
- RED.  HMPH!

56
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,041
- Radio Host: THE AREA OF DANKIN
IS MOSTLY DEMOLISHED.


57
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,666
ALL RESIDENTS GO TO YOUR 
DESIGNATED SHELTER AREAS.

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,791
THE NEXT UPDATE
WILL BE AT 1: 30 P.M.

59
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,250
- HUH?
- UNTIL THEN,

60
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,375
PLEASE ENJOY
OUR MUSICAL SELECTION.

61
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,916
- ( leering chuckles )

62
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,791
- WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

63
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,791
- A BANANA SUNDAE.
- HUH?

64
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,041
- AND I WILL HAVE A GATOE
MILK BOWL WITH SALONG TEA.

65
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,083
- All: HUH?!
- ( growling )

66
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,125
( grunts )
LISTEN, MISSES,

67
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,791
I'M AFRAID YOU'D BETTER
ORDER MILK WITH THAT

68
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,333
OR THAT GAG
AIN'T GONNA WORK.

69
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,708
- YEAH, 'CAUSE IF YOU DID,

70
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,125
WE'D GIVE YOU ALL THE MILK
YOU COULD POSSIBLY WANT.

71
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,541
- ALTHOUGH,
I HATE TO TELL YOU,

72
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,500
BUT IT WOULDN'T 
EXACTLY BE FREE.

73
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,250
- ( men laugh )

74
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,500
- BUT I DIDN'T SAY MILK.
I SAID SALONG TEA.

75
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,708
- ( grunts )
- ( men mutter )

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
- HEY!
- HEY!

77
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,625
- OH, SORRY.

78
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,875
- YOU LITTLE BITCH, YOU!

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,916
- AWWW.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,458
- THAT STUPID SLING
BROKE AGAIN.

81
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,291
- YOU HAVE A SPARE, DON'T YOU?
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

82
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,958
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- WHAT THE HELL IS SHE?

83
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,666
- SHE'S A MONSTER.

84
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,291
- BY THE WAY, MISTER,
WE HEARD THAT VASH THE STAMPEDE

85
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,625
SHOWED UP IN FELNARL RECENTLY.

86
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL US? 

87
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,083
- WHAT ABOUT VASH?
AND WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

88
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,291
DON'T TELL ME YOU TWO
INNOCENT-LOOKING THINGS

89
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,833
ARE AFTER THAT SIXTY BILLION
DOUBLE-DOLLAR REWARD.

90
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,875
- OH, NOT AT ALL.
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,

91
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,875
WE'RE JUST PASSING
THROUGH HERE ON BUSINESS.

92
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,833
- BUSINESS? WELL, I DIDN'T
EXACTLY SEE HIM, MYSELF.

93
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:58,000
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, HE WAS
GONE FROM THE CITY BY DAWN. 

94
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,416
LAST I HEARD, HE WAS
HEADED OUT TO THE EAST.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,291
- CAN YOU TELL ME
ANY MORE ABOUT HIM?

96
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,250
- HMM, WELL, HE STANDS ABOUT
12 FIELDS TALL.

97
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,166
AND HE WIELDS A HUGE WEAPON.
- Men: HUH?!

98
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,666
- Chef: HE'S SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A MOHAWK.

99
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,458
AND NERVES OF STEEL.
- ( chuckles )

100
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,250
- APPARENTLY, HE'S GOT
TONS OF HENCHMEN.

101
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,416
AND A REPUTATION AS
THE WORST WOMANIZER

102
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,916
ANYONE'S EVER SEEN.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,625
- WOMANIZER!
- I HEARD WHAT HE SAID,

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,333
"A HUGE WEAPON
AND A MOHAWK."

105
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,208
THAT'S OUR MAN,
ALL RIGHT.

106
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,583
- WHERE IS HE?
WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

107
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,458
I DON'T CARE IF YOU
HAVE TO DIG UP THE WHOLE AREA--


108
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,541
I WANT YOU TO FIND IT.


109
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,541
- WELL, BOSS, I
DON'T BELIEVE IT.


110
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,416
THAT LITTLE COWARD
COULDN'T BE HIM.

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,208
( inhales )

112
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,916
I DON'T SEE ANY POINT
IN STICKING AROUND THIS PLACE.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,916
LET'S JUST MOVE--
WAIT!

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,250
- SO YOU THINK YOU'RE BIG ENOUGH
TO GIVE ME ORDERS NOW,

115
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,625
YOU LITTLE WEASEL, HUH?

116
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,333
YOU SAW WHAT HE WAS WEARING.
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S HIM.

117
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,250
FIND HIM NO MATTER WHAT
OR I'LL HAVE TO BREAK YOUR NECK.

118
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,375
OKAY?
- YES, BOSS!

119
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,625
- ( screams )
( grunts )

120
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,250
- ( gasping )

121
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,458
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
SUFFOCATE A MINUTE THERE.

122
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
- IT'S VASH!
( grunts )

123
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,250
UGH!

124
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,416
- HI, THERE.
PARDON ME.

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,041
THANKS FOR NOTHING, FELLAS.

126
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,875
- ( empty rounds click )

127
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,583
- ( laughing )

128
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,000
- ( screams )

129
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,541
( pants )

130
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,791
( screaming )

131
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,416
- THAT WAS A PRETTY CLOSE ONE.

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,125
ALMOST BOUGHT THE FARM
BACK THERE.

133
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,041
IT'S ACTUALLY A MIRACLE THAT
I GOT AWAY WITH IT THIS TIME.

134
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
- I FOUND HIM!
OVER THERE!

135
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,833
- ( screams )

136
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,833
PERFECT SHOT!
- ( gunfire )

137
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,291
- ( screams, pants )

138
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,583
- WELL, HE THINKS
HE'S FUNNY.

139
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,291
HUNT HIM DOWN.
- RIGHT.

140
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,875
- ( panting )

141
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,750
( breathes harshly )

142
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,250
I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

143
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,000
THEY'RE PERSISTENT.

144
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,583
HA HAHAHA!

145
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,458
I'M LIKE A SITTING DUCK
OVER HERE.

146
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,625
I'M DEFENSELESS!
- ( grunts )

147
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,625
( growls )

148
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,583
HUH? UH...

149
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,833
OH, SHIT.

150
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,708
- NOW, STAND REAL STILL.

151
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,708
YOU WOULDN'T WANT THIS GUN
TO GO OFF, WOULD YOU?

152
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,500
- ( gulps )
I FOUND HIM!

153
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,208
HE'S RIGHT
OVER HERE, BOSS!

154
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,958
- UH, WOULD YOU MIND
LOWERING YOUR GUN

155
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,916
LIKE A GOOD BOY?
- FORGET IT.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,916
- YOU DON'T LIKE PAIN, DO YOU?
- I'M USE TO IT.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,791
- WELL, I FEEL SORRY
FOR YOUR WIFE AND KIDS.

158
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,000
YOU'LL MAKE 'EM CRY.
- I AIN'T GOT NO KIDS

159
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,458
AND MOST WOMEN FIND ME
PRETTY OFFENSIVE. SO I'M SINGLE!

160
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,125
- SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY
LONELY LIFE.

161
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,500
- I'M TELLING YOU...

162
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,791
YOU HAVE TO DIE.

163
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,625
IT WOULD SURE MAKE US
ALL HAPPY IF YOU DO. 

164
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,000
- SORRY, I DON'T DO REQUESTS.

165
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,625
- ( metal swishes )
- HUH? GET DOWN!

166
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,541
- ( screams )

167
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
- ( rumbling )
- ( groans )

168
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,333
- BOSS! HELP ME!

169
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,250
- HUH, THAT'S GOOD WORK.
MY COMPLIMENTS.

170
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,375
- BOSS, IT HURTS.
- ATTACKING WHILE YOUR PAL

171
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,625
IS IN THE LINE OF FIRE.
- IT HURTS! HELP ME.

172
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,166
- DON'T YOU CARE 
ABOUT HIM AT ALL?

173
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,000
- HELP.
- WE'RE NOT PALS.

174
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,791
OUR FATE IS
OUR BEING PARTNERS.

175
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,166
THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY
HE CAN BE HAPPY

176
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,333
IS WHEN I'M HAPPY.

177
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,333
- THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.

178
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,291
- YOU CAN SHOOT ME IF THAT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

179
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,958
THAT IS IF YOUR BIG GUN
OF YOURS

180
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,583
ISN'T JUST FOR SHOW.
- ACTUALLY, I CAN'T STAND BLOOD.

181
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,208
JUST THE VERY SIGHT OF IT
MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE FAINT.

182
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,583
- FINE THEN.
HOW ABOUT WE FIND OUT

183
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,458
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET TO SEE
YOUR OWN BLOOD, HUH?

184
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,625
- ( groans )
- NOW, IT WOULD

185
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,166
MAKE ME REAL HAPPY
IF YOU GO HOLD HIM DOWN.

186
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,500
- UGH!

187
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,791
- ( both grunt )

188
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,791
- ( whimpers )

189
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,916
- THERE NOW. DO YOU
SEE HOW DEVOTED HE IS?

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
- ( shivers )

191
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,000
HEY, COULDN'T YOU GUYS BE
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE GENTLE?

192
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,500
- ( animal groans )

193
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,041
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
OUR PRECIOUS LITTLE CARGO

194
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,500
TO THE FEDS RIGHT AWAY.

195
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,291
- HAHAHAHA!
- YEAH! HAHA!

196
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,000
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
BE FILTHY RICH.

197
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,333
- ( both laugh )

198
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,333
HUH?

199
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,916
- ( animal groans )

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,416
- WOMEN.
ARE THEY FRIENDS OF HIS?

201
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,333
- Leader: WELL, ARE THEY GONNA
TRY AND STEAL OUR REWARD?

202
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,875
- WE'RE GOING IN.
- RIGHT.

203
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,333
- ( groans )

204
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,166
- NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

205
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,166
- I'M VERY PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

206
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,666
MY NAME IS MERYL.

207
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,833
I'M-- I'M MERYL STRYFE
AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING 

208

210
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,916
- THIS, UH, IS A SMALL TOKEN
OF OUR GOOD WILL.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,625
- NICE GOING, MERYL.

212
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

213
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,625
ARE YOU HERE WITH HIM?

214
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708
- ( laughs )

215
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,708
- ACTUALLY, NOT AT ALL.
WE WERE SENT HERE

216
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,458
BY THE BERNARDELLI
INSURANCE SOCIETY

217
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,625
TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT--
- ( gunfire )

218
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,666
- HUH?!

219
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,791
- ( chuckles )

220
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,166
I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

221
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,125
IT'S THE SIXTY BILLION
DOUBLE-DOLLAR BIG BOUNTY,

222
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,041
MR. VASH THE STAMPEDE.

223
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:15,833
- ( growls )

224
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,625
- HUH?
- HUH?

225
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,166
- MY NAME IS LOOSE RUTH.
I'M A BOUNTY HUNTER.

226
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,458
AND SOME PEOPLE KNOW ME AS
CONSTANCE RIFLE.

227
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,125
MR. VASH THE STAMPEDE,

228
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,083
TIME YOU KNOW THAT I'M HERE
FOR THE PRICE ON YOUR HEAD.

229
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WELL, MERYL?

230
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,125
- THIS LOOKS BAD.

231
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,500
- UH, DID I MISS SOMETHING?

232
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,083
- MR. VASH THE STAMPEDE,
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO MEET YOU.

233
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,875
YOUR FACE IS STARTING TO LOOK

234
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,583
LIKE IT BELONGS ON
THE DOUBLE DOLLAR.

235
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,916
YOU REALLY CAN'T BLAME ME
FOR COMING AFTER YOU NOW,

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,625
SINCE YOUR HEAD IS WORTH
60,000,000,000.

237
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,875
- Milly: WHAT DO WE DO, MERYL?

238
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,750
- I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

239
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,416
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM.

240
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,416
- SO DID YOU YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS RUTH? 

241
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
- UH, COULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
- WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE

242
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,625
YOU ENJOY YOUR WORK, MR. RUTH.

243
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,791
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT LATE.

244
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,000
- PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME.
- ME, LATE?

245
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,708
I DON'T RECKON SO.

246
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,791
- ( gun cocks )

247
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,791
- ( gasps ) 
YOU ASSHOLE!

248
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,583
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE AIMING AT?

249
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,875
- JUST A SIXTY BILLION
DOUBLE-DOLLAR SKULL.

250
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,583
THAT'S ALL.
- DON'T BE A MORON!

251
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,666
- ( laughs )
- HUH?

252
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,666
- YOU THINK THE BOSS IS VASH?
WHERE THE HELL

253
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,583
DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?
- HUH?

254
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,333
- I AIN'T FOOL ENOUGH
TO LISTEN TO SOME LAME HENCHMAN.

255
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,791
SORRY, JOKE'S OVER
AND I AIN'T LAUGHING.

256
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,041
- HUH, THIS IS JUST STUPID.
QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

257
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,083
GET THE HELL OUT OF--
- Ruth: DON'T MOVE.

258
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,666
YOU'RE DRESSED
IN A RED COAT.

259
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
YOU'VE GOT EARRINGS
AND YOUR LEGS ARE SHORT.

260
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,458
I'M CONVINCED YOU ARE
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

261
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,291
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND!

262
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,791
VASH IS A BLONDE-HAIRED MAN
IN A RED COAT

263
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,666
AND HE CARRIES
A GREAT BIG HANDGUN OKAY.

264
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,041
- NO, HE ISN'T.

265
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,958
VASH THE STAMPEDE
IS A GIANT MAN

266
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,791
WITH A REALLY HUGE WEAPON
AND A MOHAWK!

267
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,166
- Milly:
THAT'S AWFULLY STRANGE.

268
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,166
- Meryl:
YEAH, THE RUMORS DON'T MATCH.

269
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,458
- Milly:
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

270
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,791
- Meryl: WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

271
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,958
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BELIEVE WHAT WE'VE HEARD.

272
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,791
- BUT MERYL.

273
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,166
- HUH?
- YOU'RE ALL CRAZY.

274
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,500
I'M NOT VASH.  HUH?!
- HEY, BOSS, LOOK!

275
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,291
- THE FEDS'LL PAY
SIXTY BILLION DOUBLE DOLLARS

276
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,125
FOR VASH THE STAMPEDE,
DEAD OR ALIVE.

277
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,958
SO IT'S YOUR CHOICE, FRIEND.

278
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,416
I'D BE HAPPY TO KILL YOU NOW
IF YOU LIKE.

279
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,750
- SO HE'S BLONDE,
HAS A RED COAT, A BIG GUN.

280
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,291
( chuckles )
I GET IT.

281
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,375
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
THE JUMP ON ME, AREN'T YOU...

282
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,125
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

283
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,666
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

284
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,500
- Gang leader: YOU EVEN CAME UP
WITH THAT STUPID FAKE NAME.

285
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,875
NICE TOUCH.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

286
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,291
- HE IS DEFINITELY
THE REAL THING.

287
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
LET'S GET HIM!

288
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,958
- HMM, WELL, I'LL BE.

289
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,458
SO THIS IS HOW HE STAYED ALIVE
THIS LONG.

290
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,000
- COME ON, SHOOT!

291
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,125
- ( shouts )

292
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,666
- ( all scream )

293
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,458
- AAAAH! LET ME OUT OF HERE!

294
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,833
- THAT BASTARD!

295
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,708
DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK!

296
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,458
( growls )

297
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,125
- ( whimpers )
I'M REALLY SCARED.

298
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,291
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON
IS ON THE LOOSE.

299
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,833
WHAT DO WE DO, MERYL?
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

300
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,625
DUH, WE RUN AWAY,
THAT'S WHAT.

301
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,708
- I GUESS IT IS IMPORTANT
TO STAY ALIVE, ISN'T IT? 

302
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,750
- ( panting )

303
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,625
- ( shouting )
- ( gunfire )

304
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,791
- WE HAVE TO GIVE THE TOWN

305
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,250
THE EVACUATION ORDER
IMMEDIATELY.

306
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,333
- BUT, MERYL,
ISN'T RUNNING AWAY LIKE THIS

307
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,750
THE SAME AS IF WE WERE
ABANDONING OUR POST?

308
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,291
- IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT
WE CONTACT THE TOWN NOW.

309
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,250
- MM-HMM,
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

310
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,250
- HUH? WHEN DID
YOU GET HERE?

311
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,291
- THANKS A LOT.
I WAS REALLY GETTING HUNGRY.

312
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,458
THESE DONUTS HIT THE SPOT.
THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.

313
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,500
- GIVE ME THOSE! YOU KNOW,
WE DIDN'T COME OUT HERE

314
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,208
JUST TO SAVE
YOUR SORRY BUTT.

315
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,583
- OH, OKAY, THEN.
WHAT WERE YOU TWO DOING THERE?

316
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,625
ARE UGLY GUYS LIKE THAT
YOUR TYPE OR WHAT?

317
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,625
- SHUT UP, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

318
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,916
WE CAME TO THIS PLACE
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,250
- THAT'S RIGHT,
OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES

320
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,833
OF THE BERNARDELLI 
INSURANCE SOCIETY.

321
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,541
WE'RE DISASTER INVESTIGATORS.

322
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,125
- SO IF YOU'RE REALLY
INSURANCE PEOPLE,

323
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,333
WHY ARE SO INTERESTED
IN SUCH A DANGEROUS BOUNTY?

324
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,166
- THERE'VE BEEN OVER
300 INCIDENTS

325
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,458
INVOLVING VASH THE STAMPEDE.
IT'S A HUGE LIABILITY

326
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,916
FOR ANY INSURANCE COMPANY.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
( sighs )

328
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,791
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND RISKS...
( grunts )

329
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,250
AND JUST CUT
WHAT HE TAKES!

330
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,458
- YEAH, THAT MUST BE ROUGH.
( chews loudly )

331
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,041
- ( scoffs )
LIKE YOU CARE.

332
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,333
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO FIND
VASH THE STAMPEDE

333
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,333
AND KEEP HIM UNDER
24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE.

334
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,625
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT
FURTHER DAMAGE.

335
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,458
- 24-HOUR?!

336
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,666
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

337
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,666
- NO, NOTHING. 
- OH, I GOT IT.

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,833
ALL RIGHT, I'M PREPARED
TO MAKE YOU A DEAL.

339
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,541
IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS
AND THE DONUTS,

340
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,125
WOULD YOU CONSIDER GOING INTO
TOWN AND WARNING THE PEOPLE?

341
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,000
I'LL EVEN LEND YOU
MY OWN PERSONAL THOMAS.

342
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,541
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY
GOING BACK THERE? 

343
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,333
- IT'S THE JOB.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

344
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
- ( thomas groans )

345
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,583
- ( silent )

346
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,750
- Meryl: LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ALL OVER.

347
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,000
GOOD, THERE DON'T
SEEM TO BE ANY CASUALTIES.

348
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,875
- BUT, MERYL, DIDN'T THAT
BOUNTY HUNTER GET KILLED?

349
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,166
I'D CALL THAT A CASUALTY.

350
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
- THAT'S TRUE.
IT'S VERY SAD.

351
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,916
- WELL, HOW'RE WE GONNA
APPROACH 'EM THIS TIME?

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,333
HAVE YOU GOT SOME KIND
OF PLAN?

353
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,000
- ( laughs ) YEAH.

354
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,000
A DELUXE BOX OF 30.
- HEY, WHAT A GREAT IDEA!

355
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
- AS LONG AS WE'RE
CLEVER ABOUT THIS 

356
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,041
AND TREAT THEM WITH
COURTESY AND RESPECT,

357
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

358
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,208
- ( metal swishes )
- ( screaming )

359
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,791
- YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVE
COMING BACK HERE.

360
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,291
- PLEASE ACCEPT
THIS TOKEN OF GOODWILL.

361
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,583
- I HATE PRESENTS. NOW, WHERE'S
THE GUY YOU RAN AWAY WITH?

362
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,916
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE SPLIT UP HALF WAY.

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,541
- AND IT WAS SO DAMN HARD
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

364
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,166
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT THIS, RUTH?

365
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,791
- YOU'RE ALIVE?
- HOW CAN YOU STILL BE ALIVE?

366
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,875
I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH.

367
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,166
- IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE BOTH
MADE A LITTLE ERROR.

368
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,708
- "WE MADE THE ERROR"?
IN MY OPINION,

369
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,125
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT SCREWED UP.

370
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,000
IT WASN'T ME.
LISTEN HERE. 

371
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,541
WE'RE GONNA SPLIT IT.
70-30.

372
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,666
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

373
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,916
- WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT?

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,583
- TIME TO GO.
- HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE.

375
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,666
- ( whimpers )
OH, MERYL.

376
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,750
- I GUESS, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN THIS JOB, AFTER ALL.

377
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,958
- Gang leader:
WHAT GOOD WILL THIS DO?

378
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,000
THESE TWO ARE USELESS.

379
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,500
- Ruth: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST ENJOY THEM.

380
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:26,291
- OH, YOU'VE GOT BAD TASTE,
SICK AND TWISTED,

381
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,875
BUT, ACTUALLY,
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

382
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,875
- THEY DID SAY HE WAS
THE WORST KIND OF WOMANIZER.

383
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,208
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO REMIND ME OF THAT.

384
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,000
- ( both shiver )

385
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,500
- ( chuckles )

386
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,166
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU PREFER, LADIES.

387
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,250
PLEASURE BEFORE DEATH?
OR JUST DEATH WITHOUT PLEASURE?

388
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,458
- ( squeaks )
- HE HE HE HE HE HE.

389
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,458
HM-HMM.
( breathy exhale )

390
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,250
HUH?

391
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,291
- Minion: BOSS, WE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM!

392
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,458
- I'M BUSY!

393
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,208
- YA-OWW!
WELL, ACTUALLY,

394
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,958
IT'S ME
WITH THE BIG PROBLEM HERE.

395
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,750
- HE'S HERE.  THAT LITTLE--
- ( growls )

396
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,916
- HE CAME BACK.
- ( gunfire )

397
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,791
- GOTCHA.
- ( grunting )

398
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,541
- AH!
- RUN!

399
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,875
- ( gunfire )
- ( whimpers )

400
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,291
- THANKS FOR SAVING ME
THE TROUBLE

401
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,458
OF LOOKING FOR YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT,

402
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,750
VASH THE STAMPEDE!

403
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,000
- VASH?
- ( gang leader grunts )

404
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,666
HUH?

405
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,416
HUH?! WHERE'D HE GO?

406
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,083
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
- TO THE POTTY, SIR.

407
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,625
- HMM.

408
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,208
- ( yelping )
- HE DID SAVE OUR LIVES.

409
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,125
- PRETTY PATHETIC HERO
IF YOU ASK ME.

410
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,708
- MOMMY!

411
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916
- ALL RIGHT, CORNER HIM.

412
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,208
- UH-OH.
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

413
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,083
WELL, VASH, IT'S TIME
TO CHOOSE YOUR WAY TO DIE.

414
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,708
BY A BOOMERANG OR TO
A SUICIDE DIVE OFF THE CLIFF.

415
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,250
- SUICIDE?

416
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,750
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

417
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,500
I DISAPPROVE OF SUICIDE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

418
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,708
- HMM.

419
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,041
ALL RIGHT,
THE BOOMERANG IT IS.

420
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,833
ARGH!

421
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
WHAT?

422
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,333
- AYE, AYE, AYE, AYE,
AYE, AYE, AYE, AYE,

423
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,333
DANGEROUS TOYS ARE FUN,

424
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,833
BUT YOU COULD GET HURT.

425
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,041
- YOU BASTARD!
( screams )

426
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,625
( bones crunching )

427
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,208
- WATCH OUT, BOSS!
- HEY, BOSS, LOOK OUT!

428
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,666
- ( gasps )
- HE GOT THE BOSS!

429
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,333
- THAT GUY ISN'T HUMAN!

430
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,958
- ( both screaming )

431
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,666
- ( sighs ) WHAT FRAGILE
BONDS OF LOYALTY.

432
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,166
NOW, YOU THERE!

433
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,166
- HUH?
- YOU BETTER LOOK OUT!

434
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,833
- WHAT FOR? UGH!

435
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,041
- OOPS, JUST
A LITTLE TOO LATE.

436
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,291
- ( gasping )

437
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,916
- WELL, FRIENDS,
I REALLY HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,166
- ( gags )

439
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,666
- THAT'S AMAZING.

440
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,416
HE ACTUALLY GOT BOTH OF THEM
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

441
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,125
- IT'S AS IF HE WERE
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

442
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,125
- HUH?

443
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,958
- WELL, DID I WORK OFF
THE DONUTS

444
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,291
AND THE TEN DOUBLE DOLLARS?

445
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,541
- HUH?
- ( hysterical laughing  )

446
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,625
( hysterical laughter
continues )

447
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,208
- IT CAN'T BE HIM.
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.

448
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,500
- ( screams )

449
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,500
- ( screaming )

450
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,750
- ( gargled scream )

451
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,583
- ( rumbling )

452
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,833
- ( typing )


453
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,541
- Meryl: "DISASTER REPORT:


454
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
WE HAVE DETERMINED 
THAT THE LANDSLIDE,


455
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,041
WHICH DESTROYED FELNARL

456
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,625
WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF
THE ILLEGAL USE OF EXPLOSIVES

457
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,125
BY A MAN CALLED LOOSE RUTH.

458
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,500
PLEASE PAY ALL INSURANCE CLAIMS
AS PER REGULATIONS."

459
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,666
( sighs )

460
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,041
AFTER ALL THAT WORK, WE'RE AT
LESS THAN ZERO ON OUR VASH HUNT,

461
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,083
BUT WE CAN'T JUST
IGNORE THE RUMORS.

462
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,125
THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

463
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,875
- WHAT ABOUT THAT CRAZY GUY?
- HMM?

464
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,041
- HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE VASH.

465
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,333
I JUST DON'T BUY THAT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

466
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,750
- Man: VASH THE STAMPEDE?
- Man #2: YUP, THAT'S THE ONE.

467
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,250
THE MAN WITH SIXTY BILLION 
DOUBLE DOLLARS ON HIS HEAD.

468
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,541
THEY SAY HE SHOWED UP
IN FELNARL.

469
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,291
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?
- NO, SO WHAT HAPPENED?

470
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:31,125
- THE FUNNY THING IS 
THEY SAY NOBODY DIED.

471
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,666
- YOU MEAN LIKE, "YOU DON'T
NEED GOD FOR A MIRACLE"?

472
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,333
- ( both laugh )

473
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,500
- ( theme music plays )

474
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

475
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,833
- Vash: THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS,

476
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,208
HUMAN EMOTION.

477
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,625
EMOTIONS OF THE HEART CAN'T
JUST BE TUCKED AWAY IN A CLOSET.

478
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,458
THERE'S A WAY
TO KNOW THE EMOTIONS.

479
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,458
LOOK INTO THE EYES.

480
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,000
THE GIRL LIED TO ME...

481
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,375
AND I BELIEVED HER.

482
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,458
THE GENTLEMAN LIED TO ME

483
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,833
WHEN I TRUSTED HIM.

484
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,375
BUT THE MOMENT
I LOOKED INTO HIS EYES,

485
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,916
THE ANGEL OF DESTINY
BEGAN TO UNRAVEL THE TRUTH.

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,333
JUST LOOK INTO THEIR EYES.

487
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,041
THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUTH.
