- HEY, GUYS,
THIS COULD BE IT.

12
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,458
SURE LOOKS PROMISING THIS TIME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

13
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,583
- I HAVE A GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

14
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,958
I THINK THAT PLANET IS
GOING TO BE OUR NEW HOME!

15
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,541
- ACCORDING TO OUR PRELIMINARY
OBSERVATIONAL DATA,

16
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,750
IT SEEMS TO BE
REASONABLY SIMILAR TO HOME.

17
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,916
- ENOUGH WITH
THE SCIENTIFIC CRAP ALREADY.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,416
I SAY WE TAKE A CHANCE.
LET'S LAND THIS PUPPY.

19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,250
WE'VE DONE THE COLD SLEEP
FIVE TIMES.

20
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,666
IF WE GET FROZEN ONE MORE TIME,
WE'LL SHRIVEL UP! ( laughing )

- ( grunts ) KNOCK IT OFF.
YOU'RE SUCH A PIG, STEVE.

22
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,375
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO SETTLE HERE.

23
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,875
AND BESIDES, WHETHER
WE LAND OR NOT,

24
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,333
THAT'S NOT A DECISION
FOR US TO MAKE.

25
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,041
IT DEFINITELY HAS
A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT,

26
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,875
BUT IT HAS NO EXISTING OCEANS

27
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,083
AND ITS STRATUM CONSISTS
MOSTLY OF QUARTZ.

28
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,666
IT'S NOT WORTH

JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,541
WHAT KIND OF FLOWERS
ARE ON THAT PLANET?

WHAT I SAID BEFORE, REM?

33
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,000
THAT PLANET DOESN'T HAVE--
- HOLD ON, WHY NOT?

34
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,666
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,708
WE'LL DECIDE ONCE THE RESULTS
OF THE MINUTE ANALYSIS ARE IN.

FOR ALL WE KNOW,

37

IT JUST MIGHT HAVE THE
FLOWERS REM THINKS IT HAS.

00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,750
THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME
TO TELL YOU WHAT IS WRITTEN

49
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,625
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS SHIP.

50
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,458
IT SAYS "PROJECT SEEDS."
- Young Vash: PROJECT SEEDS?

51
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,833
- YES, THESE SHIPS
ARE LIKE SEEDS

52
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,875
THAT ARE FILLED WITH
OUR OWN GENES,

53
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,625
GENES FROM THE HUMAN RACE.

54
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,583
THEY ARE SENT OFF TO DISCOVER
AND POPULATE AN UNKNOWN WORLD.

55
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,583
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
SAY THAT WE ARE

56
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,416
THE CARETAKERS OF
ALL THOSE SEEDS.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
IF THERE'S A GOD
IN DEEP SPACE,

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,708
HE MUST BE LAUGHING
AT US RIGHT NOW.

59
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,375
OUR PITIFUL STRUGGLE
FOR IMMORTALITY

60
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,500
MUST LOOK LIKE AN
IMPOSSIBLE QUEST TO HIM.

61
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,583
EVEN THOUGH IT MAY
LOOK SHAMEFUL TO OTHERS,

62
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,791
IT REPRESENTS,
FOR ALL OF US,

63
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,750
THE DESPERATE HUMAN WILL
TO SURVIVE,

64
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,750
TO CARRY ON OUR SPECIES.

65
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,375
WHEN THEY ARRIVE,

66
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,500
A FIGHT ON A NEW LAND
AWAITS THEM.

67
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,041
THIS SHIP IS THEIR HOME
AND UNTIL IT'S TIME,

68
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,291
IT'S OUR JOB TO LET THEM
SLEEP IN PEACE.

69
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,750
- REM, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU?

70
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,916
- ( laughs )

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,458
- OH, THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE!
SO DO YOU WANT TO HAVE LUNCH

72
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,458
IN THE USUAL PLACE
IN THE REC ROOM?

THAT SONG.

75
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,333
- IT SEEMS TO POP INTO MY HEAD
WHENEVER I'M HAPPY.

76
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,625
DO YOU THINK
IT'S STRANGE?

77
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,375
- NO, NOT REALLY.
IT'S A NICE SONG.

78
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,041
- THAT'S SWEET.
THANKS, KNIVES.

79
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,208
- IT'S WEIRD. NOTHING'S
ACTUALLY BEEN MOVED AROUND,

80
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,625
BUT EVERY TIME WE COME HERE

81
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,666
THIS PLACE SEEMS DIFFERENT
FOR SOME REASON.

82
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,208
- Rem: THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S ALIVE.

83
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,416
- HMM?

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
- CAN'T YOU FEEL IT?
IT HAS ITS OWN RHYTHM.

85
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,250
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE LIVING
HEARTBEAT OF THE PLANTS.

86
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,125
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN,
THINKING ABOUT HOME.

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
- Knives: SO THIS LOOKS
LIKE THE WORLD YOU

88
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,291
AND THE OTHERS KEEP
TALKING ABOUT.

89
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,375
- Rem: SORT OF. BUT THE
SCENERY AT HOME WAS

90
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,208
ACTUALLY MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE,

91
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,041
WITH A LOT MORE VARIETY
OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.

92
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,750
- I'D LIKE
TO SEE THAT, REM!

93
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,375
- WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SEE
IT, WE'RE GOING TO CREATE IT!

94
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,291
WE'LL FIND A PLACE
TO CREATE OUR NEW HOME.

95
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,791
AND WHEN WE GET THERE...

96
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,833
- Knives: THERE WILL BE
NOTHING BUT PEACEFUL DAYS.

97
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,583
- Vash: WITH NO WAR.
- Knives: AND NO STEALING.

98
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,750
- Vash: AN EDEN WHERE PEOPLE CAN
LIVE IN FREEDOM AND HARMONY.

99
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,291
RIGHT?

100
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,458
- Joey: THE STATE
OF OUR HOME, EARTH,

101
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,041
WAS SO DESPERATE,
WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE.

102
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,375
MANKIND CAN NO LONGER
SURVIVE THERE.

103
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,750
THE ENTIRE POPULATION
WAS FACING DEATH,

104
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,041
SO PROJECT SEEDS WAS DRAFTED
AS A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS.

105
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,750
- REM, THAT'S OUR SHIP.
THE ONE YOU TOLD US ABOUT.

106
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,958
- MM-HMM.

107
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,166
- JUDGING FROM THE
COMPUTER DATA,

108
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
MANKIND IS RESPONSIBLE

109
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,791
FOR DAMAGING THE PLANET.
RIGHT, CAPTAIN?

110
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,375
- I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

111
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,208
OUR YOUNG RACE BELIEVED THE LAND
AND RESOURCES WERE UNLIMITED,

112
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
WHICH LED TO GRADUAL
DESTRUCTION.

113
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,625
BY THE TIME THEY REALIZED WHAT
THEY HAD DONE, IT WAS TOO LATE.

114
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,583
THE PLANET COULD NO LONGER
TAKE THE ABUSE.

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,833
- IF THAT'S TRUE, WHY DID
THEY COME UP WITH THE IDEA

116
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,583
TO SET THIS PROJECT IN MOTION?

117
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,375
- THE NEED TO SURVIVE.
- Joey: EXACTLY.

118
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,916
THE BEHAVIOR OF CLINGING TO LIFE
UNTIL THE VERGE OF DEATH

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,583
IS INTRINSIC
TO ALL ORGANISMS.

120
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,041
SURVIVAL INSTINCTS TAKE OVER,

121
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,833
DISMISSING SHAME
IN ORDER TO LIVE.

122
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,625
- Knives: BUT IS IT RIGHT
TO LIVE IF IT MEANS

123
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,833
SUCH HUGE SACRIFICES?

124
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,458
- Joey: WE MAKE THE SMALLEST
SACRIFICE WE CAN THINK OF

125
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,333
AT THE TIME. UNLIKE THE OTHER
ORGANISMS ON THE PLANET,

126
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,916
WE POSSESS LOGIC, THE KNOWLEDGE
TO MINIMIZE THE SACRIFICE.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,291
- ALSO AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE
THE ABILITY TO RIGHT OUR WRONGS.

128
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,750
HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN
FROM OUR MISTAKES

129
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,333
AND START OVER IN A NEW HOME.

130
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,750
AS WE JOURNEY, WE NEED
TO TAKE TIME TO SEARCH

131
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,250
AND THINK OF WAYS TO
MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY

132
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,750
WITHOUT ENDANGERING
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

133
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,958
- THIS IS NO GOOD.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

134
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,000
- I'M NOT CUT OUT
TO BE AN EDUCATOR.

135
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,333
WHAT WAS I THINKING, REM?

136
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,083
I CAN ONLY TEACH THEM
HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER.

137
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,666
I'VE NEVER BEEN A FATHER.

138
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,583
I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST
THING ABOUT RAISING KIDS.

139
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,458
- THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR ME.

140
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,333
- I'M SERIOUS. YOU'RE TEACHING
THEM ALL SORTS OF THINGS--

141
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,708
LIKE EMOTIONS,
HOW TO BE KIND TO OTHERS

142
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,875
AND THE VALUE OF THE FUTURE.

143
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,625
- I'M NOT THAT GREAT,
JOEY, REALLY.

144
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,541
I JUST PLAY WITH THEM,
THAT'S ALL. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

145
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,458
- ( chuckles ) YEAH, I GUESS
WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY

146
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,916
OF LOOKING AT THINGS.

147
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,750
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

148
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,708
WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
THEY CAME HERE ANYWAY?

149
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,458
- BECAUSE THEY'RE ANGELS!
- ANGELS?

150
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,083
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD PAY
MORE ATTENTION TO THEM.

151
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,833
VASH AND KNIVES COULD
BE ANGELS GOD SENT

152
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,666
TO POINT US IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION!

153
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,000
THEY MAY EVEN GUIDE US
THROUGH OUR DREAM.

154
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,750
- ( groans )

155
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,875
HEY, REM HERE?

156
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,125
- NO, SHE'S WITH THE KIDS
IN THE REC ROOM.

157
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,416
- OH, LIKE THERE ISN'T
A CARE IN THE WORLD.

158
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,875
APPARENTLY SHE DOESN'T REALIZE

159
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,750
WE STILL HAVE THREE
PLANTS LEFT TO ADJUST.

160
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,416
- OH YES,
I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,583
THE TWO LITTLE GUYS TOOK CARE
OF THOSE WHILE YOU WERE NAPPING.

162
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,791
- WHAT?!
TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING, ROWAN.

163
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,458
I'M FAST, BUT THAT'S STILL
A TWO-DAY JOB FOR ME!

164
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,625
WHAT'S WITH THEM?

165
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,083
- IT'S NOTHING TO
BE SURPRISED ABOUT.

166
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,458
THEIR I.Q. IS WAY
WAY ABOVE OURS!

167
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,000
DON'T TAKE IT SO PERSONALLY.

168
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,583
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
THEY'RE WILLING TO HELP.

169
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,833
- MAYBE THEY'RE BETTER SUITED
FOR BRAIN WORK THAN YOU, STEVE.

170
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,625
YOU NEED TO LIGHTEN UP
ON THOSE KIDS A LITTLE.

171
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,291
- CUT THE CRAP!
- ( both wince )

172
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,333
- DO YOU REALLY WANT THE
SHIP LEFT IN THE HANDS

173
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,333
OF THOSE MONSTERS?

174
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,625
- HMM?
- ( gasps )

175
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,916
- JUST LOOK AT HOW BIG
THEY GREW IN ONE YEAR.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,083
IT ISN'T NORMAL. THOSE KIDS
ARE MONSTERS, I TELL YOU!

177
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,416
MONSTERS!

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,250
- ( Vash sobbing )

179
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,083
- VASH!

180
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,125
VASH...

181
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,666
HEY, YOU'RE CRYING AGAIN.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

182
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,125
- IT'S STEVE. HE SAYS
THAT WE'RE NOT HUMAN.

183
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,125
HE HATES ME!

184
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,416
- ( chuckles )
- ( evil laugh )

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,458
- Knives: I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND,

186
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,083
BUT TO THESE PEOPLE
WE'RE JUST UNINVITED GUESTS.

187
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,250
WE ONLY NEED TO BE
PATIENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

188
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,416
UNTIL THEY ACCEPT US.

189
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,750
- BUT REM SAID THAT
WE COULD STAY HERE.

190
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,916
DO YOU THINK SHE FEELS THAT WAY?
- REMEMBER WHAT JOEY SAID?

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,458
WE HAVE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST
SACRIFICE WE CAN THINK OF

192
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,750
AT THE TIME.

193
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,416
IF WE CAN DO THAT,
WE CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING.

194
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,958
HEY, VASH, DO YOU KNOW
WHY PLANTS CAN'T TALK?

195
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,958
- REM SAID IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN WE ARE.

196
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
SHE SAID THEY'RE SO STRONG,

197
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,416
THEY CONCENTRATE ALL
THEIR ENERGY ON LIVING

198
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,291
SO THEY DON'T NEED TO USE WORDS.

199
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,166
- YEAH, THEY'RE STRONG,
BUT WE EAT THEIR FRUIT.

200
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,916
- WE HAVE TO EAT
THEIR FRUIT TO LIVE.

201
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,958
- DO YOU THINK
I'LL BE EATEN SOMEDAY?

202
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,875
- NO, KNIVES,
DEFINITELY NOT.

203
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,416
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO REM.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,916
SHE SAID THEY'RE MAKING
A DIFFERENT KIND OF EDEN.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
- Steve: KNIVES! WHAT THE
HELL ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

206
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,791
- ( blow thuds )

207
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,666
- THIS PLACE IS OFF-LIMITS
TO YOUR KIND, YOU GOT THAT--

208
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,208
MONSTER?

209
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,750
- Knives: SO THEN
WHY AM I HERE?

210
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,458
- ( crying )

211
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,416
- DON'T!

212
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,416
- Knives:
THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON.

213
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,958
- KNIVES?
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER.

214
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,875
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

215
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,916
- THIS IS TURNING INTO
QUITE A TRIM.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,416
I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE,
BUT YOU'RE REALLY HANDSOME.

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,208
- REALLY?
DO YOU THINK SO, REM?

218
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,750
- HEY, I HAVE
AN IDEA, HANDSOME!

219
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,708
- IT'S STICKING UP!
- ( chuckles )

220
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,958
- I THINK IT'S GREAT.
IT REALLY SUITS YOU, VASH.

221
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,416
AND IT REMINDS ME OF HIM.

222
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,583
- Vash: WHO?

223
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,416
- SOMEONE I LOVED VERY MUCH
BACK HOME.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,250
- SO WHERE IS HE NOW, REM?

225
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,583
- HE IS IN THE LAND
OF ANGELS...

226
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,458
HEAVEN.
HE WAS MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.

227
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,166
THANKS TO HIM, I WAS ABLE
TO FACE MY MISTAKES

228
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
WITHOUT JUDGMENT.

229
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,958
I LEARNED TO MAKE
THEM RIGHT AGAIN.

230
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,125
THEN I LOST HIM AND REALIZED
I WOULD HAVE TO DO IT ALONE.

231
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,875
BUT I WASN'T AFRAID
TO MAKE MISTAKES ANYMORE.

232
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,416
I BELIEVED I COULD POINT MYSELF
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITHOUT

233
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,041
LOOKING BACK.

234
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,916
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY
I GOT ON THIS SHIP.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
SO I COULD ENTER
THE FUTURE AS I AM.

236
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,583
- Vash: REM, ARE YOU SAD?

237
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,750
- HUH?
WELL, JUST A LITTLE.

238
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,583
- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE ME.

239
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,750
I WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE!

240
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,916
I PROMISE I WON'T,
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE YOU, REM!

241
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,583
- ( laughs )
YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,750
BUT THANK YOU, VASH.

243
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,666
ANYWAY, WE'RE DONE.
SHALL WE SWITCH NOW?

244
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,625
KNIVES?
- ( scissors snip )

245
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,250
- Knives:
IT'S ALL WRONG!

246
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,958
- ( electricity crackling )

247
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,000
- HEY, SOMEHOW
I KNEW YOU'D BE IN HERE.

248
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,000
( gasps )

249
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,083
WHAT HAPPENED?

250
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,416
- JUST A SMALL CHANGE
OF HEART, THAT'S ALL.

251
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
BESIDES,
IF WE STAY THE SAME,

252
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,291
THERE'S NO INDIVIDUALITY.

253
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,208
- Rem: THAT'S A WONDERFUL
HAIRCUT, KNIVES!

254
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,333
- THANK YOU.
AS STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND,

255
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,708
I ACTUALLY FEEL REFRESHED.

256
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,791
- Woman: YOU KNOW,
YOU LOOK VERY INTELLECTUAL!

257
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,166
- Rowan: WHY, YOU LOOK LIKE
A REGULAR LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.

258
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,000
- Vash: WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?
- Adults: A MOMMA'S BOY.

259
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,125
- THAT'S MEAN!
- ( all laugh )

260
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,625
- All: HUH?

261
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,583
- I'M AMAZED YOU CAN STOMACH
EATING AT THE SAME TABLE

262
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,791
WITH THOSE LITTLE MONSTERS!

263
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,375
- STEVE, I THINK
YOU'VE HAD ONE TOO MANY.

264
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,541
- NO, I HAVEN'T, BABY.

265
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,666
- HEY, STEVE, COME ON.
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME WORK

266
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,625
YOU STILL HAVE TO DO
SOMEPLACE ELSE?

267
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,750
- SHUT UP, POINDEXTER.
I CAN ALWAYS DO THAT LATER.

268
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,833
- Knives: YOU'RE A DISGRACE.
- GUH?

269
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,500
- NOW IS THAT ANY WAY FOR A
GROWN MAN LIKE YOU TO BEHAVE

270
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,375
IN THE PRESENCE
OF INNOCENT CHILDREN?

271
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,083
- ( growls )

272
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,916
( cackling )

273
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,166
- ( Rem thinking ) HE SURE
HAS BEEN ACTING CRAZY LATELY.

274
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,333
- Knives:
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID.

275
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,291
- WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS,

276
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,541
DRAPING HIMSELF ALL
OVER MARY LIKE THAT?

277
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,750
HUH?

278
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,250
- ( Mary sighs )
THOSE TWO ARE SUCH A PAIN!

279
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,875
BUT THEN AGAIN, I SUPPOSE
JUST ONE WOULD BE RATHER BORING.

280
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,166
HUH? OH.

281
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,708
- ( Rem humming )
- OH OH!

282
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,666
- HUH?

283
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,958
- Vash: AH AH!

284
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,458
- THAT WAS THE EASIEST
WAY TO STOP HIM.

285
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,958
YOU WANTED TO SAVE
THE BUTTERFLY, RIGHT?

286
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,833
- I DIDN'T WANT TO
KILL THE SPIDER.

287
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,333
I WANTED TO SAVE THEM BOTH!

288
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,916
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,875
UNLESS THE SPIDER
CAUGHT THE BUTTERFLY,

290
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,666
IT WOULD DIE OF
STARVATION ANYWAY.

291
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,083
YOU CAN'T SAVE BOTH.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

292
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,916
- Rem: IT'S NOT RIGHT TO MAKE
THAT CHOICE SO EASILY.

293
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,250
BOTH OF THEM ARE
LIVING CREATURES, KNIVES.

294
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,375
SO YOU SHOULD--

295
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,166
- BUT I'M NOT WRONG
ABOUT THIS, REM!

296
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,000
IF YOU JUST KEEP
SAVING THE BUTTERFLIES,

297
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,250
THE SPIDERS WILL DIE!

298
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,708
- YES, BUT--

299
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,750
- WANTING TO SAVE BOTH IS
JUST A NAIVE CONTRADICTION.

300
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,541
AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
RATHER HAD US DO?

301
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,208
JUST STAND
AND THINK ABOUT IT?

302
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,750
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHILE WE DO THAT,

303
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,958
THE SPIDER EATS THE BUTTERF--

304
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,750
- ( growls )

305
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,500
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, KNIVES?

306
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,791
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

307
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,291
I WANTED TO SAVE
BOTH OF THEM, YOU IDIOT!

308
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,291
( panting )

309
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,416
- Knives: YOU DON'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, VASH.

310
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,083
- I DON'T THINK SO, KNIVES!

311
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,166
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

312
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
- Joey: ACCORDING
TO INTERPLANETARY LAW,

313
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,000
STEVE IS RELIEVED OF DUTY. HE
WILL BE DETAINED IN THE FREEZER.

314
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,625
( through P.A. ) Furthermore,

315
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,208
upon the completion
of our mission,

316
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,291
he will be released from
detention to stand trial.

317
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,333
That is all!

318
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
- ALL I DID WAS
GET A LITTLE DRUNK.

319
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,750
WHY CAN'T YOU BELIEVE
WHAT I'M SAYING?

320
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,750
- WE HAVEN'T HEARD HIS SIDE YET.
YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR TO HIM.

321
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,416
- I SAW HIM GO INTO MARY'S ROOM
AND I FIND THAT UNACCEPTABLE.

322
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,416
- HEY WAIT,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

323
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,458
- WE STILL HAVE TIME
TO DISCUSS THIS.

324
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,625
- IN ORDER FOR US
TO FUNCTION AS A GROUP,

325
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,208
WE NEED LAW. IT PROTECTS
ALL OF US FROM HARM.

326
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,208
THE ENTIRE TEAM
MUST UNDERSTAND THIS.

327
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,375
- BUT MAYBE IT WOULDN'T
HURT TO HEAR HIS SIDE OF

328
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,000
THE STORY BEFORE WE FREEZE HIM.

329
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,500
- REM, HE RAPED ME.

330
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,666
- NO, I DIDN'T DO IT!

331
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,458
- ( whooshes )
- ( screams )

332
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,250
- Vash: REM, WHY CAN'T EVERYONE
JUST GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER?

333
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,166
- I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE
PEOPLE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT

334
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,750
WAYS OF THINKING.

335
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,291
BUT EVEN IF WE DO
MAKE MISTAKES,

336
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,291
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT

337
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,500
AND MAKE BETTER CHOICES
THE NEXT TIME.

338
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,500
AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR VISION
CLEAR, YOU WILL SEE THE FUTURE.

339
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,416
WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR FUTURE
IS OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.

340
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,958
- ( Mary scoffs )
MARRY YOU?

341
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,708
- HERE.
- COME ON, YOU MUST BE TEASING.

342
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,208
- AS SOON AS WE'RE
FINISHED HERE,

343
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,541
I'D LIKE YOU TO COME
TO THE BRIDGE.

344
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,791
THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE IN
IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE.

345
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,041
- I MADE SURE THAT STEVE
WILL NEVER WAKE UP AGAIN.

346
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,541
I READJUSTED
THE FREEZER.

347
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,916
- I DIDN'T MEAN FOR US
TO KILL HIM!

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,916
- I GUESS NOW THAT MEANS
WE'RE PARTNERS.

349
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,750
- ( banging )
- All: HUH?

350
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,000
- Joey!
- WHAT'S WRONG, REM?!

351
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,666
- ( panting )

352
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,916
- THE A-12 MONITORS,
SOMEBODY DISCONNECTED THEM.

353
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,125
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

354
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,458
ROWAN!

355
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,875
- IT'S HER OWN FAULT.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

356
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,750
I HELPED HER
AND THEN SHE BETRAYED ME.

357
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,416
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT HER FROM STEVE.

358
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,208
- ROWAN, PLEASE DON'T.

359
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,416
- SHE EVEN TOLD ME
SHE LOVED ME!

360
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,208
THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCUSE.
REM, YOU DO UNDERSTAND ME?

361
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,916
( gasps )
- ( gasps )

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,916
- Rowan: OH, I SEE NOW.
- HUH?

363
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
- IT HAD TO BE HIM.
BECAUSE OF HIM, MARY HAD TO DIE.

364
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,083
IT WAS HIS FAULT.

365
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,291
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ROWAN?

366
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,208
PLEASE PUT THE GUN DOWN.
- Joey: Rem, what's happening?

367
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,208
REM, REM!

368
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,208
- HE CAN'T GET AWAY
WITH IT, THAT MONSTER.

369
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,791
I HAVE TO SHOOT HIM.

370
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,916
NOW GET OUT OF THE WAY, REM!

371
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,541
- NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO TAKE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.

372
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,083
YOU DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM.

373
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,500
NOW PUT IT DOWN.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

374
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,625
- STAY-STAY-- STAY BACK!

375
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,916
( gasping )

376
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,708
- Rowan!
What are you doing?!

377
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,875
- SOMETHING'S BROKEN
INSIDE ME. I'M NUMB.

378
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,916
I CAN'T SEEM TO STOP.

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,916
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, ROWAN.
- Joey: REM, GET OUT OF THERE!

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,916
Rem!

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,250
- Rem: IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO START OVER.

382
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,500
- ( moaning )
- Rem: HERE.

383
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,708
- PLEASE STAY BACK, REM.

384
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,458
DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT YOU!

385
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,208
( screams )

386
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,166
- ( growls )

387
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,416
- ( both screaming )

388
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,750
- ROWAN!

389
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,791
NO, ROWAN, NO!

390
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:13,958
- ( door clanks )

391
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
- Rem: WHY DID YOU
DO THAT, JOEY?

392
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,500
- If I hadn't,
he would have shot you.

393
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,625
I'm sorry.
There was no other way.

394
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,000
- I KNEW ROWAN.
HE WOULDN'T SHOOT ME.

395
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,583
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND! I COULDN'T
SEE THAT FROM THE MONITORS.

396
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,541
- I HAD TO DECIDE QUICKLY.
IF I HADN'T...

397
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,041
- ROWAN... MARY...

398
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,291
- JOEY, I AGREE WITH YOU.

399
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,791
I THINK YOU DID
EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING.

400
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,041
ROWAN WENT CRAZY.
THAT'S ALL YOU COULD DO.

401
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,125
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,
BUT WHAT IF REM WAS RIGHT?

402
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,250
PERHAPS HE WASN'T
GOING TO SHOOT HER.

403
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,500
IF THAT'S TRUE, WHAT I DID
WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

404
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,958
- YOU'RE JUST A HUMAN
LIKE THE REST OF THEM.

405
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,416
I KNOW MY CHOICE
IS THE THE RIGHT ONE.

406
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,666
- ( gunshot )
- ( computer beeping )

407
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,333
- Altering ships'
course program.

408
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,000
- ( gasps )
- Vash: WHAT IS IT?

409
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,958
- Rem: WE'RE CHANGING DIRECTION.
OUR COURSE HAS BEEN RE-ENTERED.

410
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,291
- WHAT?!

411
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,750
- SOMEONE IS SENDING ORDERS
TO ALL OF THE SHIPS.

412
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,833
ALL SYSTEMS ARE NOW
OPERATING ON AUTO-LOCK MODE.

413
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,208
OH MY GOD!
AT THIS RATE,

414
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,208
THE SHIPS ARE GOING TO
CRASH ON THAT PLANET!

415
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,125
- APPARENTLY ROWAN HAD STARTED
UP THE ORBITAL PROGRAM!

416
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,875
WE HAVE TO EVACUATE.
- Rem: WHERE'S JOEY?

417
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,333
- Knives: HE TOLD ME TO GET US
TO THE ESCAPE PODS!

418
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,083
HE SAID HE'D TRY
TO SAVE THE SHIPS!

419
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,833
- Vash: BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE SLEEPING PEOPLE ON BOARD?

420
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,125
- WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

421
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,583
- REM...
- COME ON!

422
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,583
- WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE PODS.

423
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,833
- ( alarm blaring )
Warning, warning.

424
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,458
The ship is about
to enter the atmosphere.

425
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,583
Please proceed
to the escape pods.

426
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,083
Please proceed to
the escape pods.

427
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,833
- COME ON, WE'VE GOT
TO HURRY, REM!

428
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,916
- ( thinking ) A FIGHT ON
A NEW LAND AWAITS THEM.

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,375
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE IT,
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE IT.

430
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,291
AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR VISION
CLEAR, YOU WILL SEE THE FUTURE.

431
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,375
WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR FUTURE
IS OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.

432
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,083
- REM, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

433
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,583
- ALEX, HELP ME.
GIVE ME STRENGTH!

434
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,750
YOU TWO, GO ON AHEAD.

435
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,083
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN. WHY?

436
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,541
- I CAN'T LEAVE JOEY
HERE BY HIMSELF

437
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,416
AND I HAVE TO TRY TO FIND
A WAY TO SAVE THE OTHERS.

438
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,083
- Vash: BUT THE PROGRAM
IS ALREADY RUNNING!

439
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
- YOU'VE GOT TO COME WITH US,
REM. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US!

440
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,583
- I'M SORRY, VASH.
IF ALEX WERE STILL ALIVE,

441
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,583
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART
THAT HE WOULD DO THE SAME THING.

442
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,500
VASH, TAKE CARE OF KNIVES!

443
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,833
DON'T WORRY, VASH.

444
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,625
- ( screams )

445
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,791
( sobs )

446
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,750
( screams )
NO, REM!

447
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,625
NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE!
( sobbing )

448
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,583
PLEASE COME BACK, REM!
- ( laughing )

449
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,500
- REM...
- I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HUMANS.

450
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,083
THEY'RE A TOTAL
WASTE OF LIFE.

451
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,125
TO THINK THEY'D ACTUALLY
SACRIFICE THEMSELVES

452
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,916
OUT OF FOOLISH SENTIMENT FOR
OTHERS. IT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

453
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,791
I THOUGHT I'D LET HER LIVE
ONLY BECAUSE YOU WERE

454
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,125
SO ATTACHED TO HER.

455
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,875
BUT NOW I SEE HOW TRULY
IMPERFECT SHE REALLY WAS.

456
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,958
IT'S A GOOD THING SHE DIED.
- DON'T SAY THAT!

457
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,958
- THEIR IMMIGRATION
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

458
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,875
THAT WOULD BE LIKE SPREADING
PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS

459
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,458
ACROSS OUR HEALTHY UNIVERSE.

460
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,541
- YOU'RE SAYING
YOU PLANNED THIS?

461
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT DON'T WORRY.

462
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,291
YOU AND I WILL BE FINE.

463
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,125
I MADE SURE THE PLANT
SHIP WILL SURVIVE.

464
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,458
AFTER ALL WE NEED THAT
TO CREATE OUR NEW HOME,

465
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,166
NOW WON'T WE,
MY DEAREST BROTHER?

466
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,875
ONLY SHIPS CARRYING
THE HUMANS WILL CRASH.

467
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,416
- ( screams )

468
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,083
BRING HER BACK!
BRING REM BACK, YOU BASTARD!

469
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,541
( grunts )
- ( chuckles )

470
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,708
- All ships now commencing
orbital correction.

471
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,416
- WHAT?

472
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,625
- ( engines roaring )

473
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,458
- Knives:
REVERSE THRUSTERS?

474
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,208
THAT BITCH ACTUALLY DID IT.

475
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,958
- ( crying )
I'M SORRY, REM.

476
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,166
- ( Rem humming )

477
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,333
- Rem's voice:
VASH, TAKE CARE OF KNIVES!

478
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,500
- ( Vash thinking )
TRUST ME, REM.

479
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,083
I WILL...

480
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,333
( cocks )
...TAKE CARE OF HIM.

481
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,916
- ( theme music playing )

482
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,375
( singing in Japanese )

483
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,458
- Vash: LET US REGARD
THE FIFTH MOON

484
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,958
SHINING DOWN UPON US
FROM THE SKIES,

485
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,583
STAINED RED WITH BLOOD.

486
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,875
AND LET US REMEMBER
HIS NAME, HIS LEGEND.

487
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,250
TO DO SO,
YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK UP.

488
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,375
LIKE IT OR NOT, HIS LEGEND IS
CHISELED INTO THE FIFTH MOON,

489
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,666
A PERMANENT ETCHING
FROM A TERRIBLE PAST.

490
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,750
THE LEGEND
OF VASH THE STAMPEDE,

491
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,791
CHISELED FOREVER.

492
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:41,125
AND THEN THE TIME COMES, YOU
ONLY NEED TELL OF THE TRACKS

493
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,166
WHICH LEAD TO THE FUTURE.
