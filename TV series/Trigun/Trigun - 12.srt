YOU BEEN STANDING THERE?

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,916
- I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
THE ENTIRE TIME.

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,083
- ( laughs )
YOU ARE ONE CREEPY GUY.

00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,083
WELL, I REALLY MUST SAY

- DID YOU THINK IT WAS THE
IDLE TALK OF A DRUNK?

18
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,125
- YOU CAN HARDLY BLAME ME
IF I DID, NOW CAN YOU?

00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,208
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK

00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,333
SO TELL ME,
WHO AM I HUNTING?

23
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,333
( thunder crashing )
- ( softly ) VASH THE STAMPEDE.

24
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,791
- ( laughs ) OOH YEAH,
I CAN FEEL THE SHIVERS.

25
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,833
SUDDENLY I CAN REMEMBER
WHY I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

ALL THESE YEARS.

27
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,916
- BE SURE YOU SHOW OUR
MASTER YOUR GRATITUDE

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,791
FOR KEEPING YOU HERE.

29

I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,125
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

31
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,625
I WAS TOLD THAT
YOU'RE RARELY OPEN

32
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,958
'CAUSE YOU SELL OTHER STUFF...

33
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,625
WELL, BESIDES BOOTS, I MEAN.
WHO KNEW? ( laughs )

34
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,958
- HEY, SONNY,
YOU SURE LIKE TO TALK A LOT.

35
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,208
I HOPE YOU LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT BOOTS, FOR YOUR SAKE.

36
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,916
- I DO, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE I WANNA KNOW.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,166
I'LL ABIDE BY YOUR RULES,
I WON'T MAKE ANY TROUBLE.

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,666
COME ON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

( chattering )

41
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,000
- ISN'T THIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
DAY YOU'VE EVER SEEN, MERYL?

42
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,458
- YES, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

43
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,125
- IT'S THE KIND OF DAY
THAT JUST MAKES YOU WANT

44
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
TO SIT HERE AND FORGET ALL ABOUT
YOUR PROBLEMS. DON'T YOU AGREE?

45
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,083
- YES, DEFINITELY.
- IN FACT, IT MAKES YOU WANT

46
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,666
TO COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT WORK
AND TAKE THE DAY OFF.

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,916
- NOT A CHANCE, BUT NICE TRY.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,625
- SHUCKS.

49
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,291
- ( Vash sighs )

50
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,708
THE SKY IS UNBELIEVABLY BLUE.

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,708
- HEY, GIVE ME THE BALL!
- ( kids laughing )

52
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,958
- NO WAY!

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,666
- ( sighing )

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,833
THERE I GO AGAIN.

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,000
GUESS IT'S
KIND OF STUPID, HUH?

56
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,833
I STILL KEEP THINKING HOW
I'D LIKE TO SHOW IT TO YOU.

57
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,916
EVEN THOUGH
THAT'S NO LONGER POSSIBLE.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,375
I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

59
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,500
( screams )

60
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,750
- WHOA, MAN.
I'M REALLY REALLY SORRY.

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,708
- ARE YOU OKAY, MISTER?

62
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,791
- ( yelling )
- ( screaming )

63
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,791
- THE DEADLY DODGEBALL HEAD!

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,041
A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE
TO HOLD THE BALL IN PLACE

65
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,250
WITH INTENSE SUCTION!
TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS!

66
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,541
- HEY, IT'S MR. VASH.

67
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,458
- ( babbling )
- Kids: WE'RE SORRY! STOP!

68
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,833
- WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THAT MAN DOING?

69
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,333
( sighs )

70
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,583
- ISN'T IT WONDERFUL, MERYL?

71
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,916
- HUH?

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,375
- THAT THE VASH WE
KNOW AND LOVE IS BACK?

73
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
- HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

74
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,416
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WHO WANTS ICE CREAM? HUH?

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
- ARE YOU TREATING?
- ALL RIGHT!

76
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,166
- GET SIX, OKAY?

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,291
- BUT WHY DO YOU
WANT SIX OF 'EM?

78
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,333
ISN'T THAT ONE TOO MANY?

79
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,791
- ONE IS FOR HER.

80
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,125
- HERE YOU GO.
- HUH?

81
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,583
- WE'VE GOT A BALL.
YOU WANT TO COME AND PLAY?

82
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,916
- EH... UH...
( sighs )

83
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,416
- WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

84
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,208
- HERE GOES!
- ( laughter )

85
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,458
- HEY, MISTER, OVER HERE!
- OVER HERE!

86
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,916
- ALL RIGHT.

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,375
( gasps )

88
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,583

I FOUND YOU,

89
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,875
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

90
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,458
- Vash's voice:
WHAT?  WHO ARE YOU?

91
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:35,041
- LEGATO.
LEGATO BLUESUMMERS.

92
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,291
- UH, MR. VASH?

93
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,791
- HMM?

94
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,666
- WELL, UH--
IT'S NOTHING.

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,166
( yelps )

96
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,541
- Boy: HEY, LADY!  HURRY!
- COMING!

97
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,375
WHAT WAS THAT STRANGE LOOK
ON HIS FACE?

98
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,791
IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

99
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,250
- Vash's voice:
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,291
- Legato's voice:
YOUR LIFE.

101
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,416
( chuckles )

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,000
PERHAPS THAT WAS
A BIT TOO DRAMATIC.

103
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,583
ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE AS A MESSENGER.

104
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,916
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'VE COME HERE TO WARN YOU.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,916
I'M AFRAID YOUR LIFE
IS GOING TO END...

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,125
TODAY.

107
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,125
- WHAT?

108
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,291
- DO YOU THINK
I'M LYING TO YOU?

109
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,375
- ( gasps )

110
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,333
- ( gasps )

111
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,125
- ( gasps happily )
- ( gasps )

112
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,916
- ( chewing )

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,958
- Legato's voice: I HAVEN'T
GIVEN YOU A GIFT YET, HAVE I?

114
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,083
- ( giggles )

115
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,333
- ( yelps )
- ( gasps )

116
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,916
( laughing )

117
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,208
- ( laughing )

118
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,750
YOUR REACTION WAS
BETTER THAN I'D HOPED.

119
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,666
YOU'RE FUN.

120
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,708
AND TO THINK I COULD KILL
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD HERE

121
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,583
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
IF I WANTED TO.

122
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,291
THE POWER OF DEATH
IS INTOXICATING.

123
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,583
DON'T BE
IN SO MUCH OF A HURRY.

124
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,916
YOU STILL HAVE
A LITTLE TIME LEFT...

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,791
OR PERHAPS YOU DON'T.

126
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,916
AND DON'T WORRY.
NO ONE ELSE NEEDS TO GET HURT.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
SO DO YOU WANT TO DRAW?

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,208
( chuckles )
A WISE CHOICE.

129
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,916
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,041
THIS IS
A LITTLE FAREWELL GIFT.

131
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,458
IT CONTAINS
A LESSON FROM ME.

132
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,916
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE.

133
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,250
- HELP ME!
- WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

134
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,791
- THAT'S THE SHOEMAKER'S WIFE.
OH, SHE LOOKS REALLY UPSET.

135
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,250
HEY!
- IT'S MURDER!

136
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,208
- HEY, IT'S OKAY.
CALM DOWN.

137
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,500
- MURDER, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

138
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,541
- MY HUSBAND--
MY HUSBAND'S IN THERE,

139
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,041
BUT HE WON'T TALK!
HE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING!

140
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,416
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

141
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
- HE-- HE WON'T TALK.

142
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,666
- OKAY, NOW JUST CALM DOWN.
- HE WON'T SAY A WORD!

143
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,208
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

144
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,125
HUSBAND!
OH MY HUSBAND!

145
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,750
( sobs )

146
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,541
- Meryl: SHERIFF, HE DIDN'T
DO IT! HE'S INNOCENT!

147
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,833
- SAVE IT FOR THE
JUDGE TO DECIDE, LADY.

148
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,541
THIS IS NOT A COURTHOUSE.

149
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,291
LISTEN, WE HAVE
WITNESS TESTIMONY

150
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,208
THAT PLACES HIM
AT THE SHOE STORE.

151
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,041
HE ALSO JUST HAPPENED
TO BE THE ONE CLOSEST BY

152
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,750
WHEN THE OWNER'S BODY
WAS FOUND.

153
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,083
AND WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE.

154
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,833
WHAT'S MORE,
WE RAN A CHECK AND FOUND OUT

155
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,541
HE'S THAT HUMANOID TYPHOON

156
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,583
EVERYONE'S BEEN
TALKING ABOUT LATELY.

157
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,541
I'D HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY
OUT OF MY MIND

158
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,041
NOT TO LOCK UP THAT GUY.

159
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,666
NOW IF I WERE TO CUT HIM LOOSE

160
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
AND HE WAS TO MAKE
OFF INTO THE NIGHT,

161
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,458
WOULD YOU TAKE THE HEAT?
I THINK NOT.

162
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,916
- Legato's voice:
IT'S A LITTLE FAREWELL GIFT.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,458
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE.

164
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,291
I'M AFRAID YOUR LIFE
IS GOING TO END...

165
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
TODAY. 

166
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,250
- WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM ME?

167
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:23,958
THE 60 BILLION
DOUBLE DOLLAR REWARD?  NO.

168
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,041
IS IT HIM?

169
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,416
- OH.  HEY, VASH.

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,375
- ( breathing shakily )

171
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,250
- UMM, MR. VASH?

172
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,541
- ( screams )

173
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,541
- OH, HI. IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT HERE?

174
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,000
- OH, IT'S JUST YOU.

175
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,541
- UH-HUH.
- OH, VASH.

176
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,750
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS,

177
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,291
BUT WILL YOU PLEASE
STAY HERE JUST FOR TODAY?

178
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,833
WE'LL COME FOR YOU TOMORROW.
I PROMISE.

179
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,708
- THAT'S NICE.
THANK YOU.

180
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,791
BUT DON'T GO OUT
OF YOUR WAY FOR ME, OKAY?

181
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,458
- AS FAR AS I KNOW,

182
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,583
YOU'RE INNOCENT AND HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

183
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,750
- I NEED SOME TIME ALONE
TO THINK RIGHT NOW.

184
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,291
- UMM, HEY, MR. VASH.

185
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,791
- YES?
- WELL, UH, ACTUALLY--

186
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,500
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOTHING!

187
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,083
( laughing nervously )

188
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, MILLY?

189
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,083
- ACTUALLY, IT MEANS NOTHING.
( laughing nervously )

190
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,208
( doors bang )

191
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,708
- HMM?

192
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,625
- ( heavy footsteps )

193
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,666
- ( whimpering )

194
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,666
- ( gasps )
- WHAT?  WHAT WAS THAT?

195
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,458
( clangs )
- GET DOWN!

196
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,958
( loud gunfire )

197
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,041
( rock music playing )

198
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,791
- ( clangs )
- GET DOWN!

199
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,833
- ( women screaming )

200
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,750
( gun whirs down )

201
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,583
- ( laughs )

202
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,125
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME IN.

203
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,666
- CAN YOU HEAR ME,
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

204
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,125
MY NAME IS MONEV THE GALE,

205
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,250
AND I'M HERE TO
SEND YOU TO HELL,

206
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,875
JUST AS YOU WERE PROMISED.

207
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,291
- ( women coughing )

208
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,875
- BOTH OF YOU, RUN!

209
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,666
- ( women gasp )
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

210
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,125
- GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!
THE ENEMY IS COMING!

211
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,750
HURRY!

212
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "THE ENEMY"?

213
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,666
WHO IS HE AND WHAT
IS HE DOING HERE?

214
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,916
- ( crashes )
- ( grunts )

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,166
- ( chuckles )
THIS WAS SIMPLE.

216
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,750
SIMPLE ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME REALIZE

217
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,416
I'VE BEEN WASTING MY LIFE.

218
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,916
( laughs )
- ( gun cocks )

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,666
- LET GO OF HIM RIGHT NOW.

220
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,666
- GET BACK!
- ( grunts )

221
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,791
- MERYL! ( gasps )
- WHY? ( grunting )

222
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,916
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG 20 YEARS IS,

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,833
IMPRISONED IN THAT
DISGUSTING PLACE

224
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,500
WITH NOTHING TO DO
BUT PHYSICAL TRAINING?

225
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,375
IT WAS LIKE LIVING
IN THE BOWELS OF HELL.

226
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,958
BUT ONCE I KILL YOU,

227
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,416
THOSE DAYS OF TORTURE
WILL BE OVER FOREVER.

228
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,208
FIVE CLICKS UNTIL THE END.

229
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,666
FOUR, THREE,

230
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,666
TWO... ONE.

231
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,875
- WHY, YOU--

232
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,875
- ( grunts, yells )

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,916
IT'S TRUE WHAT I WAS TOLD
ABOUT THIS GUY--

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,083
HE'S A COMPLETE CHICKENSHIT.

235
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,250
- ( groaning )
- MERYL?

236
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE SHOULD GO AFTER HIM.

237
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,916
- SOMETHING'S WRONG...
WITH VASH.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,291
- WHAT?
- THE WAY HE'S BEEN ACTING.

239
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,583
- ( chattering )
- Man: WHAT?  WHAT HAPPENED?

240
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,291
- Man #2: LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
ATTACKED THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

241
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,583
- WAS IT FRIENDS OF THAT GUY
IN JAIL TRYING TO SET HIM FREE?

242
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,416
- Vash: STAY AWAY FROM ME!
- WHOA!

243
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,541
- RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
COMING THROUGH!

244
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,333
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GET NEAR ME!

245
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,333
TAKE COVER UNTIL
I'M SAFELY OUT OF TOWN!

246
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,958
I'M NOT KIDDING! IT'S A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH HERE!

247
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,541
- IT'S THE GUY!
- VASH THE STAMPEDE!

248
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,750
- ( gun clangs )
- I SAID GET DOWN!

249
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,083
- ( screams )

250
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,458
- SORRY, GRANDPA!
- HUH?  WHAT THE-- OH!

251
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,750
- HUH?
- NO PEEKING!

252
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,791
- THAT PINHEAD
ARROGANT LITTLE TWERP!

253
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,583
DOES HE ACTUALLY THINK
HE CAN GET AWAY FROM ME

254
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,791
AND KEEP UP THIS PACE?

255
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,291
- Vash: RUN!
RUN OR I'LL SHOOT!

256
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,750
- YEAH, RIGHT, HOTSHOT.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

257
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,208
- IDIOTS.
I WARNED YA.

258
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,208
- STILL HELPING OTHERS
EVEN AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

259
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,750
YOU ARE WEAK. IF YOU HAVE ANY
EXPECTATIONS OF STAYING ALIVE,

260
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,041
YOU'D BETTER USE THEM
AS A SHIELD.

261
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,250
BUT DON'T WORRY,
IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON, ANYWAY.

262
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,625
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

263
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,958
- ( gun clangs )
- ( gasps )

264
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,375
- NOW'S THE END
OF VASH THE STAMPEDE!

265
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,500
YOU AND THIS TOWN
DIE TOGETHER!

266
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,291
- ( silent )

267
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,750
- ( gun firing )
- ( explosions )

268
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,000
- ( groaning )

269
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,041
( breathing shakily )

270
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
- ( sighs )

271
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,416
( laughing )

272
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,375
I DID IT!
I DID IT!

273
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,291
SO MUCH
FOR THE LEGENDARY OUTLAW!

274
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,250
HE WAS NOTHING.
HE DIED LIKE A COWARD.

275
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,916
AT LAST.
AT LAST I'M FREE!

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
NOW I CAN LIVE
THE WAY I WANT TO LIVE!

277
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,083
( laughs )

278
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,625
- ( gunfire )
- ( yelps )

279
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,666
( groaning )

280
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,083
Monev's voice: THIS-- THIS
MUST BE A NIGHTMARE.

281
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,083
THOSE EYES.

282
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,250
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
IN THE EYES OF THE DIABLO.

283
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
- ( gun cocks )

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,625
- ( yells )

285
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:59,166
- ( pants ) HE DID GO
THIS WAY, DIDN'T HE?

286
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,541
- YES.  HUH?  OH.

287
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,458
MR. VASH!

288
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,541
- STAY BACK!
- ( gasps )

289
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,791
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

290
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,666
- WHO IS HE?
THAT'S NOT VASH.

291
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,958
THAT IS NOT THE SAME MAN.

292
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,666
HE'S WALKING AWAY.

293
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,125
IF WE LET HIM LEAVE NOW,
HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER COME BACK.

294
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,500
- I DON'T THINK WE CAN STOP HIM.

295
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,583
THE WAY HE'S ACTING,

296
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,625
I DON'T THINK ANYONE
CAN STOP HIM RIGHT NOW.

297
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE WAY HE SHOT AT ME.

298
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,416
ISN'T HE SUPPOSED
TO BE SO SPINELESS

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,958
THAT HE'S UNABLE
TO KILL A FLY?

300
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,416
HE WAS LIKE
THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

301
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
HE SHOWED
HIS TRUE NATURE TO ME.

302
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,583
BUT I STILL
HAVE TO TAKE HIS LIFE.

303
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,000
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

304
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,250
- Man: WAIT!  WAIT!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

305
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,208
- Vash: I NEED TO USE
YOUR SAFE.  OPEN IT.

306
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,250
- Man: BUT SIR, I CAN'T-- I--
- ( gun clicks )

307
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,833
- Vash:
HURRY!  THERE'S NO TIME!

308
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,875
( gun clicking )

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,958
- TWO SHOTS LEFT.

310
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,708
HOW CAN I DO THIS?

311
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,083
- ( laughs )
I SEE YOUR PLAN.

312
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,958
YOU'RE GONNA USE
THE BIG SAFE AS A SHIELD.

313
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,750
I'LL MUTILATE YOU!

314
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,000
( shouts, grunts )

315
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,375
- ( pants )
- ALONG WITH THAT VAULT DOOR!

316
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,458
- ( clicks, explodes )
- WHAT?

317
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,916
YOU HAVE
NO MORE BULLETS, COWARD!

318
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,416
- ( whines, cocks )

319
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,000

( groaning )

321
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,000
Monev's voice: A HIDDEN GUN?
WHY DIDN'T HE USE IT BEFORE?

322
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,000
HE COULD'VE SHOT ME THEN.

323
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,083
- ( footsteps )
- YOU'LL PAY.

324
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,916
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.

325
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,000
HUH?

326
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,333
- THEY'RE DEAD.
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

327
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,208
- WHO THE HELL CARES?

328
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,750
( grunts, screams )
- ( cocks )

329
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,333
YOU KILLED ALL THE PEOPLE!

330
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,250
YOU KILLED THEM ALL!

331
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,875
- ( groaning )
- AND YOU WERE THE ONE

332
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,958
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THEIR DEATHS!

333
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,250
- ( screaming )

334
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,750
- NOW YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO DIE!

335
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,416
- DON'T KILL ME!

336
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,083
PLEASE!  DON'T KILL ME.

337
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,000
I'M SORRY!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

338
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,500
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!
PLEASE!

339
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,125
DON'T KILL ME!
NO NO, I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

340
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,083
( screaming )

341
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,875
- ( Rem's voice, echoing )
ARE YOU AWAKE NOW?

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,125
- YEAH, BUT I WAS DREAMING, REM.

343
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,250
EVERYTHING--

344
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,500
EVERYTHING WAS
SO HORRIBLY DRY,

345
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,041
EVEN PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

346
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,458
FROM FAR AWAY, AS I WATCHED
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE,

347
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,666
I ALWAYS
FOUND MYSELF WONDERING

348
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,083
HOW AND WHY COULD
THEY POSSIBLY KEEP ON LIVING?

349
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,708
WHAT MOTIVATION DID THEY HAVE

350
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,750
THAT WOULD GET THEM UP
EVERY DAY NO MATTER WHAT

351
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,041
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?

352
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,791
- ( Rem laughing )

353
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,458
- REM, WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

354
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,250
- IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO SERIOUS,

355
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,083
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING.

356
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,916
YOU'LL TURN
INTO AN OLD MAN VERY QUICKLY

357
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,750
IF YOU KEEP ON CONSTANTLY
PONDERING LIKE THAT.

358
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,666
I'M EXCITED TO THINK
THAT THE TICKET I WAS HANDED

359
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,875
ON THE DAY OF MY BIRTH
WAS COMPLETELY OPEN.

360
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,750
THE CHOICES WE MAKE IN LIFE
HAVE UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES.

361
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,833
ALL I CAN DO
IS THINK ABOUT THEM.

ROUTINE REPORT, DATE: JULY 20th.

380
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,125
TWO DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT
CAUSED BY A MAN NAMED MONEV,

381
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,125
TENSION STILL
RUNS HIGH IN THE CITY.

382
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,708
THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THERE

383
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,416
MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING
ALL OVER AGAIN--

384
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,625
IT'S AN AWARENESS
WHICH BECOMES OBSCURED

385
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,083
AS I KEEP REGULAR CONTACT
WITH HIM--

386
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,000
THAT BEING THE REASON
VASH THE STAMPEDE

387
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,916
IS CALLED
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON.

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,458
YET I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND--

389
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,958
WHY IS IT THAT SO MUCH TROUBLE
FALLS INTO THIS MAN'S LAP?
