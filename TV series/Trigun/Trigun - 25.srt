1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,833
- Rem: VASH?  VASH.
( echoes )

3
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,250
WAKE UP, QUICK.

4
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:48,291
OH, VASH.

5
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,875
- WHAT, REM?

6
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,458
( groans )

7
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,666
WHERE THE HELL AM I?

8
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,958
( gasping )

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,583
( gasping )

10
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,916
WHAT HAVE I--

11
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,375
WHAT HAVE I BECOME?

12
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,208
- Meryl: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

13
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,416
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE MADE IT
OTHERWISE.

14
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
- Man: THINK NOTHING OF IT.

15
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,541
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE,

16
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,916
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK.
- Meryl: I WILL.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,750
THANK YOU AGAIN.

18
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,250
( gasps )

19
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,041
- OH, YOU'RE AWAKE.

20
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,833
WELL, ALREADY
THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

21
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,375
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY.

22
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,791
I'LL FIX YOU SOME SOUP.

23
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,291
- WHERE ARE WE?

24
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,291
- IT'S A SMALL VILLAGE

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,375
ABOUT 200 ILES
FROM THE TOWN OF LR.

26
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,750
THERE'S A LOT OF
VERY KIND PEOPLE

27
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,958
LIVING IN THIS TOWN.

28
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,375
THEY LET US
STAY AT THIS HOUSE

29
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,833
SO WE COULD CARE
FOR YOUR WOUNDS.

30
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,916
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,833
YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP
SINCE WE ARRIVED, 

32
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,583
FOR 10 DAYS STRAIGHT NOW.

33
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,083
HERE.

34
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,166
IT'S MY OWN RECIPE.

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,875
DRINK UP.
IT'S GOOD FOR HEALING.

36
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,125
- I REMEMBER.

37
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,375
I REMEMBER ALL OF IT.

38
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,083
- OH, HEY, I ALMOST FORGOT.
I NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE.

39
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,625
I BETTER HURRY.

40
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,166
I'LL BE BACK LATER, 'KAY.
SEE YA.

41
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,250
MAKE SURE YOU DRINK 
ALL YOUR SOUP, OKAY?

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,958
- ( door closes )

43
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,125
- OH, VASH.

44
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,708
- ( Vash cries )
- ( exhales )

45
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,375
- ( Vash wailing )

46
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:29,166
( screaming )

47
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,625
- Old man: MISS MERYL.
MISS MERYL?

48
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,333
- HUH?
- HOW IS YOUR FRIEND DOING?

49
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,833
IS HE FEELING ANY BETTER?
- OH, MUCH BETTER.  THANK YOU.

50
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,416
HE FINALLY REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS.

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,041
IN FACT, IF HE KEEPS HEALING
AT THIS RATE,

52
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,625
HE SHOULD BE UP AND ABOUT
REAL SOON.

53
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,625
- THAT'S WONDERFUL, DEAR.
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

54
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,875
- ( rumbling )

55
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,375
- HUH?!
- OH, DEAR!

56
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,500
- ( screams ) HUH?
- Milly: OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

57
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,291
( embarrassed giggle )

58
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,166
MR. VASH IS AWAKE?

59
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,500
GEE, MERYL,
THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.

60
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,416
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

61
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
YOU MUST BE EXCITED.

62
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,916
UH-- OH, YEAH.
THAT REMINDS ME.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,791
HERE YOU GO.
IT'S TODAY'S WAGES.

64
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,333
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, MILLY.

65
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,583
MAKING YOU DO
ALL THE WORK BY YOURSELF,

66
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,750
IT'S NOT FAIR.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

67
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,833
I ALWAYS WORKED
THE FIELDS AT HOME.

68
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,291
AND BESIDES, BY KEEPING BUSY,

69
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,583
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT MY PROBLEMS.

70
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,291
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,541
- THAT'S GOOD.
INCIDENTALLY,

72
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,875
HOW IS THE WELL
COMING ALONG ANYWAY?

73
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,750
- NOT TOO BAD.
ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE,

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,916
IT LOOKS LIKE WE SHOULD REACH
THE UNDERGROUND WATER VEIN

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,125
IN ABOUT ONE WEEK.

76
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,750
- WELL, LET'S SPLURGE
ON DINNER TONIGHT.

77
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,958
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- WOW, DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

78
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,000
- ( bell clinks )

79
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,583
- Shopkeeper:
THANKS, COME AGAIN.

80
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,250
- Milly: YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, MERYL?

81
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,875
THIS PLACE KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF MY HOMETOWN.

82
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,541
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

83
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,833
YOUR HOME IS
ACTUALLY LIKE THAT?

84
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,125
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S JUST A QUIET,

85
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,583
PLAIN, ORDINARY
LITTLE VILLAGE,

86
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,250
BUT IT WAS
A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE

87
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,416
BECAUSE MY WHOLE 
FAMILY WAS THERE.

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,916
- YEAH, FAMILY.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,916
HUH?

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,250
- WHAT IS IT, MERYL?

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
- THAT MAN UP THERE.

92
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,583
- Vash: HE'S OUT THERE.

93
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,208
I KNOW KNIVES
IS RIGHT OUT THERE.

94
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,666
THE ONE I'VE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR IS SO CLOSE,

95
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,416
BUT...

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,583
- THEN JUST ANSWER ME
ONE THING.

97
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,250
WHAT IN THE HELL
DO YOU INTEND TO DO

98
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,916
ONCE YOU'VE ACTUALLY
FOUND KNIVES?

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,625
- MANY YEARS AGO,
HE STOLE SOMEONE 

100
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,416
WHO WAS VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,250
- SO YOU WANT REVENGE.

102
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

103
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,791
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

104
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,791
- I SEE.

105
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,750
SO THAT'S HOW YOU LIVE.

106
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,166
THAT'S HOW
YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE.

107
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,916
- Vash: WOLFWOOD.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,583
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WHEN I SEE HIM?

109
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,000
I ACTUALLY KILLED A MAN
WITH MY OWN HAND.

110
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,250
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY
SAY TO HIM?

111
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,541
I'M NO DIFFERENT.

112
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,375
( cries )

113
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,166
REM.

114
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,333
REM.

115
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,791
I'M SO SORRY, REM.

116
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,208
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

117
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,166
NOW I'M A SINNER TOO.

118
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,958
( cries )

119
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,708
- Meryl: VASH?

120
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,208
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP HERE?

121
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,625
YOUR WOUNDS HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO HEAL YET.

122
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,541
OH, VASH, TAKE IT EASY.

123
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,708
YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE.
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,000
- ( forced ) 
I HAVE TO GO.

125
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,958
- GO WHERE?
WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO

126
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,125
IN THAT CONDITION?

127
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,291
- TO REM.

128
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,083
I HAVE TO GO SEE REM.

129
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,291
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

130
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,583
YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE.

131
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
- I HAVE TO GO
TO WHERE REM IS.

132
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,583
I'M GOING.

133
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,416
- COME ON, YOU HAVE
 TO SNAP OUT OF IT.

134
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,791
- YOU HAVE TO LET US HELP.
- LET GO OF ME.

135
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,583
NOW I CAN NEVER GO BACK.

136
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,208
I REALLY KILLED SOMEONE.

137
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,916
I SHOT HIM DEAD.  I DID!
I TOOK HIS LIFE.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,791
- BUT, VASH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

139
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,583
- I'M ENDING LIVES.
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER CHOICE.

140
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,750
THERE HAD TO BE ANOTHER WAY.
I JUST DIDN'T SEE IT IN TIME

141
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,833
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

142
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,250
REM SAID SO.

143
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,291
THERE HAD TO BE A WAY.

144
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,083
REM, PLEASE TELL ME.

145
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,541
DID I HAVE--

146
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
- WAIT, VASH, YOU CAN'T.

147
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,208
VASH!

148
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,458
I DON'T KNOW, MILLY.

149
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,250
MAYBE FOLLOWING HIM WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA, AFTER ALL.

150
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,416
- HMM?
- IF WE HADN'T FOLLOWED HIM,

151
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,750
HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO MAKE
SUCH A TERRIBLE CHOICE.

152
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
AND THINGS MIGHT HAVE
TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.

153
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,083
AND THEN...

154
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,083
HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN HURT.

155
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,833
HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO SUFFER LIKE THIS.

156
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,583
I JUST CAN'T STAND IT.

157
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,833
- YOU'RE WRONG, MERYL!

158
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,416
THE ONLY REASON
YOU FOLLOWED VASH

159
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,666
IS BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

160
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,875
IT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED ANYWAY.

161
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,041
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TAKING A STAND

162
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,208
AND ACTING WITH YOUR HEART?

163
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,083
WELL, LIKE MY BIG BIG SISTER
ALWAYS SAID,

164
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,125
"NEVER HOLD BACK
IN MATTERS OF THE HEART."

165
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
- GEE, MILLY.

166
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,541
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE
THAT MAKES THE DECISIONS NOW.

167
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,041
- HUH?
- OH, NOTHING.

168
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,750
NEVER MIND.
FORGET WHAT I SAID.

169
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,250
ALL RIGHT, MILLY.
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING.

170
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,916
SO PREPARE TO WORK
YOUR BUTT OFF TOMORROW.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,625
- ( giggles )
OKAY, MERYL.

172
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,333
- OW!
( hisses )

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,625
( sighs )

174
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,625
NOW, VASH, YOU TAKE CARE OF
THE HOUSE WHILE WE'RE GONE.

175
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,583
- SEE YOU LATER.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

176
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,541
SINCE WE'VE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF HIM,

177
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,958
MR. VASH LOOKS A LITTLE
HAPPIER NOW, DON'T YOU THINK?

178
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,791
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
HE DOES.

179
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,625
- ( meows )
- ( gasps )

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,416
- HEY, THERE.
YOU'RE AWFULLY LATE.

181
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
- YOU CAN ONLY SAY THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.

182
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,541
BE GLAD.

183
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,916
YOU GUYS PROBABLY
AREN'T AWARE OF THIS,

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,416
BUT A WHOLE LOT
OF WEIRD SHIT

185
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,125
HAS BEEN GOING ON
AROUND HERE LATELY.

186
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,958
- DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN?

187
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,291
- MASS DISAPPEARANCES
IN 12 TOWNS

188
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,583
WITH NO TRACE OF THEM.

189
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,958
LR'S ONE BIG WAR ZONE
AND MY FAMILY'S MISSING!

190
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,583
- I HAD NO IDEA.

191
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,833
- THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY
PEACEFUL TOWN LEFT.

192
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,083
THERE YOU GO.
- HEY, THANKS A LOT.

193
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,291
- FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM.
- OH YEAH.

194
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,750
TWO GIRLS JUST SHOWED UP
IN TOWN WITH HIM.

195
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,791
THAT WAS ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO.

196
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,875
POOR FELLOW WAS
IN HORRIBLE SHAPE,

197
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,416
SHOT FULL OF BULLET HOLES.

198
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,916
IT'S AMAZING HE SURVIVED.

199
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,000
- ( driver gasps )

200
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,041
- WHERE HAVE I SEEN HIM?

201
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,291
- Driver: COME ON!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

202
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,791
- HUH?  WHAT'S UP
WITH THE SHOUTING, SIMON?

203
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,458
- JUST GET IN
THE DAMN TRUCK!

204
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,750
- WHAT'S THE RUSH? WHY ARE
WE LEAVING IN SUCH A HURRY?

205
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,000
- THAT WAS
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

206
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,250
- HUH?

207
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,041
- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

208
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,375
THAT BLONDE GUY SITTING THERE

209
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,416
WAS DEFINITELY
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON.

ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU
LEAVE HERE AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

244

IS IT POSSIBLE THIS GUY
ISN'T HIM?

THAT GUY TO BE SUCH A WUSS.

00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,083

DON'T KILL HIM.

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,083
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

284
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,416
HE FOUGHT TO
PROTECT EVERYONE.

285
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
I BEG YOU,
PLEASE DON'T KILL HIM.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,333
HE JUST CAME HERE TO HEAL.

287
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,708
HE WASN'T GOING
TO HURT ANYONE.

288
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,166
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

289
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,916
- OH, MERYL!
- COULD A NORMAL HUMAN BEING

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,958
DO ALL THOSE
HORRIBLE THINGS?

291
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,416
HE HAD TO BE THE ONE!

292
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,125
WHO ELSE COULD HAVE
BEEN RESPONSIBLE?

293
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,750
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG.
- THEN TELL ME WHY...

294
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
( cries )

295

WHY THE HELL DID STEVEN
HAVE TO DIE

296
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,708
SUCH A HORRIBLE DEATH, HUH?

297
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,083
ANSWER ME!

298
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,208
ANSWER ME.

299
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,041
- I'VE--

300
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,500
I'VE WATCHED HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

301
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,125
SO I KNOW.  IT'S TRUE
THAT HE CAN'T AVOID FIGHTING,

302
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,666
BUT THIS MAN
KNOWS HOW TO LIVE,

303
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,375
TO LIVE LIKE
A DECENT HUMAN BEING.

304
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,083
- SHOOTING HIM
WON'T HELP ANYONE.

305
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,291
- ( gasps )
- DON'T FEED ME YOUR GARBAGE!

306
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,208
WE HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SHOOT THIS MONSTER

307
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,208
FOR EVERYTHING HE'S DONE.

308
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,791
WE LOST FRIENDS, FAMILIES,

309
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,750
NEIGHBORS,
AND EVEN CHILDREN!

310
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,208
WE SHOULD HATE THIS BASTARD

311
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,541
AND NOW HE DESERVES TO DIE.

312
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,833
- BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

313
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,125
NO ONE EVER HAS THE RIGHT

314
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,791
TO TAKE THE LIFE
OF ANOTHER PERSON.

315
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,208
NO ONE.

316
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,583
NO ONE EVER HAS THE RIGHT
TO TAKE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.

317
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:32,041
NO ONE.
AND EVERYONE--

318
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,375
EVERYONE DESERVES A FUTURE.

319
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,625
- OH, REM.

320
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,750
- DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S TRUE?

321
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,791
- WAIT, STAY BACK.

322
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,958
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID STAY BACK!

323
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,333
- PLEASE.

324
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,791
PLEASE, IT'S TIME TO STOP
THE FIGHTING NOW.

325
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,166
- WHY?

326
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,416
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?
PLEASE GET BACK.

327
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,833
- IT'S UP TO US TO END
THE CYCLE OF HATRED.

328
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,916
IF WE DON'T WORK TO END
THE SORROW THIS TIME,

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,416
THEN THE CYCLE OF PAIN
WILL JUST CONTINUE ON.

330
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,958
WHEN WE WERE ALL BORN,

331
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,625
WERE ANY OF US
MADE TO STEAL 

332
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,916
OR CAUSE OTHERS HARM?

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,041
- ( gasps )

334
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,875
- ( silent )

335
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,583
- HOW COULD YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN SO RECKLESS?

336
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:48,208
- YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I WANT CRITICISM FROM.

337
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,458
- AND BESIDES,

338
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,250
WHAT WE DID WAS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE.

339
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,166
AND I'M SURE--
I KNOW IN MY HEART

340
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,458
THAT HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
TO DO THE SAME.

341
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
- YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME
THE ANSWER.

342
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,416
- HUH?

343
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,083
- THAT'S IT,
IT'S GOTTA BE.

344
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,291
- HEY, WAIT.
UH...

345
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

346
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,458
- PEOPLE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT
WAYS OF THINKING.

347
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,958
EVEN IF A MISTAKE IS MADE,

348
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,041
AS LONG AS A PERSON
REALIZES THEIR MISTAKE,

349
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,333
IT'S POSSIBLE TO
MAKE IT RIGHT AGAIN.

350
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,250
AND IF YOU KEEP
YOUR VISION CLEAR,

351
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,541
YOU'LL SEE THE FUTURE.

352
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,583
THIS IS WHAT
ONE MUST REALIZE.

353
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,125
RIGHT, REM?

354
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,416
- I HATE TO ASK, BUT HOW LONG
ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO THIS?

355
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,083
- OH, THIS IS A GREAT DAY!

356
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,333
- UGH.

357
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,791
- ( laughs )
- LET ME GO!

358
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,416
LET GO OF ME, HEY.

359
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,125
- ( laughing ) 
- ( screaming )

360
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,083
- ( thuds )
- ( growls )

361
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,833
- HEY, I'M INJURED,
REMEMBER?

362
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,916
THE RED FLOWER
REM LOVED,

363
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,375
THE GERANIUM.

364
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,458
IN THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS,
IT MEANS

365
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,416
"DETERMINATION."
- ( gun cocks )

366
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,125
- Knives: I MADE IT.

367
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,625
THIS ONE'S YOURS.

368
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,333
- YOU'RE GOING,
AREN'T YOU?

369
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,833
- YEAH.

370
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,458
I'M FEELING A LOT
BETTER NOW.

371
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE OKAY.

372
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,750
- SEE YOU LATER.
GOOD LUCK.

373
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,208
- THANKS.

374
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,041
AND THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING.

375
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,541
- UH...
- Milly: MR. VASH!

376
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,375
- HUH?
- OVER HERE.

377
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,583
( laughs )

378
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,541
- BUT WAIT A MINUTE,
ISN'T THAT--

379
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,083
- I WANT YOU TO
TAKE THIS WITH YOU.

380
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,041
I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE
MR. WOLFWOOD HAPPY. 

381
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,541
IN FACT,
IT WOULD HONOR HIM.

382
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,916
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,833
- I AM.

384
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
- ( metal clanking )

385
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,125
- WOW, THIS IS PRETTY HEAVY.

386
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,291
- YEAH, IT IS.

387
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,583
OF COURSE IT'S HEAVY.

388
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,041
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S FULL OF MERCY.

389
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,166
- WELL, TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELVES.

390
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,791
BYE.

391
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,083
- Meryl: I COULDN'T.

392
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,291
( cries )

393
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,791
I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO HIM.

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,291
- WELL, YOU CAN TELL HIM
EVERYTHING WHEN HE GETS BACK.

395
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,208
YOU CAN GO NUTS ON HIM.

396
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,458
- ( wind rushes )

397
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,041
- VASH, TAKE CARE OF KNIVES.

398
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,666
- I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

399
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,416
IT WAS THE LAST THING
SHE TRIED TO TELL ME.

400
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,958
I WILL NEVER GO WRONG AGAIN.

401
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,500
HUMANS ARE SURVIVORS.

402
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,125
SO I WILL
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

403
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,166
I'LL SAVE KNIVES.

404
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,166
- ( end theme playing )

405
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

406
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:16,708
- Vash: THAT DAY, THAT TIME,
130 YEARS AGO,

407
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,583
WE WERE BORN,
WEREN'T WE?

408
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,458
THERE WAS NOTHING 
BUT PEACEFUL DAYS.

409
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,583
AND REM WAS ALWAYS
CLOSE BEHIND US.

410
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,666
BUT OUR DISAGREEING THOUGHTS

411
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,916
CHANGED EACH OF OUR
WAYS OF LIFE, DIDN'T THEY?

412
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,666
I DON'T REGRET IT.

413
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,583
I WILL VOW ONCE AGAIN
NOT TO KILL,

414
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,500
NOT TO BETRAY,
BUT TO FIND HAPPINESS,

415
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,791
TO TALK ABOUT MY DREAMS

416
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,583
BECAUSE THE TICKET
TO THE FUTURE

417
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,708
IS ALWAYS BLANK.
