00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,250

WE'LL BE STUCK HERE WITH
THIS CARAVAN FOREVER!

TAKE IT EASY, FELLA.

17
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,166

NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,500
SHOULD I BUTT THIS GUY IN THE
HEAD AND MAKE A BREAK FOR IT?

19
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,916
AH, NO NO!
I CAN'T DO THAT!

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,916
WHAT AM I THINKING? I'M A
MAN OF GOD, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,750

DANCING LESSONS.

24
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,833
HUH? ALL RIGHT,
BACK TO REALITY HERE!

25
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,375
WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO?!

26
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,750
- Milly: WHAT? YOU
DON'T HAVE PUDDING?!

27
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,208
- A SIMPLE LOOK AROUND
WILL TELL YOU WE DON'T SERVE

28
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,416
THAT KIND OF STUFF HERE.

SORRY, MISSY.
- I JUST ASKED FOR PUDDING!

30
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,458
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SO RUDE.
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

31
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,916
- HEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,583
- HEY, MR. PRIEST.
WHAT A PEASANT SURPRISE!

33
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,583
- "PLEASANT."
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

34
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,208
DON'T TELL ME YOU GUYS
ARE TRAVELING WITH THIS CARAVAN.

35
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,583

MR. VASH ARE HERE WITH ME!

36
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,583

00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,333

00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,083
- MEOW.

NEXT TO MY KNIGHT, BUDDY?

41
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,791

00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,583
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT

47
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,083
THE REST OF MY FARE IS RIDING
ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS GAME?

48
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,083
YOU TRYING TO GET ME THROWN OUT?
- OH, I GIVE UP!

49

- WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

50
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,583
OH. I'LL BE DAMNED.

52
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,041

ALL OF THESE FOR ME,

53
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,166
MR. WOLFWOOD.

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,833
- ( laughs )
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.

55
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,833
YOU SAVED MY BACON,
CHESS MASTER!

56
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,250
- I GUESS I'M GOOD AT CHESS.
MY BIG BROTHER USED TO MAKE ME

57
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
PLAY CHESS
WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

58
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,416
- A BIG BROTHER, HUH?

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,125
GEE, THAT MUST BE NICE.
ANY OTHER SIBLINGS?

60
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,583
- NO, BUT THERE'S
10 BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

61
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,625
- UH-HUH, YOU'RE
THE YOUNGEST, AREN'T YOU?

62
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,125
- YEAH! WOW, HOW
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

63
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,666
- SOMETIMES THE ANSWERS
JUST CRASH DOWN FROM HEAVEN.

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,916
- ( panting )
OOH!

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,041
- HMM?

66
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,416
- HEY, AREN'T YOU
THE DANCING GIRL FROM BEFORE?

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,916
- HUH?

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,416
- I NEED YOUR HELP.
PLEASE, DON'T LET THEM FIND ME!

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,750
- HOLD IT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

70
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,375
- ( Milly laughs )
- HMM?

71
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,750
- HEY, BUDDY!

72
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,791
A DANCING GIRL JUST
CAME THROUGH HERE!

73
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,000
WHICH WAY DID SHE GO?
- IS SHE IN TROUBLE?

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,208
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION!
- HUH!

75
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,041
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
RELAX, MISTER.

76
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,916
YOU'LL FIND HER HIDING
RIGHT BEHIND ME.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,666
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,666
- HUH? WHAT THE HELL?

79
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,791
- I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION.

80
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,916
NOW I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY
FAIR YOU ANSWER MINE.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,875
- FAIR OR NOT, THIS AIN'T GOT
NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU!

82
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,708
- ( yells )
- HUH?

83
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,375
- OH!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

84
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,708
- THAT HAPPENED TO BE MY CAN
OF PUDDING AND YOU WASTED IT!

85
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,666
- WHOO-WEE!
- ( gunshots )

86
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,166
- ( groaning )

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,000
- YOU SHOULD NEVER GET BETWEEN
PEOPLE AND THEIR PUDDING.

88
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,500
- BUT YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO DROPPED THEM, YOU KNOW?

89
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,250
- UM, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

90
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,958
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

91
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,750
- Man: I HEARD GUNFIRE
FROM OVER THERE!

92
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,041
- Man #2: GET ALL
THE GUYS TOGETHER.

93
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,583
WE CAN'T LET HER ESCAPE.

94
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,458
THERE SHE IS!

95
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
- ( laughs )
- HMM?

96
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,916
- GEE, YOUNG LADY.
YOU'RE ENORMOUS.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
ARE YOU EXPECTING
SEXTUPLETS?

98
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,166
- ( laughs )

99
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,958
ISN'T IT LOVELY
OUT TODAY, HONEY?

100
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,250
- ( groans )
EXCRUCIATINGLY PLEASANT, HONEY.

101
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,958
- I AM REALLY SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

102
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,458
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST STAY OUTTA SIGHT.

103
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,666
- DID YOU SEE HER?
- NO, NOWHERE.

104
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,916
- SHE COULDN'T HAVE GONE
TOO FAR. JUST FIND HER!

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,125
- RIGHT!

106
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,416
- ( thinking )
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

107
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

108
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,250
I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET INTO
TROUBLE WITH THIS GIRL.

109
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,000
HEY!

110
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,666
- SECONDHAND SMOKE IS BAD
FOR THE BABY, DARLING.

111
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,250
- HA HA, OH YEAH!
GEE, SORRY ABOUT THAT, HONEY!

112
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,125
- HMM. IT'S BEEN AGES
SINCE MILLY LEFT

113
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,958
TO GO BUY WHATEVER
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.

114
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,958
WHAT ON EARTH IS
KEEPING THAT GIRL SO LONG?

115
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,291
I'M REALLY GETTING
TIRED OF WAITING. HUH?

116
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,916
- HEY, MISTER, IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU'RE VASH THE STAMPEDE?

117
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
- Dancer: I'M SO SORRY
FOR CAUSING YOU ANY TROUBLE.

118
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,625
- Milly: IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE
TO LEND A HELPING HAND.

119
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,375
- Wolfwood: SINCE I'M ALREADY
IN THIS SO DEEP,

120
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,916
WILL YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,791
- ACTUALLY, I'M--
- ( gunshot, screams )

122
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,125
- WHO DID THAT?!

123
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,208
- GET AWAY FROM MOORE!
- WHAT THE--

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,166
- JULIUS, STOP SHOOTING!
- HUH?

125
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
- THESE PEOPLE HELPED ME!

126
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,125
I'M SORRY I'M LATE!
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT LATE.

127
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,416
- MOORE!
- JULIUS!

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,541
- WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
- ( laughing )

129
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,375
- ( gurgling, hissing )

130
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,833
- Moore: JULIUS AND I HAVE BEEN
FRIENDS SINCE CHILDHOOD.

131
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,666
BUT HE'S THE SON OF THE OWNER OF
THE BIG TRANSPORTATION COMPANY,

132
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,041
WHICH PASSES THROUGH
DEMISLAD,

133
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,875
AND, WELL, I'M JUST
A SIMPLE DANCING GIRL.

134
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,250
- YEAH, BUT WHY
ARE THEY AFTER YOU?

135
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,583
- Julius: IT'S FONDRIQUE.

136
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,041
- WHAT? DO YOU MEAN FONDRIQUE
AS IN THE BIG CITY FONDRIQUE?

137
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,416
- FONDRIQUE CITY'S
TRANSPORTATION NEEDS

138
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,750
HAVE BEEN LEFT SOLELY
TO MY COMPANY, TO MY CARAVAN.

139
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,833
UNFORTUNATELY THE SECURITY
OVER THERE IS SO TIGHT,

140
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,750
I CAN'T EVEN GET IN
WITHOUT A PASS.

141
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,583
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
SITUATION.

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,583
- Vash: SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR YOUR PASS?

143
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,000
- NO, I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON.

144
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,625
ALTHOUGH HE'S ACTUALLY
NOT MY REAL SON.

145
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,083
- MY SO-CALLED FATHER

146
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,583
JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE
THE MAYOR OF FONDRIQUE.

147
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,291
AND THE CARAVAN
NEEDS ME BECAUSE

148
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,708
I'M THE ONLY PASS THEY HAVE
LETTING THEM INTO THE CITY.

149
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,208
- ( gasps )

150
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,916
- SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY
AFTER YOU AND NOT HER?

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,458
THAT'S STILL NO REASON
TO RUN AWAY LIKE YOU DID.

152
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,916
RUNNING AWAY IS NOT GOING
TO SOLVE ANYTHING.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,666
- Moore: BUT WE DO
HAVE A REASON!

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,291
OH.

155
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,708
- I RAN AWAY THE DAY
I DISCOVERED

156
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,416
THAT MY REAL FATHER AND THE MAN
I THOUGHT WAS MY FATHER

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,541
WERE DOING
SOMETHING DESPICABLE.

158
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,916
SURE, FONDRIQUE DID
USE THE CARAVAN

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,583
TO IMPORT CARGO ALL RIGHT,

160
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT THEIR CARGO

161
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,583
WASN'T ALWAYS IN BOXES.

162
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,750
- Man: NOW, COME HERE.
WE BOUGHT YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS.

163
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,458
- WE OWN YOU.
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

164
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,458
- ( woman crying )
LET GO OF ME!

165
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,541
MOTHER! MOTHER!

166
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,583
- THEY TREAT PEOPLE
LIKE THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY.

167
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,916
THAT'S THE WAY THEY WERE
ABLE TO GET SO RICH.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,916
- HORRIBLE.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,291
- WELL THEN, AM I RIGHT IN
ASSUMING THAT SHE'S SUPPOSED

170
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,625
TO BE THE NEW CARGO?

171
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,208
- THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON
WE HAD TO RUN AWAY.

172
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,708
WE CAN'T GO ON
LIVING LIKE THIS!

173
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,125
- PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

174
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,416
I NEED YOU TO GET
MY JULIUS BACK FOR ME.

175
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,750
WITHOUT HIM, ALL TRADE
WILL STOP COMPLETELY.

176
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,625
IT'LL BE THE END OF THIS
CARAVAN. WE'LL NEVER SURVIVE.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
- $$20 MILLION.

178
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,666
THAT'S MY PRICE AND IT'S NOT
UP FOR NEGOTIATION.

179
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,708
- HUH? 20 MILLION?!

180
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,833
THAT IS LUDICROUS!

181
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,125
- THEN FIND SOMEONE
ELSE TO HELP YOU.

182
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,083
- ( groans )
ALL RIGHT, IT'S A DEAL THEN.

183
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,916
I'LL PAY YOUR PRICE.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,583
HOWEVER, I NEED TO ASK YOU
FOR ONE OTHER CONDITION.

185
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,916
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,250
FOR HELPING MOORE
GET AWAY FROM THOSE MEN.

187
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,500
LET'S GO.
- SO WHERE ARE YOU HEADED NOW?

188
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,125
- SOMEPLACE WHERE
WE CAN BE FREE.

189
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,958
- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
PLANNING TO GO THAT WAY.

190
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,000
YOU'LL BE KILLED!
- THE CARAVAN PEOPLE

191
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,750
ARE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THE
LAND SURROUNDING THIS AREA.

192
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,500
BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T
DARE FOLLOW US THROUGH THERE.

193
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,750
- Wolfwood: EVEN IF IT MEANS
THE END OF THE CARAVAN?

194
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,458
- OH?

195
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,958
- IF YOU LEAVE, THEY LOSE
THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE CITY,

196
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,500
THE CARAVAN GOES UNDER
AND EVERYBODY DIES.

197
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,791
- ANY CARAVAN THAT'S
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE

198
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,833
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT

199
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,250
SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO SURVIVE.

200
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,083
I HOPE FONDRIQUE
GOES UNDER TOO!

201
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,416
- ( gasps )

202
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,750
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

203
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,416
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
DIE BECAUSE OF YOU!

204
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,666
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

205
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,458
IT'S ALL SO EASY FOR
YOU TO SAY BECAUSE

206
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,583
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY
FROM IT. SAY THAT

207
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,166
AFTER YOU WATCH THEM DIE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

208
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,333
WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO MAKE YOUR ESCAPE

209
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,791
OVER THE BODIES
OF THE DEAD?

210
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,958
- WE'VE MADE UP
OUR MINDS TO DO THIS

211
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,250
AND IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

212
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,916
- THAT'S TRUE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,166
( sighs )
- All: HMM?

214
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,000
- MR. PRIEST!

215
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,208
- ...HOWEVER,

216
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,000
THE FEWER SACRIFICED,
THE BETTER.

217
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,958
AM I RIGHT?

218
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,250
- THE FEWER SACRIFICED,
THE BETTER.

219
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,291
AM I RIGHT?

220
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,375
- MR. PRIEST.

221
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,916
- Wolfwood:
YOUR FREEDOM OR THE LIVES

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,541
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CARAVAN?

223
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,250
IT'S PLAIN TO SEE
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT.

224
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,791
I'LL CHOOSE FOR YOU.

225
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,291
- ( gasps )
- IF YOU DO DECIDE TO LEAVE

226
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,916
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO DIE.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,958
WELL, CAN YOU DO IT? ARE YOU
STILL ABLE TO JUST RUN AWAY?

228
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,833
- ( Moore sobs )

229
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,916
- I'M WAITING
FOR YOU TO SHOW ME

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,916
HOW DETERMINED YOU ARE.

231
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,916
- I DON'T THINK
LEAVING'S A GOOD IDEA.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,125
HEY, I'M NOT KIDDING!

233
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,500
- HUH.

234
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,000
- ( all gasp )

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,958
- THANKS A LOT.

236
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,958
- I DON'T WANT YOUR THANKS.

237
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,458
I ASKED YOU AN
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

238
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,083
I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE
AN ANSWER

239
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,583
AND I STILL THINK THAT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG.

240
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,625
- THAT'S TRUE,
BUT WE STILL WANT TO THANK YOU.

241
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,208
- UH-- MMM.

242
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,000
- YOU'RE GOING WITH THEM?

243
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,583
- I CAN'T JUST
IGNORE THEM, CAN I?

244
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,625
- IF YOU'RE DOING IT
OUT OF SYMPATHY, FORGET IT.

245
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,500
IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM AND THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM.

246
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,958
- I'M GOING BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
MY BIG SISTER TOLD ME TO DO.

247
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,666
WHEN PEOPLE NEED HELP,
IF I CAN, I HAVE TO HELP THEM.

248
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,333
OKAY?

249
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,291
- SHE DOES EVERYTHING I CAN'T,
LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.

250
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,625
IT'S REALLY IRRITATING.

251
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,625
- HOT HOT HOT HOT
HOT HOT HOT HOT!

252
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,708
- YOU REALLY SHOULD
BE MORE CAREFUL!

253
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,208
IF IT GETS ON YOU,
IT WILL LEAVE TERRIBLE SCARS.

254
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,833
- YOU MUST GO BACK, PLEASE!

255
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,083
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER

256
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,250
BY COMING WITH US.
- OH, YOU KNOW,

257
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,250
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.

258
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,333
BESIDES, THEY SAY
JOURNEYS ARE SOCIAL SCARS

259
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,541
THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR LIFE.

260
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,541
- YOU SHOULDN'T JOKE
ABOUT A THING LIKE THAT.

261
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,958
- HUH?

262
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,500
- ( laughs ) YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY FUNNY, MISS, UH...

263
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,750
- MY NAME IS MILLY THOMPSON!

264
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,791
- WHAT DID THAT MAN
ASK YOU TO DO?

265
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,041
IT'S NOTHING NASTY, I HOPE?

266
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,416
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

267
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,791
( yelps )

268
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,333
- ( all panting )

269
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,000
- LOOK OUT!

270
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,750
- ( screaming )
- JULIUS! MILLY!

271
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,208
- ( pants )

272
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,041
- MILLY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

273
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,208
- IT WAS A LITTLE HOT,
BUT I'M FINE NOW.

274
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,250
- I FEEL SO POWERLESS!

275
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,958
MAYBE HE WASN'T MY REAL FATHER,
BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT,

276
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,125
I LOVED HIM ANYWAY.

277
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,333
THAT'S WHY I
WANT HIM TO STOP!

278
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,125
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE LIKE THIS,

279
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,666
KNOWING THAT MY
SUCCESS DEPENDS

280
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,250
ON THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS!

281
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:57,375
IT'S ALL SO CRAZY. MY ACTIONS
ARE MAKING EVERYONE SUFFER.

282
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,208
AND NOW I'M DRAGGING
YOU INTO IT.

283
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,416
MAYBE THE PRIEST
WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL.

284
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,625
- BUT I'M FINE, REALLY.

285
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,333
- Man: THERE THEY ARE!
- ( gasps )

286
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,125
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP
THIS AND SAY SOMETHING?

287
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,166
( growls, grunts )

288
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,250
ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU TALK TO ME!

289
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,625
- HE WANTED A KILL.

290
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,916
- A KILL?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

291
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,458
- AND YOU ACCEPTED?
- YES.

292
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,375
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A
DESPICABLE OUTLAW,

293
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,625
JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

294
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,208
VERY WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

295
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,125
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO EXECUTE
RISK PREVENTION PROCEDURE.

296
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,833
( huffs )

297
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
WOULD YOU MIND AT
LEAST EXPLAINING WHY

298
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,583
YOU DECIDED TO DO THIS?

299
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,541
- AFTER THEM!
- DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY!

300
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,791
- OW, MY BACK.

301
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,166
- Moore: JULIUS!
- RUN, MOORE, RUN!

302
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,000
- I CAN'T!
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU!

303
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,125
- Julius: MOORE!

304
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,958
- JULIUS!
- AHH.

305
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,166
- IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO STOP RUNNING!

306
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,208
- IS THAT MY FATHER'S ORDER?

307
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,208
- ACTUALLY, IT'S THE ENTIRE
CARAVAN'S DECISION.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,125
- ( moaning )

309
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,875
- HEY, STOP!
STOP IT NOW!

310
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,916
YOU WIN.
I'LL GO BACK.

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,958
- BUT YOU CAN'T! WE'VE COME THIS
FAR, YOU CAN'T JUST GO BACK NOW.

312
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,583
- MILLY'S RIGHT! YOU'VE
GOT TO LISTEN TO HER.

313
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,875
DON'T GIVE UP, JULIUS!

314
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,750
- ( sighs )

315
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,500
- COME ON, IT'S TIME TO GO BACK.

316
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,791
- ( sobs )
- OH, JULIUS.

317
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,375
- ( crashes )
- ( man screams )

318
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,083
- AHA! MR. PRIEST!

319
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,125
- ( sighs, groans )

320
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,458
- PRIEST, I'M GONNA
PUMMEL YOU--

321
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,416
GUH!
- AHHH!

322
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,583
- MOORE!

323
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,375
- LORD, WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

324
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,250
- Milly:
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

325
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,708
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,791
- I DON'T KNOW. GUESS I WAS
INFECTED BY YOUR NOSINESS.

327
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,500
( thinking ) I THINK I
ACTUALLY CAUGHT IT FROM VASH.

328
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,291
WELL NOW,
LOOKING FOR A FIGHT?

329
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,291
THEN YOU'D BETTER
EXPECT NO MERCY!

330
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,000
HUH?

331
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,666
- LOOK.

332
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,583
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

333
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,541
- NO WAY.
WAS HE HIRED BY MY FATHER?

334
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,875
- PLEASE, YOU GOTTA
HELP US, VASH!

335
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,833
- Man: FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE CARAVAN!

336
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,000
- HUH?

337
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,791
- ( both gasp )

338
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,041
- ( gasps )

339
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,083
- HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

340
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,541
- YEP.
AND GOD IS MY WITNESS.

341
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,375
- ( gasps )
MOORE!

342
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,166
- ( groans )
- ( shouts )

343
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,250
- ( screams )

344
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,166
- NO-OOO!

345
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,000
- BUT-- BUT YOU SHOT JULIUS.

346
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,166
- IT'S ALL OVER.
OUR PASS IS DEAD.

347
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,958
- HEY! IT WAS NEVER PART
OF THE AGREEMENT TO KILL HIM.

348
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,416
- YOUR BOSS HIRED ME
TO STOP THEM.

349
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,958
HE NEVER MENTIONED
THEIR SAFETY.

350
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,250
I'VE FINISHED THE JOB. NOW
LEAVE THE MONEY AND GET LOST.

351
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,625
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

352
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,541
- DON'T DO IT! ARE
YOU SUICIDAL?!

353
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,291
- I THINK WE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE HERE, GUYS.

354
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,041
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE
TO SOMEONE LIKE HIM FOR HELP!

355
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,291
- HE'S JUST LIKE THEY SAID.
HE'S GONNA KILL US ALL AS WELL!

356
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,666
- ( whimpering )

357
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,375
- NOW HE'S REALLY DONE IT.
HUH?

358
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,333
- HOW COULD... HOW COULD...

359
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,041
HOW COULD HE DO THIS?

360
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,958
HOW COULD YOU EVEN
THINK OF DOING

361
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,375
SUCH A HORRIBLE EVIL THING?!

362
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,041
- MILLY.
- HMM?

363
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,750
OH, MERYL.

364
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,375
MERYL!
( sobbing )

365
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,708
THEY'RE GONE! I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT, HE SHOT THEM BOTH.

366
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,083
HE SHOT THEM, MERYL.
I WATCHED THEM BOTH DIE.

367
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,541
- YOU WANT TO SETTLE WHAT WE
STARTED BACK IN MAY CITY?

368
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,000
COME ON!

369
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,000
THAT WAS A REALISTIC
PERFORMANCE.

370
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,583
PRETTY TOUGH TO KILL

371
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,958
WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING
WITH RUBBER BULLETS.

372
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,166
- ( gunshot )
- ( yelps )

373
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,458
HEY, DON'T FIRE THOSE SO CLOSE!
THAT STINGS!

374
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,375
- OH, THANK GOODNESS!
THANK GOODNESS!

375
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,458
- Meryl: I HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM YOUR FATHER.

376
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,416
HE SAYS HE'S SORRY
FOR DECEIVING YOU.

377
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,583
AND THAT EVEN THOUGH
IT'S NO EXCUSE, HE ONLY DID IT

378
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,750
BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING
YOU AND THE CARAVAN.

379
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,125
- I UNDERSTAND.

380
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,375
- OH, AND THERE'S
ONE OTHER THING.

381
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,750
HE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU
YOU ARE NOW FREE TO GO.

382
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,541
- FATHER...
- JULIUS!

383
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,208
- I'M NOT SURE
HOW TO THANK YOU.

384
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,250
- DON'T THANK ME,
HE'S THE ONE THAT DESERVES IT.

385
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,125
- HEY, YOU FORGOT THIS!

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,416
- NOW QUICKLY, YOU'VE GOTTA GO
BEFORE THEY SPOT YOU.

387
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,791
- HUH-UH.

388
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
FROM THIS POINT ON,
WE'RE GONNA GO ON LIVING

389
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,333
WITHOUT RELYING ON ANYONE.
IT'LL BE JUST THE TWO OF US.

390
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,041
- ( laughs )
- WELL, MILLY,

391
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,333
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, OKAY?

392
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,208
- Wolfwood:
AND THUS, YOUR NAME

393
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,041
IS BEING SPREAD ACROSS
THE PLANET EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

394
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,333
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT
THEY CALL KARMA.

395
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,416
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

396
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,791
- Wolfwood:
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL, ISN'T SHE?

397
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,916
SHE'S REALLY GOOD.
- YES, SHE IS.

398
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,333
- ( thinking )
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,

399
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,958
ARE JUST LIKE HER.

400
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,708
- WHAT? YOU MEAN HE'S REALLY
LEFT FOR GOOD THIS TIME?

401
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,208
- ALL OF LIFE'S JOURNEYS
COME WITH MEETINGS

402
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,666
AND PARTINGS AND REUNIONS.

403
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,833
- OH, I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

404
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,666
- Wolfwood: I'VE GOT THINGS
TO DO, SO I'LL BE GOING NOW.

405
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,083
- Vash: WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

406
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,250
AND BESIDES,
WHENEVER I LOOK AT YOU,

407
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,750
I'M REMINDED OF EVERYTHING
I HATE ABOUT MYSELF.

408
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,750
YOU KNOW, IT HURTS.

409
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:24,750
- NICHOLAS D. WOLFWOOD...

410
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,250
- ( thinking )
I'LL BE DARNED.

411
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,666
ALL ALONG I THOUGHT THERE
HAD TO BE A SACRIFICE.

412
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,125
BUT THERE WAS
ANOTHER ANSWER AFTER ALL:

413
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,458
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

414
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,625
- ( theme music playing )

415
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,000
( singing in Japanese )

416
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,083
- Vash: ALL PEOPLE
HAVE A SANCTUARY

417
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,958
WHICH MUST NEVER BE TOUCHED,

418
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:20,083
A SCAR OF SADNESS WHICH
MUST NEVER BE TREAD UPON.

419
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,416
THE COOPERATION FORMED BY
THE LIVING TO REALIZE A DREAM

420
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,583
OR ACHIEVE AN IDEAL.

421
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,750
THE MAN WITH THE WHITE COAT
TOLD ME IN A QUIET VOICE

422
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,458
THAT HE HAD FINALLY FOUND ME,
THAT HE WANTED MY LIFE.

423
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,416
THAT MAN SMILED A SMILE
DEEPER THAN DARKNESS.

424
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,541
LEGATO BLUESUMMERS,
THE MAN FASCINATED BY DEATH,

425
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,625
ONLY SPOKE QUIETLY.
