00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,583
- Wolfwood:
I PICKED UP MY FIRST GUN

8
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,416
AT THE AGE OF SEVEN,

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,583
AND I SHOT.

10
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,750
I REMEMBER HOW
STRANGELY EASY IT WAS

11
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,416
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,666
I ACTUALLY LAUGHED.

13
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,416
BECAUSE THAT ONE SHOT

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,458
WAS ALL IT TOOK
TO FINALLY SILENCE

15
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,583
THAT SICKENING
PIECE OF GARBAGE

16
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:09,458
WHO HAD THE NERVE
TO CALL HIMSELF MY GUARDIAN.

( chuckles )

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,583
IT WAS THAT SIMPLE.

19
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,916
AND SO,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,583
I WAS FREE.

21
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,250
YES, TOMORROW THINGS
WOULD BE DIFFERENT. 

22
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958

TOMORROW.

23
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,791
AS MUCH I WANTED
TO BELIEVE,

24
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,791
IT ONLY WENT FROM
BAD TO WORSE.

25
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,875
A VICIOUS CYCLE.

26
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,916
- Chapel: LIFE IS LIKE AN
INCESSANT SERIES OF PROBLEMS.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,666
ALL SO DIFFICULT

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,333
WITH BRUTAL CHOICES
AND A TIME LIMIT.

29
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,583
THE SINGLE WORST THING
WE CAN DO

30
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,250
IS TO MAKE NO CHOICE

31
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,333
WHEN WE'RE WAITING FOR
THE ANSWER TO COME TO US.

32
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,875
YOU MUST MAKE THE BEST DECISION
IN A SPLIT SECOND.

33
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,750
WE ARE NOTHING LIKE GOD.

34
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,583
NOT ONLY ARE
OUR POWERS LIMITED,

35
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,583
WE SOMETIMES ARE DRIVEN
TO BECOME THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

- Wolfwood: I DIDN'T WANT
OTHER KIDS TO GROW UP LIKE ME,

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,416
SO I STARTED
MY OWN ORPHANAGE.

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,083
IT WAS GRATIFYING WORK.

39
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,166
I WAS ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING
FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS.

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,458
IT WAS MY PLACE OF
PEACE AND HAPPINESS.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,625
YET SOMETIMES,
I STILL THINK TO MYSELF:

42
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,916
THERE'S NO PLACE WORSE
THAN THIS PLANET.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,625
IT'S HORRIBLE HERE.

HOW CAN YOU ENJOY THIS?

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,750
- AW, SHIT.

49
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,291
THIS THING'S FILTHY.

( exhales )

51
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,458

HE WASN'T GONNA SHOOT ME.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,583
- Wolfwood: PLEASE. PLEASE
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

54
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,791
THERE ARE EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES

55
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

- YOU STILL NEED SOME WORK.

62
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,083
IT'S NOT HEALTHY
TO HESITATE,

63
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,333
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU DO,

64
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,583
YOU WEAR DOWN
A LITTLE MORE OF YOUR LIFE.

65
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,583
I'M SURE I TOLD YOU
THAT BEFORE, HAVEN'T I?

66
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,583
- WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE?

67
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,416
- APPARENTLY,
YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,750
WHY, NICHOLAS?

69
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,583
- I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
WITH A REAL TROUBLEMAKER.

70
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,458
- IT'S NOT WISE TO DROWN
IN EACH OTHER'S PAIN.

71
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,458
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO KILL THIS MAN NOW.

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,791
- BUT KNIVES SPECIFICALLY
TOLD ME TO BRING HIM BACK ALIVE.

73
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,500
THE ORDER WAS NOT
TO DESTROY HIM.

74
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,500
- I'M AFRAID THAT ORDER
HAS BEEN RETRACTED.

75
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,833
- WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?

76
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,125
- DON'T WORRY.
IT WILL BE PAID AS PROMISED.

77
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,666
FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH YOUR MISSION,

78
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
AND I GUARANTEE THE LIVES
OF YOUR PRECIOUS

79

DECEMBER ORPHAN CHILDREN

80
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,916
UPON THE HOLY NAME OF
THE CHAPEL OF THE GUNG-HO GUNS.

81
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,791
AND AS OF NOW,

82
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,916
YOU TOO, MY FRIEND,

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,750
ARE ALSO A GUNG-HO GUN.

84
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,083
Chapel: DEAL WITH
THE SITUATION AS INSTRUCTED

85
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,958
AND YOU WILL INHERIT
MY TITLE.

89
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,958
- THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME,

90
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,916
IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WAS
THE ONE WHO KILLED THE KID.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,583
DAMN IT,
I'LL TAKE THE BLAME.

92
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,916
HIT ME IF YOU NEED TO.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,916
THEN MAYBE AT LEAST I CAN--

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,666
- Milly: MR. PRIEST?

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,166
OH, GOOD.  I WAS HOPING
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

96
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,791
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE HUNGRY,

97
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,250
SO MERYL AND I
MADE YOU SANDWICHES,

98
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,208
AND I'D BE VERY HAPPY
IF YOU'D EAT THEM.

99
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,500
OH, YEAH.  AND YOU TAKE
YOUR COFFEE BLACK, RIGHT?

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,166
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU
SAID ANYTHING?

101
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,333
- ANYTHING?

102
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,916
- ABOUT THE KID I
KILLED THE OTHER DAY.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,625
- OHH.

104
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,083
OH, I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

105
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,666
I'M SO CONFUSED.

106
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,541
BECAUSE WHAT
YOU SAID WAS RIGHT,

107
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,458
AND WHAT MR. VASH
SAID WAS TRUE TOO.

108
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,916
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE. 

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,250
- Wolfwood:
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

110
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,416
- I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

111
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,583
- THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

112
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,583
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM.

113
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,541
EVEN IN SUCH AN
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION,

114
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,916
HE KEEPS SAYING
THAT NOBODY HAD TO DIE.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,250
HOW CAN HE BELIEVE THAT?

116
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,541
( sighs )

117
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,916
- THAT'S THE WAY
MR. VASH HAS ALWAYS BEEN.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,958
I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE
WATCHED HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

119
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,958
HE'S LIVED BY THAT RULE
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

120
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,500
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM.

121
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,750
- "THOU SHALT NOT KILL,"
REMEMBER?

122
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,416
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF
CHURCH MAN ARE YOU ANYWAY?

123
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,416
COME ON.

124
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,666
- I'VE LIVED MY LIFE
VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM HIM,

125
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,166
AND I GUESS I HAVE TO
ACCEPT THAT.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,916
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GUIDE HIM. 

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,458
I WAS ORDERED
TO PROTECT HIM.

128
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,500
IT WAS MY JOB
TO BE THERE FOR HIM.

129
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,916
BUT THE MISSION, 
THE OBLIGATION...

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,583
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

131
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,916
I HONESTLY WANTED
TO SAVE HIM,

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,916
EVEN IF IT MEANT
KILLING A CHILD.

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,583
I ACTUALLY WANTED
TO SAVE HIM.

134
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,291
I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE.

135
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,291
I HAD TO CHOOSE
ONE OR THE OTHER.

136
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,291
( crying )

137
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,916
IT'S SO STRANGE.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,583
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

139
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,583
I'VE ALWAYS CHOSEN
THE RIGHT PATH... 

140
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,250
HAVEN'T I?

141
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,541
( crying )

142
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,250
( sighs )
THANK YOU.

143
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,250
YOU'RE SO KIND.

144
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,250
- Milly:
YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH.

145
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,583
PLEASE EAT THE SANDWICHES.

146
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,458
- Wolfwood: WILL YOU PLEASE
EAT THEM WITH ME?

147
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,541
- MILLY'S SO LATE
GETTING BACK TO HER ROOM.

148
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,833
- I DON'T KNOW.

149
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,791
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

150
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,125
WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?

151
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,458
REM...

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,208
- Wolfwood: ARE YOU LEAVING
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE?

153
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,250
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HIT YOU THE OTHER DAY.

154
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,250
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

155
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,250
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,583
MAYBE THERE WAS A WAY OUT
OF THAT PROBLEM. 

157
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,916
MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE--

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,041
- SHUT UP!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

159
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,583
- ( gasps )

160
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,250
- OUR LIVES ARE
TOO DIFFERENT, VASH.

161
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,125
YOU AND I WERE
DESTINED TO COME TO THIS.

162
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,583
IT'S PART OF WHO I AM.

163
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,791
LONG AGO, WE STARTED
A QUICKDRAW TOURNAMENT.

164
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
WE'RE GOING TO
SETTLE IT AT LAST.

165
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,791
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

166
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,250
- WHY AT THIS TIME?

167
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,291
- IF I TELL YOU,
WILL YOU AGREE TO DIE?

168
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,958
DRAW.

169
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,291
DRAW!

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,583
- OKAY,
I'LL DO THAT FOR YOU.

171
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,916
BUT IN RETURN,
WILL YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,791
- YEAH, WHAT?

173
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,458
- WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER
AND I'M DEAD,

174
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,291
YOU WON'T EVER SHOOT
ANYONE AGAIN.

175
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,041
- ( rock music playing )

176
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,916
- WHEN THIS IS OVER
AND I'M DEAD,

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,416
YOU DON'T EVER
SHOOT ANYONE AGAIN.

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,791
- YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO BECOME A LIVING TARGET

179
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,708
LIKE YOU ARE?

180
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,875
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO
YOU PLAN TO GET OUT OF

181
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,125
THIS PREDICAMENT, HUH?

182
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,833
- I DON'T KNOW.

183
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,166
- THEN ANSWER ME ONE THING,

184
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,916
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
GOING AFTER KNIVES.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,916
WHAT DO YOU INTEND
TO DO ONCE YOU FIND HIM?

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,791
- MANY YEARS AGO,
HE STOLE SOMEONE 

187
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,916
WHO WAS VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,125
- SO YOU WANT REVENGE?

189
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

190
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,250
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

191
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,916
- I SEE.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,916
SO THAT'S HOW YOU LIVE.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,583
THAT'S HOW YOU 
CHOOSE TO LIVE.

194
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
YOU KNOW WHAT?

195
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,000
YOU'RE AN EXPERT
AT PISSING ME OFF.

196
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,916
AMAZING.
- HEY, WOLFWOOD.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,458
- ( grunts )

198
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,458
- ( gunshots )

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,916
- TAKE COVER!

200
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,708
- WHO FIRED THAT?

201
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,083
- IT MUST BE CAINE.

202
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,916
HE'S PROBABLY SNIPING
FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,083
IF WE DON'T DO
SOMETHING NOW,

204
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,250
HE WILL HIT HIS TARGET.

205
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,458
AND HE'S NOT ALONE.
- WHAT?

206
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,916
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO AFTER CAINE?

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,291
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM FINDING HIM.

208
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,916
THE OTHER ONE'S MINE.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,541
BY THE WAY,

210
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,583
I ONLY KNOW YOU 
AS THE STAMPEDE.

211
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,250
I THINK YOU CAN AT LEAST
TELL ME YOUR REAL NAME.

212
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,500
- NO WAY.

213
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,500
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
JUST SO YOU CAN GO OUT

214
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,416
AND GET KILLED TODAY.

215
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,541
- NOW DON'T BE STUPID.
TELL ME.

216
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,041
- BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

217
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,083
MY NAME'S IRRELEVANT.

218
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,583
- ( chuckles )

219
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
- ( grunts )

220
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,208
- TIME TO GET
BACK TO BUSINESS, VASH.

221
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,208
HMM?

222
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,375
- WOLFWOOD, WHY?

223
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,791
NO, DOESN'T MATTER.

224
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,958
- Meryl: MR. WOLFWOOD?

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,583
I HEARD GUNFIRE.
( gasps )

226
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,250
MILLY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

227
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,916
- ( murmurs )

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,583
I'M STAYING HERE, MERYL.

229
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,583
HE TOLD ME TO STAY HERE.

230
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,583
HE MADE ME PROMISE,

231
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,291
SO I'M NOT MOVING
UNTIL HE COMES BACK.

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,791
- GOT IT.

233
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,541
- ( grunts )

234
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041
( grunts )

235
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,000
( gasps )

236
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,958
( grunts )

237
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,458
ALCOHOL?

238
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,916
HE LED ME IN HERE!

239
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,916
- THE ONLY CLUES I HAD

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,875
WERE THE LAG TIME
BETWEEN RIFLE REPORTS

241
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,750
AND MY ROUGH CALCULATIONS
OF THE ANGLES ON IMPACT. 

242
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,041
I HAD A HARD TIME
FINDING YOU.

243
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,208
WELL, GEE NOW,

244
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,625
SINCE YOUR GUN'S
GONE TO PIECES, 

245
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,291
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD ON HOME?

246
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,625
IT'S TOO HOT OUT HERE.

247
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,500
GREAT, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE SEEING IT MY WAY.

248
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:56,958
( gasps )

249
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,666
- WHERE?

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,125
WHERE WILL HE
ATTACK FROM? 

251
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,125
( gasps )

252
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,583
OH, SHIT!

253
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,666
( grunts )

254
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,166
( groans )
- ( gunfire )

255
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,625
- ( sighs )

256
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,875
( groans )

257
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,833
( breathes heavily )

258
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,625
- SO NOW WHAT'S 
THE BEST CHOICE?

259
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,291
TELL ME.

260
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,833
IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH?

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,625
IS IT?

262
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,500
- ( exhales )

263
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
- I'M DONE.

264
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,916
THAT'S GONNA BE IT FOR ME.

265
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,916
HMM.

266
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,250
HMM.

267
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,958
NOW THAT'S TASTY!

268
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
- ( grunts )

269
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,541
THIS IS A HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME.

270
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D SO EASILY WASTE

271
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,791
THE 10 YEARS OF TRAINING
I GAVE YOU--

272
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
- ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T
WASTED AT ALL.

273
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,875
I'VE USED EVERYTHING
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME.

274
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,833
I JUST DECIDED TO DO
THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,916
MAY YOU GO WITH
GOD'S PROTECTION.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,916
OH, YEAH.
AND THANKS FOR THE APPLE.

277
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,041
- ( grunts )

278
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,625
AAH!

279
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,291
( groans )

280
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,625
AAH.

281
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,666
( shouts )

282
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,666
- HMM?

283
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,750
- ( gunfire )

284
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,583
- I FAILED.

286
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,333
I FAILED TO SAVE
SOMEONE AGAIN.

287
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,583
- MAN IS BORN
A MORTAL BEING,

288
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,750
AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

289
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,916
IT'S PART OF THE GAME.

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,125
JUST BE MORE CAREFUL
THE NEXT TIME.

291
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,291
- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT
MAKING MISTAKES LIKE THIS.

292
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,125
- THEN YOU CAN
CHOOSE TO SUFFER.

293
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,083
THAT'S ALSO A PART OF
THE EXPERIENCE OF MORTAL LIFE.

294
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,583
- OH, YEAH.  MORTAL.

295
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,833
- BY THE WAY,
KNIVES IS IN DMITRI.

296
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,458
- ( gasps )
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,916
I NEVER TOLD YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT KNIVES.

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,791
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,625
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME
BARGING IN LIKE THIS.

300
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,750
( grunts )

301
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,916
( gasps )

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,250
IN SPITE OF
THE PROFESSION I'VE CHOSEN,

303
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,916
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
MADE A CONFESSION BEFORE.

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,583
IT'S THESE TIMES
WE LIVE IN.

305
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,583
I DID WHAT IT TOOK TO PROTECT
THE CHILDREN AT ANY COST.

306
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,250
THAT'S HOW I ALWAYS
JUSTIFIED MY ACTIONS.

307
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,750
I TOOK MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES.

308
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,916
ALL THAT TIME BELIEVING
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY.

309
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
( sighs )

310
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,916
MY SINS ARE SO HEAVY.

311
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
TOO HEAVY.

312
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,291
TOO HEAVY TO EVER
ATONE FOR.

313
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,375
( grunts )

314
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,958
AND YET...

315
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,291
SOMEHOW I FEEL HAPPY,

316
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,625
AT PEACE WITH
MYSELF TODAY.

317
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,916
IT REALLY CAN BE DONE.

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,916
ONCE YOU STOP
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,250
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS
TO SAVE EVERYONE.

320
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,916
WHY DIDN'T I EVER
LISTEN TO HIM?

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,250
WHY DIDN'T I SEE THAT
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE?

322
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,916
( inhales, exhales )

323
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,916
THAT TASTES GOOD.

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,291
- YOU KNOW, CIGARETTES ARE
BAD FOR THE BABY, DARLING.

325
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,291
- Wolfwood:
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

326
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,541
IF I AM REINCARNATED,

327
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,583
I'D LIKE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE
WHERE LIFE IS EASIER.

328
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,250
SOMEWHERE WITH NOTHING
BUT PEACEFUL DAYS.

329
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,958
SOMEWHERE WITH NO STEALING,
NO KILLING.

330
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,458
EDEN.

331
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,416
IN EDEN...

332
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,916
I COULD LIVE HAPPILY
WITH HIM

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,250
AND THE GIRLS.

334
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,916
( groans )

335
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,583
I'M NOT READY YET.

336
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,416
THERE'S STILL SO MUCH
LEFT TO BE DONE.

337
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,583
I WANT TO STAY WITH THEM.

338
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,583
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

339
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,958
( gasps )

340
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,000
I'M A MAN.

341
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,333
WAS EVERYTHING I DID 
IN MY LIFE A MISTAKE?

342
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,333
WOULD I BE WRONG NOW
TO ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS?

343
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,541
I DID NOT WANT TO
DIE THIS WAY!

344
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:23,250
- ( birds chirping )

345
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,916
- ( sobbing )

346
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,375
- ( crying )

347
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,208
- ( end theme playing )

348
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

349
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,916
- Vash: REPEATED TRAGEDIES,
REPEATED PAIN.

350
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,250
THE WISHES OF A MAN
ARE SO STRONG

351
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,583
AND YET SO FRAIL AND WEAK.

352
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,916
TO LIVE,

353
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,916
TO STAY ALIVE.

354
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,791
WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
SURVIVAL WAS THIS HARD?

355
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,541
THIS PAINFUL?

356
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,250
I MUST CHOOSE.

357
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,250
I MUST MAKE THE CHOICE.

358
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,583
IN THE MOMENT THAT
INTERTWINES LIFE AND DEATH,

359
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,125
CAN I CHOOSE TO
REMAIN A HUMAN?
