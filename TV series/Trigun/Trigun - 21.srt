1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,125
( theme music continues )

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,791
- ( saxophone playing )

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,916
- YES, MASTER,
I'M IMMINENTLY AWARE OF THAT.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,916
LET ME TEACH HIM
THAT TO STAY ALIVE

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,416
IS TRUE SUFFERING.

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,541
FOR ALL ETERNITY
HE WILL PAY FOR 

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,416
THE GRIEVOUS SIN
OF INJURING YOU.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,875
HE WILL SUFFER
UNCEASING DESPAIR,

10
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,125
ANGUISH,

11
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,458
WOUNDS WHICH CAN
NEVER BE HEALED.

12
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,666
A WONDERFUL SHOW
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN,

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,083
AND YOU WILL PERFORM
AS THE STAR ATTRACTION,

14
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,000
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

15
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,791
- THREE DEMONS?

16
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,583
THREE DEMONS ARE HERE?

17
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,833
- Leonof: YES. THIS IS YOUR
COMEBACK CELEBRATION,

18
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,250
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

19
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,250
- OH, MAN.
WHAT IS THAT THING?

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,916
- HEY!  HELLO THERE.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,125
APPARENTLY YOU'RE FROM
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

22
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,583
WE'RE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE. WE
DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE WITH YOU,

23
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,750
SO IF YOU'D PLEASE--
- ( all gasp )

24
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,125
( all gasp )

25
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,375
( screaming )

26
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,125
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

27
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,791
HE'S JUST LYING THERE.

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,875
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

29
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,041
- HEY, YOU!
GET OUT OF HERE.

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,875
- ( all gasp )

31
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,750
( screaming )

32
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,083
- ( laughing )

33
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,041
- ( Leonof laughs )

34
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,250
YOU SEEM SURPRISED.

35
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,250
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS SHIP
IS EASY PREY FOR US.

36
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,250
THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS
ARE LIKELY TO BE

37
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,708
THE MOST FULFILLING
YOU HAVE EVE EXPERIENCED.

38
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,333
TEMPER, TEMPER.
- ( gasps )

39
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,750
- Leonof: YOUR EXCITABLE NATURE
WILL WORK NICELY FOR OUR GAME. 

40
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,333
( laughs )

41
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,666
- WHAT NOW?

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,416
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE SITUATION, DOC?

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,875
- Doc: Oh, Vash...

44
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,583
INTRUDERS ARE APPROACHING
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE SHIP.

45
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,208
I'M AFRAID THE ONES
WHO WENT TO CHECK IT OUT

46
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,916
have stopped reporting in.

47
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,000
- I'M GONNA DO THIS MY WAY.

48
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,000
OH, YEAH.
A WORD TO THE WISE,

49
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,250
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH
TYPICAL HUMAN BEINGS HERE.

50
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,250
IF YOU TRY PULLING
THE SAME STUNT AS BEFORE,

51
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,541
I GUARANTEE YOU

52
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,541
THEY WILL DESTROY YOU
THIS TIME.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,583
- UHH.
- HUH?

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,416
- GO STAY WITH THE DOCTOR
UNTIL THIS IS OVER.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,916
- WAIT A SECOND.
YOU MIND TELLING ME

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,333
WHAT THE HELL
THESE THINGS ARE?

57
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,958
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WE SHOULD BLAME FOR THIS.

58
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,958
- GET MOVING!

59
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,125
- ( both gasp )

60
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,333
- ( sighs )

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,916
HUH?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,625
- ( sighs )

63
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,833
- DAMN!  HOW MANY OF THESE
THINGS DO I HAVE TO SHOOT?

64
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,291
I'M WASTING BULLETS.

65
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,083
- Vash: WHERE IS HE?

66
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,916
WHERE'S THE MAN
BEHIND THE CURTAIN?

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,708
- ( screaming )

68
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,666
( screams )

69
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
- ( gunfire )

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,583
- ( gasps )

71
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,583
- ( whimpers )

72
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,583
- ( grunts )

73
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,458
AAH!

74
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,250
( grunts )

75
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,125
THE KICK FROM THIS THING
IS TOO STRONG.

76
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,291
- ( screaming )

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,791
- CONCENTRATE.

78
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,416
- I'M NOT ABOUT
TO TRUST YOU

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,791
TO DO EVERYTHING
AROUND THIS PLACE.

80
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,250
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT GOOD.

81
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,916
THEY'RE GOING AFTER
THE POWER PLANT.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,583
- ( all gasp )
- WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT?

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,416
- ARE THEY TRYING
TO MAKE US CRASH THE SHIP?

84
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,916
- VASH IS NOW OUR
ONLY HOPE AGAINST THEM.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,916
EVERYTHING NOW DEPENDS
UPON HIS SUCCESS

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,583
ALONG WITH THE HELP AND STRENGTH
OF THE PREACHER IN BLACK.

87
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,791
- I'M AMAZED THAT
A GUY AS BIG AS YOU ARE

88
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,541
ACTUALLY MANAGED
TO GET THIS FAR.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,750
HA.

90
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,458
WELL, NICE OF YOU TO POP IN.

91
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,458
I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE
A WORTHY OPPONENT. 

92
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,791
HELLO THERE.

93
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,875
DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
A WORD I'M SAYING?

94
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,750
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN TAKE OFF RIGHT NOW.

95
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,916
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,541
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

97
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,125
I WILL SHOW NO MERCY.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,916
WHAT THE--?

99
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,250
( shouts )

100
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,458
WELL NOW, THAT WAS
AN INTERESTING DISPLAY.

101
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,625
OKAY, TRY THIS.

102
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,708
SAY GOODNIGHT.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,541
- I THINK THAT'S
MOST OF THEM.

104
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,208
- YEAH.
- Doc: Vash!

105
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,708
- HMM?

106
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,958
- Doc: One of the demons is
heading for power room #2.

107
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,583
They're going to try
to bring down the ship.

108
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,583
- THAT POWER ROOM
IS SIX FLOORS BELOW US.

109
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,708
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT ALL THE
WAY DOWN IN TIME TO STOP HIM.

110
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,916
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,583
- I'M MAKING MYSELF
A LITTLE SHORTCUT. 

112
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,125
YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW THAT I
ACTUALLY STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT,

113
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,250
THIS IS REALLY KIND OF...

114
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,458
SCARY!

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,916
- THAT IDIOT.

116
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,958
- ( screams )

117
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,625
( whimpers )

118
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,625
AHH.

119
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,291
THIS IS A NEW MODEL,
ALL RIGHT.

120
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,916
PACKS A PRETTY 
POWERFUL PUNCH.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,958
HUH?

122
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,958
( gasps )

123
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,916
NO.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,583
MY FRIENDS...

125
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,125
IT CAN'T BE.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,583
VAL.

127
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,458
JONES.

128
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,916
UMERA.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,916
FARINA.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,375
I REMEMBER YOU.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,916
I REMEMBER ALL OF YOU.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,250
I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN YOU.

133
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,916
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
COME HOME SOONER. 

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,625
I--

135
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,291
I'M SO...

136
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,583
( crying )

137
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,291
( gasps )

138
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,291
( grunts )

139
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,250
- DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

140
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,083
WHAT ARE YOU
CRYING FOR? 

141
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,500
THIS ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE
YOU'RE HERE, REMEMBER?

142
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,416
I AM THE THIRD
GUNG-HO-GUN,

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,208
HOPPARD THE GAUNTLET.

144
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,583
- TELL ME WHY!

145
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,208
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL THEM?!

146
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,000
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

147
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,875
- THAT'S SIMPLE.

148
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,750
BECAUSE YOU ARE
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

149
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,791
- ( gasps )

150
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,166
- COMPARED TO WHAT
YOU DID TO JULY

151
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,375
AND AUGUSTA,

152
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,833
THIS IS A STROLL
THROUGH THE TULIPS.

153
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,916
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE ON THIS PLANET.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,750
- ( sighs )

155
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,583
- IN FACT,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

156
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,916
I'M GOING TO CRUSH YOU
WITH MY GUTTERRIER.

157
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,166
- ( gasps )

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,458
- HMM?

159
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,666
WELL, HOW'D THAT FEEL?

160
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,708
( gasps )

161
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,708
IT DIDN'T MAKE A DENT.

162
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
I GET IT.

163
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,500
YOU MUST BE
GRAY THE NINELIVES.

164
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,583
CAN'T EXACTLY SAY
I'M HAPPY TO MEET YOU.

165
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,625
I GUESS THE RUMOR OF THE MAN
WITH THE NINE EXTRA LIVES

166
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,166
ACTUALLY HAD SOME
TRUTH TO IT.

167
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,125
( gasps )

168
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,291
AAH!

169
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,833
( grunts )

170
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,333
SHIT.

171
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,875
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO DO THAT,
YOU BIG DUMB?

172
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,875
HUH?

173
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,291
GREAT.
CAN THIS GET ANY WORSE?

174
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,333
- ( grunts )

175
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,833
AAH.

176
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,125
- IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE,
THE WORD "CONTRADICT" 

177
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
IS DERIVED FROM
A BATTLEFIELD SITUATION

178
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,458
WHEN A GREAT SPEAR
AND A GREAT SHIELD

179
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,583
WERE PITTED AGAINST
EACH OTHER AND BOTH BROKE.

180
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,250
THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT
MY SHIELD IS INVINCIBLE.

181
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,416
IT WILL REPEL
ANY KIND OF ATTACK.

182
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

183
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,083
( gasps )

184
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,833
- THAT IS WHAT'S KNOWN
AS A WASTE OF TIME.

185
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,333
NOTHING CAN CONTRADICT
MY GUTTERRIER.

186
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,750
- ( grunts )

187
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,916
( groans )

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
- I HAVE ONLY THREE
IMPORTANT WORDS

189
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,125
IN MY VOCABULARY.

190
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,791
"ATTACK,"

191
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,791
"TRAMPLE,"

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,208
AND "DESTROY."

193
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,083
THESE DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME, 

194
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,958
VASH THE STAMPEDE.

195
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,416
- AAH!
( grunts )

196
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,000
( groans )

197
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,208
( grunts )

198
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:45,958
UH-OH.

199
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,458
( grunts )

200
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,416
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

201
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
THAT EXPLAINS YOUR
INVULNERABILITY.

202
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,625
THIS SIMPLIFIES MATTERS.

203
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,041
- HUH?

204
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,375
- ( cackles )

205
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,541
- ( sighs )

206
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,875
HEY, STOP SHOOTING!

207
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,250
- YES, THAT'S IT.

208
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,875
KEEP ON HOLLERING
AND MAKING THOSE STUPID FACES.

209
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,583
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.

210
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,875
- IS IT SO MUCH TO ASK?

211
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,250
YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH DAMAGE.

212
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,875
CAN'T YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE?

213
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,583
- ( giggles )

214
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,916
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I
HAD THIS DONE TO MY BODY

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,791
JUST SO I COULD LISTEN
TO YOUR PATHETIC

216
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,000
BLEEDING-HEART NONSENSE?

217
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,333
( laughing )

218
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,583
YOU'RE CRAZIER THAN
THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE.

219
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,125
I'M GOING TO 
PULVERIZE YOU

220
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,333
AND THIS SHIP INTO 
TINY LITTLE PIECES!

221
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,125
- Vash:
MUST KEEP MOVING.

222
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,333
I PROMISED HER.

223
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,375
I MUST KEEP MOVING.

224
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,041
- HUH?

225
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,250
HE'S GOT LEONOF'S WIRE!

226
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,208
( shouts )

227
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,583
- ( gasps )

228
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,125
- ( grunts )

229
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,125
( screams )

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,958
- HEY, SNAP OUT OF IT.

231
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,625
- ( grunts )
THE PLANT.

232
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,625
- OH, NO.

233
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,583
WHAT DO WE DO?

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,875
- WELL, I'M OUT OF HERE.

235
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:05,833
HUH?

236
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,416
DAMN,
YOU'RE A PERSISTENT BUGGER.

237
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,916
- ( gun clicks )

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,250
- I'M OUT OF AMMO?!

239
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,458
NOT GOOD.

240
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
THAT THING'S
WAY TOO CLOSE TO THE PLANT.

241
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:25,958
DON'T!

242
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,958
NO!

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,916
- ( both grunting )

244
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,083
- HEY, MERYL,
I THINK IT FINALLY STOPPED.

245
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,875
- YEAH.
- ( both gasp )

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
- ( meows )
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

247
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,625
IT'S A--

248
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,750
- PLANT NUMBER ONE IS DOWN!

249
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,125
THIS IS NOT GOOD.
- ( crowd shouting )

250
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,916
- THE POWER LEVELS 
OF PLANT NUMBER TWO

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
ARE ALSO DROPPING.
I CAN'T STOP IT.

252
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,916
- THE PLANT IS SHUTTING DOWN?

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
IS OUR CITY GONNA FALL?

254
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,333
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

255
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,250
WHY NOW?  WHY IN THE HELL
IS ALL OF THIS HAPPENING?

256
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,333
IT'S NUTS.
UNTIL YESTERDAY,

257
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,208
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM
WAS FIGURING OUT

258
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,916
HOW TO GET THE GIRL I LOVE
TO LOOK MY WAY.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,583
- Vash:
ARE YOU GIVING UP ALREADY?

260
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,583
- HUH?

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,416
- IT'S TOO SOON 
TO JUST GIVE UP.

262
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,916
THERE'S ALWAYS A SOLUTION IF
YOU'RE WILLING TO LOOK FOR IT.

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,583
WE HAVEN'T TRIED
EVERYTHING YET. 

264
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,458
ARE YOU JUST GONNA
ROLL OVER AND DIE?

265
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,583
'CAUSE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE,
THINK!

266
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,291
THINK OF WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

267
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,958
YOU CAN OPERATE THE CONTROLLER,
CAN'T YOU?

268
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,125
WELL, CAN'T YOU?
- YES.

269
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,666
- GOOD.

270
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,916
THEN THERE'S STILL--

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,541
STILL TIME.

272
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,250
- ( typing at console )

273
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,625
- I'M IN.
CAN YOU DO IT?

274
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,125
ANSWER ME!

275
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,833
- ( gasps )

276
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
COME ON NOW, FRIEND.

277
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,583
IT'S NOT OVER JUST YET.

278
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,583
HOLD ON JUST
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

279
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,208
I CAN HELP YOU IF YOU'RE 
WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY.

280
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,750
I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS.
PLEASE.

281
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,625
- ( exhales )

282
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,625
- ( heartbeat )

283
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,666
- ( sighs )

284
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,208
WHAT?  WHAT IS THAT?
HMM.

285
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,958
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

286
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,583
- THE PLANT!
IT'S COMING BACK TO LIFE.

287
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,791
- CHECK IT OUT.
THE POWER LEVELS ARE RISING.

288
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,458
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
AFTER ALL.

289
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,416
- ( cheering )

290
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,583
- THAT'S THE WAY.

291
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,250
TAKE IT NICE AND EASY.

292
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,958
- IT'S THE ONES THAT LIVE
OUTSIDE OF TIME.

293
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,791
- ( clanging )
- HUH?

294
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,541
- ( gasps )
- VASH THE STAMPEDE!

295
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,958
- NO!

296
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,708
( grunts )

297
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,416
- ( all screaming )

298
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,000
- ( screaming, grunts )

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
- Wolfwood: DAMN IT.

300
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,541
EVERYTHING HAPPENED
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY PLANNED IT.

301
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,916
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,208
YOU'D BETTER GET USED
TO THE IDEA THAT SOME DAY

303
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,791
YOU'RE GONNA ALL LIVE 
ON THAT DESERT PLANET!

304
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
( groans )

305
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,416
I KNEW THAT IT WAS
INEVITABLE,

306
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,125
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD BE THE ONE 

307
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,583
TO TRIGGER IT.

308
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,916
- ( gasps, murmurs )

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,958
- HMM?

310
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,958
MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

311
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,416
OH, NO.
YOU MEAN THE GIRL WE SAVED IS--

312
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,291
- THE SHIP.
- WE'RE DONE FOR.

313
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,250
WE'RE STUCK ON THIS PLANET.

314
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,916
- OUR WAY OF LIFE,
OUR PEACEFUL DAYS,

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,416
THEY'RE OVER.

316
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,333
- DAMN.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

317
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,666
- IT'S VASH.
- HMM?

318
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,416
- THIS IS ALL HIS FAULT!

319
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,916
- THAT'S RIGHT,
IT'S HIS FAULT!

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
- YEAH.
EVERYTHING WAS FINE

321
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,375
BEFORE HE CAME BACK!

322
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,875
- FORGIVE ME.

323
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,750
- YOU THINK THAT'LL
MAKE IT BETTER?!

324
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,458
- Brad:
ALL OF YOU, SHUT UP!

325
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,458
- ( crowd silences )

326
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,458
- THIS WASN'T BECAUSE OF HIM.

327
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,708
IT'S OUR FAULT.

328
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
WE ALL CHOSE TO
IGNORE REALITY 

329
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,291
WHEN WE KNEW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN SOME DAY.

330
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,958
WE NEVER LIFTED
A FINGER TO HELP,

331
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,958
SO WE HAVE NO RIGHT
TO POINT ONE NOW.

332
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,416
WE'VE JUST HUDDLED TOGETHER,
SHAKING IN FEAR

333
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,166
LIKE SCARED ANIMALS.

334
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,583
WE'RE STILL ALIVE,
AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

335
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,083
IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER,

336
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,375
WE CAN BUILD A DECENT LIFE
ON THIS BALL OF SAND.

337
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,916
- BRAD.

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
- Jessica: VASH!
- HUH?

339
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,208
- VASH!
- JESSICA.

340
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,916
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
WHAT A RELIEF.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,125
- THAT REMINDS ME,

342
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,458
I NEVER THANKED YOU
FOR THE NEW COAT, DID I?

343
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,666
SO THANKS.
IT FITS ME LIKE A GLOVE.

344
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,000
- GREAT.  IT LOOKS
REALLY GOOD ON YOU, VASH.

345
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,333
- SHE DOESN'T SEEM
UPSET ABOUT THE SHIP AT ALL.

346
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
GEE, SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE.

347
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,041
- ( both chuckle )

348
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,000
- Wolfwood: NEEDLE-NOGGIN!
- Both: HUH?

349
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,208
- ( gasps )
- ( gasping )

350
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,041
- GAHH...

351
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,041
- ( gasps )

352
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,750
- ( gasping )
- BRAD!

353
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,250
- ( groans )

354
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,708
- ( gun clicks )

355
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,250
- BRAD, NO.

356
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,208
BRAD!

357
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,708
- I HAVE FAILED.

358
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,958
BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

359
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,958
IT WAS A PERFECT PLAN.

360
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:40,958
HMM?

361
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,500
- YOU DEPRAVED LUNATIC!

362
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,125
THIS DAMN JOB'S
KILLING ME.

363
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,250
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY CRYING,
VASH THE STAMPEDE?

364
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,250
THAT IS WONDERFUL.
TRULY WONDERFUL.

365
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
- Vash: BRAD!

366
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,708
BRAD!  HANG ON, BRAD.

367
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,250
- ( groans )

368
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,708
- OH, BRAD.

369
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,583
- ( sighs )

370
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,750
THE ONES WHO LIVE
OUTSIDE OF TIME. 

371
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,083
IT REALLY IS AMAZING.

372
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,625
MY HANDS GREW THIS BIG
IN 13 YEARS,

373
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,958
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT. 

374
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,750
YOU'RE EXACTLY
AS I REMEMBER.

375
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,375
( gasping )

376
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,083
- ( crying )

377
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,041
- ( grunts )

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,958
( exhales )
- ( gasps )

379
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,916
- BRAD!  BRAD!

380
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,250
- ( Vash and Jessica crying )

381
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,166
- ETERNAL PAIN.

382
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,791
- ( sobbing )

383
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,000
- ( theme music playing )

384
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

385
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,625
- Vash: SELF-PROTECTION,

386
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,708
THE MEANS OF PROTECTING
ONESELF.

387
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,916
PEOPLE EXPOSE THE WEAKNESSES
WHICH PAIN THEM,

388
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,916
AND THUS FORM A GROUP.

389
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,916
BEFORE THEY KNOW IT,
THEY BEGIN TO EXCLUDE THOSE

390
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,583
WHO ARE NOT ONE OF THEM.

391
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:30,125
BUT WHAT BECOMES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED?

392
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,583
I SMILED AT THE CHILDREN
WHO LIVED IN A TIGHT GROUP

393
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,458
IN THEIR RICKETY HOUSE.

394
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,583
SURE, LET'S LIVE TODAY,

395
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,916
LET'S LIVE TOMORROW,

396
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,333
AND LET'S LIVE
THE DAY AFTER THAT,

397
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,625
EVEN IF IT MEANS
LIVING IN ETERNAL PAIN.
