DRINK THIS STUFF.

00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,875
YOU HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR IT.

11
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,041
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO THE BOOZE
TO DRINK IT LIKE THAT.

( gulps ) AH!

00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,250
I'M IMPRESSED.
HOOCH IS BRAND NAME.

WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD.

YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
BEATING YOURSELF UP.

18
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,625
IF YOU HAVE TO CALL
IT SOMETHING, CALL IT DESTINY.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,333
- DON'T TRY TO JUSTIFY IT

20
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,250
BY LABELING IT
WITH A SIMPLE WORD.

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,166
SO MANY DIED
AND THEY WON'T BE COMING BACK.

22
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,750
I CAN'T STAND IT.

I KILLED BRAD.

26
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,083
- VASH, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,875
I'M SURE THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD'VE DONE TO SAVE HIM.

28
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,291
( crying )
I'M SORRY.

29
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,500
- EVERYONE WHO TOUCHES ME
ENDS UP DYING.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
- THAT VERY WELL MAY BE,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING

31
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,916
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
AT THIS POINT.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,041
YOU'VE STILL GOT
SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU HAVE TO GO.

33
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,583
DON'T YOU AGREE?

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,916
- I AGREE.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,875
I'M NOT DONE YET.

36
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,416
WHATEVER IT TAKES,

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,625
I HAVE TO FACE HIM.

38
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,375
- Wolfwood: AH, THERE IT IS!

39
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,083
WE'RE HERE.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

40
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,208
- YAY, TEAM!

43
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,208
THAT MEANS YOU'RE HUNGRY?

44
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,541
- AMAZING. HOW COULD
YOU TELL, MR. WOLFWOOD?

45
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,375
- I KNOW ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, HONEY.

46
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,666
- WELL, FORGET IT, DEAR.

47
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,625
I'M AFRAID SEXTUPLETS ARE
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
- ( laughs )
NICE COMEBACK.

49
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,958
- ( both laugh )

50
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,458
- Meryl: VASH?
- YEAH, MERYL?  WHAT'S UP?

51
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,916
- UH, UMM... NOTHING.

52
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,416
- Wolfwood: HELLO!

53
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,291
IS ANYBODY IN THERE?

54
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,375
HELLO?

55
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,250
- WHO'S THERE?
- ( gun rattles )

56
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,166
- WE'RE POOR, UNFORTUNATE,
HUNGRY TRAVELERS

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,583
AIMLESSLY WANDERING
THE DESERT.

58
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,875
- EXCUSE ME, WOULD IT BE
ALL RIGHT IF WE CAME INSIDE?

59
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,583
- I'LL LET YOU IN...
FOR 300,000 DOUBLE DOLLARS.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,083
- OOH!
- 300,000?!

61
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,208
- EXACTLY. I SAID IT 'CAUSE
I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

62
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
IT'S MY LITTLE WAY OF SAYING

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,958
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.
- ( guns cock )

64
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,250
- WHY THE SUDDEN HOSTILITY?
WE DON'T MEAN YOU ANY HARM.

65
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,833
- YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DANGEROUS OR ANYTHING.

66
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,541
I'M MERYL STRYFE
FROM THE BERNARDELLI--

67
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,083
- ( gunshot )
 - OH!

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,583
- I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
FROM BERNARDELLI OR THE FEDS!

69
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,916
MY ANSWER IS FINAL!

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,958
YOU'RE NOT COMING IN,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

71
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,750
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT BEING
VERY FAIR ABOUT THIS.

72
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,458
- LET'S GO.
- HUH?  HOW COME?

73
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
- THEY DON'T WANT US
AND WE HAVE TO RESPECT THEM.

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,625
THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN
PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD REASON.

75
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,208
IT'S NOT JUST A WHIM.

76
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S JUST LEAVING.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,750
ISN'T HE OVER IT YET?

78
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,416
- WHAT?
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,375
- ( gasps )

80
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,291
- Vash:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,333
- NOW NOW, AREN'T YOU GOING TO
SAY THANK YOU TO THE NICE MAN?

82
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,541
- ( grunts )

83
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,791
- SAY, "THANK YOU."
COME ON, NOW.

84
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,333
- THANK YOU, SIR.

85
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,416
- NOW THAT WAS EASY,
WASN'T IT? HUH?

86
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,375
- HEY!  THERE'S ONLY
DESERT THAT WAY!

87
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,500
- LET'S GO. I THINK WE NEED
TO TAKE A LITTLE SIDE TRIP.

88
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,500
- QUIT STANDING AROUND,
WASTING TIME.

89
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- COME ON, HURRY UP.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,750
- ( Wolfwood knocks on door )

91
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,041
ANYBODY HOME?

92
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,000
- ( yelps ) WHAT?

93
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,250
- GET HIM! GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE!

94
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,750
- ( grunts )

95
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,083
HEY, WAIT! STOP IT!

96
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,750
WE'RE NOT MAD
AT YOU!  HEY!

97
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,916
WE JUST TURNED AWAY
FROM THAT TOWN LIKE YOU!

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,916
NOW WE JUST WANNA STAY HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,583
COME ON, WE WON'T HURT YOU.
I PROMISE.

100
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,000
PLEASE, JUST LISTEN TO ME.
I'M NOT ASKING FOR A FAVOR.

101
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,791
HERE, YOU WANNA TRADE?

102
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,791
- ( kids gasp, cheering )

103
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,708
- Wolfwood: HMM.
- Girl: MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!

104
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,750
- WELL, I GUESS
THIS MEANS WE HAVE A DEAL.

105
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,958
- Girl:
GO AWAY.  GIMME!

106
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,666
- MR. WOLFWOOD, THOSE ARE
OUR EMERGENCY RATIONS.

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,708
- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY,
ISN'T IT?

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,708
- EH... HUH?
- ( Vash laughs )

109
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,250
- I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.
THIS IS DEFINITELY AN EMERGENCY.

110
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,041
- ( kids chattering )
- REALLY?

111
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,291
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

112
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,583
APPARENTLY, I SEEM TO BE
OUTNUMBERED THIS TIME.

113
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,125
- Child: MMM!
- ( laughs ) YAY!

114
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,250
- MILLY?
- HUH?

115
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

116
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,625
- OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT SOME TOO, MERYL?

117
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,750
THEY'RE REALLY TASTY.
- ( laughs )

118
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,583
- GIMME SOME OF THAT!
- NO, I WANT IT, I WANT IT!

119
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,416
- Wolfwood: I SEE. SO THESE
KIDS ARE ALL ORPHANS, HUH?

120
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,291
- Boy: YEAH,
IT'S REALLY JUST A COINCIDENCE.

121
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,875
IT HAPPENED BY CHANCE WE ALL
ENDED UP GATHERING HERE

122
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,458
IN THE SAME PLACE

123
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,750
- IT'S UNUSUAL, BUT THAT SORT OF
THING HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN.

124
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,708
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
A GREAT HELP, ACTUALLY.

125
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,291
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO EAT AND
YOU CAME AT A REALLY GOOD TIME.

126
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,000
- NO BIG DEAL.
JUST LENDING A HELPING HAND.

127
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,458
- SO I WAS JUST WONDERING:

128
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,541
WHY IS IT THEY WON'T
LET YOU INTO THE TOWN?

129
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,458
- THEY WON'T LET
ANY OUTSIDERS IN,

130
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,083
EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY CHILDREN.

131
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,750
THE TOWNSFOLK ARE FRIGHTENED.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

132
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,416
- Wolfwood: WHY?
- I'M NOT SURE.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,708
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT EVERY TOWN IN THIS REGION

134
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,916
HAS BEEN ABANDONED.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,458
WELL, EXCEPT FOR KEYBAS
OVER THERE.

136
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,833
MY TOWN WAS ABANDONED, TOO,
THE SAME WAY.

137
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,750
ONE DAY WITHOUT WARNING,
EVERYONE JUST STOPPED

138
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,041
WHAT THEY WERE DOING
AND THEY BEGAN TO WALK.

139
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,291
THEY DIDN'T TAKE
A THING WITH THEM

140
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,041
AND THEY DIDN'T SAY
A WORD AS THEY LEFT.

141
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,291
- ( clatters )
- HUH?

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,583
DAD!  DAD, WHAT'S WRONG?

143
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,208
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SAY SOMETHING!

144
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,583
WHAT'S HAPPENING?  HUH?

145
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,166
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING?

146
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,000
DAD!  HUH?

147
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,208
MOM!  MOM!

148
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,000
DAD!

149
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,166
THEY ALL JUST LEFT HOME,

150
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,250
WALKED OUT OF TOWN LIKE
THEY WERE BLIND AND DUMB.

151
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,583
THEY LOOKED LIKE ZOMBIES,

152
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,791
LIKE SOMETHING WAS
CONTROLLING THEM.

153
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,083
ALL OF THE OTHERS WENT
THROUGH THE SAME THING

154
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,083
WITH THEIR PARENTS.

155
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,291
THEY ALL LEFT
AT THE SAME TIME.

156
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,833
- Vash:
TELL ME ONE THING:

157
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,458
DURING THE TIME
THIS WAS HAPPENING,

158
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,083
DID YOU SEE ANYONE OTHER
THAN THE TOWNSFOLK THERE?

159
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,416
- NO.  NUH-UH.

160
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,083
BUT ACTUALLY,
I DID HEAR A STRANGE VOICE.

161
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,583
- WHAT DID IT SAY?
- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

162
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,125
WHAT IT HAD TO DO
WITH THEM LEAVING HOME.

163
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,791
IT SAID, "THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR TAKING SO LONG."

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,375
- Vash's voice: IT'S HIM.

165
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,875
- Wolfwood's voice: BOY, HE
NEVER DOES GET A BREAK, DOES HE?

166
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,083
POOR SAP.

167
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,416
- SO WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO NOW, VASH?

168
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,083
YOU GOING IN OR WHAT?

169
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,250
- ( kids grunting )

170
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,333
- Both: HUH?

171
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,416
- Kids: HUH?
- ( Vash chuckles )

172
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,916
- ( both sigh )

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,625
- WHAT I SAY?
- NO KID IS EVER GONNA WARM UP

174
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,458
TO A GUY THAT WALKS AROUND
WITH AN EMPTY SMILE.

175
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,041
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
HAND THAT UP TO ME?

176
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,416
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO CARRY IT FOR YOU.

177
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,041
- Boy: LET'S GO.
- HUH?

178
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,291
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT KIDS WARMING UP?

179
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,666
- ALL RIGHT, SHUT UP.
IT'S JUST THAT THESE GUYS

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,125
ARE A LITTLE BIT SHY,
THAT'S ALL.

181
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,500
- ( claps )
- Both: HUH?

182
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,750
- YOU TWO ARE SO GOOD!
YOU'RE GREAT AT HELPING OUT.

183
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,041
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- ( kids giggling )

184
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,541
- Both: HUH.

185
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,333
- Meryl: SO IF YOU CUT IT
WITH A KNIFE ALONG THE TENDON

186
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,416
AT A RIGHT ANGLE LIKE THIS
AND SPRINKLE ON A LOT OF PEPPER,

187
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
IT'LL ACTUALLY LAST
A LOT LONGER THAN YOU THINK

188
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,708
AND GUESS WHAT--
IT'LL TASTE BETTER TOO.

189
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,458
- Kids: REALLY?
- HUH?

190
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,000
WOMEN ARE A MARVEL,
AREN'T THEY?

191
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,666
- THAT'S FOR SURE.

192
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,333
HEY THERE!
WHAT YOU COOKING, GUYS?

193
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,458
- Meryl: THAT'S OUR SECRET
UNTIL SUPPERTIME.

194
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,625
- Kids: YEAH!

195
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,041
- Vash: OH JEEZ, HOW COULD
YOU BE SO COLD?

196
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,958
- THAT GUY,
HE IS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

197
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,000
DIG IN, EVERYONE.
- ( laughter )

198
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,083
- Meryl: HELP YOURSELF.
- ( chattering)

199
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,375
- THIS IS YUMMY!
- DELICIOUS.  THANK YOU.

200
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,875
- HEY, DON'T SPILL IT.
- ( laughter )

201
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,208
- WELL, THEY'RE ALL
FAST ASLEEP AT LAST.

202
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,125
- I'M GUESSING IT'S A LONG TIME
SINCE THEY WERE ABLE TO RELAX.

203
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,083
- JUST LOOK
AT THOSE HAPPY FACES.

204
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,750
- ( boy crying )

205
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,250
MOMMY.  DADDY.

206
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,041
- ( door creaks, closes )

207
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,250
Vash's voice: IF I TAKE TOO
LONG, THEY'LL MAKE ANOTHER MOVE.

208
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,083
STILL...

209
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,791
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE THESE KIDS.

210
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,958
HMM?

211
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,958
- QUIT BEING SO
SERIOUS AND CHEER UP.

212
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,666
COME ON, LET'S HAVE A DRINK.

213
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,500
- HUH?

214
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,541
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

215
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,083
- ( cocks )

216
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,333
- HUH? ( screams )

217
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,666
- what was that?
- ( people murmuring )

218
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,541
- HEARD A GUN GO OFF!
- WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

219
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,416
- I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

220
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,791
- HUH?

221
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,041
- ( rock music playing )

222
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,500
- ( snoring )

223
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,666
- ( ground rumbling )

224
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,250
- ( gun rattles, cocks )

225
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,708
- ( gunfire )

226
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,833
- ( screaming )

227
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,458
- EVERYONE, GET AWAY
FROM THE WINDOWS?

228
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,041
- MERYL, WHY ARE
THEY SHOOTING AT US?

229
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,916
- I SAID GET AWAY
FROM THE WINDOWS!

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,166
- EVERYONE ALL RIGHT IN HERE?

231
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,250
- GET DOWN!

232
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,125
- ( kids crying )
- WHOA!

233
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,458
- COME ON OUT!
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

234
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,916
IF YOU AREN'T OUT HERE
BY THE TIME I COUNT TO 10,

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,166
WE'RE COMING IN AFTER YOU
AND WE WILL SHOOT TO KILL!

236
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,041
- WELL, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
- 10, NINE...

237
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,458
- ONLY WAY OUT
OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING

238
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,541
IS TO REASON WITH THEM.
- REASON WITH THOSE HOTHEADS?

239
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,875
ARE YOU NUTS?

240
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,583
CAN'T YOU COME UP WITH
ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT?

241
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,916
- ...FIVE, FOUR...
- NEVER MIND, I'LL GO ALONE.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,750
- THREE...
- ( groans )

243
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,250
- ...TWO, ONE!

244
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,208
TIME'S UP!  HUH?

245
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,541
( humphs )

246
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,125
- HI. WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT WE DID TO UPSET YOU FELLAS.

247
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,916
WE MEANT NO HARM. WOULD YOU MIND
FILLING US IN A LITTLE BIT?

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,625
- YOU'RE JUST PRETENDING
TO BE NICE TO THESE KIDS

249
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,500
FOR CAMOUFLAGE,
YOU PIECE OF TRASH.

250
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,041
I DON'T BUY YOUR CRAP
FOR A MINUTE!

251
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,916
( grunts )

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,166
- I'M REALLY SORRY,

253
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,791
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

254
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,958
- ( both grunt )

255
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,416
- DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH US, SPIKY BOY.

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,125
YOU AND YOUR PALS
ARE THE ONLY OUTSIDERS

257
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,291
ANYWHERE NEAR TOWN.

258
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,083
- WAIT, THIS IS A FALSE ALARM.
( grunts )

259
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,416
- WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

260
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,583
THIS IS ALL SOME KIND
OF TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

261
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,583
- Man: OH YEAH, YOU'RE A REAL
MR. NICE GUY, AREN'T YOU?

262
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,083
JEFFREY WAS KILLED
AND HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND!

263
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,541
- ( both gasp )
- Wolfwood: WHY YOU

264
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,083
STUPID BUNCH
OF BLUNDERING IGNORAMUSES.

265
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,083
- WAIT, STOP.
- ( groans )

266
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,375
GIVE THE GOODY-GOODY ROUTINE
A REST, WILL YOU, VASH?

267
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,916
- ( both groaning )

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,458
- PLEASE, JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

269
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,666
- YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!
- ( both gasp )

270
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,208
- YOU HAVE TO HEAR ME OUT.

271
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,500
- ( ground rumbling )
- ( all shouting )

272
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,708
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
- WHOA!

273
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,791
- WHOA, HOLD ON!
EASY EASY EASY!

274
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,916
- ( men scream )
- ( gasps )

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,750
- ( both gasp )
- Man: OH MY GOD!

276
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,500
WHAT ARE WORMS DOING HERE?

277
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,625
- ( screeches )
- ( screams )

278
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,333
- BUT WHY WOULD THEY--
- ( whimpering )

279
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,666
- WAIT A MINUTE!

280
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,791
ISN'T THIS ENTIRE AREA
MADE UP OF SOLID BEDROCK?

281
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,041
- IT WOULD HAVE TO BE.

282
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,666
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY
CAN BUILD A HOUSE ON IT.

283
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

284
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,416
- BEATS THE HECK OUT OF ME.

285
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,791
THERE'S ONE THING
FOR SURE, THOUGH:

286
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
WE'RE NOT SAFE HERE.
WE'LL DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION.

287
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,208
YOU TWO GET THE KIDS OUT.
- OKAY, UNDERSTOOD.

288
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,625
YOU WILL LET US
INTO YOUR TOWN, WON'T YOU?

289
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,291
- YEAH.

290
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,291
- ( cocks )
- NOW THAT TAKES CARE OF THEM.

291
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,333
- IT'S TIME FOR US TO GET GOING.

292
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,000
- ( clicks )

293
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,583
- HEY, GOOD LUCK.
- THANKS.

294
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,583
- ( laughing )
- Vash: OVER HERE!

295
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,250
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!
- ( screaming )

296
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,250
- ( screeches )

297
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,125
- NICE WORMIE!

298
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,833
- THEY'RE CATCHING UP,
YOU IDIOT!

299
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,833
- ( grunts )
- ( gun fires )

300
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,375
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
CAN'T I KILL THOSE EITHER?

301
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,375
- YOU CAN'T KILL THOSE, NO!
- ( screeches )

302
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,458
- WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING YOUR WAY?

303
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,333
- ( both screaming )

304
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,166
- WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

305
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,708
PRETTY WELL ORGANIZED
FOR ORDINARY SANDWORMS.

306
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,125
- YEAH, I AGREE.

307
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,083
HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

308
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,166
- SOME ROTTEN LOWLIFE
MUST BE SITTING BACK,

309
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,166
WATCHING AS THEY DO
HIS DIRTY WORK FOR HIM.

310
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,416
- DO YOU SUPPOSE...

311
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,916
- ( screeching )

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,458
- HOW DID THE WORMS
GET INSIDE THE TOWN?

313
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,458
- ( all screaming )

314
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,875
- Vash:
CLIMB THE BUILDINGS, HURRY!

315
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,208
- Women: HUH?
- IF YOU CLIMB HIGH ENOUGH,

316
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,708
THE WORMS WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET TO YOU!

317
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,666
- Meryl: RIGHT, LET'S GO!
- ( kids crying )

318
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,250
- OH!  WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU HURT?

319
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,708
- ( crying )

320
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,583
- OH.  HEY, MIKE, COME BACK.
- I'M SORRY!

321
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,916
- I'M ON IT.
- ( gun cocks )

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,916
- ( fires crackling )

323
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,583
- THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.

324
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,541
- OUR WHOLE TOWN'S
DESTROYED NOW.

325
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,833
- ( sighs )
WHERE'S MILLY AND THE BOY?

326
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,833
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE OVER WITH WOLFWOOD.

327
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,625
- YEAH, THEY'LL BE
ALL RIGHT THEN.

328
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,083
- Vash's voice:
BUT WHAT IS THIS FEELING?

329
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,125
I KEEP HAVING
THE STRANGEST SENSATION,

330
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,916
LIKE SOMETHING IS
OUT OF PLACE.

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,166
- ( rumbling )

332
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,666
( screeching )

333
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,000
- ( men screaming )

334
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,833
- DAMN. THERE ARE
TOO MANY OF THEM HERE.

335
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,083
- ( rumbling )
- ( Vash gasps )

336
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,333
- ( man screams )

337
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,333
- Milly: WAIT! ( laughs )

338
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,583
 I CAUGHT YOU
FAIR AND SQUARE, HUH?

339
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,000
- ( crying )

340
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,958
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, THERE'S
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

341
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,375
- ( humphs )
- ( worm screeching )

342
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,333
- Wolfwood: RUN!

343
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,708
- ( grunts )
- ( screeching )

344
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,208
- ( kids scream )
- ( clicks )

345
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,583
- DAMN BULLETS.

346
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,166
- ( clicks )

347
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,458
- ( high-pitched whine )

348
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,500
- THAT'S IT.

349
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,000
- ( screeches )

350
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,916
- ( gunshot echoes )

351
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,833
- ( both whimper )
- HUH?

352
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,666
- ( both gasp )

353
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,666
- WHAT HAPPENED?

354
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,500
- ( screeches )

355
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,916
- YOU WERE USING A
HIGH-FREQUENCY DEVICE

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,583
TO CONTROL THEM.

357
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,166
I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

358
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,583
THEY'RE YOUR OWN PEOPLE.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO HURT THEM?

359
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,375
- ( laughs )
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT MY PEOPLE.

360
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,291
- ( gun cocks )
- BECAUSE I AM A GUNG-HO GUN!

361
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,791
- ( gasps )

362
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,166
- I'M THE FOURTH
OF THE GUNG-HO GUNS.

363
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,291
I'M ZAZIE THE BEAST.

364
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,625
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- ( crying )

365
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,791
- ( gun cocks )
- Zazie: DON'T CRY!

366
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,875
GOD, THAT IS SO ANNOYING.

367
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,875
THIS CONFIRMS
WHY I HATE CHILDREN.

368
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,416
THEY WHINE,
THEY GET DEPRESSED

369
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,083
AND THEY'LL ONLY BRUSH
THEIR TEETH WHEN THEY'RE TOLD

370
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,333
BECAUSE THEY'RE
TOO STUPID TO DO OTHERWISE.

371
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,583
THEY COMPLETELY LACK
ANY CONCEPT OF FREE WILL!

372
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,791
- ( gunshot )
- ( clatters )

373
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,916
- Zazie: YOU PROBABLY AREN'T
EVEN CAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,583
WHY I WOULD CHOOSE TO DO
SOMETHING THIS INTRICATE.

375
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,583
- ( gasps )
- STOP IT!  NO!

376
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,625
- Boy:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BETE?

377
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,875
- MY NAME IS ZAZIE.
IT'S ZAZIE THE BEAST.

378
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,916
- YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,166
- HUH?

380
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,833
- IT'S TRUE. I SAW YOU
CRYING THE OTHER NIGHT.

381
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,083
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

382
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,791
THE DEMON HASN'T WON.

383
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,458
AT ONE POINT, YOU EVEN TRIED
TO CHEER ME ON IN SPITE OF HIM.

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,625
- WELL, THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG.

385
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,291
DEMONS CAN BLOCK
THE CONSCIOUSNESS

386
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,500
AND MEMORY ON DEMAND.

387
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,916
- Vash: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
- ( growls )

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,625
- YOU WANT IT THIS WAY?

389
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,916
YOU'RE FORCING YOURSELF.

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,083
- GOODY TWO-SHOES IDIOT!
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM!

391
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,625
- THAT'S FINE. BELIEVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

392
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,458
YOU CAN JUST DIE, THINKING
YOUR PLEASANT LITTLE THOUGHTS.

393
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,958
- STOP THIS, BETE, RIGHT NOW!
- HUH?

394
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,166
( growling )

395
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,458
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

396
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,541
- ( gasps )

397
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,333
- ( gasps )

398
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,625
- ( breathing shakily )

399
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,041
-  HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!

400
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,208
- WHY, WOLFWOOD?

401
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,500
IT DIDN'T HAVE
TO END LIKE THIS!

402
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,166
- KIDS ARE KIDS
AND THAT'S ONE THING.

403
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,000
THIS WAS NO KID.
HE WAS NOTHING BUT A DAMN DEMON.

404
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,250
AND IF I HADN'T SHOT HIM,

405
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,333
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
YOU LYING THERE.

406
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,875
- BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
HE WASN'T GOING TO SHOOT ME.

407
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,041
- I SAVED YOUR ASS
YET ONE MORE TIME,

408
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,500
AND YOU COME AFTER ME
WITH YOUR CHILDISH BULLSHIT?!

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,708
- YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE KILLED HIM.

410
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,166
YOU KNOW YOU'RE WRONG.

411
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,958
- ( both grunt )

412
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,875
- WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO I
HAVE IF WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE?

413
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,958
( gasps )

414
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,791
- Vash:
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR A PLACE

415
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,041
WHERE WE CAN LIVE
OUR LIVES IN PEACEFUL DAYS,

416
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,500
WITH NO WARS
AND NO STEALING.

417
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,750
A PLACE
THAT ISN'T RUN BY FEAR.

418
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,166
A PLACE WHERE
PEOPLE CAN LIVE

419
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,208
AND ACTUALLY TRUST
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

420
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,041
- ( scoffs )
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT!

421
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,000
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR YOUR
IDEALISTIC DREAMS RIGHT NOW!

422
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,250
- OH.

423
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,333
- ( theme music playing )

424
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,166
( singing in Japanese )

425
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:17,583
- Vash: TO REALIZE
A MISTAKE, TO NOT LIE,

426
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,166
TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
TO NOT KILL.

427
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,166
THOSE ARE VERY SIMPLE THINGS,

428
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,041
BUT THESE TIMES
WON'T ALLOW FOR THEM.

429
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,583
THERE IS NO GREEN
ON THIS PLANET,

430
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,250
EVEN THOUGH WE WANT IT,

431
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,375
AND WANT IT SO BADLY.

432
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,958
A PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIVE
PEACEFUL DAYS WITH NO WARS,

433
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,458
NOR STEALING.

434
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,083
A SACRED PLACE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN LIVE

435
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,333
AS PEOPLE.
YES, THERE.

436
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:42,875
THAT PLACE IS CALLED...
