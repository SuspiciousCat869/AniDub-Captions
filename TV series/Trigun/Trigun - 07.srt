1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,875
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,208
- ( upbeat music playing )

3
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,750
- ( chattering, laughing )

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,791
- YOU REALLY DID IT!
- YOU'RE AWESOME, MR. VASH.

5
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE DRINKING WITH THE OUTLAW

6
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,833
WHO SAVED THE CITY TWICE.

7
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,208
- OH, YEAH, HE'S A DANGEROUS
CRIMINAL, AIN'T HE?

8
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,041
- ( all laugh )

9
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,000
- COME ON, DRINK UP.

10
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,916
- ( all cheer )

11
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,125
- AH.

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,125
- ( all gasp )

13
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,541
YEAH!

14
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,625
- HI.  SO YOU ENJOYING
YOUR DRINK?

15
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,916
- UM, YES, VERY MUCH.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,083
- ( slurred )
YES, I'M DRINKING.

17
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,250
- ( softly chuckles )

18
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,125
- THAT VASH THE STAMPEDE REALLY
IS AN UNUSUAL GUY, ISN'T HE?

19
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,750
I MEAN, SURE,
EVERYBODY'S A LOT LESS TENSE

20
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,125
NOW THAT THE PLANT IS FIXED.

21
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,916
BUT THOSE ARE
THE VERY SAME PEOPLE

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,875
THAT TRIED TO KILL HIM
FOR THE REWARD.

23
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,250
YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND THEM.

24
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,416
- TROUBLE SEEMS TO FOLLOW HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
I THINK THE WORLD
WOULD BE A LOT BETTER

26
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,416
AND SAFER PLACE WITHOUT HIM.
- DON'T WORRY...

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,083
I CAN HANDLE IT.

28
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,583
I'M UNIQUE AND CAN EAT
ANYTHING I WANT TO.

29
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,125
I HAVE A SEPARATE STOMACH
JUST FOR CAKE AND ICE CREAM.

30
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,791
MM...

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,291
- YOUR FRIEND
IS ANOTHER UNUSUAL ONE.

32
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,041
- IT'S NO GOOD, HENRY.

33
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,625
- HE'S COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.
DEAD TO THE WORLD.

34
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,416
- GUESS I GAVE HIM
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,291
I'M SORRY I CALLED YOU BOTH
OUT HERE FOR NOTHING.

36
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,875
I DIDN'T THINK HE'D PASS OUT.

37
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,125
- ( girls sigh )
- ( laughs )

38
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,958
BE SURE TO SAY HI TO
SILVY FOR ME.

39
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,916
- IT'S REALLY TOO BAD,
ISN'T IT?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,458
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO SLEEP
WITH A GUY LIKE THAT EVERY DAY.

41
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,416
( sighs )
WELL...

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,916
- GOOD NIGHT, GIRLS.
- SEE YOU AROUND.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,250
- BYE.
- ( door closes )

44
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,000
- COULD I BE REGRETTING IT?

45
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,625
JUST A LITTLE?

46
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,666
- ( cheering, chattering )

47
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,166
- ( playing fanfare )

48
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,833
- WHAT?
VASH IS LEAVING?

49
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,958
- BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN
SAY GOOD-BYE.

50
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,625
- HURRY UP, MILLY!
( exhales, pants )

51
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,125
- HE JUST TOLD ME THAT MR. VASH
GOT ON THE SAND STEAMER.

52
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,750
- WHAT?!

53
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,958
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY!

54
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,958
- BYE!
- ( indistinct shouts )

55
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,916
- VASH, WAIT!

56
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,458
HEY, YOU BETTER COME BACK
AND SEE ME SOMETIME.

57
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,750
- HOW CAN YOU JUST LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE?

58
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,583
- BE GOOD TO YOUR MOM
AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE, TONIS.

59
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,458
GOOD-BYE!

60
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,458
- Kids:
BYE!  SEE YOU!

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,083
BYE!

62
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,333
- ALL RIGHT!

63
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,250
AT LONG LAST
I AM FINALLY ON MY OWN AGAIN.

64
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,666
( retches )
- AWW!  EW!

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,166
- I THINK I DRANK TOO MUCH.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,916
- WELL, HE'S A LITTLE LATE,
BUT HE'S ALWAYS LATE...

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,250
- WHAT WAS THAT GAME?
I DON'T REMEMBER.

68
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,583
- ( chatter continues )

69
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,375
- YOU VASH THE STAMPEDE?

70
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,791
YOU SURE DON'T LOOK LIKE IT.

71
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,625
- I DIDN'T CALL ANYONE
FOR ROOM SERVICE.

72
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,458
- WE'RE ABOUT TO GO
INTO LOTTENBURG CANYON.

73
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,083
- YEAH?  AND?

74
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,583
- YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

75
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,083
IT'S THE TURF OF
THE BIGGEST, BADDEST,

76
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,125
MOST NOTORIOUS GANG AROUND--

77
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,291
THE BAD LAD THIEVES.

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,791
IF I CAN GET YOU
ON GUARD DUTY,

79
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,291
I CAN CHARGE DOUBLE THE FARE,

80
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,875
AND WE'LL BOTH MAKE
SOME GOOD MONEY.

81
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,875
SAY YOU'LL DO IT.

82
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,041
- NOW, SEE HERE.
- HUH?

83
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,916
- I AM A SIMPLE PASSENGER.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,416
MY LIFE, MY SAFETY IS DEPENDING
ON YOUR SHIP'S DEFENSES,

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,541
SO DON'T LET ME DOWN.

86
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,083
- NO NO, WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

87
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,083
HEY HEY, COME ON!

88
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,416
- ( urinating )

89
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,666
JEEZ.

90
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,958
I SURE WISH I HAD CHOSEN
A QUIETER WAY TO TRAVEL.

91
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,500
NOW TO CATCH SOME MORE "Z"s.

92
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,000
( yawns )
AAH!

93
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,875
( groans )

94
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,375
( screams )
- OH, SHIT!

95
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,708
- ( groans )

96
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,166
- AAH!

97
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,125
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

98
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,416
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HURT SOMEBODY

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,750
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO APOLOGIZE?

100
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,375
LOOK AT THIS!
I'M BLEEDING.

101
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,208
- YOU GOT THAT WHEN YOU BASHED
THROUGH THE VENT, YOU BIG IDIOT.

102
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,750
- HUH?
- ( straining grunts )

103
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,875
- WHAT'S THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?
SOME KIND OF STRANGLEHOLD?

104
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,416
YOU CAN'T HURT ME WHILE
YOU'RE UP IN THE AIR, KID.

105
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,708
YOU'RE A STOWAWAY, AREN'T YOU?

106
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,666
- HUH?

107
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,958
THAT'S RIGHT I AM.

108
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,791
MY PARENTS DIED
WHEN I WAS REAL YOUNG.

109
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,000
SO I WENT TO LIVE
WITH SOME DISTANT RELATIVES,

110
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,750
BUT IT WAS SO HORRIBLE THERE.
I COULDN'T STAND IT.

111
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,916
MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD GET DRUNK
AND HIT ME ALL THE TIME.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,750
AND MY WEIRD UNCLE WAS
REALLY MEAN.

113
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,416
HE WAS ALWAYS
TRYING TO GET AT ME.

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,416
IF I CAN JUST GET TO MAY,
I CAN ESCAPE THEM.

115
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,125
IF I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THAT PLACE,

116
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'LL DO TO ME.

117
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,000
PLEASE, MISTER, PLEASE DON'T--

118
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
DON'T TURN ME IN.

119
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,416
( cries )

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,583
OH, BOY, I'M DEAD.

121
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,000
NOBODY'S DUMB ENOUGH
TO BUY SUCH A LAME STORY.

122
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,333
IT'S THE WORST ONE
I'VE EVER COME UP WITH.

123
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,458
( grunts )

124
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,125
- ( crying )
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

125
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,125
I UNDERSTAND.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN...

126
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,666
SO HARD.

127
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

128
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,208
- WHOA!  IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?

129
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,375
- Meryl: THAT'S TWO
BACON-LETTUCE DOGS,

130
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,750
TWO CARTONS OF MILK...

131
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,250
- WAIT A MINUTE.

132
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,250
- FOUR BAG OF PRETZELS
AND ONE PACK OF RAISINS.

133
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,375
- I MUST SAY,
I'M VERY CURIOUS

134
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,208
AS TO WHY YOU INSURANCE GIRLS
ARE HERE DOING THIS WORK.

135
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,541
CARE TO LET ME IN ON IT?

136
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,625
- WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY FOR A TICKET,

137
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,500
SO WE GOT A PART-TIME JOB HERE.

138
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,666
- ALL TOGETHER, THAT COMES
TO 12 DOUBLE DOLLARS

139
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,250
AND 75 "C"-CENTS.

140
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,041
- UH.  OKAY.

141
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,791
- I'M AMAZED THAT
YOU'RE STILL SO HUNGRY

142
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,833
AFTER JUST HAVING FINISHED
YOUR DINNER.

143
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,000
- YOU HAVE AN APPETITE
JUST LIKE A GROWING BOY.

144
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
- THINK SO?

145
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,958
- ( all chuckle )

146
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,500
- JEEZ, THOSE GIRLS
ARE PRETTY SHARP.

147
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,833
THE BIG ONE
IS EXCEPTIONALLY SCARY.

148
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,125
MY ONLY SALVATION IS SHE
DOESN'T KNOW HOW SMART SHE IS.

149
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,041
- HEY, VASH.

150
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,500
GUARD THIS PLACE WELL.

151
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,416
IT WASN'T EASY TO GET YOU
THAT ROOM, YOU KNOW?

152
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,583
- YOU GOT IT.

153
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,583
HELLO THERE, GROWING BOY,
I'M BACK.

154
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,583
YOUR MOUTH MAY BE SILENT,

155
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,583
BUT YOUR EYES SPEAK 
REAL LOUD AND CLEAR,

156
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,791
SAYING, "I'M STARVING!"

157
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,791
( chuckles )

158
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,791
HERE.

159
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,333
- ( gasps )

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,916
- HUH?
- ( chomping loudly )

161
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,166
- ( sighs )

162
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,375
IT'S REALLY DARK OUT THERE.

163
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,416
NOT A SINGLE LIGHT TO BE SEEN.

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,916
- OH, YEAH?

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,916
IT'LL BE BRIGHT SOON ENOUGH.

166
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,250
- ( grunts )

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,375
- SORRY ABOUT THAT,
MR. GOODY-GOODY.

168
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,375
ONE MORE LEFT.

169
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,583
I GOTTA HURRY.

170
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,958
- ( trilling )

171
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,083
- HEY, BEREMY.
- YEAH?

172
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,166
- WHAT'S THE TIME?

173
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,041
- TWO-TWO-FIVE-THREE.

174
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,541
- OKAY.

175
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
LISTEN UP, THE KID SHOULD

176
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,791
HAVE IT ALL SET BY NOW.

177
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,875
SEVEN MINUTES TILL PARADE TIME.

178
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,833
MAKE IT GOOD AND FLASHY.

179
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,291
- Beremy:
RIGHT ON TIME!

180
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,083
IT'S THE PURPLE SIGNAL.

181
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,250
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
- HERE WE GO!

182
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,083
- Bad Lads: YEAH!

183
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,458
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

184
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,625
- OH, NO, CAPTAIN!
- WHAT IS IT?

185
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,625
OH, MY GOD.

186
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,375
- LET'S GO!

187
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,583
- IT'S THE BAD LAD GANG.

188
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,625
- WHAT THE HELL IS 
GOING ON OUT THERE?

189
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,625
- ( clamoring )

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,416
- BASTARDS!
- THIEVING JERKS!

191
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,083
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S THE BIG MAN DOING?

192
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,416
I THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING PAID
SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
- WHY AREN'T
THE MAIN CANNONS FIRING?

194
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,916
- I TRIED, SIR.
THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING.

195
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,541
- Both: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

196
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,916
AAH!

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,958
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

198
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,000
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

199
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,500
- THEY'RE ON THE STARBOARD
REAR HATCH.

200
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,916
- OH...

201
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,666
- ( screaming )

202
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,416
- AH, THE MAGNIFICENT
 DREADNOUGHT RAIDERS.

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,416
I, LEADER OF THE BAD LADS,
PERSONALLY TRAINED THEM.

204
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,291
BRILLIANT DYNAMITES NEON 
NOW EMERGES TO TAKE OVER.

205
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,083
NOW, MY FRIENDS,
IT'S HARVEST TIME.

206
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,458
WHAT GLITTERS ON THIS SHIP
BELONGS TO ME.

207
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,083
YOU PERFORMED BRILLIANTLY, KID.

208
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,291
NICE JOB.

209
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,750
NOW GATHER ALL THE PASSENGERS
IN ONE SPOT

210
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,500
AND TAKE ME TO 
THE PARTY ROOM.

211
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,000
- RIGHT.  YES, SIR.

212
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,958
- ( rock music playing )

213
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,791
- ( Rem vocalizing )

214
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,875
- IT'S A SONG.

215
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,083
I HEAR A SONG.

216
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,541
- Rem:
♪ AND ON THE SECOND EVENING ♪

217
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,083
♪ ALL THE CHILDREN
OF THEIR PEBBLES JOINED HANDS ♪

218
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:18,583
♪ AND COMPOSED A WALTZ... ♪

219
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,583
( giggles )

220
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,125
YOU KNOW, I'M SO EXCITED.

221
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,125
THE MEANING OF LIFE.

222
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,916
YOU'RE VERY SERIOUS-MINDED,
AREN'T YOU, VASH?

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,583
WE DECIDE OUR OWN DESTINIES.

224
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,583
- REM.

225
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,833
- YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.

226
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,125
OUR TICKETS TO
THE FUTURE ARE OPEN.

227
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
PLEASE...

228
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,125
DECIDE YOUR OWN DESTINY.

229
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,333
- REM, DON'T LEAVE YET!

230
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,291
REM...

231
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,000
WAIT!

232
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,541
- ( door slams )

233
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,541
- ( running footsteps )

234
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,500
- WHAT IS THAT?

235
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,166
- MEOW.

236
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
- AH, JUNK.

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,625
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

238
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,458
PATHETIC BEGGARS!

239
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M STUPID?

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,916
- ( hostages whimpering )

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,333
- HEY, BOSS!
- HMM?

242
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,125
WELL, NOW, THERE IT IS.

243
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,208
AND IT'S A BIG ONE.
VERY NICE.

244
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,333
OPEN IT UP FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

245
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,416
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

246
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,250
I COULDN'T DO IT
EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

247
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,083
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE PERSON
ON THIS SHIP

248
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,083
WHO KNOWS THE COMBINATION
TO THAT SAFE.

249
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
BESIDES, THE ONLY CODED
KEY IS CAREFULLY

250
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,166
LOCKED AWAY IN THE CITY.

251
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,000
I SWEAR IT'S NOT HERE!

252
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,416
- ( chuckles )
I SEE.

253
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,916
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,666
THAT MEANS WE'LL JUST 
HAVE TO BREAK IT OPEN.

255
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
- ( mutters )

256
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,750
- ONCE WE HAVE MADE OUR WAY
AROUND THE MOUNTAIN--

257
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,583
TO THE RIGHT,
THEN GO STRAIGHT.

258
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,916
IN FIVE,
TAKE A NORTHEAST COURSE

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,083
AND STAY WITHIN SIGHT
OF THE CANYON.

260
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,666
THEN BEGIN TO ACCELERATE.

261
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,083
- ( grumbles )

262
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,500
- AT FULL SPEED,
WE WILL ARRIVE

263
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,958
IN JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

264
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,791
THIS IS OUR DESTINATION,
THE ENORA PRECIPICE.

265
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,041
- WHAT?

266
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,666
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME
RELEASE THE PASSENGERS.

267
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,625
PLEASE, SIR!

268
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,625
- ( laughs )

269
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,625
WE RISKED OUR LIVES
TO GET HERE.

270
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,791
IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT YOU
SHOULD BE EXPECTED

271
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,458
TO RISK YOUR LIVES TOO.

272
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,458
- DEPRAVED MAD LUNATIC!

273
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,958
AAH!
( grunts )

274
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,125
THE SUPER EXPRESS WILL
TAKE YOUR LIVES OUT

275
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,791
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY.

276
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,791
IF IT'S NOT FLASHY AND IN
HIGH-STYLE, WHAT'S THE POINT?

277
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,541
- THIS IS A HORRIBLE MESS
WE'RE IN, MERYL.

278
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,750
- WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE
THAN JUST THE TWO OF US

279
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,083
TO TAKE ON A GANG
THAT'S SO HEAVILY-ARMED.

280
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,125
- THE ONLY PERSON WHO
COULD DO SOMETHING

281
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,541
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS...

282
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,916
- IS HIM.  ALTHOUGH I HATE
TO ADMIT IT.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,833
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

284
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,833
- MY NECK HURTS.

285
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,666
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHERE I AM.

286
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,125
- ( rumbling )
- AAH.

287
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,541
- HUH?  WHAT WAS THAT?

288
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,250
- UH.

289
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,541
- ( breathes deeply )

290
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,000
( groans )

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,125
AAH!

292
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,291
- NAUGHTY BOY.
ISN'T THAT THE BRAKE?

293
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,208
DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE?

294
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,875
- EVERYONE ON THIS CREW
IS SWORN

295
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,375
TO PROTECT THE PASSENGERS
AT ANY COST.

296
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,458
I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
GO AGAINST THAT.

297
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,208
I'LL HONOR THAT
EVEN IF I HAVE TO DIE!

298
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,250
- HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

299
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,291
( gun cocks )

300
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,291
- NO!

301
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,000
- ( gunshot )
- AAH!

302
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,375
- SUCH A WASTE.

303
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,041
YOU HAVE THE STUFF
PROS ARE MADE OF.

304
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,750
I THINK I'LL PRESERVE YOU
JUST LIKE YOU ARE

305
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,000
WHILE YOU'RE STILL BEAUTIFUL.

306
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,958
- NO, DON'T!  STOP IT!

307
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,458
( groaning )
- ( laughing )

308
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,708
- I BROUGHT THE KID.

309
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,500
GO ON, MOVE IT.

310
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,250
- NOW NOW, DON'T LOOK SO GRIM,
LITTLE PARTNER.

311
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:04,208
ADULTS ARE PRONE TO MANY
UNHAPPY DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.

312
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,791
I BROUGHT YOU UP HERE,
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE

313
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,333
IF YOU KNEW HOW
TO STEER THIS HUGE CLUNKER.

314
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,250
- I DON'T KNOW THE LAYOUT
OF THE CONSOLE.

315
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,541
BUT YOU NEED TO REGULATE
THE AMOUNT OF CO2

316
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,083
SENT TO THE HEATING PLANT

317
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,375
AND MONITOR THE STRESS
ON THE BOILER.

318
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,666
THE LIGHT AND HEAT
ON THE HYDRO-PLANT ALSO NEEDS

319
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,166
TO BE REGULATED
AND MONITORED CONSTANTLY.

320
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,083
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO HAVE EXPERIENCE.

321
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,583
- WHO THE HELL IS THAT BOY?

322
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,916
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THIS THING IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,583
GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
KILLED THE POOR BASTARD.

324
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,916
- UH, HEY.

325
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,833
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT THE STEERING?

326
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,791
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN ACCELERATING
KINDA FUNNY.

327
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,833
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THE GOODS AND SPLIT NOW?

328
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,375
- WELL, BECAUSE THE PLAN
HAS CHANGED.

329
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,166
THE SWAG OF THE DAY
IS IN A HUGE SAFE

330
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,625
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHIP.

331
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,333
A LOT TOUGHER THAN THE USUAL
CRAPPY SAFES WE RUN INTO.

332
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,500
THE WORST PART OF IT IS
THAT WE HAVE NO KEY

333
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,291
UNLESS WE GO INTO THE CITY.

334
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,791
ISN'T IT SAD ENOUGH
TO MAKE YOU WANNA CRY?

335
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,833
TELL ME, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

336
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,916
YOUR RESPONSE: YOU'LL CRACK
THE WHOLE THING IN HALF.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,916
( chuckles )

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,125
- ( cries )

339
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,833
- HUH?  WHAT'S WRONG?

340
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,708
- I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

341
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,583
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

342
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,916
BUT JUST NOT THAT.

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
- HUH?

344
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,416
- YOU NEVER SAID
YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT.

345
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,750
I WAS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO SILENCE THE SECURITY GUARDS

346
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,916
TO LET YOU
AND THE BAD LADS INSIDE.

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,958
SO WHY IS IT NOW WE'RE
WRECKING THE WHOLE

348
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,375
SAND STEAMER ALL OF A SUDDEN?

349
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,375
WHY?!

350
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,250
THAT WAS NEVER
PART OF OUR DEAL.

351
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,458
I CAN'T ALLOW IT!

352
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,375
( groans )

353
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,791
- HEY, KID.

354
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,458
ARE YOU MISUNDERSTANDING
SOMETHING HERE?

355
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,666
I WON THE GOODS ON THIS SHIP,

356
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,625
SO WHY THE HELL WOULD I 
HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOU...

357
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,583
BEFORE I COLLECT
WHAT'S ALREADY MINE?

358
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,416
AAH!

359
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,875
KID, YOU AIN'T BEING BEAUTIFUL.

360
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,041
IF YOU'RE GONNA USE
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHIP

361
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,666
FOR A TRADE
WITH THE BAD GUYS,

362
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,916
AT LEAST PREPARE FOR THE WORST.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,916
STUPID.

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,416
- ( coughing )

365
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,250
PLEASE...

366
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,833
YOU GOTTA LEAVE 
THIS SHIP ALONE!

367
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,416
( grunts loudly )

368
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,500
- Beremy:
BOY, DON'T BE A FOOL.

369
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,666
SHUT UP AND DO WHAT HE SAYS.

370
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,000
- NEVER!

371
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,833
THIS SHIP BELONGS TO MY FATHER.

372
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,583
IT'S NOT YOURS.

373
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,416
THIS SHIP BELONGS TO MY DAD!

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,083
- ENOUGH.

375
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,416
THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE.

376
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
SPLATTER TIME.

377
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,125
- ( trilling )

378
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,791
- ( shouting )

379
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,125
- YOU OKAY, SQUIRT?
OVER HERE.

380
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,291
- SON OF A--

381
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,000
( screaming )

382
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,458
- DON'T MOVE NOW,
OR YOU'LL GET HURT.

383
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,708
HUH?

384
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,583
- BOSS, SAMSON WAS IN
A PASSENGER CABIN!

385
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,916
- ( screaming )

386
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,875
- ( metal clanks )
- OW...

387
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,375
- HMM?

388
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,458
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

389
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,458
THIS'LL BE FUN.

390
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,791
HEY, SCUMBAGS!
- Bad Lads: YEAH!

391
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,916
- FETCH ME A SOUVENIR.
- YES, SIR!

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,916
- MAKE IT SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL AND GORGEOUS.

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,083
- YEAH!

394
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,416
- ( laughs )

395
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,750
JUST WHO IS THAT IDIOT?

396
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,250
- ( screaming )

397
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,916
- HEY, COULDN'T YOU THINK
OF A BETTER WAY TO RESCUE ME?

398
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,166
THIS SUCKS BIG TIME!

399
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,333
- DON'T BE SO UNGRATEFUL, KID.

400
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,458
BESIDES, I RECEIVED A HECK OF
A LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN YOU DID.

401
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,458
- AAH!

402
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,416
- ( both screaming )

403
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,375
( panting )

404
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,708
- IF WE CLIMB A LITTLE HIGHER,

405
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,916
WE CAN GET TO
A VENTILATION SHAFT.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,166
- YEAH, OKAY, LET'S GET GOING.

407
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,125
I MEAN LIKE LET'S GET
GOING RIGHT AWAY.

408
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,291
- OH, IT'S A WAREHOUSE.

409
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,125
HUH?  WHAT'S THIS?

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,625
- LOOKS LIKE TRUNKS.

411
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,625
- Both: HUH?

412
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,416
- ( punches landing )

413
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,625
- ( whimpering )

414
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,875
- SORRY ABOUT HITTING YOU
LIKE I DID, CAPTAIN.

415
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,125
FORGIVE ME.

416
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,875
IT LOOKS LIKE I CAN'T QUITE
CONTROL THE SHIP

417
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,875
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,
AFTER ALL.

418
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,541
SO, THIS TIME, TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR YOU TO STEER,

419
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,041
I ENLISTED A VOLUNTEER
FROM THE PASSENGERS...

420
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,875
- ...FOR INSPIRATION.

421
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,041
- NO!

422
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,375
- SHIT!  YOU ARE SICK!

423
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,875
JUST GO TO HELL AND DIE.

424
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,708
- HEH.  I'M GETTING KINDA TIRED
OF BEING TOLD TO DO THAT.

425
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,875
- ( crying )
LET ME GO!

426
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,041
- YOU'RE LOOKING IN 
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

427
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,583
THE CONTROL LEVER
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

428
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,625
IT'S YOUR SHIP;
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE

429
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,041
TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS.

430
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,041
AT LEAST YOU'LL BE GOING
DOWN WITH IT

431
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,458
LIKE A GOOD CAPTAIN.

432
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,166
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE THING TO DO.

433
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,166
SPEED IT UP.

434
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,625
- ( girl screams )

435
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,625
- ( sighs )

436
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,166
- ( chuckling )

437
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,125
( laughing )

438
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,083
- ( yelping )

439
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,458
- ( Brilliant Dynamites Neon
cackling )

440
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,583
- ( end theme playing )

441
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

442
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,666
- Vash:
PEOPLE WHO SIN SAY THIS:

443
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,000
THAT THEY HAD TO
TO SURVIVE.

444
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,791
PEOPLE WHO SIN,
SAY THIS:

445
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,125
"IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO STOP."

446
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,125
A SHADOW CALLED SIN
DOGS THEM STEADILY FROM BEHIND,

447
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,625
SILENTLY, WITHOUT A WORD.

448
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,500
REMORSE AND AGONY ARE REPEATED

449
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,250
ONLY TO END UP AT DESPAIR
IN THE END.

450
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,916
BUT THE SINNERS
JUST DON'T KNOW

451
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,583
THAT IF
THEY'D ONLY TURN AROUND,

452
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,000
THERE'S A LIGHT THERE,

453
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,291
A LIGHT WHICH KEEPS
SHINING ON THEM

454
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,750
EVERY SO LONELY--

455
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,708
A LIGHT THAT WILL
NEVER FADE.
