WHY'D YOU SAVE ME?

OW!  OOH, THAT HURT.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT?!

WHAT ARE THE BADDY LADDIES
GONNA DO NOW?

- WHY? WHY DID I SAY THAT?

43
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,833
WHY DID I SAY
IT WAS MY DAD'S SHIP?

44
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,000
SHIT.  WHY DO I EVEN CARE
ABOUT THIS STUPID RIG?

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,666
MY DAD WAS JUST
A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING WORKAHOLIC.

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
- ALL RIGHT!
- ( groans )

47
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,708
- OKAY, TIME TO GET GOING.

48
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,833
- WELL, CAN I AT LEAST
ASK WHERE WE'RE GOING?

49
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,416
- THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE
WORRYING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT.

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,333
IT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KEEP SOME ROOM

51
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,375
IN YOUR BRAIN OPEN.

52
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:54,125
- HMM?
- I'M STOPPING THIS SHIP.

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,208
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE GOING TO HELP.

54
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,708
- OKAY.

55
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,708
- HEY, ISN'T THIS THE--

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,250
- YEAH, THE BLUEPRINT
OF THE FLOURISH,

57
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,083
THIS STEAMER.
- BUT HOW?

58
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,583
HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO GET THAT?

59
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,416
IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,958
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I COPIED
FROM MY DAD'S WORKPLACE

61
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,541
- WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID.
- BUT THIS IS REALLY AMAZING.

62
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,666
IT'S REPRODUCED ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO THE TINIEST SCRIBBLES

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,166
YOU MUST'VE HAD
A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR DAD.

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,916
- Man: KAITE?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,208
KAITE!

66
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,916
KAITE, YOU MUST BECOME
THE KIND OF PERSON

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,625
WHO DOES THINGS FOR OTHERS.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,250
AS FOR ME,

69
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,500
I WAS ABLE TO DO IT
WITH THE SAND STEAMER.

70
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,125
I WONDER WHAT YOU'LL DEVOTE
YOUR LIFE TO, MY SON.

71
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,291
- ( crying )

72
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,000
I DON'T HAVE A DAD.

73
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,125
WHAT THE HELL IS
SOMEONE LIKE ME SUPPOSED TO DO

74
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,250
FOR A LIVING
WHERE I CAN HELP PEOPLE?

75
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,791
HUH?

76
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,583
- ( emphatically )
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING

77
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,625
ALL SENTIMENTAL ON ME FOR,

78
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,458
YOU LITTLE SQUIRT?

79
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,416
FEELING BETTER NOW?
- ( groans )

80
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,916
- WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE!
GOT THAT?!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,875
- UH, YEAH.

82

- ( men scream )

85
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,750
- WHY DIDN'T IT EXPLODE?
- IS IT A DUD?

86
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,791
- THAT WAS FREAKY.

87
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,041

93
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,250
- WHAT A HAUL! NOW WE'VE GOT
SOME GUNS TO PLAY WITH!

94
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,625
- WHEN WE GET TO THE END,
MAKE A RIGHT.

95
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,625
- ( door opens )

96
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,666
- OH, I UNDERSTAND.

97
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,208
THESE ARE ALL VOICE TUBES.

98
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
- YEAH, BUT...
- HMM?

99
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,708
- ...DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS'LL WORK?

100
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,625
- HMM.
WELL, THE BALL'S IN MOTION,

101
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,791
WE JUST HAVE TO SEE
IF THEY PICK IT UP.

102
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,541
- HMM?

103
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,416
- ( panting )

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,375
HE-- HE GOT US, BOSS.

105
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,958
HE'S NOT HUMAN.

106
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,333
( groans )

107
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,958
- HMM.
( laughing )

108
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,583
THIS IS GREAT.
EVEN BETTER THAN A DIME NOVEL.

109
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,875
AT LAST, WE'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA HAVE SOME FUN.

110
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,916
LET'S SEE IF OUR LITTLE FRIEND
REALLY SPARKLES.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,333
Attention, scumbags:

112
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,208
If you slack off till time out,
I will kill you.

113
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,250
Drag that blond bastard
up here or else.

114
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,750
- IT'S MY TIME.

115
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,541
I'M AT THE STARBOARD
PASSENGER CABINS!

116
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,916
IT'S HIM!
IT'S THE BLOND GUY!

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- Good.
Hold him right there.

118
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,791
I'll send you some help.
- IT'S NO GOOD!

119
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,083
I CAN'T STOP HIM!
HE'S HITTING HIMSELF!

120
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,833
HIS SPEED IS INCREDIBLE!
( choking )

121
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,458
- JEEZ. WHAT A SHOW-OFF.

122
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,916
- ALL RIGHT! GOT HIM!

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,250
- NOW I'LL BE ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE.

124
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,625
BUT HOW WILL I CONTACT YOU

125
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,166
TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE GONNA BE?

126
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,958
HUH?
WAIT, ISN'T THIS--

127
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,208
IT'S SIMPLE. ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS TALK INTO IT

128
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,791
AND I'LL HEAR YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT

129
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,500
IN SOME SHOOTOUT
IN A NARROW PASSAGEWAY,

130
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,958
SO I'M GONNA BE
COUNTING ON YOUR HELP.

131
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,541
DON'T LET ME DOWN, OKAY?

132
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,083
- HMM.
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE!

133
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,333
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

134
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,958
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
THIS LOST TECHNOLOGY?

135
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,708
JUST WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

136
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,458
- I'D EXPLAIN IT TO YOU,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

137
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,250
BESIDES, THERE'S NO TIME.

138
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,916
DON'T WORRY SO MUCH
ABOUT THE LITTLE DETAILS.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,250
SEE YA!
- ( cocks )

140
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,916

- ( rapid gunfire )

141
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,958
- ( gasps )

142
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,791
VASH, YOU OKAY?

143
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,541
- NO, KAITE. IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO START LIKE THIS.

144
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S WRONG?

145
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,916
- I SCREWED UP.
THEY'RE BLEEDING BADLY.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,458
I HAVE TO HELP THEM.
- HELP THEM?

147
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,791
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

148
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,416
ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING
THAT YOU PURPOSEFULLY AVOIDED

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,375
KILLING THEM THE ENTIRE TIME?

150
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,875
HUH?  WHAT--

151
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,916
WHAT THE HELL?!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU!

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
A SHOT YOU ARE,

153
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,416
UNLESS YOU SHOOT TO KILL,

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,541
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOURSELF KILLED!

155
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,541
( gasps )

156
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,166
HUH?

157
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,791
- ( grunts )

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
WELL, I GUESS IT IS KIND OF
A STUPID APPROACH, ISN'T IT?

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,083
I KNOW THAT.

160
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,666
- ( gasps )
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

161
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,250
IT IS TRUE.
IT IS VERY SLOPPY OF ME.

162
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,750
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MADE A PROMISE.

163
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,083
IF I PUT OUT
EVEN ONE FLAME OF LIFE,

164
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,750
IT WOULD MAKE HER SAD.

165
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,750
( grunting )

166
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,541
- HUH?

167
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,291
- ( clicks )

168
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,250
- ( grunting )

169
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,708
- Man on voice tube:
There's something happening

170
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,166
in the central stairway,
third floor!

171
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,291
- GOOD!
PORT PASSENGER CABIN TEAM,

172
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,625
HEAD AROUND BEHIND
THE CENTRAL STAIRWAY QUICKLY!

173
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,833
EVERYBODY ON FLOORS
ONE THROUGH FIVE,

174
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,625
POSITION YOURSELVES AROUND
EACH STAIRWAY AND CLOSE IN NOW.

175
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,333
- WHAT'S OUR TIME?

176
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,041
- SEVEN MINUTES LEFT.

177
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,791
- WHEN YOU GET THERE,
YOU SHOULD SPEED RIGHT ACROSS.

178
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,916
THEY'RE GATHERING ABOVE
AND BELOW YOU RIGHT NOW.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
- Vash: Roger.

180
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,125
- ( both grunt )

181
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,875
- THAT'S STUPID.

182
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,833
YOU GOTTA STOP BEING
SO SOFT WITH THOSE BAD LADS!

183
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,666
NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT!
STOP BEING SO DAMN SOFT

184
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,125
WITH THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE!
( growls )

185
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,708
I HAVE BETRAYED,
THEY HAVE BETRAYED,

186
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,125
AND WE ALL LET A LOT
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE!

187
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,791
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR US TO GO BACK NOW!

188
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,833
AND-- AND YOU'RE
TOO DAMN CLEAN!

189
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,750
( pants )

190
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,791
- ( footsteps )
- HUH?

191
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,750
- THEN YOU SHOULD START OVER.

192
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
- WHAT?

193
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,125
- THE TICKET TO THE FUTURE...

194
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,916
IS ALWAYS OPEN.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,125
- Man on voice tube:
He's broken past the central

196
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,333
engineer's cabin. He is good,
a real tough bastard,

197
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,583
but he's also got
the Devil's luck!

198
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,041
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO, BOSS?

199
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,458
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT LUCK
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

200
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,750
- ( grunting )
- Good, keep going straight.

201
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,791
There should be a stairway
on your right.

202
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
Take it all the way down.

203
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,375
Don't go anywhere else.
That's the only unmanned place.

204
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,291
- WELCOME TO THE PARTY.
OH, YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME.

205
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,500
I TRUST THAT MY BRILLIANT
DIRECTIONS WERE CLEAR ENOUGH.

206
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:29,875
- OH, KAITE, YOU'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF THAT ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

207
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,833
- ( guitar music playing )

208
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,750
- ( gunfire stops )

209
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,416
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU SPARKLE.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,166
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE A WORTHY OPPONENT.

211
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,708
ARE YOU NO LONGER
AFRAID OF DYING?

212
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,250
- Man on voice tube: We found
him, Boss! It was the kid.

213
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,166
- ( grunts )

214
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,083
- Get up, you pain in the ass.

215
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,791
You gave us
a lot of trouble.

216
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,000
- ( blows thudding )
- ( Kaite grunting )

217
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,125
- LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALL OUT OF TRICKS.

218
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,583
OH WELL.
IT'S A REAL ACCOMPLISHMENT

219
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,083
THAT YOUR RAG TEAM
MADE IT THIS FAR.

220
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,583
HOWEVER, THE SIMPLE
FACT IS REALITY IS

221
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,166
ALMOST NEVER THAT BEAUTIFUL.

222
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,625
I ACTUALLY DO FEEL FOR YOU.
- ( beeps )

223
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,458
- <i>VAYA CON DIOS.</i>

224
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,333
HMM?
- ( gun cocks )

225
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,500
- THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

226
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,458
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?

227
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,416
- I'VE NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY
FOND OF THIS METHOD,

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,625
BUT IT SEEMED TO BE THE
QUICKEST AND EASIEST WAY

229
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,208
TO GET PAST YOU.

230
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,791
I AM MERYL STRYFE FROM THE
BERNARDELLI INSURANCE SOCIETY.

231
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,791
HOWEVER IN SOME PLACES
I HAPPEN TO BE BETTER KNOWN

232
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:53,958
AS DERRINGER MERYL.

233
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,500
- DON'T MESS WITH US,
LITTLE GIRL.

234
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,166
- ( gunshots )
- ( men grunt, crash )

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,291
- UMM, HI.
MY NAME IS MILLY THOMPSON.

236
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,250
LET'S SEE NOW.
I SUPPOSE FOR THE TIME BEING

237
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,041
YOU CAN JUST CALL ME STUN
GUN MILLY. HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

238
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,875
- WE'RE GONNA
LET YOU OFF EASY THIS TIME.

239
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,166
ONLY BECAUSE WE DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT.

240
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,291
NOW I EXPECT YOU'LL ACT
LIKE A REASONABLE ADULT

241
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,750
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM QUICKLY
WITHOUT SCREWING AROUND,

242
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,208
MR. VASH THE STAMPEDE.

243
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,041
- Men: VASH THE STAMPEDE?!

244
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,750
- VASH THE STAMPEDE?

245
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,583
( chuckles )

246
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,958
- ( rumbling )
- ( yelps )

247
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,208
- ( screaming )

248
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,916
- WELL, MY FRIEND.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR TIME
TOGETHER IS RUNNING SHORT.

250
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,333
THIS SHIP'S TAKING
A REAL BEATING.

251
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,250
I DOUBT
IT'LL LAST VERY LONG.

252
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,083
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

253
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,750
HOW ABOUT YOU AND YOUR GUYS
GO DOWN WITH ME?

254
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,250
- I'LL DROP YOU
RIGHT NOW, BLONDIE.

255
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,750
HMM?
- ALL RIGHT.

256
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,208
LET'S FIND OUT JUST WHO SPARKLES
THE MOST BETWEEN US.

257
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,708
YOU IDIOTS STAY OUT OF IT.

258
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,750
WE'LL SETTLE IT
WITH AN OLD-FASHIONED DUEL.

259
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,791
- I'M IN.
AND IF I WIN THIS SHOWDOWN,

260
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,208
WILL YOU STOP THE SHIP?

261
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,625
- IF YOU WON.
- ( grunts )

262
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,208
- ENGINE TEMPERATURE
IS AT NORMAL, SIR.

263
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,125
THE HULL IS SCREAMING.

264
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,916
- ALL WE CAN DO AT THIS POINT
IS BET ON HIM.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,458
HE'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,250
- ( chuckles ) I KNOW IT'S
RATHER TRITE AND OLD-FASHIONED,

267
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,125
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE START RIGHT WHEN

268
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,125
THIS COIN HITS THE DECK?

269
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,625
- ( screaming )

270
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,333
- ( clinks )

271
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,708
- ( yelling )

272
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,833
( grunts, thuds )

273
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,958
- ( grunts )

274
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,458
- ( gasps )
- OH NO! VASH!

275
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,333
- ARE THEY BOTH HIT?
- ( cocks )

276
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,666
- ( gasps )

277
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000
- ( beeping )

278
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
- ( both whimper )

279
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,208
- ( gunshot )

280
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,791
- YOU STUPID IDIOT.

281
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,750
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR JUMPING AROUND

282
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,375
LIKE AN ACROBAT IN
THE SHAPE YOU'RE IN.

283
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,416
- AREN'T YOU GONNA FINISH HIM?

284
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,083
- ( footsteps )
- HEY. BOSS?

285
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,500
- BEREMY, JUST SHUT UP.

286
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,958
I DIDN'T EVEN SHOOT HIM.
HE TORE HIS OWN WOUNDS OPEN.

287
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,250
- YOU SHOULD FINISH HIM,
ANYWAY, BOSS.

288
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,416
YOU'RE TOO SOFT-HEARTED.

289
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,250
HEY, USE THOSE
HUGE DYNAMOS OF YOURS.

290
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,291
- ( chuckles ) LIKE I'VE
MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES BEFORE.

291
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,291
A NAME DEFENDED TO THE DEATH

292
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,500
IS A NAME WORTHY OF RESPECT.

293
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,541
- EVERYBODY, VASH WON THE DUEL!

294
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,458
- ( cheers )

295
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,833
- EMERGENCY BRAKES!
HIT THEM NOW!

296
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,083
- AYE, CAPTAIN.

297
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,125
- ( clanking )
- ( grunts )

298
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,000
IT'S NO GOOD.
THEY WON'T ENGAGE.

299
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
- SIR!

300
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,583
- DID THE IMPACT DAMAGE
THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM?

301
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,958
- UNCONFIRMED, SIR,
BUT I'M GETTING

302
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,708
ABNORMAL PRESSURE READINGS
IN THE BOILER.

303
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,875
IF IT GETS MUCH
HIGHER THAN THIS,

304
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,333
THE ENTIRE HULL WILL EXPLODE.

305
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,791
- FORCE THE ENGINES
TO A FULL STOP IMMEDIATELY.

306
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,333
- ( groaning )

307
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,625
-  I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE
FIGHTING IN THAT CONDITION.

308
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,000
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

309
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,750
- WE HAVE TO GET THAT
LOOKED AFTER QUICK.

310
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,708
- WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY!
- All: HUH?

311
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

312
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,666
- THERE'S-- THERE'S BEEN
A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION.

313
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,458
WE'VE LOST THE STEERING!

314
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,666
- ( gasps )
- WHAT?

315
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,666
- WE NEED KAITE.

316
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,875
- IS THERE A WAY
TO SHUT THE ENGINES DOWN?

317
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,416
- WE'D HAVE TO POWER DOWN
THE SYSTEM MANUALLY.

318
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,833
- WHERE CAN WE EVEN DO THAT?

319
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,333
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
THIS SHIP IS SO OLD.

320
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,166
- IT'S IN ENGINE ROOM TWO.
- Men: HMM?

321
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,916
- THERE'S AN EMERGENCY STOP
LEVER INSIDE THE CONTROL SYSTEM,

322
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,625
BUT ACCESS IS LIMITED.

323
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666

YOU KNOW, YOU LITTLE BRAT?

324
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,416
GIMME THAT.
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

DAMN DAMN DAMN!

327
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,208

AS HE WAS KILLED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

332
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,791
I WILL NOT
ACCEPT HELP FROM YOU.

333
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,666
WE WILL STOP
THE SHIP OURSELVES.

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,041
- Vash on radio: Kaite.

335
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,208
Kaite.

336
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,916
What are
you gonna do, Kaite?

337
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,333
- QUIT BUGGING ME. I KNOW.

338
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,500
THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO PAY
THE PRICE FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

339
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,791

351

IT WON'T BUDGE!
THERE JUST ISN'T ANY WAY

352

WE CAN GET THROUGH
THIS MESS OF PIPES!

353

- COME ON.

355
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,625
- IT'S HOPELESS! THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO!

356
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!
- CALM DOWN.

357
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,333
THERE'S A WAY.
THERE'S GOTTA BE.

358

366
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,416

WE WERE ALL SAVED.
- NEON DID THAT?

374
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,916
- NOW DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA.

375
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,875
I JUST PAID OFF MY WAGER.

376
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,041
