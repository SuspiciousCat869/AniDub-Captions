I HAVE BEEN
A HUNTER OF PEACE,

FOR MANY,
MANY MOONS NOW.

9
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,500
THERE IS NO REST FOR ME
IN MY SEARCH OF PEACE. 

10
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,250
I MEDITATE DILIGENTLY
EVERY MORNING.

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,500
THE SUBJECTS
ARE LIFE AND LOVE.

12
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,625
I QUIT AFTER
THREE SECONDS.

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,208
IN MY SEARCH FOR PEACE,

14
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,791
I ALSO TRAIN DILIGENTLY.

15
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,583

18
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,583
- THANKS, FRIEND,
AND FAREWELL.

19
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,083
- Boy #1: HEY, VASH!
- HMM?

20
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,333
- COME ON!
- HURRY UP, WOULD YOU?

21
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,416
LET'S GO!
- WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU.

22
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,750
- RIGHT.

23
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,625
- ( kids laugh )
- I'VE ALSO MADE IT MY MISSION

24
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,916
TO TEACH THE PRECIOUS
VALUE OF PEACE

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,375
TO THE CHILDREN WHO
WILL ONE DAY OWN THE WORLD.

26
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,125
- ( bones cracking )
- ( straining )

27
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,916
- THAT'S CUTE.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,208
MR. VASH IS BEING
PUT IN STRANGLEHOLDS

30
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,958
- THAT'S NICE.

31
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,875
- ( boys roughhousing )
- Vash: I WILL SAY IT AGAIN.

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,750
MY NAME IS VASH
THE STAMPEDE.

33
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,750
I AM A HUNTER OF PEACE,

34
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,375
CHASING THE MAYFLY

35
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,083
- HUH?

36
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,708
OH!

37
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,333
( screams )

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,833
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISTER?

39
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,083
- EILEEN?!

40
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,083
- HUH?

41
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,583
- I-- I'M SORRY.

42
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,125
IT'S JUST THAT YOU LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE

43
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,583
MY POOR,
DEAD GIRLFRIEND.

44
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,750
PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME.

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,250
- I'M MICHELLE.

46
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,708
- LOVELY NAME.

47
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,375
MY NAME IS VASH,

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,916
VASH THE STAMPEDE.
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,250
( gasps ) THE NAME
OF THE OUTLAW

50
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,666
WITH 60,000,000,000$$
ON HIS HEAD.

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,125
- I GET THAT A LOT.

52
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,250
SO, ANYWAY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO HAVING LUNCH WITH ME?

53
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,583
- NOT A CHANCE.

54
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,375
- ( grunts )

55
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,083
- ( wind whistles )

56
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,083
- Boy #2: ( grunts ) THAT
MAKES TEN LOSSES OUT OF TEN.

57
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,375
- YOU KNOW, VASH, WE DID
ALL THIS FOR YOU.

58
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,416
- YEAH, YOU COULD
TRY HARDER.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,833
- ( whining )
BUT, CAPTAIN,

60
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
THIS STRATEGY DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE WORKING.

61
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,791
CAN'T WE TRY SOMETHING ELSE?
- HEY, IT'S NEIL.

62
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,208
- HEY, NEIL!

63
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,875
WANT TO JOIN IN?

64
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,958
- HE'S BEEN A REAL QUIET
LONER LATELY.

65
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,041
- WE INVITE HIM,
BUT HE NEVER COMES.

66
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,166
- ( footsteps approach )
- HMM?

67
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,333
- MR. VASH, JUST HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK

68
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,708
YOU CAN PERPETUATE THIS 
SELF-INDULGENT LIFESTYLE

69
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,583
OF DOING NOTHING BUT 
PLAYING WITH CHILDREN

70
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,958
AND EATING
AND SLEEPING

71
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,916
WITHOUT DOING ANY WORK
WHATSOEVER?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,666
- OH, A LECTURE.

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,250
- YOU GOT TO BE PRETTY LAME
TO TAKE THAT KIND OF ABUSE.

74
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,541
- Neil:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

75
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,041
HUH?

76
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,500
- COME ON.
- WAIT, DAD.

77
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,000
- ( chuckles )

78
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,375
- ( giggles )

79
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,458
- Vash: NEIL.
- HUH?

80
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,333
- HI.
- OH, GREAT.

81
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,208
IT'S JUST VASH.

82
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
- NOW, THAT WASN'T
A VERY WARM HELLO.

83
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,791
ARE YOU HELPING OUT?
THAT'S REALLY GOOD, NEIL.

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,125
- THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

85
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,583
- HEY, NOW DON'T
BE LIKE THAT.

86
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,875
WAIT, DOES YOUR FAMILY
RUN A RESTAURANT?

87
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,416
I'M STARVED.  THINK YOU CAN
GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT?

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,416
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY HANDOUTS.

89
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,250
- I KNOW THAT.
- AND...

90
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
MY MOM'S OFF-LIMITS.

91
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

92
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,125
- HEY, MOM, CUSTOMER.
- ( food sizzles in pan )

93
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,875
- HELLO AND WELCOME!

94
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,333
- HEY!

95
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,125
- ( chuckles )

96
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,083
COME ON IN.

97
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
- ( exasperated sigh )

98
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,166
- DON'T WRECK THE PLACE,
STUPID.

99
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,916
- ( sizzles )

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,625
- AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, PREACHER-MAN?

101
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,458
- CAN'T YOU TELL?
I'M LENDING A HELPING HAND.

102
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,416
- MM-HMM.

103
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO HELP OUT THOSE IN NEED.

104
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,375
HERE YOU GO.

105
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,375
ALL DONE.
- THANK YOU.

106
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,625
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

107
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,750
- THINK NOTHING OF IT.

108
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,000
I'M DOING IT BECAUSE
I WANT TO HELP.

109
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,416
NOW, COME ON,
GET IT WHILE IT'S WARM.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,541
- ALL RIGHT.

111
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,750
HERE YOU ARE.  ENJOY.

112
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,083
- DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN?

113
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,291
- UH...

114
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,916
THANK HEAVEN YOU ASKED!

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,583
IT'S A LONG STORY, ALTHOUGH
IT'S KIND OF A SHORT ONE.

116
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,375
ANYWAY, THIS IS 
HOW IT HAPPENED.

117
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,500
BY CHANCE, I HAD JUST
STOPPED BY HERE

118
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,583
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.
- ( woman screams )

119
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,166
OH, NO!

120
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY MOM?!
- HELP!

121
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,208
- ( in falsetto )
"I'M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE,

122
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,708
JUST WAIT A BIT LONGER
AND I'LL PAY YOU

123
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
THE MONEY I OWE YOU.
I PROMISE!"

124
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,375
- ( mimics gangster ) 
"LADY, YOU'RE WAY PAST

125
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,625
YOUR DEADLINE.

126
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,250
UNLESS YOU PAY OFF YOUR DEBT
IN FULL,

127
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,666
WE CAN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY EITHER.

128
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT.
HEH HEH!"

129
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,041
( normal voice )
SO AFTER THAT,

130
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,083
I DECIDED YOU USE
A LITTLE OF HIS GOSPEL

131
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,250
TO TALK THEM OUT OF IT.

132
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,458
I ASKED THE LADY,
"WHAT HAPPENED?"

133
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,541
SHE SAID THAT HER HUSBAND
DISAPPEARED

134
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,875
LEAVING HIS DEBT BEHIND,

135
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,750
BUT SHE DECIDED TO KEEP
THIS PLACE RUNNING.

136
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,750
EVEN THE CHILD IS DESPERATE
TO HELP HIS MOTHER IN NEED.

137
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
IT SHOT ME THROUGH THE HEART.

138
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,666
COULD YOU JUST SIT THERE?

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,750
COULD YOU JUST IGNORE THAT?

140
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,333
- THAT'S JUST AWFUL!
- YES, JUST AWFUL.

141
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,541
- AWFUL! ( cries )
- ( dramatically ) OH, YES!

142
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,625
MOST DEFINITELY.
- YES, DEFINITELY.

143
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,458
IT'S THE MOST
TERRIBLE THING.

144
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,416
- YOU'VE SAVED ME TIME.

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,916
I WAS GOING TO GO LOOK FOR YOU
ONCE WE CLOSED SHOP.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,541
- FOR ME?
- YUP.

147
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,166
- THE THIRD ANNUAL
QUICK DRAW TOURNAMENT.

148
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,083
GRAND PRIZE, 50,000$$.
WHAT'S THIS?

149
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
- TO HELP OUT A POOR FAMILY,

150
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,125
YOU'RE GOING TO COMPETE.
- I WILL?!

151
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,708
IS SHOW UP THERE 
ON TIME TOMORROW.

153
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REGISTRATION

154
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,583
AND PAPERWORK FOR YOU.
- WHY ME ALL OF A SUDDEN?

155
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,916
- WE'RE HELPING THESE
GOOD PEOPLE OUT HERE!

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,125
OR WOULD YOU PREFER
IF I TURNED YOU IN 

157
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,750
AND GET
THE 60,000,000,000$$ INSTEAD?

158
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,791
- THAT'S NOT
VERY FUNNY, PAL.

159
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,250
- JUST LOOK AT HER.

160
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,916
ISN'T THAT A SAD FACE?

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,583
- YEAH.
- NOT TO MENTION BEAUTIFUL.

162
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
- YEAH.

163
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,333
FOR LOVE!
- FOR LOVE AND FOR PEACE.

164
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,916
- Meryl:
A QUICK DRAW TOURNAMENT?!

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
- HM-HMM.
- WHAT IS GOING ON

166
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
INSIDE THAT PEA-BRAINED
SPIKY HEAD?

167
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,458
ANY NORMAL PERSON
WOULD BE ABLE

168
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,166
TO SEE THE DANGER
OF PARTICIPATING 

169
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,416
IN SUCH A STUPID CONTEST.

170
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,833
- I DIDN'T EVEN ENTER
THE CONTEST MYSELF.

171
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,291
I WAS KIND OF
TALKED INTO IT.

172
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,375
- Meryl: BY WHOM?
- THE PRIEST WE MET ON THE BUS.

173
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,125
- HEY, MR. VASH,
IF YOU WIN THE CONTEST,

174
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,375
WILL YOU TREAT ME
TO SOMETHING?

175
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,041
- ( chuckles )
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

176
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,041
- ( groans ) NOT AGAIN!

177
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,416
I'M HAVING
UNHAPPY VISIONS HERE!

178
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,291
- Meryl: I SEE THIS
SCENE IN MY HEAD

179
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,041
OF DOZENS OF HOTSHOT GUNMEN

180
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,833
AFTER THE 60,000,000,000$$

181
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,333
HAVING A MACHO-SHOOTOUT WAR.

182
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,083
- I'M JUST TAKING PART
IN A FUN CONTEST, THAT'S ALL.

183
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,291
IT'LL BE OKAY.

184
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,250
- YOU HAVEN'T GOT
A SINGLE CLUE, HAVE YOU?

185
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,083
- AND YOU ALWAYS SAY 
THE STRANGEST THINGS.

186
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,416
- FUNNY, THE CHIEF SAYS
THE SAME THING.

187
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,375
- IT'LL BE OKAY, OKAY?
I'LL BE OKAY.

188
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,625
- ( growls )

189
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,916
- I GUESS IT WILL.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,583
- Butler: SIR, I JUST THOUGHT
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

191
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,583
THAT WHEN WE WERE GOING 
THROUGH TODAY'S ENTRIES,

192
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,125
THIS NAME CAME UP.
- Organizer: VASH THE STAMPEDE?

193
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,416
- THIS IS A MOST TROUBLING
TURN OF EVENTS.

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,958
SHALL I HAVE
HIS ENTRY WITHDRAWN?

195
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,500
- I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT
THE LEGENDARY GUNMAN 

196
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,541
WOULD COME OUT OF HIDING
FOR A MERE 50,000$$ PRIZE.

197
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,833
IT'S JUST A WANNABE PUNK 
USING THE NAME FOR KICKS.

198
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,916
- BUT, SIR...
- WE'LL JUST LET HIM TRY IT.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,250
THEN WE'LL KNOW
IF HE'S THE REAL THING.

200
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,833
WE WILL HOLD THE TOURNAMENT
AS PLANNED.

201
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,291
THAT IS ALL.  GO.
- VERY GOOD, SIR.

202
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,208
- ( door opens )

203
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,291
( door closes )
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

204
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,000
WILL THIS DO?

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,583
- ( knocks on door )
- WHO IS IT?

206
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,000
- Wolfwood: IT'S ME.
- DOOR'S OPEN.

207
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,458
- ( door opens )

208
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,458
- HEY, YOU STILL AWAKE?

209
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,500
LADY GAVE US A PRESENT.

210
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,916
CARE FOR A SWIG?

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,916
( sighs )
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,791
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN 
TO FORCE YOU INTO IT.

213
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,041
- COME ON, YOU PLANNED IT
FROM THE START.

214
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,791
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT I APOLOGIZED.

215
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,125
- Vash: THE CHURCH.

216
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
- HUH?
- YOU SAID EARLIER

217
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,041
THAT YOU CAME FROM A CHURCH.
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

218
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,750
- IT'S 300 ILES FROM 
THE CITY OF DECEMBER.

219
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,875
- YOU BRING ORPHANS
THAT FAR OUT INTO THE BOONIES?

220
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,458
- IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
I'VE GOT.

221
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,416
KIDS I'VE MET ON THE WAY 
WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO GO--

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
EITHER THEIR PARENTS ARE DEAD
OR THEY ABANDONED THEM.

223
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,208
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S KIDS LIKE NEIL.

224
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,416
I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO TAKE HIM.

225
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,708
- ( gulps, gasps )

226
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,291
( hisses )

227
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,166
THEY'RE YOU GO
SMILING AGAIN.

228
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,916
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,916
HEY, GIRLS!
- Both: HMM?!

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,250
- Wolfwood: YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN THROUGH THE DOOR.

231
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,375
COME ON IN.

232
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,500
- ( nervous laughing )
- WELL, HELLO.

233
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,375
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR EAVESDROPPING,

234
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,750
BUT AT LEAST NOW
I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER,

235
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,375
MR. VASH.
- WHAT?

236
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,833
- SINCE IT APPEARS THAT
YOU WERE FORCED THIS TIME,

237
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,875
I WISH YOU G--
- SHE MEANS,

238
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,625
"GOOD LUCK, MR. VASH.
GIVE 'EM HECK, ALL RIGHT."

239
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,250
- THANKS, GUYS.

240
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,916
- WHO'S DRINKING?

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
- I AM! OH YEAH!
- UH...

242
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,791
HEY, DON'T LET HER
HAVE TOO MUCH, ALL RIGHT?

243
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,125
- Wolfwood: HEY, LIGHTEN UP.

244
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,458
- ( meows )

245
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,000
- Milly:
OH, I FEEL SO HOT.  WOW.

246
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,125
- Meryl: HEY,
DON'T DO THAT HERE.

247
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,125
- Milly: WHOO! 
- Meryl: MILLY!

248
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,291
- Wolfwood: YOU GO, BIG GIRL!

249
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,916
- GET YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON
RIGHT NOW.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,416
- ( Milly laughs )
- Vash: OH YEAH!

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,833
- Meryl: MILLY!
- ( all laughing )

252
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,625
- ( chatter )

253
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,500
- ( gunfire )

254
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,291
- Old Man: OH, WE GOT IN
SOME AMAZING GUNMEN THIS YEAR.

255
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,458
- Younger Man:
GET A LOAD OF THAT GUN.

256
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,125
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

257
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,708
- Milly: ( muffled )
MR. VASH AND MR. WOLFWOOD

258
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,916
HAVEN'T ARRIVED YET.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,791
- WELL, YOU SAW HOW
THEY WERE LAST NIGHT.

260
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,583
THEY'LL TAKE
THEIR OWN SWEET TIME.

261
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,250
BESIDES, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

262
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,541
IF THEY DON'T DRAW
TOO MUCH ATTENTION ANYWAY.

263
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,125
- Wolfwood:
SO, SHALL WE GO?

264
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,791
- PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
WILL YOU?

265
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,708
MY HEAD REALLY HURTS.
- YOU'RE REALLY A WUSS, VASH.

266
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,125
CAN'T YOU HANDLE
A FEW DRINKS?

267
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,208
- THAT WASN'T A FEW DRINKS.

268
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,875
THAT WAS MORE LIKE
A FEW GALLONS.

269
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,708
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

270
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,083
- Neil: HEY, VASH!

271
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,625
- HEY, THERE.
- IS IT REALLY TRUE?

272
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,208
ARE YOU GONNA
HELP MY MOM? 

273
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,000
- NEIL, STOP. I CAN'T
ASK YOU TO DO THIS.

274
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,083
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

275
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,958
- HEY, WE'RE ALL FRIENDS NOW.

276
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,916
AND BESIDES, I'M NOT TOO BAD
AT THIS SORT OF THING, ACTUALLY.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,666
( shaky laughs )

278
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,916
- ( gunfire )

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,958
- ( crowd shouts )
- Man #1: WHAT WAS THAT? 

280
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,708
HE COULDN'T HIT
A SINGLE ONE.

281
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,083
- Shooter: ( mutters )
- ( jeering )

282
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,333
- ( gunshots )

283
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,708
- VASH IS IN THE TOURNAMENT.
- HE IS?

284
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,125
YOU THINK
HE CAN HANDLE IT?

285
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,375
- LOOK, THERE HE IS.
OVER THERE.

286
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,750
- ( gags )

287
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,666
( moans )

288
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,083
- Boy #2: HE LOOKS LIKE
A LOST CAUSE TO ME.

289
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,916
- ( crowd taunts )

290
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
- Man #2: COME ON,
JUST SHOOT IT.

291
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,875
- ( gunshots )

292
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,083
- Boys: WHOA!

293
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,791
- IS THAT THE MAN
YOU SPOKE OF?

294
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,541
HE'S NOT BAD.

295
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,000
- OOPS.  OH NO,
I HIT THEM ALL.

296
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,250
( sighs )

297
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,166
- YOU ARE VASH THE STAMPEDE,
ALL RIGHT.

298
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,083
- I'M STANDING OUT
TOO MUCH.

299
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,750
- EH, IT'LL MAKE THE GOING
THAT MUCH EASIER, VASH.

300
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,916
KEEP KNOCKING
'EM DEAD OUT THERE.

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,833
- THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO.
- HUH? ME TOO?

302
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,833
- IF THE THIRD ROUND CONTESTANT,
MR. NICHOLAS D. WOLFWOOD,

303
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,333
IS PRESENT AND
READY TO COMPETE,

304
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,833
STEP FORWARD NOW...
- AAH!

305
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,291
- OR BE DISQUALIFIED.

306
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,666
- WHAT THE HELL DID YOU
SIGN ME UP FOR?!

307
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,791
- WELL, IF WE BOTH COMPETE,
IT'LL IMPROVE OUR CHANCES.

308
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,916
- WHAT?!

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,875
- GOOD LUCK OUT THERE,
MR. PRIEST-MAN.

310
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,083
- OH, GREAT.  HMM?

311
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,375
- Vash: FOR LOVE...
- Wolfwood: AND PEACE.

312
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,750
- ( gunshots )

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,583
HOW COME YOU'RE GOOD?
- UNFORTUNATELY,

316
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,416
WE HAVE TO LIVE
IN A DANGEROUS WORLD.

317
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
IT'S FOR SELF-PROTECTION.

318
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,000
- MAYBE YOU'RE AN EX-GUNMAN.

319
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,666
- YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

320
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,166
WHAT IS IT?!

321
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,291

I'M IMPRESSED.

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,333
- BUT I'M AFRAID THIS
IS THE END OF YOUR SPREE.

324
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,583
THIS TIME, YOU AIN'T SHOOTING
NO LIQUOR BOTTLES.

325
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,291
THIS TIME, IT'S LIVE
ONE-ON-ONE COMBAT.

328
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,333
- CAN I DROP OUT NOW?

329
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,541
- YOU DRAGGED ME INTO THIS
WITH YOU

330
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,291
AND NOW IT'S
TOO DAMN LATE!

00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,000
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY, MISTER.

336
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,416
IT'S ONLY YOUR SHOULDER.

337
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
- YOU'RE GOOD AT
CHANGING TRAJECTORIES.

338
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,041
YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING
PEOPLE KILL EACH OTHER, HUH?

339
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,291
- REMEMBER, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DRAGGED ME INTO THIS. 

340
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,666
- NO NEED TO THANK ME.

341
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,291

00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,958
- IT'S YOU AND ME,
SPINELESS COWARD. 

344
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,125

353
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583

363
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,166
SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T HAD
A SINGLE FATALITY

364
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,458
IN THIS YEAR'S CONTEST.

365
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,125
- HELL, HE'S ACTUALLY
THE REAL THING.

366

HE'S VASH THE STAMPEDE.

367
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750

00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,833
- NOW YOU'RE COOL ENOUGH
TO JOIN OUR CLUB.

369
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,458

370
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,291
THAT HE'S GONNA STEP OUT
OF THE COMPETITION.

371
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,916

NOW YOU'VE WON

372
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,458
THIS CONTEST FOR SURE.

I'M WITHDRAWING
FROM THE FINAL ROUND.

375
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,125
- REALLY?

376
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,125
BUT YOU WERE DOING
SO WELL FOR YOURSELF.

377
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
MAY I ASK WHY?

378
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,791
- AH, IT'S TOO MUCH
OF A BOTHER, THAT'S ALL.

379
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,458
THEN JUST GIVE THE PRIZE
TO THE OTHER GUY, ALL RIGHT?

380
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,875
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHAT?

381
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,375
- LOOK.
- HUH? 

382

WELL, NOW,
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
- NICHOLAS,
YOU REALLY ARE VERY GOOD.

384
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,250
WOULD YOU CONSIDER ELIMINATING
VASH THE STAMPEDE

385
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,958
WITH YOUR SUPERB
GUNMANSHIP?

386
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,375
IF YOU DO AS I ASK,

387
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,375
I WILL GUARANTEE YOU THE SAFETY
OF THAT FAMILY.

388
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,500
AND I'D EVEN BE WILLING
TO RAISE THE PRICE

389
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,875
TO 30,000,000,000$$.

390
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,375
- YOU MEAN, 50/50?

391
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,125
- ( chuckles ) I LIKE A MAN
WITH A HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS.

392
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,750
- Announcer: GENTLEMEN,
THE FINAL ROUND WILL NOW BEGIN.

393
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,083
- HUH?!
- BUT WHY?

394
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,541
- NO, VASH.

395
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,291
- DIDN'T YOU GO OVER THERE
TO WITHDRAW?

396
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,916
- HERE'S THE BIG MONEY QUESTION.

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,083
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU SEE
IN THE WINDOW

398
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,541
OF THAT BUILDING
OVER THERE?

399
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,916
AND THAT JUST ABOUT
SUMS IT UP.

400
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,916

- IT'S FOR THE GOOD
OF THAT FAMILY.

404
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,208
JUST RESIGN YOURSELF
AND DIE.

405
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,541
- ( gunshots )

406
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,166
- COME ON, GET SERIOUS!

407
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,125
- I'M SAYING THAT WE ALL
HAVE TO MAKE A FEW SACRIFICES.

408
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,791
- CAN I MAKE
A DIFFERENT ONE?

409
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,458
- UGH!

410
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,833
NOW, YOU'VE DONE IT!

411
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,541

YESTERDAY.

413
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,583

I'D TRY SOMETHING THAT CHEAP?!

414
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,041
- YEAH, I DO.

415
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,625
AFTER YOU WENT AND SIGNED ME UP
WITHOUT ASKING.

416
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,791
- YOU DID
THE SAME TO ME.

417
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,125
- ( gunshots )

418
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,666

441
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,208
- I'M AMAZED YOU CAN SAY THAT
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

442
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,541
- HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED

I WON'T LET
ANY MORE CHILDREN SUFFER!

448
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,291
NEVER AGAIN!

449
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,583

452
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

453
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,625
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO
AND INJURE

454
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,958
SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE?

455
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,833
WHAT KIND OF A CHURCHMAN
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

456
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,541
- HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

457
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,458
NOBODY'S DEAD. 
I KEPT MY WORD.

458
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,166
- NOW THEN.
MISTER...

459
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,250
MAY THE LORD
HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL.

460
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,583
OR DO YOU INTEND TO PAY ME
THE PRIZE MONEY AFTER ALL?

461
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,625
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL PAY IT.  I'LL PAY IT.

462
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,083
- MUCH OBLIGED.

463
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,125
- ( kids straining )

464
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,875
OWW! STOP IT!

00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,875
GO AWAY! IT HURTS!

466
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,375
- HE SURE HAS BECOME AWFULLY
POPULAR ALL OF A SUDDEN,

467
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,375
DON'T YOU THINK?

468
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,916
- I KNEW HE WAS NO
ORDINARY PRIEST,

469
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,583
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
HOW UNUSUAL HE WAS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- AH, HECK.

476
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,083
THINK NOTHING OF IT.

FOR LOVE...

484
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,500
HUH?

485
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,250

486
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,541
- Boy #2: GET 'EM!

ANYTHING BUT THAT!

488
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,708
NO!
- ( thudding )

489
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,083
- ( meows )

490
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,666
- ( theme music plays )

491
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

492
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,166
- Vash: A CHOICE
BETWEEN TWO THINGS,

493
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,541
THE FORKED ROAD,
A CROSSED ROAD

494
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,416
WHERE MEN GIVEN LIFE
MUST TAKE

495
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,208
IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE.

496
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,416
WHICHEVER END
THEY LIVE ON,

497
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,416
THEY LOSE SOMETHING.

498
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,916
WHICHEVER END THEY LIVE ON,

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,125
THEY ARE UNABLE
TO FIND HAPPINESS.

500
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,916
BUT ARE THERE REALLY ONLY
TWO PATHS TO A FORKED ROAD?

501
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,041
NO, THERE ARE INFINITE
PATHS WE MUST TAKE.

502
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,291
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PATH.

503
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,875
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE
PATH TO THE FUTURE.
