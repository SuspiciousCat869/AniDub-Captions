1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,291
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,291
- DO YOU REALLY WANT
OUT HERE?

3
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,125
IT'S 500 YARDS TO TOWN.
- THANKS FOR THE RIDE. 

4
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,458
IT'S OKAY.

5
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,916
- YOU AREN'T GONNA LISTEN,
ARE YOU?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,916
WELL, TO EACH HIS OWN.

7
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,291
- Serious sandstorms
are forming.

8
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
Up to 4,000 yards around
the Orleans area.

9
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,750
- All transportation
has been stopped

10
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,125
with no immediate signs
of resuming.

11
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,583
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE'RE STUCK HERE.

12
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,000
- I DON'T KNOW, WHY DON'T
WE JUST THINK OF IT

13
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,041
AS SOME KIND
OF VACATION, MERYL?

14
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,625
- IF THIS WERE A VACATION,
I KNOW THAT I'D SPEND IT

15
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,333
SOMEPLACE A LOT
QUIETER THAN THIS.

16
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,583
- I DID IT!
- UNBELIEVABLE.

17
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,250
- NOT AGAIN.
- I DID IT! I DID IT!

18
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,583
IT'S AN ALL CLUBS STRAIGHT.

19
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,416
- THAT'S WONDERFUL,
MISS STEFANY.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
- HEY, I REALLY
LIKE THIS GAME.

21
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,083
- Man: I CAN'T PLAY LIKE THIS.
- HUH?

22
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,416
BUT, WAIT, WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
DON'T GIVE UP YET.

23
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,583
I WAS JUST STARTING TO HAVE
SOME FUN HERE.

24
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,833
- SHOOTING MYSELF
IS MORE FUN THAN THIS.

25
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,875
- Men: HEAR HEAR!
- HMM.

26
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,083
- Both: UH...

27
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,875
- HEY, THERE, WOULD
YOU TWO LIKE TO PLAY?

28
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,250
- ARE YOU PLAYING OLD MAID?
- WELL, ACTUALLY,

29
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,583
WE DON'T KNOW
ANY OTHER GAMES,

30
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,083
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,625
- COME ON,
DON'T BE THAT WAY.

32
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,833
PLEASE.
- I'LL PLAY, DEAL ME IN.

33
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,916
- WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN.
LET'S GET THIS

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
SHOW ON THE ROAD
BEFORE MY LUCK CHANGES.

35
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,166
- ONE CONDITION.
- HUH?

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,625
- ( gun clicks )

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,666
- ( gasps )

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,958
- I STAGE GAME.

39
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,875
THE BET IS FOR YOUR LIFE.

40
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,666
- Sheriff:
THERE ARE THREE THINGS

41
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,416
I CAN'T TOLERATE
IN THIS WORLD:

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,125
PEOPLE WHO PUT ICE
IN ALCOHOL,

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,583
THE PATTERN ON
A SILHOUETTE SCORPION,

44
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,416
AND SLIME WHO DON'T
APPRECIATE TRANQUILITY.

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,416
A ROBBERY IN MY JURISDICTION?

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,166
NOT ON MY WATCH, DAMN IT!

47
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,375
- ( tires screech )

48
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,125
- WELL, WHAT'S THE SITUATION
HERE, STAN?

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,083
- ALL RIGHT, DICK,
WILL YOU INFORM THE EARL

50
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,875
OF WHAT'S GOING ON?
- YES, SIR.

51
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,625
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE
TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESSES,

52
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,000
THE GROUP CONSISTS
OF FOUR CRIMINALS 

53
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
AND FOUR HOSTAGES.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,125
I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK
TO THE FOLKS THAT ESCAPED.

55
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,916
THEY TOLD ME THAT
ONE OF THE HOSTAGES

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,916
WAS A REAL PRETTY GIRL
WHO LOVES CARDS, MR. VOSTALK.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,458
- WHAT ARE THESE LOWLIFES
LOOKING FOR?

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,125
- WELL, THEY WANT A 100,000$$.

59
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,500
IN INCONSECUTIVE BILLS
AND A GETAWAY WAGON.

60
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,166
- DID THEY GO
AND COMMIT THIS CRIME

61
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,958
KNOWING THAT
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER?

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,416
- I BET THEY DID.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,958
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ANY BIG SECRET

64
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,583
THAT YOU'RE
THE WEALTHIEST MAN IN TOWN.

65
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,458
AND ONLY YOU COULD COME UP
WITH 100,000$$ THAT QUICK.

66
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,833
- UHH! I'M NOT GONNA
LET THEM GET AWAY!

67
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,000
( growls )
IF WORD OF THIS GETS AROUND,

68
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,250
HOOLIGANS WILL COME
SWARMING FROM EVERYWHERE.

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,958
MY DAUGHTER WILL
BECOME THEIR PLAYTHING

70
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,541
AND WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED,
THEY'LL DISCARD HER

71
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,875
IN THE DESERT.
- I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T

72
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,666
KNOW THAT FROM
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,958
WOULD YOU,
"GRIM REAPER" VOSTALK.

74
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,875
- SHUT UP, STAN!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED 

75
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,208
TO BE THE SHERIFF
IN THIS TOWN.

76
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,250
AND IT'S YOUR JOB
TO HELP MY DAUGHTER, DAMN IT!

77
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,166
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY HAVE TO DIE,

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,416
YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT IT TAKES 

79
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,250
TO GET HER BACK
IN ONE PIECE.

80
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,000
- ( gun cocks )
- WHAT?!

81
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,250
- DON'T ORDER ME AROUND,
VOSTALK.

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,416
THIS IS NOT THE OLD DAYS.

83
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,250
- ( growls )

84
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,250
- HMM.

85
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,000
- HMM.
- ( light music plays )

86
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,291
- ( humming )
- HUH?

87
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,583
- ( music plays )
- ( humming )

88
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,041
- WHAT IS HE DOING?

89
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,625
- CHIC-A-BOOM.
TSCH, TSCH, TSCH.

90
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,083
TSCH, CHIC-AH,
TSCH, TSCH, TSCH.

91
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,083
TSCH, CHIC-A-BOOM,
PHFTT, TSCH-AH.

92
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,916
- WHO IS THAT IDIOT?!
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,291
- HEY, LOOK OUT.
GET BACK HERE, DUMB ASS.

94
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,208
- THERE'S A HOSTAGE
SITUATION IN THERE!

95
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,583
YOU WANT TO DIE?!

96
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,291
- WHOO, WHOO.
TSCH, TSCH, TSCH.

97
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,416
- HE'S DANCING AROUND TOO MUCH
TO EVEN NOTICE.

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
HE CAN'T HEAR
A DAMN THING.

99
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,791
- THAT BRAINLESS MORON!
HE'S GONNA UPSET THE CRIMINALS.

100
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:39,916
- Both: HUH?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,791
- YEOW! WHOOWHA!

102
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,666
OH, WHOO, TSCH...
- ( gunfire )

103
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,583
- Stan: DANG FOOL.
THEY'RE SHOOTING AT HIM.

104
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,916
- Dick: HE'S DODGING
THE BULLETS.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,916
- Stan: DODGING? THAT FREAK
DOESN'T EVEN REALIZE

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,583
HE'S BEING SHOT AT.
- ( gunfire )

107
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,375
- Dick: LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GOING INSIDE.

108
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,625
- HEY, YOU! STOP IT!

109
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,416
GET OUT OF THERE!

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,416
- YEAH!

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,125
- ( music continues )

112
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,208
- WHO ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE?

113
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,666
- ARE YOU SUICIDAL?
- OR TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER?

114
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,458
- ( music volume
increases )

115
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,625
- HUH?

116
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
- Both: HUH?

117
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,416
- AH! HELP, SOMEBODY!

118
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,208
ROBBERS!
HELP, SOMEBODY!

119
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
STOP IT! HEY, WHAT DID I DO?
- THAT GUY IS JUST AN IDIOT.

120
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,250
- IT TAKES MORE
THAN JUST AN IDIOT

121
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,500
TO BE SCREAMING THAT WAY.
- WHY DO THESE THINGS

122
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,916
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME?!
PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP!

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,250
- WELL, I GUESS WE GOT
FIVE HOSTAGES NOW.

124
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,125
- THE PLAN HAS NOT CHANGED.
ALL THIS MEANS IS THAT

125
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,583
THERE'S ONE MORE
LIFE ON THE LINE

126
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,500
WE'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT.
HOW'S IT COMING ALONG?

127
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,708
- WE GOT THROUGH JUST ABOUT
TWO HOURS AGO, SIR.

128
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,083
WE'LL BE READY BY THE DEADLINE
THE CRIMINALS GAVE US.

129
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,291
NO PROBLEM.

130
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,458
- HEY, VOSTALK.
I THINK IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA

131
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,791
FOR YOU TO KEEP PRAYING
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S SAFETY.

132
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,416
OH, YEAH, AND BY THE WAY,
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

133
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,750
DON'T FORGET THE MONEY.

134
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,458
- ( growls )

135
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,708
- ( punching )
- OOH!

136
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,750
CAN'T YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE GENTLE, BROTHER?

137
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,625
I WON'T TRY ANYTHING ELSE,
HONEST.

138
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,000
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE MY GUN, SEE?

139
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,375
- HUH? WHAT'S THIS?

140
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,333
HERE, CATCH.
- OH, THAT'S HEAVY.

141
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,500
- CUSTOM MADE.  YOU'RE PACKING
SOME SERIOUS FIREPOWER

142
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,666
FOR SUCH A SCRAWNY GUY.
- HEY, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

143
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
COULD YOU GIVE IT BACK TO ME
WHEN YOU'RE DONE?

144
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,791
- SHUT UP, YOU LITTLE MAGGOT.
- AHH!

145
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,500
- OOH.
- WELL, HELLO.

146
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,125
- HELLO.  YOU KNOW WHAT?

147
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,583
I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF HELL

148
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,208
SINCE I MET THE TWO OF YOU.
- ( growls )

149
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,791
- WE'RE THE ONES THAT
ARE IN HELL, YOU IDIOT!

150
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,916
- ( grunts )
OW, THAT REALLY HURT.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,208
- Stefany: ARE YOU OKAY?
- HUH?

152
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,583
WOW!

153
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,958
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

154
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,791
- ( laughs )
- HEY, STOP IT!

155
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,250
GET AWAY FROM ME!
( screams )

156
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,250
- ( thudding )
- AHH!

157
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,625
- SHOVE IT, YOU FREAK!

158
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,208
- YOU'RE A CREEP.

159
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,416
- THIS IS NOT THE WAY
A LADY SHOULD BE TREATED.

160
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,250
I AM APPALLED BY YOUR
LACK OF MANNERS.

161
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,083
- WE'RE LADIES TOO, YOU KNOW?
- OH, YEAH, I GUESS I FORGOT.

162
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
- HMPH!
- HA!

163
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,916
THIS LADY'S A SPECIAL CASE.
SHE SERVES AS A WARNING.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

165
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,708
- THEY MUST WANT
MY FAMILY'S MONEY.

166
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,916
THAT HAS TO BE IT.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,666
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY
ROB THIS TWO-BIT SALOON?

168
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,083
- HOW CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME,
MISS STEFANY?

169
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,291
I FAILED TO PROTECT YOU.
- DEPRESSING.

170
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,958
- I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
THINKING OF DEMANDING

171
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,666
ANYTHING TOO EXTRAVAGANT.

172
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,458
HOWEVER, IF IT'S POCKET MONEY
YOU WANT,

173
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,791
I'M SURE I CAN EASILY
GET THAT FROM MY DADDY.

174
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,458
- POCKET MONEY?
( growls )

175
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,958
- ( gasping )

176
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,250
DAMN YOU!
- ( screams )

177
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,208
- OH! I'LL KILL HER!
I'LL KILL YOU RIGHT NOW!

178
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,500
- KNOCK IT OFF, GENE.

179
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,208
- SHUT UP!
- MISS STEFANY!

180
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,250
- STOP!
- I'LL PULL THE TRIGGER!

181
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,958
I SWEAR JUST CRY!
SCREAM, DAMN YOU!

182
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,083
- ( glass breaks )

183
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,000
- ( strains )

184
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,041
( pants )
- CALM DOWN.

185
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,416
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
AHOLD OF YOURSELF, GENE.

186
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,416
- ( pants )

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,916
- ( sighing )

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,250
- ( whimpers )

189
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,833
- NOW YOU BETTER KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

190
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,375
'CAUSE NEXT TIME IT JUST
MIGHT BE ME WITH A GUN.

191
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,333
- CAN'T WE ALL 
JUST GET ALONG?

192
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,416
PEACEFUL LIKE?
- Both: HUH?

193
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,750
- OW OW OW!
- THIS WAS ALL YOUR DOING.

194
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,000
- I'M SORRY.  PLEASE STOP.
YOU'RE HURTING--

195
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,750
- YOU CREEP THE LIVING CRAP
OUT OF ME.

196
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,625
- ( grunting )
- SOMEBODY HELP ME.

197
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,208
- GUM?
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

198
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,916
- ( groans )

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,916
- IT COULDN'T BE.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,458
- ( menacing laughter )

201
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,250
( all laugh )

202
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,416
- Vostalk: YOU'RE USING THEM?!

203
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,375
- YES, THEY'RE A LOVELY
BUNCH OF MERCENARIES

204
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,833
WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING, EVEN KILL
THEIR VERY OWN FAMILIES,

205
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,708
JUST TO GET
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY.

206
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,916
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
QUITE SKILLFUL. 

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,416
BEST OF ALL, THEY HAVE
NO RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER.

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,875
THEY ARE THE PERFECT MEN
FOR THE JOB.

209
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,916
AND THEY'LL TAKE CONTROL
OF THE SITUATION.

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,625
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

211
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,333
- I TRUST THEY WON'T
ACCIDENTLY SHOOT MY DAUGHTER.

212
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,166
- NOW, THAT ALL DEPENDS ON
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU OFFER THEM.

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,416
THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

214
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,166
UNLESS YOU MAKE IT
WORTH THEIR WHILE,

215
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,583
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO TELL HER APART 

216
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,125
FROM A SAND ROACH.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT? 

217
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,625
- ( giggles )

218
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,375
- GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

219
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,125
BUT THEY BETTER NOT LAY 
A FINGER ON MY DAUGHTER.

220
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,166
- OKAY, GOT YOURSELF A TEAM.

221
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,250
NOW LET'S GET THIS
LITTLE PARTY UNDERWAY.

222
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,375
SHALL WE?

223
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,583
- ( gasping )

224
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
- GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD,
MORON!

225
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,416
- RIGHT.

226
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,708
- ( sighs )

227
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,250
- DAMN!
- all: HUH?

228
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,041
- ( gulping )
TIME IS RUNNING OUT,

229
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,125
YOU LITTLE WEASELS.

230
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,458
YOU ALL HAD BETTER HOPE
THE WAGON

231
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
AND MONEY GETS HERE.

232
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,833
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT ANY MORE DELAYS

233
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,583
OR I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GET ANGRY.

234
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,916
( roars )
- THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT, DENIM.

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,750
WE STILL GOT WORK TO DO.
- EXCUSE ME.

236
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,750
IF YOU RECEIVE THE MONEY
YOU'RE ASKING FOR,

237
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,708
WILL YOU PROMISE TO RELEASE
MISS STEFANY UNHARMED?

238
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,625
- IT'S ALL UP TO HER FATHER.

239
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,291
FOR HER SAKE, I HOPE HE
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

240
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,083
- KEEP IT DOWN.
THE SATELLITE'S ON.

241
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,041
( footsteps )

242
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,875
( whispers )

243
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,250
- VASH THE STAMPEDE?
- WHAT?

244
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,583
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

245
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,541
THE HUMANOID TYPHOON
IS IN THIS CITY.

246
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,333
- HEY, IF BIG MAN VOSTALK
OR THE SHERIFF

247
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,583
HIRES VASH THE STAMPEDE,
THE PARTY'S OVER.

248
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,583
WE'LL ALL BE DEAD
BEFORE SUNRISE.

249
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,083
- DON'T GO LOSING YOUR HEAD.

250
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,791
KEEP IT TOGETHER NOW, GUYS.
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

251
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,458
- HEY, LOOK, SOMETHING'S
COMING THIS WAY.

252
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,583
LOOK!
- SHUT UP!

253
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,291
I TOLD YOU TO STAY STILL!

254
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,500
- ALL RIGHT.

255
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,666
- IT'S HERE.
IT'S THE WAGON.

256
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,125
STAY DOWN!

257
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,125
- ALL RIGHT, HERE'S YOUR WAGON
AND 100,000$$

258
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,833
IN INCONSECUTIVE BILLS.

259
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
WE HAVE MET YOUR DEMANDS.

260
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,666
RELEASE YOUR HOSTAGES
IMMEDIATELY.

261
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,916
- NOT QUITE YET.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,541
FIRST, WE CHECK THE WAGON
AND THE MONEY.

263
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,958
AND YOU LISTEN UP!

264
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,916
TRY ANYTHING AND
THE HOSTAGES ARE DEAD MEAT!

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,416
GOT THAT?
- ( growls )

266
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,958
- I'LL GO.
- YOU BE CAREFUL.

267
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,500
- DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER
WILL HAND OVER THE MONEY

268
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,750
WITHOUT TRYING ANYTHING?

269
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,791
- MY DADDY WILL DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT ME,

270
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,208
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

271
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,125
STAN'S ANOTHER MATTER.

272
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,625
- IT'S A TRAP!

273
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,041
- ( gunfire )
- ( grunts )

274
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,333
- MARVIN!
- THAT BASTARD!

275
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,625
- GET BACK HERE, GENE!

276
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,958
OH, NO! GENE!

277
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:20,000
- ( all scream )

278
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,916
- ( laughter )

279
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,250
- NO!

280
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,291
- ( laughter continues )

281
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,458
- ( screams )

282
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,916
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- I THINK SO.

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,750
- IS THIS HOW THEY WORK
IN THIS TOWN?

284
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,125
THIS IS REALLY STUPID.
- YEAH, I'D SAY

285
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,916
IT'S A BIT OVERBOARD.
- LIKE I WAS GONNA SAY,

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,666
HE'S NOT EXACTLY 
A NORMAL SHERIFF.

287
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,250
- YOU!
- Girls: HUH?

288
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,750
- ( screams )
- OH NEVER MIND.

289
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,958
YOU PROBABLY
COULD HAVE SLIPPED

290
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,583
OUT OF THE ROPES AT ANY TIME,

291
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,125
BUT WHO IN THE HELL--
- ( gunshot )

292
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,291
( gunfire stops )

293
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,166
- ( rounds clink )
- HEY, MR. ROBBER MAN.

294
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,791
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US
YOUR PRETTY FACE?

295
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,916
- YEAH, WE'D BE HAPPY
TO MAKE IT A LOT PRETTIER

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,458
WITH SOME HOT LEAD SURGERY.

297
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,000
- ( gunfire resumes )
- ( whimpering )

298
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,458
- WHAT'LL WE DO NOW?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

299
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,083
- Mercenary:
SO CAN WE KILL HIM, HMM?

300
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
- YOU CAN KILL ANYONE
BUT THE GIRL!

301
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,916
- COOL.  ( laughs )

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
- STOP, I BEG YOU!

303
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,916
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT.

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,583
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

305
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,416
- SORRY, THE GUNFIRE'S
DROWNING YOU OUT.

306
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,541
( laughs ) HUH?!
- ( bang )

307
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,875
- ( single shot )

308
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,833
- ( gulps )

309
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,416
- YOU KNOW WHAT, FRIEND?

310
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,875
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU THAT
YOU LACK COMPASSION?

311
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,291
- ( whimpers )

312
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,750
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?!
JUST SHOOT THE GUY!

313
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,208
- WELL, TOUGH GUY,
SO I GUESS

314
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,583
YOU THINK YOU HAVE
A HOSTAGE NOW.

315
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,791
- JUST SHOOT HIM.

316
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,625
THEN WE'LL ALL MAKE
MORE MONEY ON THIS DEAL.

317
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,625
- REM.

318
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
- THIS GUY REALLY
IS A STUPID ASS!

319
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,750
- STAND BACK, EVERYBODY!

320
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,750
- ( screams )

321
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,166
- ( gunshot )

322
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,083
- ( laughs )

323
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,875
( growls )

324
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,000
( grunts )

325
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,916
- WHAT IN THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,250
- WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO SHOOT HIM?

327
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,666
- I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU DIDN'T SHOOT HIM.

328
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,916
- ME TOO, 'CAUSE I DON'T
LIKE PAIN VERY MUCH.

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,166
- ( sighs )

330
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,500
- NEVER MIND.
ARE YOU OKAY?

331
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,166
- ( groans )

332
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,666
- NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

333
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,500
THE SHERIFF NEVER
HAD ANY INTENTION

334
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,000
OF GIVING YOU ANY MONEY.

335
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,625
I'LL ASK DADDY
TO LET YOU GO FREE

336
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,916
IF YOU WILL PROMISE
TO JUST STOP ALL OF THIS.

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,750
- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN DO.
- WHAT?

338
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,166
I HAVE REASONS FOR
WHAT I'VE DONE HERE.

339
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,416
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE HUGE GRAVEYARD

340
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,416
ON THE NORTHEAST OUTSKIRTS
OF THE TOWN?

341
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,125
OUR PARENTS ARE BURIED
BENEATH THAT HELLISH WASTELAND

342
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,833
WHERE NOW EVEN
THE CORPSE WEEDS WON'T GROW.

343
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,416
I REMEMBER THEM WORKING
LIKE ANIMALS IN THE FIELDS,

344
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,250
COVERED IN DIRT.

345
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,750
FINALLY, AFTER TEN YEARS,

346
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,750
THEY MANAGED TO MAKE
THIS SANDY SOIL USABLE.

347
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,166
IT WAS AN AMAZING
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

348
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,708
- ( gunfire )

349
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,458
( shots fired )

350
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,708
- Ingway:
THEN ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO,

351
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,416
YOUR FATHER SHOWED UP

352
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,416
AND STOLE THE LAND
THOSE GOOD PEOPLE

353
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,416
SWEATED BLOOD TO PLOW.

354
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,875
HE EARNED THE NAME
"GRIM REAPER" VOSTALK

355
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,416
WHEN HE SLAUGHTERED
THEM ALL.

356
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,916
- YOU'RE LYING.

357
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,750
- AT THIS POINT,
LYING WOULD ACCOMPLISH NOTHING.

358
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,416
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

359
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,708
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I WILL NOT RUN AWAY.

360
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,125
HOWEVER, I WILL TAKE REVENGE

361
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,125
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
15 YEARS AGO.

362
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,291
MARK MY WORDS.

363
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,125
- Vash: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FORGET SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

364
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,625
- ( laughing )

365
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,083
- HUH?
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

366
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,750
- WHAT THE HELL?

367
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
- HEY, DON'T YOU WORRY.
WE'LL GET YOU SOME HELP, PAL.

368
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,500
- ( groans )

369
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,291
- AM I GONNA DIE?

370
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,375
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

371
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,708
THE BULLET
PASSED RIGHT THROUGH.

372
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,583
ATTENTION, I WILL NOW
DISCUSS THE DEMANDS

373
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,958
ON BEHALF OF THESE MEN

374
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,000
- Both: HUH?

375
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,750
- Stan: YOU'RE GOING?

376
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,083
- HE HAS MY OLDEST DAUGHTER.

377
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,708
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE,
BUT HEAR THIS, STAN.

378
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,000
WHEN ALL OF THIS IS OVER,

379
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,041
I WILL HOLD YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

380
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,291
- Stan: HE WAS FEARED
15 YEARS AGO

381
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,000
AS "GRIM REAPER" VOSTALK.

382
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,791
AMAZING HOW
THE LOVE OF A DAUGHTER

383
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,625
AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME
CAN CHANGE A MAN.

384
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,916
- YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT NOW.

385
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,666
IT'S TIME TO
RELEASE THE GIRL, INGWAY.

386
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,750
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO.

387
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,291
- IT'S NOT AN EASY THING
TO ESCAPE

388
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,833
FROM A PAST YOU CAN'T BURY.

389
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,416
- YOU CAN'T LOOK AWAY ANYMORE.

390
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,833
IT'S TIME YOU FACED THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

391
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,583
YOU CAN NO LONGER
REMAIN IGNORANT

392
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,250
OF THE HOPES OF THE PEOPLE 
BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE LIE

393
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,625
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
WAS BUILT UPON. 

394
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,208
- I AM AWARE OF THAT.
I AM AWARE OF THAT.

395
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,833
BUT EVEN IF IT IS TRUE,

396
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,625
THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THOSE HORRIBLE THINGS,

397
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,208
HE IS STILL MY DADDY.

398
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,416
NO MATTER HOW DISOBEDIENT
OR SELFISH I WAS GROWING UP,

399
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,291
HE WAS ALWAYS A WARM, DEDICATED,
AND LOVING FATHER TO ME.

400
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,500
- ( gunshots )

401
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,791
- ( trills )

402
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,916
- OH.

403
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,250
( groans )

404
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,541
- FATHER!

405
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,458
FATHER, I'M COMING!

406
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,041
DADDY, HOLD ON.

407
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,416
DADDY! DADDY!

408
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,833
PLEASE, DADDY, NO!

409
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,000
- I'M-- I'M ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

410
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,208
IT'S ONLY MY SHOULDER.

411
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,708
- ( Vash whimpers )

412
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,333
- Ingway:
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT?

413
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,250
- THANK YOU, INGWAY!

414
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,875
- LISTEN, I DON'T WANT YOU
THANKING ME FOR ANYTHING. 

415
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,208
I JUST SIMPLY GOT DISTRACTED.

416
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,791
IT THREW MY AIM OFF,
THAT'S ALL.

417
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,708
- ( whimpers )

418
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S REALLY CRYING.

419
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,625
SEE YOU LATER,
I'M TURNING MYSELF IN.

420
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,041
- Stan: WHOA, THERE.
IT'S TOO SOON FOR THE EPILOGUE.

421
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,041
- IT'S ALL OVER, STAN.

422
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,500
I'M GONNA GIVE MYSELF UP.

423
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,500
- NOT YET.
I STILL NEED YOU TO RESIST ME.

424
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
- WHAT?
- I NEVER DREAMED

425
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT I WOULD BE PRESENTED
WITH SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY.

426
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,250
I CAN SEE THE HEADLINES NOW.

427
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,541
"BESIEGED CRIMINAL 
KILLS MR. VOSTALK."

428
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,583
"SHERIFF FORCED TO
SHOOT CULPRIT DOWN

429
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,958
AS HE ATTEMPTS TO RESIST."

430
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,833
IT MAKES FOR
A PRETTY ARTICLE,

431
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,000
A REAL SHOWPIECE 
FOR MY SCRAPBOOK.

432
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,500
- NO, STAN.

433
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,583
- THE SHERIFF IS
A POSITION OF HONOR.

434
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,791
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

435
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,583
- 15 YEARS AGO,
THIS MAN

436
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,333
STOLE EVERY
RIGHT TO THIS TOWN.

437
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,958
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
JUST AS POWERFUL. 

438
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,541
YET I WAS STUCK
AS THE LOWLY SHERIFF.

439
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,416
I THINK I'M WAY PAST DUE

440
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,041
TO RECEIVE A LITTLE GLORY
AROUND THESE PARTS.

441
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,958
- YOU WERE IN ON IT.
- YOU ARE A FIEND.

442
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,500
- YOU'RE A SCOUNDREL.

443
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,458
- THROW DOWN YOUR 
WEAPONS RIGHT NOW.

444
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,000
YOU UNARMED STRAY DOGS,

445
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,125
HOW GRAND TO BE SUPERIOR.

446
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,250
- Vash: I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

447
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,375
TELL ME, HOW
DOES IT FEEL TO KILL

448
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,333
UNARMED INNOCENT 
PEOPLE LIKE THAT?

449
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,958
- AND I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

450
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,625
DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING
WHEN YOU BURN YOUR GARBAGE?

451
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
- NIFTY ANSWER.
SORRY I ASKED. 

452
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,666
H'YA!

453
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,541
- HUH?

454
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,333
WHAT? WHAT THE--

455
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,416
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

456
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
- HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT
THAT I WAS ARMED?

457
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,333
I DON'T REMEMBER TELLING YOU
ABOUT IT.

458
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,583
- REMEMBER, YOU HELPED ME
IN THE SALOON.

459
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,666
- ( gunshot )

460
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,666
- Vash: I CAN RECOGNIZE
THE SMELL

461
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,583
OF GUNPOWDER AND GREASE
INSTANTLY.

462
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,833
WELL, NOW.

463
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,000
- YOU BASTARDS.  I'LL--

464
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,333
- ( gun cocks )

465
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,958
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK, SHERIFF?

466
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,875
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE AT
THE MERCY OF A STRAY DOG, HUH?

467
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,958
- ( growls )

468
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,916
DIE!

469
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,625
( whimpers, grunts )

470
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,583
- YOU CAN RELAX, SHERIFF.
I'M NOT GOING TO KILL YOU.

471
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,541
HOWEVER, YOU...

472
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,000
- ( gunshot )

473
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,000
- ( clinks )

474
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,416
- ...NO LONGER HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BE SHERIFF.

475
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,750
- ( whimpers )

476
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,375
- WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
INTERESTING, SHERIFF?

477
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,083
REPEAT CAREFULLY AFTER ME!

478
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,125
- OKAY.
- THIS WORLD IS MADE...

479
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,833
- THIS WORLD IS--
- THIS WORLD IS MADE OF...

480
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,583
- THIS WORLD IS MADE OF--
- ( laughs )

481
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:42,125
- MADE OF LOVE AND PEACE!

482
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,708
- ( theme music plays )

483
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

484
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,375
- Vash: WHENEVER
SOMETHING IS GAINED,

485
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,291
SOMETHING IS ALWAYS LOST.

486
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,625
IT'S DIFFICULT TO LIVE
AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

487
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,875
WHAT IS LOST
WILL NEVER RETURN.

488
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,166
IMPORTANT THINGS,
IRREPLACEABLE THINGS,

489
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,375
BUT WHAT IS NEEDED
TO KEEP THOSE THINGS,

490
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,791
IS IN THE FIRM WILL,
PACKED IN THE ONE BULLET.

491
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,916
MAN KNOWS-- HE KNOWS THAT
NOTHING WILL BEGIN

492
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,125
UNLESS HE SPEAKS.

493
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:39,083
AND THAT NOTHING WILL CHANGE
UNLESS HE MOVES.
