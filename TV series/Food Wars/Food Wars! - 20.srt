Hm? What's wrong
with you, Megumi?

Seeing and tasting
Akira's curry...

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:12,966
It kind of knocked the wind
out of my sails.

[MEGUMI]
It's a little more than a month
till the Selection.

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,533
Trying to come up with
a dish that will rival
one as good as Akira's

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,033
in such a short amount
of time is nearly impossible!

9
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,266
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm freaking out!

10
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,566
At my family's restaurant,

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,566
back when I would watch my dad
working up close,

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,400
I hated to admit to myself,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,200
but I knew there was still
so much I needed to improve.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,866
And yet, he trusted me to come
up with a brand new menu item.

15
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,933
I was terrified.

16
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,666
Because I was still only
in sixth grade.

17
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,600
I wouldn't be able to handle
that kind of pressure!

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,166
Maybe...

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,533
But if all you do is worry about
what you need to improve on,

20
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,100
you'll never get anywhere.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,966
Like right now, you know...

22
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,266
I've really got nothin'
to lose here,

23
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,700
and everything in
the world to gain.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,533
There's no way I'm
givin' up my job at the shop,

25
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,966
or my food battles,

26
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,566
The only thing to do is
man‐up and tackle this.

27

Mm‐hmm!

28
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,533
Okay then... So spices
are gonna be important
for this theme,

29
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:14,233
of course, but I don't think
that'll be all it's about.

"Generally, about

Meat is my thing, after all.

I'd like to experiment
with my curry recipe...

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,540
Oh no! your duty is to
keep me entertained!

157

[FISHERMAN]
Yo!

158
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,273
Is that you, Megumi?!

159
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,307
Hey guys!
It's been a long time!

160
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,973
Hey, girlie, we heard
you's gonna be in
some big tournament

161
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,607
or somethin' or other!

162

It's like you're our shinin'
ray of hope 'round here!

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,207
You mean it?
Aw, c'mon, guys!

(Car honks)

165

Megumi!

00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,040
Welcome back, sweetie!

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,640
Hey, Mom! I'm home!

168
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:08,407
Y'know, it's been a long
time since you helped us
out in the kitchen, hon.

169
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,540
I think you've gotten even
better.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,873
I still have a long
way to go, Mother

171
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,840
I mess up
all the time,

172
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,940
and at training camp,
if Soma hadn't helped...

173

[MIYOKO]
Oh, I see.

174
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,773
So in the end, you just
let some man do it for you?

175
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,540
I thought you
were someone else.

176

<i>Miyoko Hojo said.</i>

<i>I'll need to fight on my own.</i>

179

(Yawn)

181
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,907
Hey, Soma.
Were you up all night?

182
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,907
Oh, hey there, Isshiki.
Good morning.

183
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,940
Ahhh... Look at all these
new dishes you've made!

184
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,773
Huh. This one's interesting.

185
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:31,873
Yes, it's VERY
interesting! Soma!

186
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:35,173
Yeah, but I'm just
gettin' started.

187
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:37,107
I've gotta... make
something even‐

[JUN]
Oh, Akira?

190
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,640
Were you up
all night again?

191
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,240
Yeah, and I've almost
perfected it...

192
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,807
The blend that will
be my secret weapon.

193
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:58,040
That's no good! It's not
healthy to keep pushing
yourself like this, Akira.

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,440
You're one to talk.

195
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,173
I see you work through
the night all the time, Jun.

196
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:04,173
Don't call me "Jun!"
It's "Professor Shiomi" to you!

197
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,873
And you have a bad habit of
falling asleep on the floor.

198
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,540
Y'know, you're pretty heavy
for a little pipsqueak.

199
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:15,107
I was worried about you!
I hope you lose this thing!

(Door slams)

201
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,007
I'm not going to lose.

202
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:22,240
Jun and I together form
an unbeatable combination.

203
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,140
We will show them all.

204
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:55,873
I'm sorry, Akira. I
forgot to water the
plants again. You mad?

205
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:56,673
I'm not mad...

I'm NOT mad...

I knew it! You're mad!

00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,140
Not. Mad!

Hey, Megumi!

How was your summer
vacation back home?

216
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,938
I wanted to try
and get ready in
my own way, but‐ Ah!

00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,171
Megumi, it's
been a while!

We're in the
same block, huh?

"Together"?

You idiot! We're competing
against each other!

And this time,
I'm not gonna lose!

in the same group as you.

But the two of us wish
you all the best

with the tournament
regardless.

Yeah,

00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:07,205
I wanted to feed
you a curry

delicious than your own.

Oh, take it easy.

255
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,305
[TAKUMI]
It's just the summer heat.

256
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:30,805
It always makes Isami
slim down a little.

257
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,038
THIS is 'cause of
the summer heat?!

258
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,438
Dude, I'm felling strong
as an ox; there's nothing
to worry about.

259
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,205
Once fall and winter
roll around,

260
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:40,705
I'll go back to my big,
beautiful, normal size.

[MEGUMI]
Really? This
happens every year?

262
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,171
[SOMA]
That can't
be healthy.

263
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,938
Anyway, you understand, right?

00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,238
That is my brother!

265
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:49,671
Now as I was saying
earlier, Soma... AH!

Attention all attendees,
we apologize for the wait.

Please direct your
attention to the stage
in front of you.

00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,405
Huh? What's going on?

00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,338
Oh, sorry, can
we talk later?

270
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,038
Huh? Uh... hey!

271
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:03,405
The competition
will kick off

272
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,638
with a few words
from our principal...

I can't believe
he's really here.

That old guy from
the opening ceremony.

AH!
(Coughing)

277
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,271
[URARA]
Um, Sir?

278
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,405
There's no need to worry.

279
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,305
A little something
in my throat.

280
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,638
Breathing in the air
in this auditorium,

281
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,338
one can sense, both in
body and spirit, the
drive in this building.

282
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,505
Even though it just
made him cough.

283
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,305
Shh!

284
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,171
This venue is also known as

285
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,771
the Celestial Room.

286
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,371
Originally, this room was only
allowed to be used

287
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,871
for the epic Food Wars between
the members of The Ten.

288
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:49,038
It has become tradition
that, to honor their
outstanding achievements,

289
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,105
we hang portraits of those who
have earned the No. 1 seat.

290
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,338
Woah, he's right.

291
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:56,138
<i>There's Chef Dojima...</i>

292
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,571
<i>And Chef Kojiro Shinomiya!</i>

293
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,371
<i>He was the No. 1 seat, too?</i>

294
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,671
Many battles were fought
and won in here,

295
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:05,071
and many specialties were born
and nurtured in this place.

296
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,805
Even now, they linger like
grains of sand.

297
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:12,538
They bring back the memories of
an unbroken chain of battles.

298
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,671
As was said...

299
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,438
The final battle
for the Fall Selection

300
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,071
will be held
in this auditorium.

301
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,905
In other words, those who make
it through prelims come back.

302
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,371
Yeah. There's going to be
some vicious cooking ahead.

303
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:27,605
This is your moment to shine!
The place where you will carve
out your part in history!

304
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,938
And so we meet
here once again...

305
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:34,571
eager participants of Tohtsuki
Academy's 92nd Selection!

306
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:38,471
(Wild cheers)

307
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,105
So, Takumi, what was it you
wanted to tell me earlier?

308
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,238
Just forget it.

309
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,638
Moving on,

310
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,938
I would like to go over
the preliminaries' rules.

311

Like it said in
your letters, the theme
will be curry cuisine!

The time limit is three hours.

313

Out of the 60 people chosen
for the preliminaries,

314
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,271
a total of eight will move
on to the final round.

315

Leaving the rest behind...

while only allowing
the best four students

from each block to proceed.

That's all that's
moving forward?!

319

of that many all at once?

in about one hour!

Let's go!

I've totally got this!

Aargh! I'm so nervous,
I can't stand it!

I'll see you here again,
at the final tournament!

330
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,705
Yeah!

331
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:35,905
Time to begin the cooking!

332
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,738
Glad you could make it.

333
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:01,171
I believe I told you
that the cooking will begin

334
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,571
at 11 am on the dot.

335
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,238
Really? You say that
knowing how difficult it is

336
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,505
for us to find just
one minute of free time.

337
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,871
Are you just oblivious to fame?

338
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,071
So, what do you have to say?

339
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:13,938
That's Natsume Sendawara!

340
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,505
She's known as the
"Queen of Curry," around Japan.

341
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,271
She rules the curry trade here.

342
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,171
Eizan managed to coax me
here as a judge today,

343
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,238
but I doubt mere students
will be able to provide

344
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,538
any entertainment
to my satisfaction.

345
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:28,271
Ugh. You could've just
contributed some money.

346
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,605
Did you say something?

Yes. Won't you please

such a major player...

That guy is a stud!

Her twin sister, Orie Sendawara!

Hey, Isshiki, my beautiful boy.

354
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,805
When will you finally leave this
place and join our company?

355
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,871
I want you to hurry up
and be my little play toy.

Hahaha! I'm still just a
young student, Madame.

Oh, that's all right!

358
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,638
You could drop out
of school now

359
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:05,605
and I'd make sure to look
after you forever!

360
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:08,571
[ORIE]
Think about it, Isshiki.

361
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,305
Think of all the scrumptious
things we could do together.

362
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:17,005
Well, for today, I hope you
can enjoy the cooking from our
brightest new freshman students.

00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:19,205
Awww... So be it.

00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,771
[ORIE]
Takumi Aldini... Is he Italian?

365
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:26,371
It seems he's using a stock of
beef shank and chicken bones.

366
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,705
Looks like pretty standard
fare so far.

367

That's his brother
right next to him...

Isami Aldini.

369
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,771
Hmm. Looks like he's filled
his pot with tomatoes.

370
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:39,671
Tomatoes are an essential part
of all Italian cuisine.

371
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm guessing he's going
to use his background...

372
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,538
It only makes sense.

373
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,138
MMMmmm!

374
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,938
This aroma is enveloping
my entire body!

Aha! Yeah!

Well? Just what does
she intend to make?

380
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:03,738
It's standard practice
to roast spices in oil,

381
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,805
but she's decided to suddenly
add water to the mixture.

382
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,638
Very interesting.

What's all that
huge equipment?

A blast chiller?
And a centrifuge?

what she plans on making
with those crazy gadgets!

successor to Hojo‐Ro,

the famous restaurant in
Yokohama's Chinatown?

400
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:54,138
Y'know, several of the spices
used in Chinese cooking overlap
with those used in curry.

I look forward to seeing
how she'll utilize them.

could do without that

in her recipe.

It's a spice zat will draw
out ze meat's natural aroma.

On top of that,

she's ground it coarse to
retain its rich aroma.

Fish head curry, eh?

00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:36,305
So? Who is your favorite
little freshman, Eizan?

463
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,571
Well. You know, uh...

464
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,005
It's hard to really narrow
it down, but...

465
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:45,838
there's only one cook out there
whose true skill I wish to see.

466
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,438
Huh?

467
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,071
Huh?

468
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,105
Huh?!

469
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:20,605
Ahh! Eh?!

470
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,438
[IKUMI]
<i>Soma?!</i>

471
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:25,171
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

472
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,238
<i>He's sleeping!</i>

473
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:31,638
(Light snoring)

474
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,238
[NATSUME]
I'm Natsume.

475
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:36,438
[ORIE]
And I'm Orie.

476
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:38,238
[BOTH]
Next time on Food Wars,

477
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:40,305
the twenty‐first course:

478
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:43,238
"That Which is
Known Yet Unknown"

479
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:45,771
Get excited about it!

480
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:47,971
Why won't you
shape them
like rabbits?

481
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:48,838
Huh...?

482
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:49,805
You're so
useless!

483
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,538
Huh...
