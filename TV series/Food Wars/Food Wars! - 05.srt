you're on the council of Ten?

<i>His dish. A peppered mackerel.</i>
<i>With a puree...</i>

30
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,206
So I'm guessing your
family's restaurant...

31
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,939
is in traditional
fine dining?

32
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,006
Interesting. Why would
you think that?

33
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:22,839
Because peppered mackerel
is normally found on
that type of menu.

34
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,739
Plus, you can't learn to
prepare this kind of thing
at just any old restaurant.

I will use mackerel as
the ingredient, too.

It's one of our most
popular dishes.

And just like your dish,
mine will have a spring

a slightly different
version using mackerel.

Salted seaweed tea.

It's bold, but its
lightly salted flavor

should finish out
the meal perfectly.

Huh?!

104

It's time to learn, kids:

105
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:34,106
Poele is a French method
used to cook protein.

106
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,739
It is a style of saute.

107
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,606
[ISSHIKI]
Olive oil is poured on
top of the protein,

108
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,972
basting it if you will, giving
it a consistent browning.

109
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,772
Would you mind telling me,
Young Soma?

110
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,139
Where did you happen to learn
your French cooking techniques?

111
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,172
From my dad. He's my mentor.

112
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,172
He taught me how
to cook like this.

113
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:54,806
He said it's perfect for making
fish nice and crispy.

114
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,806
[SOMA]
The crunchiness goes great
on a bed of rice,

115
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:01,606
or you can add seaweed tea
to give it a whole different
texture.

116
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,672
It all depends on what
you're trying to do.

117
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,139
Hm...

118
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,306
So, it appears your father
has studied French cuisine?

I'm not sure, I couldn't really
tell you anything about that...

he's studied in several
different countries, though.

00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,439
Huh?!

160
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:19,672
<i>What the heck?</i>
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

161
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,339
Uh! Uhhh...

00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:27,406
Hoh...

[YUKI]
Zenji? Zenji! Zenji!

164
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,272
Hey.

165
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,839
He's not waking up, is he?

166
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,806
Doesn't look
like it.

167
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:39,206
(Aoki and Sato groan)

168
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,672
Okay, time to go!

169
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,972
We'll definitely clean
up next time, dude.

170
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:46,939
Totally, next time
for sure, bro‐chinski.

171
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,639
(Yuki hums)
(Megumi whimpers)

172
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:50,672
(Yawn)

173
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,572
[MEGUMI]
Okay, so why did
Isshiki decide

174
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,739
that he wanted to do a
cooking battle tonight?

175
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,239
Beats me. Who ever knows
what he's thinking?

176
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,672
There's really no point in
wondering what a freak‐a‐zoid
like him is thinking anyway.

177
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,272
[AOKI]
So sleepy!

178
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,106
[YUKI]
Well, goodnight,
Megumi.

179
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,706
[MEGUMI]
Yeah, goodnight.

180
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,072
[ISSHIKI]
Well, Young Soma,

181
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:12,806
With these festivities,
you are officially

182
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:14,972
one of us here at Kyokusei.

183
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,439
(Yawn)

184
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,406
If you have any concerns,
do not hesitate to ask.

185
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:22,039
In that case...

186
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,506
How does someone
join the Ten?

187
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:25,606
Hm?

188
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,172
(Laugh)

189
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,806
[ISSHIKI]
Oh, yes!

190
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,406
You ARE out to take
the top spot

191
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,239
at the Academy,
aren't you?

192
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,872
So I must ask you then...
what keeps you so motivated?

193
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:45,139
[SOMA]
The truth is, my dad and I are
kind of at odds at the moment.

194
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,439
Unless I can become
a member of The Ten,

195
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,506
he won't acknowledge
what I can do.

196
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:53,106
That battle we just had
may have been a draw, but...

197
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,272
If I do end up
beating you...

198
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:59,606
would that make me
the new Tohtsuki No. 7?

199
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:02,372
Heh.

200
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,272
This is wonderful!
WHA?!

201
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,239
You have such powerful
ambition, Young Soma!

202
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,572
[ISSHIKI]
I'm so ridiculously
moved right now!

203
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:13,272
That's exactly what
it takes for a student
to thrive here at Kyokusei!

204
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,106
Uh... Okay...
(Gleeful yelling)

205
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,172
[ISSHIKI]
Alas, we must postpone that
discussion for another day.

206
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,739
It's getting
pretty late.

207
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,506
We should probably get
some rest, okay?

208
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:24,972
Yeah... I guess
you're right.

209
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,772
<i>Take the top spot</i>
<i>at Tohtsuki, huh?</i>

210
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:33,172

<i>of those words will</i>
<i>soon become clear.</i>

211
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,906
[SOMA]
So, um, my name's Soma Yukihira.

212
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:39,139
And well, to be honest it's an
honor to attend this school.

213
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,339
As a stepping stone
in my career.

214
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,072
I might as well
take the top spot.

215
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:47,506
<i>Young Soma, you will</i>
<i>come to learn...</i>

216
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:52,739
<i>at this school,</i>
<i>cooking is everything.</i>

217
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,606
[ERINA]
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

218
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:14,739
Make me one proper dish.

219
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,406
Those whose plate impresses
me may transfer.

220
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,272
All others will be forever
banned from the Academy.

221
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,072
Shut up and give me
that bowl, you idiot!

222
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,739
DISGUSTING!

223
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,339
I'll make myself clear:

224
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,272
I do not approve
of this decision.

225
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,506
Not of you and not of
your peasant cooking!

226
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,872
"Take the top spot," will you?
Don't make me laugh.

227
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,606
[ERINA]
All the students who've advanced
from the middle school division

228
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,439
have learned cutting‐edge
gastro techniques!

229
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,972
You don't have nearly
enough training for this.

230
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,139
There's no way you
can measure up to them.

231
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,839
Have fun trying
to play catch up!

About how challenges work

[GODABAYASHI]
We of the Chanko Stew Society

273
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:56,306
have a long and noble history,
stretching back to the
Academy's very founding.

274
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,772
And yet, Erina Nakiri,
you wish to demolish it.

275
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,839
In order to build
what exactly?!

276
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,872
A cooking annex
for my personal use.

277
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:07,039
My fifth kitchen
has gotten a wee bit
crowded for my taste‐

278
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,072
How dare you!

279
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,606
That grand
historic building

280
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,406
is home to a long
passion for eating

281
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:14,006
fostered by the students
of Tohtsuki Academy!

282
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,572
It's not for you
to toss aside!

283
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,339
How can you even
call yourself a chef?!

[SUMO 1]
Yeah, that's right!

(Sigh)

287
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,972
Trying to imitate the recipes
of those senior students,

288
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:29,406
while also squandering
away your budget...

289
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,606
Is that YOUR grand idea
of "passion"?

290
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:32,806
Uh?!

291
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,206
These past
few years,

292
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,872
you've contributed
little of value.

293
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:39,372
A society that
merely praises its
past accomplishments

294
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,472
isn't needed
here at Tohtsuki.

You are always quick to
flaunt your authority...

Someone needs to put
you in your place!

297
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,472
If I beat you, you will step
down from the council!

298

I challenge you!
Let's go Erina Nakiri!

299
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:55,806
And if I win, construction
continues as planned.

Ready, Godabayashi?

301
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,539
Let the battle begin.

302
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,539
[ISSHIKI]
Here at the Academy,
there's a system

303
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,806
for resolving disputes
between students.

304
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,939
And it involves following
a few specific rules.

305
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,506
[ISSHIKI]
You may challenge me for
the No. 7 seat if you wish,

306
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:20,539
but the guidelines state that
you must offer something
of corresponding value.

307
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,139
What would be considered
"corresponding value"?

308
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,406
For something to the level
of losing my council seat...

309
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,839
Even you being expelled
wouldn't be adequate.

310
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,106
Guh! Why not?!

311
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,306
That's right.

312
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,406
That's how much weight

313
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:33,806
the Council of Ten carries.

314
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,272
[FUMIO]
After all,

00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:37,572
they're the highest
decision‐making body on campus.

316
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:42,972
Not even the teachers can
go against a ruling made
by the Council of Ten.

317
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:48,772
In the past, residents from
this very dorm would join the
prestigious Ten every year.

318
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:52,139
It was truly the Golden Age
of Kyokusei's dormitory.

319
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,572
By comparison, you're all
just pathetic losers.

320
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,772
Aww, Ms. Fumio, you
don't really mean that.

321
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,506
I guess that
would be that...

322
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,539
You could battle me only
if I accepted the challenge,

323
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,272
and to be honest I would not
prefer you leaving the school.

324
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,839
Put simply... this challenge
is not going to happen.

325
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,406
Are you serious?

326
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:14,172
But I've been up since 5 in
the morning all ready to go!

327
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,706
In any case,
going for the No. 7 seat...

328
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:18,106
...is too ambitious!

329
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,139
They'd probably
think you were
some kinda idiot.

330
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,872
[ISSHIKI]
And it's not like you can
just challenge people on a whim.

331
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,306
Hm?

332
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:26,506
There are three things you
need to challenge someone.

333
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:31,039
First off: You need authorized
officials to declare the
challenge valid.

334
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,172
Second: An odd number of judges.

335
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:38,239
And third: The agreement of both
parties as to the conditions of
the challenge.

336
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,006
Only then will things
start to come together.

337
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:43,406
Oh man, that seems like
a lotta hassle.

338
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:45,372
[ISSHIKI]
However, the upside is...

339
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:46,872
When the conditions are met,

340
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:49,606
you are free to battle anyone
who attends the school.

341
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,406
(Light gasp)

342
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:55,206
[ISSHIKI]
"Any and all challengers must be
put down through cooking."

343
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,439
That is Tohtsuki's traditional,
one‐on‐one battle mantra.

344
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,506
And it has become known as:

345
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,339
"Food War"!

346
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,739
[JUDGE 1]
A judgment has been reached!

347
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,706
In this Food War,
the victor is Erina Nakiri!

348
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,706
(Crowd cheers)

349
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,939
No... What the hell?!

350
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,239
How can this be?

351
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,206
[GODABAYASHI]
But the... Stew Society...

352
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,072
What is the matter
with you people?

353
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:24,639
What was wrong with
my lobster hotpot, huh?

354
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,239
Uwaahh...

355
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:34,772
Ah...

356
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:38,372
(Bubbles churning)

357
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,806
Ahh...

[ERINA]
Godabayashi...

362
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,872
your dish fails on 27 points.

363
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,672
First, there's the lobster.

364
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,006
You blanched it for
two seconds far too long.

365
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,272
Ehh!

366
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,139
[ERINA]
Next, the oysters produced

367
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,306
a slight off‐flavor that
affected the whole dish.

368
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,206
Guh! Shut up!

369
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,039
As for how the vegetables
were treated‐

370
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,306
Shut your mouth!

371
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,839
Do you really think
what you made

372
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,306
is that much better
than mine?

373
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,206
I have been perfecting
that dish for weeks,

374
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,472
just for this challenge!

375

AH! Ooooh!

377

[ERINA]
Well, Godabayashi?

378
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,039
Huh?!

379
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,772
What do you say to my
langoustine ravioli?

380
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:05,839
[GODABAYASHI]
<i>The ravioli is steamed</i>
<i>light and fluffy,</i>

It's me. I won.

Huh?
[ERINA]
Take it down.

"Food Wars," huh?

Okay then. I was kinda hoping
to challenge Erina Nakiri...

00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,739
Uh. There's no way you
could ever beat her, Soma.

I look forward to seeing
how things play out.

I am certain he will achieve
some impressive victories.

403
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:33,272
After all, he was able to
cook to a draw against me,
the No. 7 seat.

404
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,739
I'm sure you see it too,
don't you, Shun?

405
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,439
Tch. Too early
to tell.

406

You don't seem to be
taking this very seriously.

You didn't even serve
your specialty.

definition of playing it safe.

Don't be silly, my friend.

into making that dish special.

Defeating that toad
is nothing to brag about.

The entire ordeal
was a disappointment.

less than perfection.
