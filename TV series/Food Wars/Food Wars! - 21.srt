I see you've added a paste of
apples, bananas, and carrots.

12

Interesting. It will give the
rice a thickness, making it

I was experimenting

he could take a mezzaluna,

and slice noodles so perfectly!

What does that girl
think she's doing?

Slicing the meat
while it hangs.

Yes, I already know that.

76
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,878
The skin of the
monkfish is covered with
a gelatinous substance,

77
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:08,844
so it's hard to prepare on
a cutting board.

78
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:12,044
She's using the traditional
method to break it down.

But still...

80
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:14,911
Because it's hangin'
in mid‐air

81
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,478
without a stable surface,

82
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,911
it takes a special skill to be

00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,735
And if I win,
from now on...

303
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:37,302
you won't get within 50 meters
of my treasured Miss Erina!

304
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,069
Being at her side
to bask in her glow...

305
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:44,002
while being subjected
to her verbal cruelties
is my dream!

306
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:49,302
Oh all the foul obscenities
that would pour forth from
her godlike tongue...

307
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,302
(Sinister laugh)

308
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,969
But we have already
battled for that privilege.

309
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,835
I have beaten you.
And quite decisively.

310
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,902
Yes...

311
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,535
But since that time...

312
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,935
I've had to view her divinity
through binoculars...

313
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:07,469
and have resorted to
sending my beautiful angel
just 30 sad letters a day.

314
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,502
<i>I should have made that</i>
<i>off‐limits as well.</i>

315
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:14,735
But if I publicly annihilate you
at this Fall Selection,

316
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,235
Miss Erina may well have a
change of heart.

317
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,235
She will let me
walk by her side
forever more.

318
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,635
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Look! Miss Erina's
assistant is next!

319
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,935
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
I bet she'll put out
an awesome dish!

320
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,402
[HISAKO]
Please enjoy.

321
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:32,102
[ORIE]
The roux looks watery
and lacking thickness.

322
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:34,535
This looks more akin
to a soup curry.

323
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,602
This meat is mutton,
is it not?

324
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:41,602
[KITA]
Though from the same
animal, it has a
stronger smell than lamb,

325
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,569
but the spices should
mask the odor.

326
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,135
[ORIE]
Odor!

327
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:52,069
(Cackle)
The effects of my cooking
still linger on, don't they?

328
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,402
<i>That, my dear, is my curse!</i>

329
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,469
<i>My curse upon you, Hisako!</i>

330
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,502
Well, I guess we should
give this dish a try.

331
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,535
<i>This is...</i>

332
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,169
OH!

333
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,069
Is everything okay over
there, Mister Ando?

334
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,535
Uh...

335
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:11,769
What?

336
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:15,602
Wh‐what?!

337
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:16,702
This from Ando,

338
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,569
the man who actually
mutters unintelligibly,

339
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:20,835
actin' like some
uprooted, withered tree.

340
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,169
I don't know what's going on,

341
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,635
but now you're starting
to sound like someone

342
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,602
in a kung fu movie!

343
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,169
[ANDO]
This unique aroma... It's...

344
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,935
Fuuwaaa...

345
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:33,635
Angelica! Rehmannia!
Lovage! And peony!

346
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,635
This dish uses the four
main ingredients

347
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,035
of Chinese herbal medicine
as its main base!

348
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:41,269
It's the Four Pillars of
Herbalism!

349
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,435
When devoured all at once,

350
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,202
the Four Pillars
do great things.

351
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:49,235
They can instantly bring
people back from the grips
of death's hands!

352
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,635
[KITA]
Of course!

353
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,502
She must have infused them
along with the spices!

354
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,469
Yes. That's her
specialty after all.

355
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,269
Hisako Arato: the Expert
of Medicinal Cooking!

356
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,769
[ALICE]
It's a discipline
based in Eastern medicine.

357
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,535
The combination of techniques
creating nourishing food

358
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,835
infused with natural drugs and
herbs used in Chinese remedies.

359
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,269
A fusion of food, medicine,
and pharmacology...

360
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,535
My original spice
mixture contains

361
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:20,102
ginger, star anise, and a
dash of fennel thrown in.

362
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,102
I added that to four more
medicinal ingredients.

363
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:27,935
I boiled those spices about
an hour earlier to draw
out their medicinal properties.

364
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:32,002
And then, I added the
vegetables and mutton and
let them simmer until moist

365
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,569
and the flavors seeped in.

366
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,635
Shaoxing rice wine and coriander
elevated the aroma profile.

367
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,069
Ahh...

368
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,769
Come to think of it,

369
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,169
curry and medicinal foods

370
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,169
have a lot in common with
each other, don't they?

371
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:46,769
[KITA]
Kyo‐o is turmeric.

372
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,235
Dai‐i‐kyo is star anise.

373
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,135
Sho‐i‐kyo is fennel.

374
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:55,402
All these spices are
absolutely essential in
making a great curry!

375
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,569
So that was her goal here.

376
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,902
A blending of curry
and medicinal cooking!

377
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,102
My brand of medicinal cooking:

378
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,902
brings forth a
"Four‐Pillar Mutton Curry"!

379
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:07,102
Ah! I can feel it! It's true!

380
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:10,935
The energy from this medicinal
meal is racing through my body!

381
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,635
AHHH!

382
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,835
<i>It's superb!</i>

383
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:20,402
<i>The flavor of the mutton is</i>
<i>heightened by the spices,</i>

384
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,935
<i>and the vegetables have</i>
<i>absorbed the roux,</i>

385
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,669
<i>becoming sweet and</i>
<i>velvety smooth!</i>

386
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,835
Thanks to the Four Pillars,

387
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:31,669
the body feels warmed the
second you take a bite!

388
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,935
Definitely. Medicinal food
is said to aid the kidneys
and lend strength...

389
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,435
as well as rid the
body of toxins.

390
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,502
[KITA]
It's the perfect balance of
flavor and aroma!

391
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,602
This is incredibly well done!

392
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,135
It not somethin' you'd expect
a student to prepare!

393
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,902
This is divine singularity.

394
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:52,602
Eating this curry makes
the last dish look like
a simple indulgence.

395
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,835
AHHH!

396
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,635
I‐it can't be...

397
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:59,902
I thought my dark curry
and my wickedness had made
slaves of the judges!

398
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:02,035
Here you go, Ms. Nao.

399
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,269
Once you eat some,
you will soon understand

400
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,402
the stark difference in
level between you and me!

401
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,869
<i>Hesitation... Chaos...</i>

402
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:19,635
<i>THAT is the essence</i>
<i>of my cooking, and yet...</i>

403
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,335
<i>It's all being washed away.</i>

404
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,835
<i>I'm being cleansed!</i>

405
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,935
<i>Stop it!</i>

406
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,769
My family has had a long
relationship with Chinese
medicine.

407
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,835
I've incorporated all
that into my cooking,

408
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,402
so that I could help Miss Erina,

409
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:54,769
who has been forced into
hardship from such a young age.

410
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,935
That is the source of my
medicinal cooking.

411
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,002
In the palaces of
ancient China,

412
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:03,269
emperors were assigned a
medical diet called
"gastric health,"

413
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,702
which was the introduction
of medicinal food.

414
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,835
To me, Miss Erina is the only
empress I will serve.

415
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:13,735
Nao Sadatsuka, your
cooking shows you only
think of yourself to impress.

416
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:17,535
You have no right to
serve the divine Miss Erina!

417
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,135
Stay far away.

418
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:20,302
And get up.

419
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:23,135
So then, Hisako Arato's
score is...

420
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,002
92 points!

421
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:26,769
(Cheering)

422
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,469
This is so insane!

423
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,869
That's why Miss Erina has
chosen her to be her aide!

424
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,302
That's over 90 points!

425
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:35,302
[SCHOOLBOY 4] She easily
beat Sadatsuka's score!

426
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:39,935
(Laughing)

427
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:43,335
My Big Sister, Miss Hisako!

428
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,235

Now this is a match to watch!

430
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,169
I really want
to beat you.

431
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,769
You think you can handle
something like that?

432
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:23,969
Hmph!

433
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,069
I'll give you a shot,

Next time, on the twenty‐second
course of Food Wars...

436
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:40,169
It will be me who

"That Which Transcends
