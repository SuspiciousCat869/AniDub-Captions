00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,511

[GIN]
But... for now she's
just raw material.

162
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,011
Tohtsuki is an inhuman,
demonic realm

163
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:20,511
where those of talent are
gathered only to eat one
another.

164
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:22,844
It's a long way down
at this academy.

165
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:26,078
Sharpen your fangs, kid,
'cause you're gonna need them!

You may have be able
to beat me this round,

169
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,444
but next time will be
a different story‐ AAGH!

of your body while your here.

175

176

Well yeah. Chef Gin Dojima.

happily shaking his hand

Man, I'm freakin' exhausted
after that 50‐course challenge!

189
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:26,178
I can't believe we were all
able to make it through.

190
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,711
This is gonna go on
for another four whole days?

191
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:31,478
The name "training camp
from Hell" was no joke.

192
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,278
Still, now that we're getting to
relax,

193
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:36,244
it kinda makes you
want to get back out there
and do it again, right?

You brought
your little ducky?

Oh! Hehehe.

Well, I thought that I'd
let him go on a trip too.

Oh My...

So, uh...What's going on?

200
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,644
[YUKI]
Looks like the
dumplings are ready.

201
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,011
Aren't they,
Lady Ryoko. OW!

202
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,944
Perfectly plump and
tender and ready to eat!

Oh, not you too.

Oh! He IS on a trip.
Huh?!

I swear. You guy are the worst.

Okay, girls...

What do you say
we get going?

211
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:12,844
Time to get back to

I dunno...
This place is so upscale

216

I'm not sure if I can
handle a bed that soft!

very ladylike.

Then please listen to my
tired, withered body.

Why do you knuckle‐draggers
always get together in MY room?!

The day caught up
with them all at once.

I guess we'll just leave 'em
till it's lights out.

You're not getting
tired yet, Megumi?

241
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,644
I guess you always go
to bed pretty early

242
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:24,444
so that you'll be ready
for the next day, huh?

243
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,578
Yeah well...
It's kinda weird, isn't it?

I'm exhausted, but I'm
not that sleepy, y'know.

00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:32,011
Well, it was a
pretty stressful day,
that's for sure?

246
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:36,944
It certainly was,
too much so at times,
but I'm not sure that's it.

247
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:41,278
I mean, I'm always so nervous
during our class lessons...

248
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:46,178
And if I mess something up,
I get really flustered
about what I should do.

249
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,411
But today, you were
there to support me, Soma.

You're welcome, Ma'am!

00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:58,044
Like maybe with you I've been
getting just a little
bit more confident.

my heart pounding.

[MEGUMI]
Ah!

255
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:07,078
But wait! It's only because
Soma told me everything
that I was supposed to do.

256
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,844
I'm not trying to say that
I'm great or anything!

You guys know I
wouldn't do that! Right?

No, you got
it all wrong.

If you hadn't gotten all
of those ingredients,

we couldn't have
made our perfect dish.

And you were able
to prepare 'em flawlessly.

When you put your mind to it,
just look at what you can do.

263
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:25,344
You should be more confident
in yourself, okay?

264
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,778
Mm‐hmm.

to get Chef Shinomiya?

30 people home yesterday.

[NARRATOR]
A terrine with nine
types of vegetables.

285
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,167
The multitude of vegetables
gives it a beautiful, vibrant
appearance.

286
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:45,267
Each of the nine varieties
requires different preparation
and heating techniques.

287
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,167
None of the vegetables' flavors
can be overpowering or
underwhelming.

288
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:53,334
And weaving those flavors
together is an extremely
difficult task.

To give you a chance,
I've chosen one of my
relatively easier recettes.

a piece of advice:

It would be sensible of you...

was wrong, um, with my dish?

Well. Your cauliflower
was a little off,

387
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,333
so you used wine vinegar
to boil it, is that correct?

388
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:10,266
Vinegar acts as a bleaching
agent, so it preserved
the color nicely.

389
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:14,233
The aftertaste of the vinegar
accentuated the sweetness
of the cauliflower.

390
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,233
The vegetables' sweetness
and the slight acidity
of the vinegar

391
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,966
created a perfect match,
flavor‐wise.

the recette that said to
accentuate the acidity? Hmm?

398

a different dish altogether.

substandard cauliflower...
