[TEACHER 1]
It'll be finished today.

Hmm...

00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,800
Some will prove
zey are worthy...

destined to fail...

"Overnight training"?

00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,833
So it's that
time, is it?

12
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,333
So what is this?

13
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,566
[RYOKO]
We had those in elementary
and middle school.

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,600
It was an outing where we
stayed outside for a few days.

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
[SOMA]
Okay...

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,033
So this is one of those

Eh?

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,833
What's wrong
with you, Megumi?

20
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,333
Because she knows...

21
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,766
this training camp
is like a trip to hell.

22
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,966
And we all have to face it
to survive.

Hm...

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,366
All of the freshmen
students

25
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,266
get sent to
the mountains

26
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,866
and are subjected
to a whole bunch
of brutal tests.

If you don't manage
to pass everything...

They say it's for
"the spirit of friendship,"

but the truth of it is...

31
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:41,766
This training is for the spirit
of pain and torture and failure!

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,600
It's not that bad. Just a
little "Competitive education".

[ISSHIKI]
In the words
of the principal,

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,566
this is when the process reveals
the best of the best among us.

35

Yo, bro, didn't you
go to that training
camp last year?

How'd you survive?

37
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,600
Very carefully.
Even back then,

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,300
dozens of students were forced
to leave the premises,

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,933
and a few others
were even expelled.

40

What? Expelled?!

41
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,633
At the camp a few years ago...

42
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,833
they apparently got rid of more
than half the students.

allowed to bring our
cards or even shogi.

But not our cellphones.

Wait a second here.

This isn't enough time
for us to bathe! C'mon!

Hey, Soma!

How can you be worried
about your bath schedule

at a time like this?!

Did you not just here Megumi
say her dying words?!

56
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,966
Half the students will
make it through, right?

00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,800
We'll just make sure
that includes all of us.

breaking a sweat!

the hotels around here.

shock me at all!

00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,000
Huh?

160
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,400
[KOJIRO]
Yes, you.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,566
You're expelled.

162
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,566
You may leave now.

163
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,866
Wha‐?!

164
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,233
Your hair product has
a citrus aroma to it.

165
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,466
[KOJIRO]
That would mask the scent
of your cooking, yes?

166
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,100
Obviously, I know it's
important to look good.

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,433
A swarthy‐looking chef will
lessen the appeal of his food.

168
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:35,733
Perhaps next time,
you should choose an
unscented hair product.

169
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm expelled?!
Seriously?!

170
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,233
For something like that?

171
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,200
"Something like that" can be
enough to lose customers.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,066
Ya little troll.

173
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you out to destroy
my restaurant?

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
Hnn!

175
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,866
That'll be all.
Get out of my sight.

176
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,433
Uh...
(Whimpers)

177
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,666
Who was that?

178
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,433
Chef Kojiro Shinomiya!

179
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:01,166
He's the first Japanese chef
to ever win France's
Brousse‐Poiret Award!

180
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,566
And over there...

181
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,166
is Chef Fuyumi Mizuhara
from "Ristorante F"!

182
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:09,766
And from sushi restaurant
"Ginza Hinowa,"
Chef Hitoshi Sekimori!

183
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh wow! All these
chefs are featured in top
magazines almost every month!

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,266
[GOTODA]
Just as unassuming
as a Dutch clover!

185
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,200
[ZENJI]
From Auberge "TrÃ©sor,"
that's Donato Gotoda!

186
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,900
I was put on this earth just so
I could lay my eyes upon you.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Care to go back
to my auberge...

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,366
where we can talk
til the sunrise?

189
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,900
Huh? I, uh...
S'cuse me what was that?

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,566
[HINAKO]
Oh leave her alone,
Chef Gotoda.

191
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,366
Hmm. Hinako...

192
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,766
[ZENJI]
That's Hinako Inui from
the Japanese restaurant
"Kiri‐no‐ya"!

193
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:43,133
(Giggle) Oh sweetie,
that must have been
very frightening for you.

194
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,400
You certainly are
adorable, aren't you?

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Goodness, you look
like a tasty little
dish indeed.

196
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,433
Huh? Huh?!

197
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,766
Hinako...

198
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,500
(Angry growl)
[GOTODA]
Master Chapelle is scowling.

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,733
Let's go back.

200
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,933
[HINAKO]
Oh!

201
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,300
Come by my
restaurant anytime.

202
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,233
HOOKAY...

203
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,200
That's him! Oh my God!

204
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,400
[ZENJI]
He took the top spot
on his graduation exam

205
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,366
with the highest
score in history!

206
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,500
That man turned down
over 800 offers

207
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
from first‐class restaurants
all over the world

208
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,933
(Crowd gasps)
just to be in his
current position.

209
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:18,833
He's the Executive Chef of the
Tohtsuki Resort chain and sits
on the board of directors:

210
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,433
Gin Dojima!

211
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,533
I am freaking out!

212
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,000
The elite chefs making a name
for Japanese cuisine...

213
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
are all right here
in front of us!

214
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,000
Welcome, students...

215
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,966
to the illustrious
Tohtsuki Resort.

216
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:39,866
All the graduates you see
before you are chef‐owners,
masters of their domains.

217
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,933
For the six days you're here,

218
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:46,633
we are going to be treating
you exactly as if you were
employees at our restaurants.

219
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,533
Do you know what that means?

220
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,433
Anyone who does not
perform to our liking...

221
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,166
is done!

222
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,466
Meaning, you're expelled.

223
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,233
(Gulp)

224
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,833
[GIN]
As you have seen,

225
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,900
your teachers have the power
to send you home at any moment.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
I wish you good fighting.

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now then, you know
your groups...

228
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:06,933
Get moving!

229
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,166
Even though we're split up,
let's do our best.

230
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,133
I'm stuck in the same
group as you again?!

231
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,533
Got a problem
with that, bro?!

232
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,633
I'll see ya.

233
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,966
Later!

234
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh, let's play poker in
Zenji's room later on.

235
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,133
Don't even think
about using my room
for any of your bullcrap

236
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,200
at a time like THIS!

237
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,066
[RYOKO]
So, you wanna taste?

238
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,600
[YUKI]
I sure do!

239
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,733
(Gasp)

240
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:42,687
[HINAKO]
Okay, looks like we're all here.

241
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:47,553
For this exercise, I would
like to have you pair up
and work in teams.

242
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,553
You'll be in the same
pairs as your first lecture
of the semester,

243
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,320
so please head to
your labelled stations.

244
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,620
Thank the freakin' comsos!

245
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,387
I'm so glad to be
paired with you again.

246
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,820
Yeah, it's gonna
be great.

247
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,187
You're Soma Yukihira,
aren't you?

248
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,553
Huh?
Yeah, that
would be me.

249
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,887
Hehehe.

250
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,820
Uh, that's over 10 seconds
of foot‐grinding.

251
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
I'm guessing you're trying
to get my attention.

252
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,187
Yes, I am.

253
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:15,387
[TAKUMI]
I've been hoping to cross

254
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,220
paths with you, buddy...

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,553
But I never thought
I'd get the chance

256
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,420
on our very
first challenge!

257
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,453
I look forward
to crushing you!

258
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,253
Just like how
I crushed your shoe.

259
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:25,320
Uhh...

260
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,487
Um, guys?

261
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,120
This is already
a difficult camp!

262
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,153
It is neither the time nor the
place for trying to pick fights!

263
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:32,553
Now I can finally
destroy you!

264
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,887
I'm glad it gets to be
me who's gonna do it!

265
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,153
Is that so?

266
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,653
Well I'm real happy for you.

267
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,587
But if you don't move your foot,
I'm gonna break it off.

268
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,687
[HINAKO]
Okay, everyone!

269
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,820
[ALL]
Huh?

270
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,720
I will be sitting right
here the whole time.

271
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,553
If there's anything you don't
understand, please ask.

272
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:51,553
Um, Chef?

273
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,220
You haven't given
out any instructions

274
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,653
on what you'd like
for us to cook, yet. Uh...

275
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:57,187
Oh, I guess not.

276
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,387
Okay!

277
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,620
Um, my challenge
for you today...

278
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,653
Is to use the
ingredients here to
make a dish emphasizing

279
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,853
traditional
Japanese cooking.

280
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,053
(Confused murmurs)

281
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,387
[SCHOOLBOY]
"Ingredients here"?

282
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,820
But there isn't a supply
of ingredients here.

283
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,420
Well of course there is.

284
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,820
The bounty of nature's
at your disposal...

285
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,920
and a clear stream with
a wealth of options.

286
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,820
[HINAKO]
You have seasonings, oil,
and cooking utensils.

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,753
Feel free to also use the
fishing equipment.

288
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:30,453
The surrounding area is our
own private land. You can
go as far as the fence.

289
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,620
Crossing the fence will be an
automatic failing grade.

290
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,320
You'll get your ingredients
solely from within the
designated area,

291
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,987
and then cook with only them.

292
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,120
As long as you make a dish
that satisfies my palate,

293
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,353
you will pass.

294
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:45,453
You have two hours
to complete your meal.

295
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,553
Now get going and
begin your journey.

296
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,820
(Squeal)

297
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,587
Huh? So did it just start?!

298
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,353
I think so!
This lady's bonkers!

299
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,753
I guess first we have to see
if we can catch some fish!

300
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:58,987
If we can get ourselves
some sweetfish we can do
a salt broil, right?!

301
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,453
Is sweetfish even
in season now?

302
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,687
Who cares, we only
have two hours!

303
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:03,453
Hurry!

304
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,320
(Frantic screaming)

305
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,253
[TAKUMI]
I challenge you, Soma.

306
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:09,487
What's that?
You want to challenge me?

307
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,387
It's time that we resolve
whose cooking is superior.

308
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,553
Chef, I'd like for
YOU to settle this.

309
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:16,687
Huh?

310
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,153
Tell us which of our dishes
is more delicious.

311
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,553
I'd like your
impartial judgment!

312
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,553
Huh? Why would I do that?

313
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,353

we could do a salt broil.

everyone's probably gonna
go that route, right?

I wanna change things up
a bit if I can.

00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,694
What are you
guys thinking?

468
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,527
The theme was
Japanese cooking!

469
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,960
That has got to be
an automatic fail!

470
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,960
No. It IS Japanese.

471
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,960
The sauce is salt‐broiled
char and uruka entrails
rather than anchovies.

472
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,760
(Shocked gasps)

473
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,594
I seem to recall that
uruka generally takes more
than a week to prepare,

474
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,627
but you made this on
the spot, correct?

475
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:18,894
Yes.

476
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,827
[TAKUMI]
We washed the
sweetfish entrails

477
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,060
and boiled them in sake,

478
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,394
then added mirin,
soy sauce, and salt.

479
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,560
Doing so, we made an impromptu,

480
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,160
rich‐tasting uruka with just
a touch of bitterness.

481
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,094
(Astonished murmurs)
[HINAKO]
But that's not all you
did to convert it, did you?

482
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:36,960
Rather than traditional
Italian parsley, they used
diced chives in its place.

483
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,094
By using that, they made a
refreshing green sauce!

484
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:44,027
Also, instead of garlic,
they used a citrus and
pepper paste,

485
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,260
giving it a very Japanese
flavor.

486
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,627
The unique elements
enhanced the whole dish.

487
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,527
I like to call it a
Japanese‐style salsa verde

488
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,827
using an improvised
uruka as its base!

489
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,760
They were able to make a
Japanese‐style Italian sauce?

490
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,394
Dude. I'm drooling
just hearing about it.

491
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:03,194
It's incredible!
I can't believe they were able
to combine so many ingredients

492
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:04,827
from just this small area!

493
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:09,960
<i>Unlike Japan, Italy has a long</i>
<i>history of eating meat.</i>

494
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,094
<i>And in Tuscany,</i>
<i>where these two are from,</i>

495
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>duck, rabbit, and boar</i>
<i>are often served,</i>
<i>depending on the season.</i>

496
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,427
<i>That must be where</i>
<i>they learned to break</i>
<i>down and prepare duck.</i>

497
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>The breast is so rich</i>
<i>because it was grilled</i>

498
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,427
<i>in a glaze of soy sauce,</i>
<i>spicy mustard, black pepper,</i>
<i>and honey.</i>

499
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,560
<i>And the salsa is the</i>
<i>perfect complement.</i>

500
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,694
This salsa verde duck was
infused with Japanese elements
in a measured and creative way.

501
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:40,327
A flawless combination
of Japanese technique
and imagination.

502
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,827
Takumi Aldini... Isami Aldini...

503
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,260
You both pass!

504
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,627
Grazie!

505
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,860
[MEGUMI]
<i>Even with limited ingredients,</i>

506
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,527
<i>he was able to use his wits to</i>
<i>come up with some amazing food.</i>

507
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,494
<i>That guy reminds</i>
<i>me of...</i>

508
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:57,627
<i>He's just like Soma!</i>

509
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,027
(Ending Song)

510
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:40,194
Ahh! Merveilleuse!

511
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:43,460
Erina Nakiri, you pass!

512
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:46,327
[ERINA]
No surprise.

513
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,227
[TAKUMI]
Next time on Food Wars,

514
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,994
the ninth course:

515
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,794
"The Breading that
Showcases the Mountains"

516
00:24:57,894 --> 00:24:59,294
(Takumi and Isami laugh)

517
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:01,260
[BOTH]
Grazie!

518
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,827
I will crush you...
In the face!

519
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,960
You are so
uncool, dude.
