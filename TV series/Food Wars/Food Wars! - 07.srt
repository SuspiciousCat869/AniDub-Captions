(Jiggle jiggle)

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,733
(SIGH) I need something
that inspires.

3
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,666
(Lion roar)

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,900
No, that's not it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,933
(Ricocheting bullet)

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,466
Still not quite there yet.

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,233
I need something
special today.

8
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,666
Ooh! Now we're talking!

9
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,066
(Flames roaring)

10
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,400
(Opening Song)

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,233
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
So did you hear about
today's Food War?

12
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,100
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Yeah. It's Meat‐Meat
vs. Bowl‐club, right?

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,533
Man, you gotta feel
sorry for Bowl‐club.

14
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,466
I mean, Erina Nakiri
has it out for them.

15
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,966
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
Yo, have you read
the Tohtsuki Sports?!

16
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,633
It says someone else
is cooking.

17
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,733
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
Look! Now it's that uppity
transfer student,

18
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,333
Soma Yukihira!

19
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:26,366
[KANICHI]
Here are the tools and
ingredients you'll need
for the battle.

20
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,433
I got everything
you asked for.

21
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,800
Nice.

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,333
Thanks again for
all your help!

23
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,200
So were you able to get
any sleep last night?

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,733
Uh...

25
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,200
Well when we were done,
I wanted tweaked the sauce
a little bit more.

26
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
I slept about two hours,
I guess.

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,733
Uh...

28
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,466
(Distant crowd chatter)

29
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,733
<i>So many people!</i>

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,133
Soma! Whatever you do don't
look out in the audience!

31
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,866
You don't want to
lose your nerve!

32
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,200
Alright, there's
no need to freak out,

33
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,666
everything is going
to be just fine, okay?

34
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,333
Just be calm and
don't lose it!
Yeah, yeah...

35
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,433
First, you need to calm
yourself down, m'kay?

36
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,800
Huh?!

37
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
You're not even a
little bit scared?

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,133
[MEGUMI]
I mean you have to cook
with all those people watching.

39
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,566
[SOMA]
Not at all.

40
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,466
Huh?

41
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,633
I mean,

42
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,666
Not compared to standing
in front of customers

43
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:18,633
with my family restaurant's
name on the line.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,833
If I do end up
beating you...

45
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,333
would that make me
the new Tohtsuki No. 7?

46
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,133
[URARA]
Sorry for the wait, you guys!

47
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,000
The Food War Administrative
Bureau has officially recognized

48
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,366
this challenge as a Food War!

49
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,733
(Crowd cheers)

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,466
And as always,
I will be your emcee.

51
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:49,366
I'm Urara Kawashima,
a freshman in the
high school division!

52
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,700
Love you!

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,566
You're cutest
thing ever, Urara!

54
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,633
HEY!

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,500
WE LOVE YOU!

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,933
[URARA]
Now then, from their
respective corners,

57
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,000
here come the contestants!

58
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,300
(Cheers)

59
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,233
[URARA]
The first contestant
to join the battle...

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,133
The Meat Master, Ikumi Mito!

61
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,000
(Laughs)
(Cheers)

62
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,266
<i>Oh, don't go flaunting</i>
<i>those big udders of yours,</i>
<i>you little hussy!</i>

63
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,600
<i>I am all the boys in this</i>
<i>school will ever need!</i>

64
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,100
<i>I am the cutest thing</i>
<i>to ever walk this earth!</i>

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,700
And now! To introduce our
next contestant...

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,933
Eat crap, you
dirty transfer!

67
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,133
Who do you
think you are?!

68
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,833
Go back home
to your diner!

69
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,866
This is the part where you
get what's coming to ya, a‐hole!

70
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:57,700
The transfer student who's
been garnering rave reviews
here at the academy,,

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Soma Yukihira!

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,933
[ONLOOKER 1]
If he's facin' Mito, I already
know who's winning this one.

73
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:08,400
He's toast. There's no way
I'm gonna miss seeing him get
expelled from this Academy.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,333
(Nervous whimpers)

75
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,866
What is with all
these rude people

76
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,966
and their attitudes?

77
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,700
I'll never forget.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,866
Back when I battled the
Standing‐While‐Eating‐Soba
Research Society,

79
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,500
there was no emcee,
not even an audience!

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,266
The only ones there
were stray dogs drawn
by the scent of food.

81
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,500
(Loud booing)
[KANICHI]
What is their problem?

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Soma, didn't you just
transfer here this spring?

83
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,033
Why do they all
hate you so much?

84
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,866
Dunno.... I haven't done
anything that I know of.

85
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,433
(Whimpers)

86
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,333
[URARA]
Let's have a quick review
of the rules, shall we?

87
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:46,066
We have three
honorary judges.

88
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,533
The theme is "rice bowls."

89
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:50,333
And the main ingredient
for today's battle is...

90
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,366
meat!

91
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,800
(Cheers)

92
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,200
[URARA]
If Ikumi Mito wins,

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,966
the Rice Bowl Research
Society will be disbanded,

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,033
and Soma Yukihira
will leave the Academy.

95
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,233
But if Soma wins,

96
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,300
the "Bowl‐club" will
get more funding

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,233
and additional cooking
facilities.

98
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,300
Also...

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,500
Ikumi will become
a member of Bowl‐club!

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,766
(Astonished murmurs)

101
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,433
Hey there, short‐timer.

102
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,000
It looks like this will be
your last day here.

103
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,833
If you have any last words,
now's the time.

104
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,400
You think so?

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,366
(Swish)

106
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,933
I think we'll have plenty of
time to talk

107
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,200
once you're a member
of Bowl‐club.

108
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,700
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Look, over there!

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,100
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Dude! Erina Nakiri!

110
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,333
[SCHOOLGIRL]
O.M.G! It's her!

111
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,700
[IKUMI]
<i>Erina...</i>

112
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,300
[YUKI]
Whoa, for real?
Why's she here?

113
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,233
Why would a member of
the Ten show up for this?

114
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,233
Especially to see something
as lame as the Bowl‐club?

115
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,600
Probably because she's part
of Erina's faction.

116
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,533
You really think that's it?
Or is there some other reason?

117
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:02,833
<i>Well, Soma Yukihira,</i>
<i>I am so looking</i>
<i>forward to this.</i>

118
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,233
<i>I cannot wait to see you</i>
<i>suffer a humiliating defeat.</i>

119
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,133
[IKUMI]
<i>Why would Miss Erina come</i>
<i>to watch this in person?</i>

120
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,700
Contestants, are you ready?!

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Get to your cooking stations!

122
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,066
[URARA]
It is winner take all...

123
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,166
in this battle
decided by the palate!

124
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,600
Let the Food War...

125
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,366
BEGIN!

126
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,766
(Horn blows)

127
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,100
[IKUMI]
Hey, transfer student.

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,933
Let me show you the kind
of ingredient a pissant like you

129
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,400
will never get to use.

130
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,100
Hm?

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
Presenting...

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,066
the ultimate grade of beef!

133
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,133
Man, I knew she'd
bring that sucker out.

134
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,433
That is some
A5‐ranked beef!

135
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,633
(Whimper)

136
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,866
Yah! HAH! AGH!

137
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,333
(Grunting)

138
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,100
That is one massive
butcher cleaver.

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,333
She's making precision cuts
even with that huge blade!

140
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,000
Aaaugh! She can really
cut some meat!

141
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,466
[AOKI]
Dude! Will you
look at that slab?!

142
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:14,266
I've never seen marbling
as fine as that!

143
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,133
[SATO]
Man! Both the
meat and the fat

144
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,633
have some sweet luster!

145
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,233
(Pleasant sigh)

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
(Sniff)

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,233
<i>Good girl...</i>

148
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,966
<i>Your subtle sweetness</i>
<i>tickles the senses...</i>

149
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,500
<i>As meat is smoked,</i>

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,300
<i>flavor components like glutamic</i>
<i>acid are increased,</i>

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,566
<i>and it starts to emit</i>
<i>a gentle, sweet aroma.</i>

152
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,233
<i>This is the ultimate meat,</i>

153
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,933
<i>and it will be cooked by the</i>
<i>ultimate hands: mine.</i>

154
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,400
Mmm...

155
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,466
[IKUMI]
First, fry it to give the
surface some color.

156
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:57,566
Scoop up the butter
and pour it all over the
meat's glistening surface.

157
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,500
(Laughs)

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,433
The aroma of melted butter
is wafting throughout
the whole building!

159
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:08,433
Ahh! It's making me ravenous
from just the scent alone.

Meanwhile, as for
Soma's dish...

171
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,900
It seems he sure is dicing
up an awful lot of onion.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,066
Just how do you think he plans
on using them all? Wha‐?!

[URARA]
It looks like he's
bringing out the meat!

174

to the A5 beef?

Uh... Half‐price?!

179
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,933

Hehe. I got it out

186

Do you really think Soma

187
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:15,833
to make it through
all this?

give up already?

Hm.

[ERINA]
Do you know what it is...

194
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,566
that makes her different?

195
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,633
Aside from the cut itself,

196
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,300
it's the way she treats it.

197
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,566
[ERINA]
That is correct.

198
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,266
But her true worth
is her delicate touch,

199
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,333
She knows exactly
what the meat needs.

200
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,633
There's no one more sensitive.

201
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,100
64 degrees...

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,633
No, it's more like 65.
Perfect.

203
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,466
[ERINA]
And Ikumi Mito
knows that the lips

204
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:59,866
are the most sensitive
part of the human body.

205
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:04,100
That being said, when it
comes to distinguishing the
appropriate temperature,

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,066
she's on another level.

207
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,533
[ERINA]
And when she
touches the meat,

208
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:12,233
her prowess becomes
even more evident.

209
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,800
She's something
else...

210
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,433
Watch closely.

211
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:21,233
See how her fingertips
caress the grains with
loving intention.

212
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,333
Like a pianist playing
an elegant solo.

213
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:28,833
A silent melody for the heavens.

214
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,300
A carnivorous sonata of meat.

What, you're still here?

217
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:48,766
Oh transfer student, you
seem to've gotten pretty
quiet over there, haven't you?

218
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:51,733

of yours from three days ago?

219

Hm?

220
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,900
Pah!

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,866
Guess it's hard
to talk smack

222
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,900
when you're in a panic.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,066
How pitiful.

224
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,866
[SOMA]
I don't need
to say a thing.

225
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:01,666
Hm?

226
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,066
'Cause in a bit,

And eloquently, too.

230
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,933
Also, it's common knowledge
that you can't trust a chef

231
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:14,433
who spends more time
hurling insults than
perfecting their dishes.

(Angry grunt)

[URARA]
And we're done!

241
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,900
[URARA]
My favorite books
are fairy tales.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,733
And I love
romance movies, too.

243
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,566
My dream for the future
is to be someone's bride!

244

I'm so cutesy!

245
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,333
[URARA]
We will now begin judgment.

246
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,366
First up, Ikumi Mito's dish.

247
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,233
[IKUMI]
This is an A5 Wagyu
rôti rice bowl.

248
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,733
[URARA]
Rôti is French for
"roast" or "broil."

249
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:20,433
So basically, it's like, used
to say food that's been
cooked in an oven, duh!

250
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,166
I love you! Hehe!

251
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:25,533
The meat has been cut so that
it resembles a flower in bloom.

252
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:29,100
I never dreamed I'd set eyes on
a rice bowl of such beauty.

253
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,366
I guess it's time to dig in.
This looks really wonderful.

254
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,966
(Squeals of deliciousness)

255
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,200
It's almost too delicious!

256
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
I'm getting weak
in the knees!

257
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,233
Amazing! This profound depth of
flavor is truly A5‐grade.

258
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,366
When she was
preparing this meat,

259
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,266
even the angle of heat was
taken into consideration.

260
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:52,400
When the flame is applied
at a right angle to the
fiber direction,

261
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,400
it causes the meat to heat
uniformly and allows the
juices to run freely.

262
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,800
Taking the meat's fiber
into account is the mark
of a true master chef!

263
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,266
And underneath these "petals"...

264
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,433
This garlic rice was cooked in
melted butter and beef fat.

265
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,633
I would happily eat three bowls
of this exquisite rice alone!

266
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:15,433
[KATSUNORI]
The way this dish was made,
you could even call it
sensuous!

267
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,600

incredible!

stupid face when he loses.

275
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,566
This doesn't look
too good.

276

call your rice bowl?

Uh, well...

280
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,033

You want us to try your
"Chaliapin Steak"?

284
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,100
So all you did was use onions
to make cheap meat tender, huh?

285
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,733
After what we've just eaten...

286
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,933
Hahaha!

00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:35,133
I can't! My hand
won't stop moving!

298
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,466
Mm! The meat is SO
tender, but also...

299
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,633
The sauce!

300
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,700
This special sauce is
infused with minced onions

301
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,633
and really
whets the appetite!

302

What is this?!

303
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,100
Such a depth of flavor...

304
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,533
After the steak was cooked,

305
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,533
the frying pan was
deglazed with red wine! OGH!

306
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,000
He simmered the remaining
meat juices in the wine,

307
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,500
and then he used THAT
to fry the onions!

308
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,533
He added cornstarch
to make it smooth

309
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,233
and he allowed it to melt
perfectly with the meat and rice

310
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,766
in a beautiful dance.

311
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:03,866
The flavors are rounded out
by a mirin‐infused soy sauce!

312
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,866
The browning of the rice gives
it a broad depth of flavor!

Ohh!
Yes!

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah, Soma!

315
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,833
Onions are essential to
a Chaliapin Steak,

316
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,266
but it looks like he tweaked it.

317
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,366
And I think he also did
something with the sauce.

318
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,933
So is that really
all there is to it?

319
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,166
<i>But sauce is just... sauce!</i>

320
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:24,200
<i>It should be no match for</i>
<i>my top‐quality meat!</i>

321
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,533
The meat and the sauce
are both full of flavor

322
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,933
but the more I eat,
the hungrier I get!

323
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,200
You are not kidding.

324
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
I feel like I could
eat this forever!

325
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,500
These undertones
of acidity...

326
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,333
Don't tell me...

327
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,300
That's right!

328
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,933
The key to my dish
lies in the rice.

329
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:40,966
It's the rice?!

330
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,633
The rice in that steak bowl

331
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,133
was mixed with homemade
pickled plum paste.

332
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,733
It's a refreshing
pickled plum rice!

333
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,000
I knew it!

334
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,433
That is the refreshing
taste that makes you

335
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,733
want to keep eating!

336
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,833
The steak is light and fluffy,
and full of deliciousness.

337
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,566
That beautiful sauce
is simply glorious!

338
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,266
And the pickled plum in the
rice is so light and brisk!

339
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,433
Hahaha!

340
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,100
[ALL THREE]
The tastiness of
each component...

341
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,766
elevates the other in harmony!

342

<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

349

Oh, God!

350
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,266
I'm already finished
with my bowl!

351
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,866
Is there any more left?

352

Where can we get some
more of this?

353
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,166
[SHIGENO]
The rôti rice bowl
was excellent,

354
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:30,633
but my chopsticks wanted to
move more towards THIS bowl.

355
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,066
Wait, what was that?!

356
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,633
<i>What about my garlic rice?</i>

357
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,066
<i>They didn't finish it!</i>

358
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,400
[SOMA]
Yup...

359
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,033
I thought long and hard
about how I should

360
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,066
best flavor the
rice in this dish...

361
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,766
[SOMA]
After I heard from Kanichi
that you'd probably use
marbled beef...

362
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,933
I figured you would understand
that you couldn't use any bold
seasonings in the rice,

363
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,166
or else it would clash
with the beef's flavor.

364
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:57,366
Your dish may look like
a rice bowl, but it's not.

(Gasp)

366
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,666
Like the head of Bowl‐club said:

367
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:06,200
Cheap and tasty. Meals should
be summarized in one bowl.

368
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh just be quiet!

369
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,700
This argument is a
complete waste of time.

370
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,333
With my top‐quality
meat, there's no way
you could've possibly‐

371

Why don't you give it
a little listen?

372
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,466
Hear what my rice bowl
has to say.

373

00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,766
Like coals
turned white.
