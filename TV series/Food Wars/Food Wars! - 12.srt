using seven vegetables.

Ah! Uh! No, I certainly
didn't want to copy it.

[SEKIMORI]
Potatoes, carrots, zucchini,

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,966
and other vegetables were worked
into pate

50

to create the layers,
treated to bring out each
vegetable's individual profile.

You did well, accomplishing
so much in the limited

52
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,566
[GOTODA]
There are two different sauces.

53
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,366
One is a sweet‐and‐sour,
citrus‐based gelee.

54
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:14,400
The other is a cool,
refreshing green sauce

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,966
made of a shiso‐based paste
infused with various herbs.

56
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,333
Delightful!

57
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,066
Having us eat the terrine
with citrus and shiso

58
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,900
is a most enticing impression.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,033
MMM! The combination
of the sauteed zucchini
mingled with the herb sauce...

60
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,766
It's so refreshing.

61
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:35,133
Mph! The citrus also pairs
nicely with the sweetness
of the tomato.

62
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,900
This seven‐layered pate
combined with the two sauces

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,666
lets us enjoy 14 different
exquisite flavors each
expertly showcased!

64
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,300
Quite provocative,
isn't it?

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,566
Mm‐hmm, these vibrant colorful
stripes are pleasing to the eye

as well as the palate.

67
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,766
A very well made dish,
I must say.

68
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,866
Okay, Megumi,

69
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,533
you used sundried
tomatoes, didn't you?

70
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,200
Um, yes, I did!

71
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,966
Y'see back in my
hometown, we take all
the summer vegetables

72
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,033
we've gathered and
dry them in the sun,

73
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,433
preserving them so we can eat
them during the winter.

74
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,600
[MEGUMI]
I used to help my Mom
in the kitchen every day.

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,866
And she showed me how
to do it in the oven.

76
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,433
I loved cooking with her.

77
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,633
You cut cherry
tomatoes in half,

78
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,300
sprinkle them
with rock salt,

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,366
then slow roast them in the
oven at 120 degrees.

80
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:20,566
That brings out their
sweetness and gives them
a different texture!

81
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,666
I thought it would be
a fun change to enhance
the terrine nicely.

82
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:27,200
Mm. Tomatoes are known to
contain the compound glutamine,

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,400
which is an umami component.

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,800
It is concentrated when
the tomato is dried,

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,833
and the sweetness on the tongue
is intensified greatly.

While both are basically
the same menu item,
a vegetable terrine,

90
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:56,033
we have a fine, fresh flavor
vs. a full‐bodied umami.

91

Two completely
different approaches.

warms the heart...

Haha!

It's not winter, so I'd
say that doesn't really

108
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,066
make any sense!

109
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,033
Then she should be known
as a Legume Gnome!

a snow queen.

That spice you added
to the pate...

It was allspice,
wasn't it?

Ah! Um, it was!

355
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:30,020
Well I would say it was
used to offset the smell
of the chicken liver.

356
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,220
It's a blend of cinnamon,
and cloves, and nutmeg,

357
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,220
and it's used throughout
the world in a wide
variety of cuisines.

Maybe... But that's not

since yesterday, right?

363
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,453
And I know you've
had to eat a lot

364
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:47,620
of different foods.

365
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,353
So, I thought that
you might be...

366
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,087
Well allspice aids in digestion
and might do you some good.

Oh!

Do not say things

that's an important

Alright, if you do
really think it's a draw,

It's hospitality...

And it is the essence
of your cooking.

That is a
powerful weapon.

Hone it well while
you're at Tohtsuki Academy!

So Kojiro's plateau
was the result of his
own resourcefulness?

Yes...

Kojiro has always been
able to move forward

423
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,820
by removing everything he
has considered unnecessary.

424
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,287
Then, he reached the summit,

425
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,487
before he'd fully matured
as an chef owner.

426

For a chef to continue
to reach new heights,

427
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,920
it takes an insatiable desire

428
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,087
to absorb knowledge from all
sources.

that back tonight.
