Oh god! I love just
thinking about it...

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:12,366
I can still taste the sweetness
of the fruit mixed with the
saltiness of the fried rice!

26
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:17,200
It's reminiscent of sweet
and sour pork, which also
uses pineapple.

To finish it off,

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,266
she hollowed‐out a pineapple and
then placed the rice inside.

29
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,900
Then, she re‐covered it
and baked it in the oven.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,333
She was even careful to salt
the areas the rice would come
in contact with

31
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,833
so as to not become
overly sweet.

32
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,266
By doing that, she was allowing
the fragrance to come out

33
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,666
and not diminish the rice's
moisture in any way.

the compliment, sir!

[KITA]
You made that stock with
fried duck fat and spices.

64
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,440
The fat imparted a duck flavor
to all the ingredients.

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Normally, that would give it a
gamey smell, but...

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,573
this scent is so inviting!

unreal!

You topped it with
a duck cutlet!

70
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:06,873
You've used turmeric
and other spices to
perfectly mask the smell

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,840
and give it an
orange‐like scent.

72

Oh and speaking of that,

73
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,473
duck a l'orange is a classic
French dish, is it not?

74
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,173
Yes! I mixed in the fruit
and it's rind to the sauce.

75
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:21,140
It really matches that special
garam masala, doesn't it?

00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,207
Ah, yes.

Fall is indeed the season
for wild game hunting...

Still, acquiring meat
of this quality for use
in the Selection

79
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,373

to a wild game hunter.

In Italy it can be
either baked or fried,

of the tomato permeates
the entire curry!

You are correct, ma'am.

114
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,473
The only liquid used in that
curry was from tomatoes.

115
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:09,073
No. You used only tomatoes,
with no added water to your
innovative dish?

116
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,907
Yes. I laid all the tomatoes
in a pot and applied heat,

117
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,407
which released all the
moisture I could need.

118
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:20,107
I added a special spice
blend suited for the
acidity of the juice

119
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:24,440
to bring out the umami
of the tomato, producing
a deep, rich curry.

of traditional tomato sauce,

Is there soy sauce
in this dish?!

162
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,173
It's not... It's tamari!

163
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,440
[ANDO]
It's produced mainly
in the Tokai region.

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,873
The flavor is more concentrated
than normal soy sauce,

165
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,640
and it's known for being
uniquely sweet and mellow.

I'm getting something else.

The smoothness of some
cheese embedded inside!

Allow me to explain.

Please look at the noodles'
cross‐section.

Oh! What is this treat?

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,640
The pasta has three layers!

172
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,273
The surface layers are flavored
with turmeric,

173
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,440
while the middle layer is softly
filled with the exquisiteness of
parmesan cheese.

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,773
I see...

175

The mixture of tamari
and parmesan

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,040
create an unusual
richness of bold flavor!

I don't understand.

<i>The tamari reinforces the depth</i>

184

<i>The technique of steeping soft</i>

186
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,707
It is like a whole new
genre of cooking.

Hot and cold, the ingredients
are infused so well...

These seasoned culinary figures
are at a loss for words!

[KITA]
This curry sauce has
been made into a foam,
and is slightly warm.

00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:15,158
Melting away elegantly
on the tongue.

Oh... This beautiful tomato
mousse is refreshingly cool and
pairs with it perfectly.

I added spices as well as
sodium alginate to harden it.

266
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,191
I made the mousse
using turmeric

267
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,391
and the powder of frozen and
pulverized foie gras.

268
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,424
The white in the middle
is a puree of

269
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:33,924
potato and six kinds of cheese.

270
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:36,391
And of course,
I flash‐froze it as well,

271
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,424
So it melts the moment
it touches the tongue.

272

If your mouth becomes too cold,
please have some of the spiced
pie crust.

273
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,991
It's been flavored with
coriander and other spices

274
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,924
to give the tongue
a tantalizing break.

Thermal sense:

276
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,024
It's a school of thought in
molecular gastronomy

00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,858
where elements are used
in varying temperatures.

This dish incorporates
that concept.

Of course! Perfect!

It uses spices as its base,

but contends with alternating
textures and temperatures.

Followed by Arato
and then Takumi,

305
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:07,158
And tied for fourth place,
we have Hojo and Isami.

306

Only four contestants
from B Block will be

But they still put out
some interesting dishes,

311
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,191
only fitting for
the final contenders.

312
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,658
Yes... Hard to say one
is better than the other.

313

heated battle this year.

A monkfish DOBUJIRU
curry, sir.

342
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,824
"Dobujiru"... a hotpot with
monkfish as the main ingredient.

343
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:56,958
Indeed. It's a dish passed down
by fishermen in the Ibaraki and
Fukushima prefectures.

344
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,658
<i>Monkfish in curry?</i>

345
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,024
<i>Just what is this</i>
<i>girl thinking?</i>

346
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,624
Oh wow!

347
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,758
So this is pure heaven.

348
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,391
THIS is what monkfish
cooking is about.

349
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:12,558
[KITA]
The main trait of dobujiru
is that it takes monkfish liver

350
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,158
and slowly cooks it
down in a frying pan.

351
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:19,458
Miso and sake are added to the
liver to create the flavor base.

352
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,591
This thoughtful young lady
added spices to make a
spectacular "liver curry miso."

353
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,358
My body's free!

354
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,191
I could get addicted
to something like this!

355
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,824
To think, these spices
would be such a match
for the richness of liver!

356
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,991
It's like a warm glow within...

357
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:38,024
After all the food we've eaten,
you can feel it even more.

358
00:18:38,124 --> 00:18:41,258
I mean, there's a
personal touch to this dish.

359
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:45,924
Ingredients include the
monkfish's flesh, its skin,
and fins and...

360
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,458
Hm? What's this?

361
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,091
Kogiku pumpkin,
Tachikawa burdock root,

362
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:52,458
and Akasuji daikon!

363
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,058
Um, it is!

364
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:56,691
All those vegetables are
grown in my hometown.

365
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,558
I tried various ways
of bringing out their flavor,

366
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:04,258
but curry is overpowering and
didn't match the sweetness and
bitterness of the vegetables,

367
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,491
so I was very worried
about what to do.

368
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,524
But in a dobujiru using
monkfish liver,

369
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,891
not only is the flavor
of the spices drawn out,

370
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,524
but it acts as a kind of
bridge to the naturalness
of the vegetables.

371
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:20,691
I wanted to make something
where you could taste
AND smells where I was born.

372
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,424
That's the kind of curry
I wanted to make!
