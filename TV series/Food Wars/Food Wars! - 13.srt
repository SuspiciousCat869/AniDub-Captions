[SOMA]
Hey, Isshiki! We're back!

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,666
Ah, Welcome home everyone!

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm glad to see you've
all made it through the
training camp from hell.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,666
Each of you did
just splendidly...

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,366
Huh?

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:16,100
ATATATATA!

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,400
Did you miss us?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
Soma?!

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
You've really
bulked up!

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
I'm guessing your challenges
were quite difficult.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,700
(Heavy chewing and grunting)

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,500
Megumi?!

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,733
Is that you, Megumi?

14
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,033
You seem a bit on
the gloomy side...

15
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,633
Shaddap, ya loser!

16
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:32,600
HUH?!

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,533
Heh‐heh...

18
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,800
Whaddya say we beat this

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,366
skinny little wuss
to a bloody pulp.

20
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,266
Let's snap his scrawny,
little neck!

21
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:42,233
Please do not disrespect
your elders like that.

22
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,266
I don't take kindly to it!

23
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:49,666
Hey Shun. What happened to
your once‐charming hairstyle?!

24
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,633
Bushy.

25
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh!

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,966
Hang on, you guys.
Where's Zenji?

27
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:57,400
I don't see him anywhere.
What happened to him?

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
The only thing we could find...

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,166
were these.

30
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,166
Oh God... Not him!

31
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:05,266
Oh, Zenji, my boy!

HUUH!

Ooh...

35
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:12,133
Oh wow, man, what a nightmare.

36
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,700
Today's only the third
day of the training camp.

37
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,733
Please make it back, everyone.

38
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,266
GRR!

39
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,533
This is awful!
Make it all again!

40
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,900
Mm‐mm! Megumi Tadokoro, you
may clean up your station.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,133
You pass!

42
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,466

You act like some sorta
queen around here...

Well you can't
keep it up forever.

59
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,093
Thanks so much
for the advice.

60
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:15,026
I will certainly try to
keep that in mind, okay? z

61
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,959

of the lower class

Today was absolutely
horrendous again!

Ugh! I wanna get back to my
luxury suite and sleep.

66
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,093
We still have two
more days left.

I think we can still pull
it off though, you guys.

Hmm? There's no
assigned bedtime curfew
set for tonight.

to be a secret.

here, then that must mean...

to him? Oh...

Everyone direct your
attention toward the stage.

110
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:05,493
There is but one reason you
have been called here:

111
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:08,193
for me to inform you
of tomorrow's challenge.

us about it the night before?

[GIN]
Ladies and gentlemen...

115
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,893
Your challenge is to create
a new breakfast item

116
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,459
befitting our guests
here at Tohtsuki Resort.

117
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,426
Breakfast is the face
of our hotel.

118
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:24,526
It is an important meal
that represents the start
of our guests' day.

119
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:28,526
Present something that
gives the table an air
of invigorated radiance.

120
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,993
Something that cannot
be ignored nor forgotten.

121
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:34,926
Make a single dish,
one that gives a sense
of wonder for the day.

122
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,926
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

123
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,626
You are allowed to prepare
any style of cuisine...

124
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:44,726
but it must be presented
in the buffet‐fashion.

125
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:48,059
Judgment will begin
at 6:00 am tomorrow.

126
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,293
Be ready to present your dish
for tasting by that time.

(Shocked murmurs)

128

Hmmm?

129
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,693
I think I might have
just misheard that.

130
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,759
He did say 6:00 PM, right?

131
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,493
No he didn't...
he totally said 6 "AM"

132

They're trying to kill us!

133

We're not going to
get any sleep tonight!

134
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,159
Use your time however
you see fit.

135
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,093
You may use the kitchen
to test your new dishes...

136
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,726
or you may rest up
back in your rooms.

137
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:17,426
But I'll see you all
bright and early.

138
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,093
You're dismissed!

139
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:20,026
(Mass groans)

140
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:21,926
My entire body
is a complete wreck!

141
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,959
I can't think straight
under these conditions!

142
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,593
I'm starting to
lose my mind!

143
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,526
Finally, we have ourselves
a worthwhile challenge.

144
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,959
Just you wait, Soma Yukihira.

145
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,726
I am going to show you
the ultimate breakfast...

146
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:36,059
Where staple Italian egg
dishes are interpreted

147
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,259
through the incomparable
Aldini techniques!

148
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,993
Hahaaa...

149
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:44,026
So tell me, what exactly
are "staple Italian
egg dishes" like?
Heh!

150
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,226
It's like this.
You fold shredded cheese

151
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,026
or different kinds of
vegetables into the eggs...

152
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,993
What are you telling
him for, Isami?!

153
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,593
Come on...
Are you trying to give away
all our family secrets?!

154
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,293
That's enough, come on we're
going back to our room!

155
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,826
Yeah, okay.

156
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,959
So looks like it'll
be eggs again.

157
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,759
Hey, wasn't that was the
theme for my entrance exam?

158
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:01,693
AH!

159
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:04,293
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

160
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:05,626
Make me one proper dish.

161
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,259

Seems like yesterday...

163
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,859
Good times.

164
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,826
Do not talk to me
like we're friends!

165
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,293
Ugh! Let me warn you right now:

166
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,393
You can't put out such haphazard
cooking this time around.

167
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:21,793
Not unless you want the judges
to laugh you out of school.

168
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:24,859
But you ate it like
you thought it was
the best thing ever.

169
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,259
What?! As if! I believe
I told you it was
vile and disgusting!

170
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,226
Miss Erina!

171
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,193
Everything has been prepared
and is ready to go.

172
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,126
Very well. Let's do it.

173
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,559
You, do the best you can do
with your meager talents.

174
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,659
Don't embarrass yourself.

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,859
Um... Are you
guys alright?

177
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,159
When it comes to it,
we'll show ya we got
what it takes!

178
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,526
C'mon, get up, Zenji!

179
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,726
We're all going to go back
to the dorm together!

180

Kyokusei! Let's Fight!

181
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,159
Yeaaaaah!

182
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,693
Y‐yeah!

183
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,359
[GIN]
Such a peaceful night...

184
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,659
It's quite a bit different
from the clamor of our
challenges all day long.

185
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,659
Perhaps, but I would say
at ze present time...

186
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,126
The students appear to be
in frantic disarray...

187
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:17,326
in a way that is far
beyond their habitual discord.

188
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,726
(Sigh)

189
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,993
[SCHOOLGIRL]
Is this going be enough?

190
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,126
Maybe we should try some
different seasonings?

191
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,559
This challenge is
a lot more harsh
than I expected.

192
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,059
Yeah, it is...

193
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,793
Unless you're really confident
in your cooking abilities,

194
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,459
you're not going to be
getting much sleep tonight.

195
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,926
I think I'm about
ready to go to bed.

196
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,726
You still tinkering
with your dish?

197
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,893
Um, yes. I'm still
just halfway done.

198
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,026
Okay then. Don't keep
at it too long.

199

Oh, also...

203
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,093
Tomorrow, we're
having a rematch.

204
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,059
In last night's game of Old
Maid...

205
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,359
You see, I wasn't really
feeling in my usual form.

206
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,026
You will be ready, right?

207
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,359
Yes, of course!

Guess I'll just
start making something!

219
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,859
The staples of egg cuisine...

220
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,626
In Japanese cooking,
it's rolled omelets.

221
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:50,259
And in Western cooking,
it's a scramble.

222
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,726
Woohoo!

223
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,226
<i>It's tasty... Really tasty.</i>

224

[JOICHIRO](Laugh)
A new menu item, huh?

226
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,626
It's an interesting
dish, alright.

227
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,526
But it's just not right.

228
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,093
What? Why not?

229
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,493
I thought you said
you really liked it!

230
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,593
Listen to me, Soma:

231
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,526
Our food is more down‐to‐earth.

232
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:30,126
Customers come to Yukihira
for friendly conversation
and comfort food.

233
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,493
If we start serving a
bunch of fancy stuff,

234
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,226
it changes who we
are, understand?

235
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,926
<i>I can't put out some dish</i>

<i>I need an egg dish worthy</i>
<i>of a five‐star hotel...</i>

Make a single dish,
one gives a sense of
wonder for the day.

Just make the kind of food
YOU would want to eat.

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,659
That'll be enough.

It's hospitality...

of your cooking.

But my lady, you told me to
stay back here and not move.

You've gotta

I gave you
that awesome prop

00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,857
Hey, Erina!
Guess we're neighbors!

318
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:08,190
Soma Yukihira,
why are you here?!

319
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,723
We've seen a lot of each
other lately, haven't we?

320
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,857
<i>This scumbag keeps popping up!</i>

321
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,590
<i>It's really getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>

322
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,723
This is my first time to witness
your famous cooking up close.

323
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:22,090
<i>Still, I suppose this will be</i>
<i>a good chance to show him</i>
<i>what real cooking looks like.</i>

324
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,790
By all means feel free
to have yourself a taste...

325
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,857
of the gap between
your cooking and mine!

326
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,823
Huh? You mean, we'll
taste and compare?

327
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:30,923
Sure, that's cool.

328
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,590
We'll do it
after the challenge.

329
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,857
Ah! Uh, no!

330
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,390
WE are not doing
anything, you got that?

331
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,823
<i>This low‐life</i>
<i>just doesn't get it!</i>

332
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:39,957
Well, best of luck
to you, Erina.

333
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,157
Ah! What do you
think you're doing?

334
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,790
You're, like, not planning
on making a souffle, are you?

335
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,923
Well kinda...

336
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:47,657
I'm going to be
making an omelet.

337
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:50,923
But I'll whisk the egg
whites into a meringue
before cooking them...

338
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:55,157
and that should give it a
different texture from just
your regular omelet.

339
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,757
It will be a souffle omelet.

340
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,290
Delivering
an unexpected texture...

341
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,423
Y'know, like what Chef Dojima
was talking about.

342
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:04,323
Uhh...

343
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,823
What is it?

344
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,990
Oh, nothing.

345
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,490
Nothing at all.

346
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,390
<i>"Texture," huh? Hmph!</i>

[GIN]
I assume you've finished
prepping for your dishes.

348

to know the conditions
required for you to pass.

349
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,557
But first, allow me
to introduce your judges.

350
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:21,957

[GIN]
Welcome our suppliers
and their families.

354
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:31,090
They provide the ingredients
used here at Tohtsuki Resort.

355
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,923
They serve as judges every
year,

356
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,557
and have also come up
with the theme, an egg
dish with a sense of wonder.

357
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,690
Uh. There's so
many of them!

358

These guys know their stuff
and they are very precise.

[TOKUZO] (Laughs)
Thanks for the
introduction.

360
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:49,190
Keep in mind,
we eat nothing that's
not up to our strict standards!

361
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,023
Hehehe.

00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,090
Hm. Hm. Hm.

These old‐timers are... legit!

364
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,023
These guys look
like trouble.

365
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,690
They look pretty

Tohtsuki Resort's staff

367
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:05,490

acting as your judges.

That's the maitre d'

371
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:14,023
[SATO]
No freakin' way!
Even Chef Dojima's
sous‐chef is here!

372
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:16,390
Two criteria
must be met:

373
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,423
First the producers
and staff must approve.

374
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:22,357
Second our guests must eat 200
of your plates in two hours.

375
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:27,023
Now remember, be vigilant
and keep your customers happy.

376
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:29,057
They are who
matter the most.

377
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,223
Two hundred plates, huh?

378
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:32,557
<i>I see.</i>

00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:36,523
<i>Women and men, young and old...</i>
<i>A diverse clientele.</i>

380

<i>They're totally simulating</i>
<i>an early breakfast rush.</i>

381

<i>anything like real cooking.</i>

382
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:46,757
Whoever meets these
criteria shall pass!

383
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,457
Now then, judges in all
assembly halls

384
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:52,890
enjoy this breakfast to your
hearts' content!

Feel free to
help yourself!

What a rich and
flavorful aroma...

391
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,323
What is it?

392
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,590
A frittata.

393
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,023
[WAITRESS 1]
That's an Italian
egg dish, right?

394
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,890
You fold cheese into
the eggs and cook them.

395
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,590
Yeah, sorry, but it kinda
seems a little ordinary
if you ask me...

396
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,223
[TAKUMI]
Not at all.

397
00:18:15,323 --> 00:18:18,123
My frittata is meant to be
broken into rough chunks

398
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,290
and sprinkled onto
a bed of salad,

399
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,723
where it will be gently
tossed to merge flavors.

400
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:29,323
Next, it's drizzled with
balsamic vinegar and topped
with grated parmesan cheese.

401
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,090
And it's done!

402
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,657
An insalata di frittata!

403
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,090
That looks really good.

404
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,157
So we're talking about
a "salad," then.

405
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,623
Ahh! This is so good!

406
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,357
The combination of fluffy eggs
and fresh crisp vegetables
is so unexpected...

407
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,523
When you take a bite, it
blends all in with this
refreshing sauce!

I call it "Single‐size
morning stew"!

For breakfast? A stew?!

the end of each of our skewers?

This taste is so soothing.

Each bite exudes the
mellow flavor of the base!

424
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,657
These vegetables were
chosen to match the
size of the quail egg

425
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,957
and are quite colorful...

the next bite!

of the white wine vinegar

elevates the egg yolk's
runniness and the juiciness

471
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm not expecting a lot
of "wonder" from this.

<i>The poached egg is</i>
<i>cooked perfectly and</i>
<i>melts on the tongue.</i>

473
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,857
<i>The hollandaise sauce has</i>
<i>just the right acidity.</i>

474
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:56,057
<i>The bacon is perfectly</i>
<i>crisp and the muffin has</i>
<i>a faint sweetness.</i>

475
00:21:56,157 --> 00:22:01,190
<i>These flavors all blend</i>
<i>together, enveloping the</i>
<i>tongue...</i>

476
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,224
<i>No! That's not all!</i>

477
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:08,590
<i>Ah! This powder, sparkling</i>
<i>amidst the egg's golden yolk...</i>

478
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,090
<i>It's mullet roe!</i>

479
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,524
<i>She coated the muffin with</i>
<i>powdered mullet roe?!</i>

480
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,224
<i>That's brilliant!</i>

481
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,890
<i>It's another type of egg!</i>

482
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,190
<i>The sublime saltiness of the</i>
<i>roe pairs with the egg yolks,</i>

483
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,490
<i>creating a huge</i>
<i>depth of flavor!</i>

<i>The Queen of Breakfast...</i>

487
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:40,057
<i>And this dish is</i>

488
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,724
<i>This culinary masterwork will</i>
