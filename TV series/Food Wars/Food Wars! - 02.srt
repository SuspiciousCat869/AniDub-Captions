[SOMA] Of course...

This is the work of an

337
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,237
It doesn't even
make me hungry.

338
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:10,503

My palate is such that I'm
called the "God Tongue"...

Well, take a look.

The fun of furikake...

355
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,037
is when it's on top
of rice, right?

356
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,603
Now then...

357
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:55,703
Uh!

00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:58,037

Ah!

362
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:20,003
<i>[ERINA]</i>
<i>The heat from the rice</i>
<i>is melting it!</i>

<i>And as it melts, it coats</i>

<i>Is it chicken?</i>

367
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:37,070
The delicate scent of
slow‐simmered chicken

I will grant you this...

Hang on, now...

Are you going in
for a second bite?

388

I thought I heard something
about you only needing one.

392
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,670

Relax and enjoy.

394
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,370
Nikogori?

We have a winner!

396
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:01,970
Those little
jiggly cubes

397
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,537
are made from
chicken wings.

398
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,703
[SOMA]
Nikogori is meat or fish broth
with lots of gelatin

399
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:10,337
so it hardens into a kind of
jelly when cooled.

400
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,470
I simmered the chicken
wings in fish seasoning,

401
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,703
sake, and mild soy sauce.

402
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:18,903
Chilled the broth to
harden it, then sliced it
up all nice and fine.

403
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,470
[SOMA]
When it goes on top
of the hot rice,

404
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,603
the broth from the
chicken wings melts,

405
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,970
binding it with the
soft‐scrambled egg.

406
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,470
[ERINA]
<i>So this nikogori is</i>
<i>a soup, so to speak...</i>

407
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,103

<i>flavor from the chicken.</i>

<i>Wait a minute.</i>

00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,903
<i>The richness and saltiness</i>
<i>of the smooth broth</i>

410
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:39,170
<i>draws out the gentle</i>
<i>sweetness of the fluffy egg.</i>

411
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,237
<i>With each bite, fluffiness</i>
<i>and velvetiness caress</i>
<i>the inside of my mouth!</i>

412
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:50,903

<i>dramatically elevates the</i>
<i>sumptuousness of the egg.</i>

413
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,670
<i>This is unlike any dish</i>
<i>I've ever tasted.</i>

414
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,337
<i>It's a wave of flavors</i>
<i>completely unknown to me!</i>

415
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,437
Well, whatcha think, huh?
Ah!

416
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,270
Are you glad you didn't
leave without trying it?

417
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,737
Ah! Be quiet!

418
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,670
I am not
finished judging!

419

With originality
and creativity,
Ah!

00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:09,437
you can elevate even
the most everyday dishes.

Who does this guy think he is?!

475
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:16,370
He is so full of it!

476
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,837
So disrespectful!

477
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,370
Toward ME, Erina Nakiri!

478
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,070
Unforgivable!

This Academy has no need
for people like you!

Hello, this is Erina.

That in today's
transfer test...

00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:49,703
not a single one of the
