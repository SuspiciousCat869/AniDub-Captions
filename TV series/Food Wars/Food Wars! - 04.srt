a scrap or two of ground pork
and beef lying around.

[FUMIO]
How could this be?

98
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
How did he make such
a thick Hamburg steak?

99
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,866
Hmph. I used the rest of your
canned mackerel to make...

100
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,100
a "Mackerel burger"!

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,533
Canned mackerel?!

102
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,666
[SOMA]
I added onions and breadcrumbs
to the egg,

103
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,433
then mixed it with
the mackerel,

104
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,200
added pepper, and lightly
salted it.

105
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,766
I fried that up, creating a
flaky mackerel‐burger steak.

106
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,700
Then, I added ponzu

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,266
to the leftover mackerel liquid

108
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,766
and thickened it up
with some potato starch

109
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,633
to make a simple,
refreshing sauce.

110
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,166
Given the timeframe;

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,133
Impossible.

115

A "Hamburg steak" made from
canned mackerel...

and inedible.

Hey boy, how on earth
did you make this?

We have no seaweed
or fish flakes

used to create a fish stock!

Well, about that...

You mean you used that
thing to make your stock?!

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,266
[SOMA]
Dried squid is pure umami.

138
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,200
Soak it for a while in
some boiling water,
add some salt,

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,966
and you'll get a richly
flavored soup stock.

140
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,433
The perfect start
for many dishes.

All right, fine.

The Tohtsuki Council of Ten...

292
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:36,400
It's a committee made up
of the ten highest‐ranked
students on campus.

293
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,433
At Tohtsuki, students settle
most of their issues through
self‐governance,

294
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:44,700
and all items are decided by a
mutual consensus of the Ten.

295
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,733
It is the highest
decision‐making body on campus.

296
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,733
In terms of school
organization, they're
right below the director.

297
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:57,066
Which means, even the
teachers have to follow
the decisions made by The Ten.

298
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,400
It is said that decades ago

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,766
the rooms at Kyokusei
were always full,

300
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,033
and that most members of
The Ten often came from here.

301
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,400
There was even a time when
Kyokusei residents held every
single one of the council seats.
