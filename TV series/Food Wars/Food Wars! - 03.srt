[SCHOOLBOY 2]
She's beautiful and
top of her class.

She's the perfect woman!

If I could just go out with
her one time, I'd die happy.

You crazy?! She would
either kill you

or you would end up getting
thrown out of freakin' school!

I welcome you...

You have reached the

(Oohs and aahs)

For three years,

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,933
you have learned the basics
of food preparation,

69
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,500
while attending our
middle school division.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,033
You have furthered your
knowledge of ingredients.

71
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,933
[SENZAEMON]
You have undertaken numerous
drills in which you have
had to prepare dishes...

72
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,066
You have heard a wide
variety of lectures,

73
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,766
such as cooking theory,

74
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,833
nutrition,

75
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,933
public health,

76
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,200
cultivation,

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,733
and managing a
restaurant business.

78
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:50,966
Now, as you stand at the
precipice of the rest
of your cooking lives...

79
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,033
you will be facing challenges

80
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,566
not just of technique
or knowledge...

81
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,233
But your resolve to see if you
can live as a professional chef!

82
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,433
And that means ninety‐nine
percent of you...

83
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,366
will sacrifice yourselves
to the cooking gods...

84
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,500

who move on!

That sounds like it's goin'
to be pretty hardcore.

Last year we started with 812
high school division freshmen.

91
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,766
And the number that was
allowed to proceed on...

92
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,266
was just 76!

93

The mediocre and the inept
are cast aside without mercy.

94
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,800
Out of a thousand freshmen
only one hundred will
remain to advance,

95
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,800
and you will be able to
count on one hand those
who reach graduation.

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,633
The odds are not
in your favor...

But you...

98
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,833
You can make it happen!

<i>The source of the Tohtsuki</i>
<i>brand's strength</i>

figured I might as well show up.

There's no way we can

It'll take over an hour,

00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,542
the meat needs more
time to get tender,

and for it to soak up
all the flavors.

361

simmer for another 30 minutes

somewhat of an

Hehe. By incorporating
some honey...

I rubbed it on the meat
before simmering,

adding some to the
seasoning, as well.

Did you?

417
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:35,542
Honey contains protease...

proteins at a faster rate.

419

[CHAPELLE]
You used it on the tough,
rib‐cut roast

420
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,775
to make it tender
in a short amount of time.

421
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,442
But, Soma, how in the world did
you know you could use honey

422
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,108
to make that happen?

423
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,375
A while back,

424
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:53,708
I read in a cookbook

425
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,542
that pineapple juice can
work as a tenderizer.

426
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,208
But I was pretty
young at the time.

427
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:01,408
And I wasn't going to be able to
just go out and buy a pineapple.

428
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:05,608
So I tried out a bunch of
things to see if they would
have the same effect.

00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,275
And guess what I found...

430
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,075

and is super easy to use.

00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,808
It is all thanks to you
that I... that I...

480
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,442
Nah, nah, it's fine.

481
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,875
We should work
together again, Megumi.

482
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,342
Okay!

483
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,042
<i>I think I may have</i>
<i>been paired up</i>

484
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:27,875
<i>with someone</i>
<i>really talented.</i>

485
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,142
<i>Someone special.</i>

486
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:30,075
Ehehehe.

487
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:31,408
By the way,

488
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,342
now that the two of us
have gotten acquainted,

489
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,542
you wanna try one of
my new dishes?

490
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:38,442
Oh! Are you sure?...
I would love to try it!

491
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,042
(Glop glop)
[SOMA]
Here...

492
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,775
Huh? I don't...

493
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,775
(Distant cackle)
It's honey‐coated
dried squid.

494
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,875
MM!

495
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,642
BLEEGGHH!

496
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,975
Ah!

497
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,608
AH!

498
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,608
AHHHH!

499
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:01,775
<i>The squid and honey</i>
<i>combination is so offensive</i>
<i>in so many ways,</i>

500
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,475
<i>it's as if my entire body</i>
<i>is being violated!</i>

501
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,875
[MEGUMI]
NOOOO!

502
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,075
(Ending Song)

503
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,742
(Oohs and aahs)
[SCHOOLGIRL 1]
Ah! That's Miss Erina!

504
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,675
[SCHOOLGIRL 2]
Omigosh, is she trying
a new dish again?

505
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,142
[SCHOOLGIRL 3]
Ahhh?! I would love to taste it!

506
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:51,908
I don't care what it is!

507
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:53,342
[HISAKO]
Miss Erina!

508
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,775
Please, Miss Erina!

509
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,608
[ERINA]
What are you
going on about?

510
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,408
Chef Chapelle's class
has just posted

511
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,742
his highest grade
of the day so far.

512
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,208
[HISAKO]
It was that transfer student:
Soma Yukihira!

513
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,042
ERRGH!

514
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,808
UH!

515
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,642
I'll tell you
just once...

516
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,375
(Demonic voice)
Do not mention that name
in front of me ever again!

517
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,875
I‐I'm sorry,
it won't happen again!

518
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:17,942
Grr!

519
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,608
(Cheeky laugh)

520
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,708
[ERINA]
<i>The one blot on my otherwise</i>
<i>pristine record...</i>

521
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,008
<i>I will not stand for this...</i>

522
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:28,742
<i>I'll make sure I get rid of</i>
<i>him as quickly as possible!</i>

523
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,942
<i>That I will!</i>

524
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,408
[SOMA]
Oh! And there's peanut
butter‐flavored squid.

525
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:39,108
(Cowering)
Plus I have all sorts of other
experiments for you to try...

526
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:44,075
(Evil laugh)
Somebody help me!
Get me away from this guy!

527
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,275
[MEGUMI]
Next time on Food Wars.

528
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,075
F‐f‐fourth course:

529
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,475
"Sacred Mother of Kyokusei"

530
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,642
Bon appétit!

531
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:03,708
[SOMA]
Oh, oh, oh!
Try THIS one next...

532
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:06,475
(Sheepish scream)
(Sinister laugh)
