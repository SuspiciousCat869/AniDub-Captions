[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Hey, you guys gettin' hungry?

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,400
Wanna get some ice cream?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,933
Nah, I need
something more filling!

4
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,433
[AKI]
Me too! I'm
starving over here!

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,700
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah I get that, but what
are you in the mood for?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,766
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Meat!

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,133
[AKI]
That sounds great!

8
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,166
I, like, want me
some meat!

9
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,000
Why don't you take
a little bite?

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,766
It's fried peanut butter
squid tentacles.

11
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,700
It's so putrid,
you're gonna freak.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,733
AHHmm!

13
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,666
(Peanut‐buttery cries)

14
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,700
No, please!

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,700
[AKI]
Every single day...

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,533
You look at that place
whenever we pass by.

17
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,033
Huh?! N‐not really...

18
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,433
Don't you
"not really" me!

19
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,433
I totally know you're
thinking about Soma again.

20
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,200
You should've told
him how you felt

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,366
while you were still gushing
over him in middle school.

22
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:55,666
Or at least when you
learned he was going off
to his fancy cooking school.

23
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,733
Uhhh...

24
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,900
Ah, no no! I'm sorry!

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,233
I didn't mean it
like that, Mayu!

26
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,133
Anyway, look, I don't
think it's too late

27
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,766
for you to go after him.

28
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe you should
try calling him

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,766
or, like, sending
a text or something.

30
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,000
But I...

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,266
I'm nothing special.

32
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,733
He would never
notice me.

33
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,866
Uh... Oh, uh, hey there,
Mayumi, how's it hanging?

34
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,266
Ahhh!

35
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,866
[BOYS] WOAH!
[AKI] Omigod, when
did you get here?!

36
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,700
Hey, it's been a while,
you guys.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,666
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
You should've told us
you were coming back!

38
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,466
You gonna reopen
the shop?

39
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,600
Nah, uh, I just
came to air the
place out for my dad.

40
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,633
WOOAAH!

41
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,733
"Yukihira" is open again!

42
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,166
What?!
A dream come true!

43
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,366
C'mon, Soma, please! You
gotta make me something!

44
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,633
I'm hungry too!
And me!

45
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,900
And me, too, please!

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,966
I've missed this
place's food so much!

47
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:44,166
Heh! 'Kay. I'll get to
prepping right away, folks.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,666
Eatery "Yukihira":

49
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,366
reopened for a limited time!

50
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,766
Yeah!

51
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,933
(Restaurant chatter)

52
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,533
One oyako bowl and
a tofu special!

53
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,533
Yahoo!

54
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,933
I've been craving this!

55
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,533
Where's your
dad been, Soma?

56
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,566
Haven't seen him around.

57
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,133
Well, he was back in
town a while ago...

58
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,966
Think he maybe went
overseas again or something.

59
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:47,300
Hey Soma!
Can I get a side
of fried sprouts?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,333
Coming!

61

<i>Ah, Soma...</i>

62
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,933
What? A cooking battle?

63
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,766
Yeah, he's gonna
go up against his dad

64
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,266
and, like, he wants
us to judge it.

65
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,800
You've never been to the
Yukihira restaurant, have you?

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,833
The food there is
TOTALLY super amazing!

67
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,633
You really don't
want to miss out on this.

truly is amazing.

[SOMA]
Thanks, guys!

84
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,833
That's weird, it's kinda
dead out there.

85
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:53,000
Normally, it'd be
pretty busy by now.

Is everything okay
with you, Mr. Tomita?

89
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,766
Does big business really
have that much power?!

90
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,466
Tomi, you need
to calm down.

91
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,166
What's wrong, has something
happened, Mr. Tomita?

92
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:13,266
The truth is, one month ago
the station's commercial area

93
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,033
finally reopened after
some major renovations.

94
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,733
[SOMA]
Oh, yeah, it looks great, huh?

95
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,766
[TOMITA]
Well, they beefed up their
"station shopping experience."

96
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:24,666
They've got clothing stores,
book stores, all sorts of
different boutiques.

97
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,333
But what's getting
the most buzz is this
fried chicken place.

98
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,000
Word is it's
really something!

99
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,266
Yeah?

100
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,133
So have you guys
tried it out already?

101
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,433
Uh‐huh. Yeah my parents
just bought some the other day.

102
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,633
Us too. Saw their
commercial on the internet.

103
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah, I hear it's been
getting a lot of views!

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,766
(Music playing)

105
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,733
It's crispy,
but oh so juicy!

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,833
One, two...

107
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,266
Unbelievable!
10 out of 10 taste score!

108
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,100
We keep losing customers.

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,166
All because they're going
over there for their fancy,
juicy fried chicken!

110
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,633
People coming from work, from
school...

111
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,400
They just pass on by.

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
My boxed lunch shop's
in trouble!

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
At this rate,
who knows how long
I can stay in business?

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,666
That's sad.

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,866
This isn't the time
to eat and sulk.

116
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:16,166
More, please.
No!

117
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess it's the sign of
the times around here.

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
We gotta face the facts,
our area is done for.

119
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,566
Okay, I'm gonna try something.

120
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,866
"Try something"? Like?

121
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,466
Their main draw is
fried chicken, right?

122
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,300
Well we're gonna come up with
a new kind of fried chicken,

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,566
one that will out‐juicy
their juiciest.

124
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,666
What?! That's crazy, Soma!

125
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,766
We are totally
outclassed here!

126
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,833
In funds AND
customer appeal!

127
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,200
Those guys are villains!

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,566
But it's better than
sittin' here doing nothin'.

129

Uhhh...

130
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,300
Customers tend to get greedy
when they want something.

"Yukihira" is open again!

132
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,466
C'mon, Soma, please!
You gotta make me something!

133
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:58,366
If something's really good,
they're sure to take notice.

134
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,033
(Cats meowing)
I'm part of this
shopping area, too.

135
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,066
I can't just let it go downhill.

136
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,066
I'll do what it takes to get
this place hoppin' again!

137
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,433
Let's make a new kind
of fried chicken!

138
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,900
Ohhh!

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
I like your thinking, Soma!

140
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,733
He's definitely
Yukihira's son, alright!

141
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,833
It just might work!

142
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,033
Here's the plan:

143
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm gonna use
all my time off

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,166
to make the ultimate
fried chicken!

145
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,066
[SOMA]
There's a lot
of prep work to do!

146
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,533
So there's no time to waste.

147

says you want to help him out,

like there's anything you can
do that's useful...

some mental help, girl.

you have a taste tester?

This girl here doesn't have any
conflicts or club activities

157
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,700
and she happens to have a really
great sense of taste!

158
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,233
Uh...

159
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,733
Ah, what're you doing?!

160
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,566
I don't know a thing about
being a proper taste tester!

161
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,433
Well an amateur's opinion
could actually be pretty
useful at a time like this.

162
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,600
But Aki, I'm just a‐

163
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,233
HYA!

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,333
"Ooh, I'd love
to help."

165
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,133
Oh. Well, I do appreciate
the offer, Mayumi.

166
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,766
First, we've gotta check out
their fried chicken.

167
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:15,466
That'll give us a clue as
to how to make our new dish.

168
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,633
"Yeah, right!"

169
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,900
[SOMA]
Great. I'll see
you tomorrow morning.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,033
"Uh‐huh!"

171
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,066
[MAYU] (Sigh)
Can I do this?

172
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,933
I'm not so sure.

173
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,100
I'm not qualified to judge
something like this...

174
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh don't be silly.
You've already judged for one
of his cooking battles!

175
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,033
That's totally different!

176
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,600
This is going to be an
important new menu item, okay!

177
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,633
You listen to me!

178
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,233
This is your big chance, Mayu!

179
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,700
A man and woman
with the same goal,

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,666
working in close quarters...

181
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,600
Aaah!

182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,366
They're sure to get super close
and intimate with each other!

183
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,733
G‐g‐g‐get close?

184
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,700
Do not screw this up!
You hear me?!

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,366
Aki, you're scaring me!

186
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>Fried chicken, huh?</i>

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,466
<i>I've made it here</i>
<i>plenty of times, but...</i>

188
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,500
<i>like that buffet challenge</i>
<i>at the training camp,</i>

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,500
<i>there might be more</i>
<i>to it, something to</i>
<i>do with the takeout.</i>

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,066
<i>Who out of my friends would</i>
<i>know something about that?</i>

191
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,433
<i>Fried chicken...</i>

(Phone ringing)

197
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,033
Ugh. Who the hell could that be?

198
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,833
I'm tryin' to enjoy my
vacation time over here, people!

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,566
What in the...? That's weird.

200
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,700
I don't think I've ever
seen this number before.

201
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,066
Who is this?

202
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,266
<i>Hey, Meat‐Meat. It's Soma!</i>

203
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,166
How did you get my number?!

204
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,000
<i>Oh uh, sorry about that,</i>
<i>I asked Kanichi to tell me.</i>

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,933
Okay, so, what do
you want, Soma?

206
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm kinda in a hurry to
create a new spectacular
fried chicken dish.

207
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm in my hometown right now,

208
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,166
but I was wondering if you'd be
able to come and help me out.

209
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,933
Huh? You want me to
come to your house?

210
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,666
<i>Are you too busy?</i>

211
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,400
No! I, uh, mean YES.

212
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
I'm sure I can find time to
help out a classmate.

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,033
Still, I'm SO busy over here.

214
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,466
My goodness, does the time fly!

215
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,466
I guess it can't be helped,
y'know, so busy...

216
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,366
<i>If you're too busy,</i>
<i>I can ask someone else.</i>

00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,533
<i>I JUST SAID I'LL DO IT! AHHHH!</i>

218
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,666
Um... Uh...

Creepy. This whole
area looks deserted.

Let's see...
"Japanese Eatery 'Yukihira.'"

Where are you?

225
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Maybe I should have dressed in a
bit more conservative fashion.

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
No, no! I won't let society
rule me I gotta be me!

227
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,800
[SOMA]
Sorry, Mayumi!

228
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,166
Just a bit
longer, okay?

229
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,533
S‐sure! I'm fine!
Take your time!

230
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,133
Oh my God! I'm so nervous!

231
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,866
I wonder if I'll be able
to help at all.

232
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,733
You better get close!
You gotta get all
up in there, Mayu!

AHHHH!

This is the Yukihira
restaurant, right?

237
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,600
Is, uh, Soma here?

238
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Uh... um yes.

Oh, Meat‐Meat!

Thanks for coming all this way.

Oh, so I see you've
already met my friend Mayumi

from middle school.

243
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,333
She's gonna be
our taste‐tester.

244
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,466
Huh?

245
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,700
This is one of my fellow
high‐school students.

She is our resident
meat expert.

You can call her
"Meat‐Meat."

Will you stop telling people

250
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,033
about that stupid nickname!

251
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,200
I will cut you!

Come on, where's
your team spirit?

Ahhhh! What should I wear?

00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,266
Maybe I should go
with something daring.

260
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,200
Can I just go in
there being myself?

No! Aagh, son of a...!

Whoa! It's gotten
so big!

It's kinda fancy, too.

264
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:20,125
Our shopping district doesn't
stand a chance against somethin'
like this, huh? (Laughs)

265
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,192
Um. That's nothing
to laugh about, Soma.

Wait, so this fried
chicken place is a Mozuya?

You've heard of it?

It's really popular all over
the Kansai area these days.

459
00:20:56,177 --> 00:21:00,510
It's just a matter of time
before Mozuya dominates
throughout the entire area!

460
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,510
Just to be safe, I want you to
keep an eye out for him.

461
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,310
And continue to report in.
Understand?

462
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,977
Yeah, sure thing.

463
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:11,077
Grrr... How many of
these uppity brats

464
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,410
do I have to deal
with in one day?

[IKUMI]
Hmm. None of them
are BAD per se,

466
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,944
they're just kinda normal.

467
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,944
We've already tried
different seasonings
and changing up

468
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,410
the batter consistency.

469
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,410
Nothing's jumping off
the plate, is it?

470
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,110
<i>So what do we change?</i>

471
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,044
<i>What kind of fried chicken</i>
<i>would win back our customers?</i>

472
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:32,044
<i>We need something</i>

Wait... Students pass by
even while on vacation.

476
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:40,910
Lots of them, too.

477
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,377
They're coming back
from their club activities.

478
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:44,944
There are a lot
of schools around here.

479
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:49,377
We've got high school
and college kids...

480
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:53,277
S‐something that's unique to
this shopping area.

481
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,410
I've got it!

482
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,310
Huh? What do
you mean, Soma?

483
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,844
Oh, man, I've been such
a bonehead about this!

484
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,310
We don't have to fight the
enemy on their own terms!

485
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,677
So we're going with the
A5 beef after all?!

486
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,777
Nah, we're still going
with the fried chicken.

487
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:09,977
Um, but didn't you just say
you didn't want to fight
them at their own game?

488
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:11,710
And we're not going to.

489
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,577
We'll use the same thing, but
we'll do something they can't.

490
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:19,144
Something so unique that
only we can provide it.

491
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:22,644
A way to make eating
fried chicken better
than it's ever been...

492
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:23,777
Heh!

493
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:25,910
We'll create something
specific to this area...

494
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,577
The deciding factor
in this battle! Hehe.

You'll do what
I say without question.

I'll consult for you
only on that condition.

497

Good, I'll do it.

Yes yes. I'm well
aware of that.

502
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,110
What's on
today's agenda?

503
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,477
Didn't you look
at the notice?

504
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,277
It's the Fall
Selection.

505
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:26,844
We have to go through
the first‐years and whittle
down the candidates.

506
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,277
But you know that.

507

Yeah, but seriously...

508
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:31,977
Why do we have to bother with
this on our vacation time?

[ISSHIKI]
Well, it can't be helped.

This is an important
responsibility...
