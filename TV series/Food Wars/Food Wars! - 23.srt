00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,166
[AOKI] Zero points!
[SATO] Zero points!

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:05,666
[AOKI]
Zero points again?!

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:09,033
[SATO]
Is zero the only score
Natsume Sendawara know?!

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,766
[AOKI]
Maybe her machine's,
like, broken or somethin'!

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,466
[SATO]
Alice Nakiri's gothy
servant‐dude, huh?

6
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,733
What kind of food is
this weirdo gonna make?

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:23,333
Apparently he had some huge
lines at the camp's 200‐dish
breakfast challenge.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:27,866
[NATSUME]
Ah, yes. That's the young man
who was preparing lobster.

9
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:32,133
He acted like a different person
when he was cooking earlier.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,966
[KODA]
Ohhh! The contrast of the
fiery red of the lobster

11
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,066
against the bright yellow of the
saffron rice is quite beautiful.

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,400
And it's been expertly treated
so that the legs and the
antennae pose no danger.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,300
How thoughtful.
This presentation has a
grace and refinement to it.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,933
It's difficult to find
this outside of the fine
dining experience.

15
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,333
Yeah. Several restaurants
serve lobster curry within
their repertoire.

16
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,400
A seafood curry is nothing
special to write home about.

17
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,500
(Gasp)

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,666
<i>Forest...</i>

19
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>Deep forest...</i>

20
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,133
<i>What is this?</i>

21
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:13,066
<i>What is this aroma?</i>

22
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,566
Whoa! That's the first time
she's taken a second bite!

23
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,900
[SCHOOLGIRL]
It must be pretty incredible!

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,533
[SCHOOLBOY]
I know, right?!

25
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,033
(Sligh moan)

26
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,400
[YUA]
The A‐Block Competition
continues.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,033
Ryo Kurokiba's lobster dish
is currently being tasted.

28
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:12,300
(Moaning)
Aaahhhh...

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,533
The sauce is americaine,
but its origin is French.

30
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:20,533
It's rich with fish stock
and butter, and it also has
savory vegetables.

31
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,333
But the core of this deep,
woody fragrance...

32
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,633
it actually seems to be
coming from...

33
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,033
Cognac!

34
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,833
That's a top‐quality brandy.

35
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,800
It's made in the region around
the western French city of
Cognac, correct?

36
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,166
Smells enticing!

37
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,266
Brandy is infused with
the scent of wooden casks

38
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,500
when left to age
creating this aroma.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,466
That would explain
why this curry dish...

40
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:45,000
has such a rich fragrance
of cedar and sandalwood
emitting from it.

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
You are correct in that.

42
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,933
However, I used a top‐shelf
Napoleon cognac.

43
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,666
This was to deepen the scent
of the curry and bring out the
pureness of the others flavors.

44
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,566
To think, the aroma of cognac
could enhance curry so greatly!

45
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,333
This is the perfect accentuation
to French lobster curry!

46
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,133
This is the first time the
judges have reacted!

47
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,133
That guy's curry must be
some kind of amazing!

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,166
[ALICE]
It's been a while, Erina.

49
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:14,933
Let me introduce you.
I have my very own aide now.

50
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,533
You have an aide?

51
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,166
I do! I found him
in Northern Europe.

52
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,033
So he's like some
kind of pet puppy?

53
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,166
No! Okay, be a
good boy and speak.

54
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,766
Hey.

55
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,866
<i>Well he must be</i>
<i>skilled enough</i>

56
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,833
<i>for Alice to have</i>
<i>put her trust in him.</i>

57
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:34,466
Well. It's about time our
dishes start to receive a
proper judgment.

58
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,933
Yeah, okay.

59
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,233
But is that really it?

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
Seems like there should be more
to the dish.

61
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,000
[NATSUME]
Um, well, it wasn't a bad dish.

62
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,466
I may actually give it a score.

63
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,766
Your score will be‐

64
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,266
Hmm...

65
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,166
Huh? Oh... Just a sec...

66
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,866
Oh, there it is...

67
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,100
Huh?

68
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,933
Not just yet!

69
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,966
It's still too soon for
you to stop eatin'!

70
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:04,266
Um, was it really necessary
to go through all that?

71
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,133
Well...
What're these for?

72
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,800
It would seem that these are
filled with cognac as well.

73
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,566
There's still a part of the dish
you haven't enjoyed yet.

74
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,133
The tomalley nestled deep inside
the lobster head!

75
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:21,366
You must take this dropper,
put a couple of drops into the
shell and then slurp it up.

76
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,300
That's the most satisfying
way to eat this dish.

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
You want me to "slurp it"?

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,266
How could you even suggest
we do something so vulgar?

79
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:32,766
At least serve it once
you've split the shell.

80
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,466
Why are you holding back,
my dear?

81
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,400
Excuse me?

82
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,233
I can tell by just
looking at you.

83
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,000
I can see your true colors.

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,133
The truth is you want
to scarf it down right now

85
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,366
in all of its
dirty glory!

86
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,566
Once you've swallowed the
tomalley with the cognac,

87
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,966
try stuffing your mouths with
the roux and saffron rice again.

88
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:55,466
It'll be so sinfully delicious
it'll make what you just
ate look like nothing.

89
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,533
<i>More delicious?</i>

<i>(Slurping)</i>

<i>The delicious seafood flavor</i>
<i>explodes in your mouth,</i>

<i>blending with the rich,</i>
<i>woody aroma!</i>

93
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>So... sensual...</i>

00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>My consciousness...</i>

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,000
<i>It's flying away!</i>

[SCHOOLBOY 1] Awesome!
[SCHOOLBOY 2] He totally
just took the lead!

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
[SCHOOLGIRL]
I don't believe it!

100
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,133
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
93 points?!

101
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,233
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
I thought for sure

102
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,500
Akira would sweep A‐Block!

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,333

This guy is one heck
of a dark horse!

106
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,800
[SCHOOLBOY 3]
This really shakes things up!

107
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,966
For as long as
I can remember,

108

(Bar revelry)

111
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,600
This academy is
a disappointment!

[SCHOOLGIRL]
Can you believe that score?!

113

How could someone just come
in and jump that far ahead?

[RYO]
Well, that's that.

Heh! That was a grand
surprise, wasn't it?

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,433
At his young age,
70 or 80 points

118
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,166
should've been the most he could
have gotten in this competition.

Will, the, uh, next contestant
please come forward now?

123
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:13,661
Ooh!

124
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,728
Wait, this is...

125
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,828
Go ahead and eat
it up, everyone.

126
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:19,361
Allow me to present
to you my curry dish...

127
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:21,795
Dongpo pork curry bowl!

128
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,261
Dongpo pork...

129
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,128
It's pork belly simmered
in soy sauce

130
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:26,828
and other delectable
ingredients.

131
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,461
Just look! The sultriness
of this ravishing meat!

132
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,228
It's glistening
with juices!

133
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:34,428
The pork belly has been cut
so that it has three
distinct layers,

134
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:37,661
alternating between
lean meat and fatty meat.

135
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:41,695
What's most notable is
the dish wobbles simply by
tapping the bowl gently.

136
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:45,361
It takes an incredible
sense of temperature
control to achieve that!

137
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,061
In some regions this
masterpiece is lovingly
called "Three‐layer meat."

138
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,361
(Sniff)
We are now entering
the realm of the senses.

139
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,128
My tongue is rejoicing before
I've even taken a bite!

140
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:58,328
It looks like her
dish has made a good
impression on them.

141
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,395
Thatta way to take it
to 'em, Meat‐Meat!

142
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,828
That is awesome, Meat‐Meat!

143
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:04,161
The meat has been cut
into thick cubes,

144
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,128
and it has most certainly
absorbed the umami of the soup!

145
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:11,595
I want to grab that meat and
tear a big ol' bite into it!

146
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,895
I can't even imagine what
it would taste like.

147
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,695
<i>Uh! W‐wait a moment...</i>

148

<i>I still haven't recovered</i>
<i>from the shock of that</i>
<i>lobster curry.</i>

149
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,728
<i>To have it followed up</i>
<i>by a dish like this...</i>

150
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,428
What's the matter?

151
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:26,895
Take yourself a great
big bite of meat.

152
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:30,095
Taste the pleasure of the
highest‐quality pork around.

153

AAAHHHH!

156
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,561
The moment you bite into it,

157
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,828
the pork's juices spill
out like an untamed waterfall

158
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,361
of velvety smoothness!

159
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:45,528
The distinctive smell
of pork belly skin

160
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,528
is masked by the aroma
of the spices...

161
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,028
So that the tongue is
hit by the sweetness of the
fat and richness of the curry.

162
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,695
It's a mind‐scrambler!

163
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:56,328
I parboiled the shank,
pan‐frying the surface to a
savory finish.

164
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,628
Simmering it in soy
and oyster sauce, Shaoshing rice
wine and other flavors.

165
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:05,795
My aromatic spices were a blend
of star anise, a little ginger,
and Sichuan pepper.

166

<i>But I don't get it.</i>

<i>Why is it so easy to eat</i>
<i>with a mere spoon?</i>

169
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,928
I see! It's all in the rice!

170
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,461
The rice has been mixed with
a little bit of rock salt,

171

and teng jiao
you flavoring oil!

The numbing sensation and
refreshing scent of ten jiao you

makes this oil set
one's heart to racing!

174
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:29,095
It makes you crave the sweetness
of the fat, which allows
the cycle to continue.

This is everything

It certainly doesn't
have much impact compared
to that last dish.

213
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:18,195
Alright this could either be
an Indian dal or a bean curry.

214
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,028
It's very similar to
Indian channa masala.

215
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,828
But why is it so thick?

216
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,295
Because it's natto!

217
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:28,461
<i>Stickiness and umami</i>
<i>intertwine on the tongue!</i>

Now don't tell me
this is actually‐

221
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:38,195
[RYOKO]
It's natto that was
finished on coals.

222
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:40,861
In other words,
it's char‐fired natto.

223
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,395
I kept charcoal burning
in the basement,

224
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:45,961
preserving the optimal
temperature and humidity.

225
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,561
Then I spread the natto
spores over soybeans,

226
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,461
fermenting them over
dozens of hours.

227
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,528
I nurtured it over the course
of the summer vacation.

228
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,928
She used charcoal to
slowly age the natto,

229
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,461
and by doing so, she made
the flavor especially strong.

230
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,695
Because that doesn't kill
the bacteria, it keeps natto's
ammonia odor in check.

231
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:06,328
But that's not all!
There's something else in there.

232
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:10,528
What is this umami that
reverberates on the tongue
like a deep bass?

233
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,228
I added soy sauce koji
to help bring out more flavor.

234
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,595
Soy sauce koji?!

235
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,761
Soy sauce mixed with
malted rice.

236
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,295
Then it's fermented at room
temperature for weeks to make
a flavoring agent.

237
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,728
Okay then.

238
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:24,828
So that black stuff
she's been carrying around

239
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,228
is soy sauce koji!

240
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,628
And that sticky stuff
was the natto!

241
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:31,961
Soy sauce koji's umami
component, glutamic acid,

242
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,995
is more than ten times stronger
than that of salt koji!

243
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,428
So zat's how she was able
to increase ze flavor

244
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:40,495
without it being overpowered
by ze strength of ze curry.

00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,705
head chef at ze luxurious
Ritz‐Carlton hotel.

303
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,338
It looks quite creamy and
heavy,

304
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:43,838
but the chopsticks are
able to move through it

305
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,372
with such delicate ease.

306
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,238
That would be because of the
supremely lightweight noodles

307
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,672
and coriander powder.

308
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:54,972
<i>A mellowness reminiscent of</i>
<i>citrus fruits and select spices</i>

309
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,605
<i>They're a perfect match for</i>
<i>the cumin‐infused noodles,</i>

310
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:00,505
<i>with each complementing</i>
<i>each other!</i>

311
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,838
<i>Such unbelievable pleasure!</i>

312
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:07,305
I used dill as a
cornerstone ingredient
to top the Vichyssoise.

313
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:11,505
I combined that with the
dill's seeds and seedlings
in a pan roast.

314
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,438
Creating an extremely
aromatic soup.

315
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,505
How did you come up with
something resembling
modern tsukemen

316
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:19,338
based on the vichyssoise
of over 100 years ago?!

and smoked egg?!

You can't go around
just smoking anything
and everything!

I mean, come on!

<i>In the end, the theme is CURRY.</i>

354
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:54,472
<i>This reckless smoking seems</i>
<i>like he's out to destroy the</i>

(Smoky squeals)

356
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,638
The spices in play are:
ground cinnamon, ground cumin,

357
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,205
cardamom‐and‐clove,
mixed into a heady blend.

358
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,805
He also added apple
bits that were slowly
cooked over smoke chips.

359
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:10,405
I see! That's how he managed to
elevate the flavor of the spices

360
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,805
instead of overpowering them!

361
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,272
Yes! These smoke chips
are the optimal way

362
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,538
to make use of the
coarse‐ground spices.

363
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,272
Prior to them being smoked,

364
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,938
the spices were cured
in a Saumur.

365
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,872
Giving a solid curry flavor.

366
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:26,405
Even from just the toppings,
you'll experience
a distinct taste.

00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,405
Your choice of toppings
are excellent.

368
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,872
The egg really locks
in the umami flavor!

369
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,338
Being soft‐boiled, the yolk is
perfectly viscous and oozes out!

That's it! I get it now!

375
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:49,738
The salt that he added
to the spices has also
been regaled in smoke!

376
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,638
How does one go
about smoking salt?!

377
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,938
But wouldn't that change the
flavor of the curry in the dish?

[SHUN]
By the way, rather than ordinary
salt, I used seaweed salt.

Seaweed, which contains
a lot of sodium,

380

is dried and then
dissolved in water.

The top layer is scooped out
and boiled to create salt.
