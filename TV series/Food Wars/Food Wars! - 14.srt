11
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,674
<i>The key to a souffle's texture</i>

<i>I can keep putting them</i>

it seems you get it.

For a buffet, nothing's more
important than appearance

Put simply, you chose the
absolute worst dish to make
for this challenge.

The "whites" are a gelÃ©e of
diluted seawater.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,574
The "yolk" is salmon roe that's
been firmed up with gelatin!

47
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:02,607
Huh? At first glance,
this looks like
a hard‐boiled egg...

48
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:05,674
But the "whites" are a
mousse of white asparagus,

49
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:09,707
and the yolks were used as a
base for a hollandaise sauce.

00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,207
Balancing the richness
of the eggs

of the asparagus is exquisite!

still fluffy like foam!

so when you press it with
a spoon, it just bounces back!

Oh, my, what a shame.

172
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:03,284
I've used up all my
ingredients that I
prepared for today.

173
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:07,517
I never thought so many people
would be brave enough to try
a dish so innovative.

174
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,751
M'kay. You can call
it quits then.

Even though he's taking
on that much work,

204
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,384
his cooking pace is
getting faster.

205
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,151
Each time he
finishes a round,

206
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,417
his technique
actually improves.

207
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,217
He's refining it on the fly.

208
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,984
This is so good!

209
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,317
It melts in your mouth!

210
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,351
I am loving this.

211
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,184
How can it
be so fluffy?

Word is spreading
around the floor.

Great for this style

Raw ingredients are

creating excitement as
ingredients are transformed
into a completed dish.

Oh whatever.
Don't even give me that look.

245

Just barely making it
is nothing to brag about.

246
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:04,851
That was a shocker!

247
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,351
I didn't think you had
a chance to even

248

get past eight plates.

249
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:11,951
Although still, using showy
tactics did seem a bit cheap.

Huh?

251
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,917
That was some
surge of momentum,
wouldn't you say?

252
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:21,817
Yes. He understood the most
important aspect, which was to
quickly assess the situation.

253
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,917
Mm‐hmm. And most importantly...

254
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,484
it's key to have
a clear idea in mind.

255
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,917
One will need to have a
strong knowledge in service,

256
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,984
so as to anticipate the
needs of a hotel breakfast
presented buffet style.

257
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,117
There is one more thing:

258
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:39,817
An ability needed when faced
with the whims of a kitchen,

259
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,984
where the unexpected is
almost sure to happen...

260
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:48,651
The skill to adapt. When a major
blow has been dealt to your
menu, you must move forward.

261
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,351
And he did that perfectly.

262
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,817
He's a bit unrefined,
but he's an interesting
specimen.

263
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,117
On the other hand...

264
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:58,651

Erina Nakiri was the
only student to clear
the 400‐plate mark.

266
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:09,284
And then there was the girl who
used all her ingredients,
serving 380 plates.

267
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:12,517
But if you
rely on gimmicky
cooking like that,

268
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,551
you'll never make
it to the top.

269
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:20,017
What you need is an approach
that's built on the latest
advances in cooking theory.

270
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:23,351
For example, cooking
that's revolutionary.

272
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,884
I should really
introduce myself...

My name is Alice Nakiri.

274
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,851
That's a name with far more
prestige than any of you.

275
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,451
Remember it well.

276
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,351
Alice... Nakiri?

Yes.

00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,884
She is my
unfortunate cousin.

280
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,984
I lived in the same mansion as
her till I turned five.

tell Soma here

284
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:57,483
about my privileged
culinary background?

285
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,183
Oh, well, uh...

286
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:02,349
Mistress Alice happens
to be Miss Erina's cousin.

that revelation!

Never mind!
I'll tell him myself!

289
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:09,283
My father is sentimental.

290
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,316
He chose my mother's
hometown in Denmark

291
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,049
as the prime location
for his innovative company,

292
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,049
Nakiri International.
You may've heard of it.

293
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:21,083
There they research cutting‐edge
cooking techniques based
on molecular gastronomy,

294
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:25,783
with the study of mechanisms
of taste and smell, and even
cerebral physiology.

295
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:30,883
It's a top‐notch research
center, unlike any culinary
facility on Earth.

296
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,283
I stayed there till
I was 14 years old.

297
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:36,349
And then, I came
to Tohtsuki Academy...

298
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,449
To face my dear sweet cousin,

299
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,883
and ultimately take her place
as the queen of the school!

300
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:45,649
Right... As if I could lose
to some silly novelty chef
with "cutting edge" methods.

301
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:48,616
But it's cute that you
allow yourself to have
such a big dream.

302
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,316
Gah! 'Course
you'd say that!

303
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,483
You've always
been that way!

304
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,883
When I was three, you'd steal
all my favorite toys.

305
00:17:55,983 --> 00:18:00,616
When I was four, I spent
all day making a cake.
Remember what you said?!

306
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:01,683
It's stinks.

307
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,183
[ALICE]
I mean who does that?!

308
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,416
And I will never forget what
you did when I was five!

309
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,483
Oh shut up, none of that has
anything to do with anything!

310
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,749
And as for you,
Mister Big Deal,
Soma Yukihira.

311
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,583
You sure talked
a lot of talk at
opening ceremony...

312
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:18,983
But the days when people
can get by on nothing but
showmanship are at an end.

313
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:24,616
As proof of that, you were
down to the wire for a challenge
that only required 200 plates.

314
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,016
HAHAHAHA!

315
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,316
Right, I was totally
getting worried!

316
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,116
I almost didn't make
it outta there.

317
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:33,416
I really messed that
up, didn't I?

318
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,749
But hey...

319
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,383
I gained the kinda experience
that comes from messing up.

320
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,116
You're really annoying.

321
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:45,016
Whatever, I'm not going
to lose to any of you!

322
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:48,849
I'm looking forward to
beating you all and taking
the top spot at the Academy.

323
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:52,649
Yeah, you don't say. I feel like
I've heard that one before.

324
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,149
I'm sure you have.

325
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,716
Well, till next time!

326
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,983
[TAKUMI and MEGUMI]
Soma!

327
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,816
Ohmigosh! I was so
worried about you!

328
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,449
You had no game plan
whatsoever, did you?!

329
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,416
Oh, uh, sorry?

330
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,383
[GIN]
Attention, everyone
who cleared 200 plates:

331
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:22,183
Get some rest because,
your next challenge will
take place in four hours.

332
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:23,683
He's kidding,
right?!

333
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,383
No... No, no, no, no!

334
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,149
That gives us just
over three hours to sleep!

335
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:31,249
I like training camp.
This is fun.

336
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,516
[SCHOOLGIRL]
It isn't over yet!

337
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,816
Uh! I can't take
it anymore!

338
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,583
My legs won't
even move!

339
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,049
I just wanna
lie down...

340
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,816
I'm so exhausted.

341
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,416
What is this? I don't
know what we're doing here,
but I don't like it.

342
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:06,216
Well there's nothing
written in the
camp itinerary.

343
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,049
Huh? Wait just a minute!

344
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,449
This pattern is
looking familiar...

345
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,216
Don't tell me we have to
stay up all night again!

346
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,716
[GIN]
Very well...

347
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,149
It seems you're all here.

348
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,883
Please! Not this again!

349
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,683
Just a few words
before we get started.

350
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:26,449
So far, 352 students
have failed,

351
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,949
leaving 628 remaining.

352
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:30,583
Though it may seem cruel,

353
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:34,449
this is a taste of what
it's really like to be
a working chef.

354
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,749
You must keep your cool in
unfamiliar situations,

355
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,616
always retaining a "dialogue"
with your ingredients.

356
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:46,016
If you become a chef in the
real world, you'll face far
greater pressures than this.

357
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:49,883
There will be nights where
you will have to endure
anxiety and indecision,

358
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,383
while dealing with
various situations.

359
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,249
Being a chef is like
living in a wasteland,

360
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:58,749
and having to brave the storms
and trials all by yourself.

361
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:02,949
The longer you endure it, the
more difficult it becomes...

362
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,816
and you can lose sight
of your goal.

363
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,883
Even when you've reached
the summit, you may very
well forget the way back.

364
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,249
However!

365
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,083
I want you to remember this:

366
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,549
Know that there were
comrades here at Tohtsuki,

367
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,216
who left tracks in that
wasteland with you.

368
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,983
You traversed it together.

369
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,683
And that fact should comfort
you when you one day
set foot on your own.

370
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,483
From the bottom of my
heart, I wish you the
best as you fight on.

371
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,249
Now then, let's begin the
final segment of this training
camp's program.

372
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:35,116
Dude!

373
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,149
Why do they hate
us so much?!

374
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,249
Welcome!

375
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:43,849
The final act is to congratulate
you on completing your training,

376
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,616
and offer you this humble meal.

esteemed graduates.

To all of the 628 who
remain standing with us,

of this camp! Congrats!
