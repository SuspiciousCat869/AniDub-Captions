If that were to happen...

We would gracefully
shut our doors...

Perhaps it's because
that eyesore of a sign

That if you can't provide
what the customer needs,

close your doors.

is just right.

already started.

thick‐cut bacon I had for
tomorrow's breakfast.

From the very restaurant
you were just insulting.

306

Shall I tell you...?

307
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,846
The secret to
its flavor.

308
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,513
[SOMA]
Once the potatoes
are nice and soft...

309
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:43,780
I grabbed some fibrous mushrooms
to soak up the fat.

310
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,346
Then, I diced up some onion

311
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,480
to bump up the sweetness, and
then kneaded both of them in.

312
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,980
Next, I wrapped it with
the thick‐cut bacon.

313
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,746
Then I slowly cooked
it in the oven.

314
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,546
That made the bacon
nice and crispy.

315
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,613
That's when the potato
and mushrooms did their thing,
