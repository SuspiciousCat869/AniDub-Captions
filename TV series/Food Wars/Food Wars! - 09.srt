You saved me some work.
Thank you.

Also, 15 minutes

keeps customers waiting,

then they pick up

Yup, we'll fry
the fish we caught.

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,933
Yeah okay,
I guess...

192
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,133
but we don't have any
flour or cornstarch...

193
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,466
Nothing to act
as a breading.

194
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,633
How do you plan
on deep‐frying it?

195
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,233
The fish has a lot of moisture,

196
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,933
so without any breading it's
not going to fry up properly.

197
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,700
Actually, we do have some.

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,633

(Gasps)

212
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,433
Now this has such
a wonderful texture!

213
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,766
It's so crispy.

214
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,333
And the fish is nice and warm!

215
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:49,066
The coating protected the char,
concentrating its flavor.

[BOTH]
Uhh...

217
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,100
[HINAKO]
The flavor of the
rice crackers themselves

218
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,833
gives the coating
another layer of complexity.

219
00:11:55,933 --> 00:12:02,000
And on the side, we have a
light and fluffy sauce using
eggs and pepper buds.

220
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,866
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
He used eggs as a base?

221
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:08,033
And it looks like he added
salad oil to the yolks.
And then whisked it up.

222
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,033
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Oh yeah. So that's his sauce?

223
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,033
Then he added to the eggs,

224
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:16,166
salt and shaved pepper buds,
the young sansho leaves.

225
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,566
That gave it a
refreshing sensation,

226
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,866
tempering the oil and
creating a refined flavor.

227
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:27,200
The creaminess of the sauce
glistening between bites
of the crispy coating

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,333
really rouses the appetite.

229

The treatment of the fried
vegetables was skillful as
well.

230

Soma, how did you come up
with something like this?

00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:36,666
We have okaki‐age that's
used in Japanese cooking, right.

250
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,666
We pound down the rice crackers,
then use it as a coating
to fry the ingredients,

251
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,600
giving the dish an unexpected
texture and flavor.

I've made it back home

the idea to use kaki no
