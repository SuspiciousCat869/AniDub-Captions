Fried chicken...

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,066
With rising plumes of steam...

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:09,800
and spices that tickle
the nose...

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,633
The plump texture of the meat...

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,866
and the hot juices that
run down one's chin...

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:20,733
This is the comfort food that
continues to grace Japanese
tables everywhere.

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:26,200
And now, the decisive battle
over it, one fought with knives
and skewers, is about to begin.

Sumire‐dori Shopping District‐

the Summer Battle
for Fried Chicken!

[SOMA]
Let's go check out the enemy!

11
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,633
(Obnoxious laugh)

12
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,966
I mean, it's not like YOU
could ever make something
this delicious.

13
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,766
[SOMA]
What would you say if

14
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:25,466
our shopping area can make a
fried chicken more delicious
than yours...

15
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,200
Mozuya would be
totally disgraced!

16
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,633
You sure do talk a big
game there, little boy.

17
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,966
But talking's a lot easier
than cooking, isn't it?

18
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,233
What are you
gonna do, punk?

19
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,200
What is the ideal way for
someone to eat fried chicken?

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
Uhh...

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,900
Well it's gotta be when
it's piping hot fresh

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
right out of the fryer,
of course‐

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,800
That's right!

24
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,200
But you see,

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Mozuya's dishes don't
necessarily represent that.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,133
Huh? Meaning what exactly?

27
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,566
The takeout boxes that they send
home with their customers

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,666
are closed off in order
to keep the heat from escaping.

29
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,366
Those are made assuming
they'll be eaten when
the customer gets home

30
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,666
and not right away when they're
bought at the franchise.

31
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:12,800
Their customers aren't
opening them up and eating them
in the middle of the station.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,133
Makes sense.
There's no food court
area at the station,

33
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,233
so the only option
they have is takeout.

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,800
However, our shopping area
doesn't have that mentality!

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,600
After all, that's one of
the reasons you come here,
to snack and walk around.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,566
Chomping down on fresh
hot fried goodness...

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,266
And that, my friends, is when
fried chicken is at its best!

38
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,600
Plus we've got plenty
of starving school kids

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,500
that need something quick,
easy, and portable.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,633
That's brilliant!

41
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,600
We don't have to fight
on their terms at all.

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,533
We will offer fresh hot,
ready‐made food for takeout.

43
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,000
We can use this location
to its full advantage!

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,933
Exactly right!

45
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,066
The keyword is...

46
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,366
"Fried chicken for
eating and walking"!

47
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:54,466
I'm feeling pretty good
about our chances.

48
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,233
Yeah!

Woohoo! YEAH!

50

WOOOOOOHOO! Now you
got me all fired up!

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm on it! I'm going to make a
new exciting dish as well!

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Huh?

53
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,033
'Cause after all,
I am a lunchtime expert.

54
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:11,933
With everyone's help,
we'll take those suckers down!

that, Mr. Tomita.

that four‐eyed dweeb for good.

A package so you
can eat it on the spot.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Then add some toothpicks...

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,166
Something like this, maybe?

77
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,566
You plan on
reusing milk cartons?

78
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,666
Ohh!

79
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:18,933
Elementary and
middle‐school kids

80
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,100
seem to like to eat
fried chicken, so...

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,833
I've got one flavored
with curry powder

82
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,566
and another with some
gooey grated cheese
melted all over it.

83

[SOMA]
What do you think?

84
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,000
Delicious!

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,000
Both the curry and the cheese
are great! But, uh...

86
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,433
I feel like Mozuya's chicken
was still more satisfying in
taste and texture.

87
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,966
So, um... well...

88
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,066
I don't think this quite
measures up yet.

89
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
Oh, alright...

90
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:58,100
Putting it in a package
and having you eat
it with toothpicks

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,700
makes the serving
size feel small.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,733
It pales to the in‐your‐face
meatiness of Mozuya's.

93
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,733
And the flavorings are only
concentrated on the surface.

94
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,500
We've gotta bring out the
quality of the ingredients
throughout.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,166
Ah! What about if we
tried putting the fried
chicken on a stick?

96
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,466
You could eat it with one
hand and not be messy!

97
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:18,666
Uhhh... chicken‐on‐a‐stick
is a pretty common concept.

98
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:22,033
It doesn't really
scream that it's
something different.

99
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh... Okay...

100
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,700
We need packaging that's not
only new and unique,

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
BUT will also be able
to draw out more flavors.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,866
There has got to be some idea
out there to solve both problems
at the same time.

103
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,233
Got it!

104
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,766
I've got a bunch of
notebooks

105
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,733
where I wrote
recipes down as a kid.

106
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,600

115
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,366
Huh?

<i>Ah! N‐no!</i>

117
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,333
<i>I wanted to ask what</i>
<i>Soma is like at school,</i>

<i>something that sounds like</i>

119

<i>it's from a letter from</i>

Um, you must be incredible

To think, you're in the

in all of Japan.

129
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,333
There's nothing
remotely special
about me at all...

It's not really
a big deal.

it makes my blood boil!

Still...

139
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,533
Soma's at least... a little
better than most of them.

140

Oh, sorry! Are you okay
under there, Meat‐Meat?

146
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,866
What the hell are you doing?!
You're such an idiot!
I said I was sorry, okay?

147
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,033
DAMMIT! AAHHHH!

148
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,700
<i>Or maybe I'm just</i>
<i>imagining things...</i>

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,500
This is by far the juiciest
of any of them yet!

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,666
That's right!

151
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,166
Mozuya uses all breast meat

152
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,800
which is low in calories
and has very little fat content.

153
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
True, that does make
it a bit more popular
with the diet crowd,

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,666
But if you want the
knockout punch of
fresh‐fried taste...

155
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,733
You've gotta use thigh meat
to get the juices!

156
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,200
[MAYU]
Yes! It's the perfect size
and it's so succulent!

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,133
Even at Western fried
chicken places...

158
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,366
drumsticks are by far the most
popular pick with the kids.

159
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,600
So using dark meat will get
the students drooling

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,833
and wanting more!

161

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
We're going to need
a really special marinade
for our chicken.

166
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Let's use a base
of soy sauce and
Ichimi‐pepper seasoning.

167
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,066
And, to get the right
batter, we should try
using some cornstarch.

168
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,100
Ah! Yeah I don't
have any of that.

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,700
I can go buy some for us.

What's going on, Mr. Tomita?

178
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,933
With this I needed to sneak
in through the back entrance.

179

Sneak in?

180

I've finally discovered it!

The perfect dish for the

186
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,000
They make them
in convenience stores.

<i>Such a waste of space.</i>

I thought it was
a hit for sure...

190
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:11,033
I mean, fried chicken
and rice is the ultimate
combination. Right?

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,100
<i>Something new with impact...</i>

457
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,556
I'm standing on a far
greater stage than you.

458
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:06,889
Soma Yukihira, I'm
letting you know.

459
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,289
You've been chosen to compete
at the Fall Selection.

460
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,989
However, I wouldn't get
too excited if I were you.

461
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,822
Being selected means these
antics of yours are over.

462
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,722
No one is going to
blemish my career.

463
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:24,256
In the culinary world,
I go by a nickname...

464
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,856
You've heard of me, I'm sure.

465
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,222
I am the Alchemist!

466
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,422
Tohtsuki Council of Ten...

467
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:35,856
Seat No. 9, Etsuya Eizan!

468
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:39,689
There is no greater
stage than this,

469
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,256
and I look forward
to crushing you.

470
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,256
[MAYU]
Next time, on Tomita‐style
Boxed Lunches...

471
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,822
I mean, on Food Wars,

472
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:55,989
it's the nineteenth course!

473
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:58,522
"The Chosen One"

474
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,189
It's delicious, Soma!

475
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,522
I'll do my best
at work today!

476
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,956
Ahheehehehe!
