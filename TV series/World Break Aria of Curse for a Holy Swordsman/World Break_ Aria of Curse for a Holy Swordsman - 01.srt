Plus! In this life
we're not brother and sister!

162
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,000
Our love will not be forbidden!

163
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,750
[laughs]

164
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,958
[SATSUKI]
Hey, hey! Wait up!

165
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,125
[giggling] Let's
go on a date after school!

166
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,000
Um, I wish I could, but actually

167
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to look
for a part-time job, so...

168
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,333
Sorry to tell you,

169
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,000
but the Academy
doesn't allow that.

170
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,458
Wait. Seriously?

171
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,250
Weird, what the heck was that?

172
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,500
It's another dimension
inside the martial arts stadium.

173
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,958
Even if you're seriously
injured in here,

174
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,750
just step through
the protective field,

175
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,458
go outside
and you'll be good as new.

176
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,000
[MOROHA]
Wow. You seem to know a lot

177
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,500
about this place.

178
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,208
So, there are
two different kinds

179
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,583
of Saviors.

180
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,541
Shirogane, who use Light Arts,

181
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,708
and Kuroma, who use Dark Arts.

182
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,291
Today, we'll begin
your education

183
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,375
with an introduction
to Light Arts.

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,458
--So cool!
--Whoa, what is that?

185
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,458
It's called "Prana,"
and it's the power source

186
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,000
for all Light Arts.

187
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,791
[GIRL A]
Can you teach me how to do that?

188
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,666
[GIRL B]
Yeah, I wanna learn, too!

189
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,375
Each of you has memories
from a former life.

190
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,916
Therefore, you must feel,
instinctively, the way

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,041
to draw out prana
from that past world

192
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,125
you lived in.
Trust your inner self

193
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,375
and you can't go wrong.

194
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,416
Sounds easy!

195
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,291
Cool, I'll give it a try!

196
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,000
[BOY] Something's coming out,
but it's not Prana!

197
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Stand back!

198
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,750
She's doing it!

199
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,583
How did she master it so fast?

200
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,291
No, please don't!

201
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,041
If you learn to
harness your Prana,

202
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,125
you'll be able to do things

203
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,833
you never thought
would be possible!

204
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,458
I don't weigh that much
to begin with,

205
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,750
so if you think
I'm impressed, you're wrong!

206
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,083
[laughs]

207
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,208
Oh, man, I feel like
I'm gonna puke!

208
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,041
[SATSUKI]
Oops, my bad!

209
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,458
Cool, huh? Hey.
You were watching me, right?

210
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,708
[GEN]
How lame.

211
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,208
This class is nothing
but a big waste of time.

212
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,208
Man... I wish a Metaphysical
would go on a rampage right now!

213
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,833
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

214
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,291
Because
if it was hardcore enough

215
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,666
to kill a bunch of people,

216
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,541
the higher-ups would have
to send us in to fight,

217
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,750
first-years or not.

218
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,541
You're sick, man.

219
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,083
[laughing]

220
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,666
What's funny, jerk?

221
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,791
Huh?

222
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,125
You three are garbage.
A disgrace to Saviors!

223
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,708
Oh? Is that a fact?
What makes you think

224
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,916
you can get away
with calling me names?

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,041
Assuming that brain of yours
still works,

226
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,000
think about what you just said,
and you'll have the answer

227
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,166
you're looking for.

228
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,875
You're not one of those losers,
are you?

229
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,083
"Duh, I just really
love justice, duh!"

230
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,833
Those skills are wasted
on you, girlie!

231
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,916
Yeah, well, garbage smells
disgusting, so if I were you,

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,041
I'd go stick my head
in an incinerator!

233
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,041
What the hell did you say to me?

234
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,125

All right, guys, break it up!
Nobody's fighting here today!

237
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,333
Come on, now.
You've got two people

238
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,166
who clearly have a handle
on using prana.

239
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,625
How about
a little practice match

240
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,000
--just for fun?
--Well, we don't normally allow

on the first day.

242

Please, sir,
just give me a chance!

243
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,750
Okay, you two, you ready?

00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,583
I can't wait to get a look
at how powerful

your brand of justice
really is, girlie!

And I can't wait to teach
this filthy piece of garbage

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,083
what it truly means
to be a Savior!

Arcule! Come forth!

Crazy!

250
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500
If you fill your tag with prana,
it will transform

251
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,916
into the weapon you used
in your former life.

Whoa.

Is that really all you've got?

Not at all, jerk!

Hhh. Weak.

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,333
The point of this match
is to show everyone

260
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,250
how it's done,
so why don't we reset

261
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,458
and give it another go,
unless you need a break.

262

You're gonna be sorry
you went head to head with me,

All right, Gen, that's enough.

If there's one thing
I will not tolerate,

274

it's the bullying of those
who can't defend themselves.

Yeah, you're right.

Listen. I may not know
what it means to be a Savior,

285
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,541
but I know this.

286
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,875
Having your heart
in the right place

287
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,125
and being a good person

288
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,416
matters more
than whether people think

289
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,583
you're weak or strong.

290
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
Yeah. Sure.

291
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,666
When I was growing up,
the town where I lived

292
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,416
was brutally attacked
over and over again

293
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,458
by Metaphysicals.

294
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,041
So I had to move around
quite a bit.

295
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,291
That must've been tough.

296
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,083
Truth is, that's why
I've never been very good

297
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,583
at making friends.

298
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,333
But you know what?
I wasn't ever lonely.

299
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:52,000
Because I had Sarasha's memories
to keep me company,

300
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,833
and I got to see Fraga
in my dreams every single night.

301
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,000
Then one day, the test revealed
I was a Savior,

302
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,041
and I discovered
that there were others out there

303
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,875
just like me.

304
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
And when I learned
there was a school

305
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,166
where Saviors come together,
I thought maybe, just maybe,

306
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,250
it was possible.

307
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,291
[MOROHA]
What's possible?

308
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,208
That if I was lucky,
I'd meet Fraga again.

309
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,708
Wait, me?

310
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,708
To be honest,
justice and saving the world

311
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,666
and all that is secondary.

312
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,041
What I really wanted
was to show off in front of you

313
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,041
and hear you
compliment me again.

314
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,208
And when I had my chance,
I failed.

315
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
[crying]
I wasn't thinking.

316
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,500
When I looked at Gen,
it was like seeing my own faults

317
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,125
reflected back.
I couldn't stand it!

318
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,708
So I picked a fight, and I lost.

00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,958
I'm sorry. It's stupid.

320
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,916
Oh, Fraga, I beg you.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,875
Tell me I'm the worst.
Lecture me like the old days.

322
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,500
I'll listen.
Please, I swear!

323
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,666
If a lecture's what you want,
I'll oblige.

324
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,500
Great, it's her!
Did you--?

325
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,250
Noooooo...

326
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,791
Getting a head start
on the dating game,

327
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,916
who's the home wrecker now?

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,291
What? I don't know
what you're talking about,

329
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,458
but you'd better stop
eating my fries or else!

330
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,208
After losing, I imagine
you're too depressed to eat.

331
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm just trying
to ease your burden

332
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,916
so you can relax.

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
Yoink!

334
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,875
Both of you cut it out
right now!

335
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,375
Look.
We had a special relationship

336
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,625
in a past life and have much
to discuss.

337
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,416
So, since
you're a complete stranger,

338
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,791
why don't you just butt out?

339
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,250
No, thanks.

340
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,041
I certainly hope
that I'm not being

341
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,500
too forward here.

342
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,541
[muffled speech]

343
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,458
This... is disgusting!

344
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:49,500
Oh! So it feels that good,
does it?

345
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,333
You jerk!

346
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,291
Perv! Leech! How dare you
behave this way in public,

347
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,500
it's repulsive!

348
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,500
Stop... right... now!

349
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,083
Do you love boobs so much
you're willing to throw away

350
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,583
your reputation?

351
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,541
And what about you, Jugs?!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself

352
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,625
for using your oversized tatas
to seduce an innocent boy?!

353
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,750
Just because you're president

354
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,208
of the Itty Bitty
Titty Committee,

355
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,958
doesn't mean you get
to speak to me that way!

356
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,000
They may be little,
but they're perky!

357
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,333
Lady "Sag A Lot!"

358
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,333
You know what?
We should stop this right now,

359
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,875
I apologize.

360
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,750
You can't apologize now,
I'm not done insulting you yet!

361
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,458
No, I feel awful.

362
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,541
When I invoked the
"Itty Bitty Titty Committee,"

363
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,750
I crossed a line.

364
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Will you please stop being
so nice to me?

365
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,583
Don't worry, we're both
very young,

366
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,208
and we both have plenty of room
to grow as individuals.

367
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,500
Wait, does that have some kind
of double meaning?

368
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,958
Forgive me. As a way
of saying "I'm sorry"

369
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,750
I will give him back to you.

370
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,708
Since you're crazy about boobs,
how do these stack up?

371
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,083
Come on, give me
your honest opinion.

372
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,250
Do you like them?

373
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,791
I know they aren't
as gigantic as hers,

374
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,000
but what I lack in size
I make up for in personality!

375
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,208
Oww, it's like
motorboating sandpaper!

376
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,333
Whatever! I'm done
trying to be nice to you!

377
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,708
You're nothing
but a big old stupid-head!

378
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,083
[crying]

379
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,833
I think that could've
ended much worse.

380
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,041
Sure she's mad, but at least
she's mad at somebody

381
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,750
besides herself.

382
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,958
You may not realize it,

383
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,416
but you just
did her a huge favor.

384
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Listen, I-- never mind.

385
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,375
It's still too early.

386
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,333
Oh, boy.

387
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,958
--It sounds fun, let's play!
--Cool. I'm in !

388
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,833
Look, kid. I appreciate
the balls this takes,

389
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,541
but it's not gonna happen.

390
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,708
Apologize now
or you'll be sorry.

391
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,666
Huh?

392
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,250
Ahh... I see what this is.

393
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,458
Pick your poison, chump.

394
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,166
Unless you're too afraid.

395
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,041
So you want me to apologize, eh?

396
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,958
Then beat me.
'Cause I'm not taking orders

397
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,916
from no weak-ass loser!

398
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,000
What is the deal
with that Shizuno girl,

399
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,541
she's totally all over him!

400
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,958
But still...

401
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,791
Moroha was really kind to me,
wasn't he?

402
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,250
Just like before.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,083
Satsuki, there's trouble!

404
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,958
It's Moroha!

405
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,750
[SHIZANO]
Oh!

406
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,666
Man, I just tossed you
across the arena

407
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,875
like a rag doll,
and I didn't even hit you

408
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,041
with everything I have!

409
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,750
I can't keep up
with his movements.

410
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,791
He's too fast!

411
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,583
My boy's quick as lightning!

412
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,833
Gen! Show him
your Celerity technique!

413
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,000
Ha!

414
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,083
-Oh, crap.
-Crap is right.

415
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,583

[GEN]
Huh. Awesome.

417
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,041
Your girlfriend
gets to watch the fun too.

418
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,625
After I finish destroying you,

419
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,958
I'll pick up
where I left off with her.

420
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,083
And this time
it won't just be her top!

421
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,833
I'll strip her completely naked!

422
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,916
Say... you're... sorry!

423
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,708
You shut your mouth, boy!

424
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,666
Oh, no.
He's gonna lose.

425
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,583
He has no chance.

426
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,083
This isn't over yet.
Keep watching.

427
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,916
This is for you.
Moroha's fighting for your sake.

428
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So no matter the outcome,
good or bad,

429
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,416
do him the favor
of watching until the very end.

430
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I won't allow you
to avert your eyes,

431
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,041
do you understand me?

432
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,041
[whimpers] I do.

433
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,666
Come on, kid!
Right! Now left!

You better keep it up
or you're gonna get knocked out!

say school is boring.

I'm having a freaking blast!

437
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,541
I know. No matter what happens,
you will not lose.

438
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,416
You're the guardian
of the holy sword.

439
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,458
You are the ultimate swordsman!

You can't lose,
'cause you're the guardian

of the holy sword!

You're the ultimate swordsman!

00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,958
You're greater than them all!

No matter what
difficult battlefield

447

I encounter and no matter what
vicious enemy I face,

448
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,083
in the end I will be victorious.

And when it's over,
I'll return to you.

450

Now it's time
to finish the fight!

451

If you beat him,
I'll do whatever you want,

I swear, I'll even kiss you!

Oh, wow. I remember.

to learn Celerity!
