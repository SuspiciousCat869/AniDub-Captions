1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,166
[SATSUKI]
I never doubted you

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,541
for a moment.

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,125
I had faith, no matter
how difficult things became.

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,708
I knew you'd keep your promise.
I knew you'd return victorious.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,416
And now,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,958
I have to keep
my promise as well.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,791
Satsuki.

8
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,958
[MOROHA]
Your lips are soft and gentle,

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,458
like an angel.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,375
Uh. Who're you?

11
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,458
Somebody who knows
you're not in pain anymore.

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,250
[MOROHA]
Ms. Principal?

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,333
Don't be afraid.
She just used her lips

14
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,791
to fill you with magical power
and restore your health.

15
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,791
And as a result, the prana
you lost will now repair itself.

16
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,791
Let me get this straight.

17
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,916
Are you saying she just
healed me with a kiss?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,416
[whimpers]

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,791
[muffled screaming]

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,083
[MARI]
Ah yes, we caught Ms. Ranjou

21
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,416
trying to sneak
into bed with you,

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,625
and since illicit
sexual relations are forbidden,

23
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,291
she's in time out.

24
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,625
[muffled whimpering]

25
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,791
I watched your fight
with Gen in the arena.

26
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,458
I knew it instantly.
You're the Ancient Dragon.

27
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,875
Uh--

28
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,125
There are other names.
The Order of the White Knights

29
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,083
calls you
the "Oldest Fallen Hero."

30
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,166
But what does that even mean?

31
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,500
Every Savior
who's ever walked this earth

32
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,541
is a reincarnation
from a former life.

33
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,041
However, it's extremely rare
for a Savior

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,750
to have been reborn
more than once

35
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,125
and to possess memories from
two former lives simultaneously.

36
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,750
We can't be certain, but that's
our working theory for now.

37
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,458
Hold on, I'm confused.

38
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,458
I only just now remembered my
former life as the warrior guy.

39
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,041
but I might have another one?

40
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,083
[MARI]
During the battle with Gen,

41
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,375
when you delivered
the final blow with your sword,

42
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,833
You were using
a level three Dark Art.

43
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,375
At any rate, you didn't suffer
any physical damage.

44
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,125
It's a good thing that fight
happened in the arena.

45
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,708
Guess so.

46
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,541
If I were you, I'd go back
to my room and get some rest.

47
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,458
I see trouble with women
in your future,

48
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,916
so you'd also be wise
to exercise caution

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,250
with the fairer sex!

50
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,750
Huh?

51
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,750
Oh, and if you would be so kind,

52
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,583
please take your
writhing classmate with you

53
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,875
when you leave.

54
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,250
Right.

55
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,333
[muffled scream]

56
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,541
[SATSUKI]
Fraga!

57
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,500
Oh! Thank goodness for you!

58
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,416
You remembered everything!
I knew you would!

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,958
"Everything's" a bit of
an exaggeration!

60
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,750
[SATSUKI] Here is your prize!
[MOROHA] My prize?

61
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,166
My, my, look at this
grotesque little fish

62
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,625
that washed ashore.

63
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,083
Ugh! You keep showing up at
the worst possible moment!

64
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,833
He and I were just about
to do the thing!

65
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,666
You know, uh, we were, um...

66
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,375
[sighs] Tell me,

67
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,166
is this the sort of thing
you had in mind?

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,458
Uh-- Mmm.

69
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,791
How dare you bust in
and steal my big moment!

70
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,875
Sounds like your fish
is done boiling.

71
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,208
[SATSUKI]
That's enough!

72
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,250
You take your hands off
my big brother right now!

73
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,750
You hear me?

74
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,250
Yeesh. "Trouble with women"
might be an understatement.

75
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,833
[SATSUKI]
Hey, Moroha!

76
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,458
Let's exchange phone numbers
and email addresses.

--[MOROHA] Yeah, sure, why not?
--[SATSUKI] Awesome!

I finally have a contact
in my cell phone

80
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,875
that isn't my mom or dad!

81
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,166
Happy to help.

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,250
Congrats on graduating
from total loser

to girl with one friend.

84
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,208
Why don't you go find
a steep cliff and jump?

85
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,166
It was just a joke.
Do you wanna trade info?

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,750
Mm. Not that I want yours,
but I guess.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,416
Oh, this is bad.

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,333
I slipped and
accidentally deleted it.

89
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,708
How about we just settle this
in the arena?

[SHIZUNO]
My favorite beauty salon,

91
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,291
not your number.

Oh.

Is there a Moroha in here?

00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,333
Yeah, that's me.

95

[GIRLS exclaim]

96
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,125
Come with me, please,
if you don't mind,

97
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,750
and Ms. Urushibara,
that goes for you as well.

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,166
Hmm?

99
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,208
Wait, what?

100
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,791
Rank C? How come?

101
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,333
[JIN]
You have the principal's

102
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,875
highest recommendation.

103
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,125
Also, I had a chance
to see you fight in the arena,

104
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,625
and I was very impressed.

105
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,833
That was my little brother
you were fighting.

106
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,708
Oh.

107
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,833
Rank C is an honor.

108
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,541
You'll be paid in
the form of a scholarship

109
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,083
that covers all your expenses.

110
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,125
After graduation,
you'll be guaranteed a position

111
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,791
with the Order of
the White Knights.

112
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,375
So what's the catch?

113
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,458
Aha. Not only are you strong,
but you're also sharp.

114
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,125
Well played, and you're
absolutely correct, Mr. Haimura.

115
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,166
once you reach Rank C,
you are also required

116
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,291
to join up with
my elite team of Strikers.

117
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,291
And that means what?

118
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,583
[JIN]
You'd be part of an

119
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,625
anti-Metaphysical combat unit,

120
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,375
the best of the best.

121
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,125
We deploy once or twice a month
on various assignments,

122
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,666
but these missions
are dangerous.

123
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166
Take some time and think about
what you wanna do.

124
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,583
[MOROHA]
Before I answer,

125
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,208
I do have one more question.

126
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,791
How much does this
scholarship pay?

127
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,041

00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,333
Yes! Auntie, I made it!

131
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,833
Are you sure you wanna do this?

132
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,583
Thank you for the opportunity!

133
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,041
Just don't screw it up.

134
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,416
Well, if he's in,

135
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,958
I guess I'll start
showing up from now on.

136
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,875
What?

137
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,833
[JIN]
Ms. Urushibara's had

138
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,916
a standing offer

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
to join the reserve unit
for some time,

140
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,291
but she hasn't ever
shown much interest.

141
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,333
Congrats. See you soon.

142
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,541
[SATSUKI]
Please, you have to

143
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,750
let me join, too!

144
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,541
Huh?

145
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,458
[JIN]
Uh. And you are?

146
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,750
If Moroha and weirdo
are joining your unit,

147
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,666
then I, Satsuki,
deserve to come!

148
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,583
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

149
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,000
but the truth is I don't know
what you're capable of.

150
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,791
She was capable of getting
her ass handed to her

151
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,958
by your little brother.

152
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,583
You shut your stupid mouth!

153
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,375
Gen's not ready for this.

154
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,583
If you lost to him,
then neither are you.

155
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,083
Maybe another time.

156
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,125
Aw man!

157
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,541
See ya!

Hey, cheer up.

159
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,625
Don't worry about me,

160
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,791
I'm totally fine.
I'm not depressed at all!

161
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,083
I'll just have to
train really hard

162
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,583
so I can get super strong

163
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,541
and then they'll have no choice
but to recognize my talent

164
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,791
and offer me a position
right next to you guys!

165
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,416
[crying]

166
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,916
Poor thing.

167
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,916
[JIN]
Welcome to the Strikers.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,666
Everyone,
meet our newest recruits,

169
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
Moroha Haimura
and Shizuno Urushibara.

170
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,583
With the old third years
officially out the door,

171
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,125
anyone who has the skills for
battle is more than welcome!

172
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,291
Hey, check out the new guy.
He's pretty cute.

173
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,541
We're gonna bust your butts,

174
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,750
so you'd better
make sure you come

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,083
ready to get to work!

176
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,666
Cool.

177
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,125
All right.
Strikers, let's get started!

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,666
We stand here as
the swords of salvation!

179
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,833
[ALL]
We stand here as

180
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,666
the saviors of everyone!

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,000
[JIN]
You're better than that.

182
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,125
Say the next part loud
so I can hear it!

183
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,500
[ALL]
We stand as

184
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
the Strikers for our people,
our beloved way of life,

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,791
our values, our peace,
and our justice!

186
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,708
Hmm.

187
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,416
Huh?
Should I shout that, too?

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,958
Sorry, I didn't know?

189
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,375
Yes, you should.

190
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,958
Mmm. All right, here goes.

191
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,833
[JIN]
One more go, people.

192
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,958
This time, try to say it
like you mean it!

193
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,791
[ALL]
We stand here as Saviors!

194
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,458
[SHIZUNO]
Jin Isurugi, our leader,

195
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,458
is part of what's commonly
called the Golden Generation.

196
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,708
They've exterminated
more Metaphysicals

197
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,208
than anyone at
the Japanese Branch

198
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,750
can even come close to touching.

199
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,125
In other words, these kids
are stronger than the adults

200
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,625
in the Order of
the White Knights?

201
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,041
[SHIZUNO]
Yes.

202
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
They're nearly all
Rank B or higher.

203
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,000
Man, I sure hope I can cut it
in a group this intense.

204
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,208
Trust me, you're gonna
do just fine.

205
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
[signs] I am worn out.

206
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,750
[BOTH grunting]

207
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,208
[MOROHA]
Geez. I don't think

208
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,166
I've ever been
this exhausted before.

209
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,791
I wouldn't
stress about it too much.

210
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
Eventually you'll learn
how to pace yourself.

211
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,833
[SATSUKI]
You're late!

212
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,083
If you weren't my big brother
in my former life,

213
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,250
I would tear you a new one

214
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,000
for making me
wait around like a loser!

215
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,500
I don't know how to argue
with that kind of logic.

216
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,041
[giggles]

217
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,666
So I don't know about you,
but I'm starving!

218
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,250
And there's a really delicious,
inexpensive okonomiyaki place

219
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,250
not far from here!

220
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
Wait, for real?

221
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,625
Yeah! Come on!
Let's go eat there right now!

222
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,416
I'm so sorry,
but if you're going,

223
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,625
you'll have to go alone.

224
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,000
Huh?

225
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,833
Moroha and I are tired after
a long day of training.

226
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,916
We would rather go home

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,791
and try to get as much
rest as we can.

228
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,833
But I'm hungry.

229
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,958
You and I will have practice

230
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,666
every single day
from here on out.

231
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,500
Sorry to break it to you,
but they're paying you

232
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,375
to be ready to fight, not to
spend your money at restaurants.

233
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,875
[SATSUKI]
It's no problem.

234
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,708
She's right.

235
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,083
I was being selfish
and not thinking.

236
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,291
No, it's not your fault, really.

237
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,208
It's just we're gonna be late
everyday because of practice.

238
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,708
I think you'll be
disappointed if you

239
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,541
spend all your time
waiting around for us.

240
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah, I guess,

241
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,791
but can we get together
and hang out

242
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,416
when you have a day off,
at least?

243
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
We'll try to work that into out
schedule if there's any time.

244
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,500
I think, maybe,
you're being a little bit--

245
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,708
Sounds great!

246
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,041
Hey, come back!

247
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,458
I don't get it,
why do you say things like that?

248
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,666
It's simple.

249
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,083
You shouldn't be wasting
all your money

250
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,833
on going out to eat.

251
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,541
Besides, it's clear
you're fond of Satsuki.

252
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
I did her a favor
by telling her the truth

253
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,958
about what to expect
from here on out

254
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,375
so she doesn't
get her feelings hurt

255
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,625
when things don't go her way.

256
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,708
[MOROHA]
That's not what I mean!

257
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,958
Look, Shizuno.

258
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,666
I don't like when
other people speak for me,

259
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,000
and I don't need you
to play the bad guy.

260
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
I appreciate you trying to help,

261
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,125
but I want you to remember,

262
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,708
it doesn't make me happy
when you act that way.

263
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,458
In fact, it makes me
really unhappy.

264
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,708
Hey, I'm easy. If you want
to do something for me,

265
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,458
all you have to do is smile.

266
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,125
Satsuki, wait up!

267
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,708
I suppose some things
never change, do they?

268
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,125
[crying]

269
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,041
Shizuno gets to hang out
with him every day,

270
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,541
and I don't.

271
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,125
[phone rings]

272
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,125
Yes? Satsuki here.

273
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,250
[MOROHA]
Are you okay?

274
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,500
It sounds like you're crying.

275
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,708
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
I'm perfectly fine!

276
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,875
What in the world would
I be crying about anyway?

277
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,958
Gah, it's like your
silly imagination takes over,

278
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,125
and all of a sudden,
you get these

279
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,916
super strange ideas
in your head!

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,083
[MOROHA]
Liar.

281
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,958
I know you're
balling your eyes out.

282
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
Hey! Will you please stop
acting like you can see me?

283
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,583
--It's weird!
--[MOROHA] But I can see you.

284
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,333
Sneaking up on someone like that
could give them a heart attack!

285
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,000
[MOROHA]
When I have a proper day off,

286
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,500
You and I should eat together.

287
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,208
Maybe we can cook
and save some money?

288
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,375
Oh! I'll make a homemade meal

289
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,625
that's so delicious you'll be
begging me for more!

290
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,750
My food will knock
your socks right off!

291
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,708
Mm. I know I'm busy,
but I'm wondering.

292
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,500
Could I call you
on your cell sometime?

293
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,375
It would be awesome
to have someone to talk to.

294
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,291
[gasps] Of course. If you ever
need to talk about stuff,

295
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,833
you can call me
anytime you want!

296
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,125
But don't call too late,

297
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,625
because you're not
the only one who's busy,

298
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,833
and if I don't get
my beauty sleep,

299
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,208
you won't want to
talk to me anyway!

300
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,000
[MOROHA chuckles]
I'll make sure

301
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,291
not to call too late.

302
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,625
I don't wanna see you grumpy.

303
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,541
[SATSUKI] Oh, you!
[MOROHA chuckles]

304
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,291
[phone rings]

305
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,791
It's so early.

306
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,291
[SATSUKI]
Good morning!

307
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
What are you up to?
How about you and I

308
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,041
go out and spend
the day together?

309
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,375
[SHIZUNO]
Sorry, but I don't wanna

310
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,500
be your girlfriend.

311
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,875
I'm already interested
in someone else.

312
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,875
[SATSUKI]
I meant as friends,

313
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,125
you big weirdo!

314
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,166
The sky looks strange.

315
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,375
So, why'd you ask me to come
to a dumb place like this?

316
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,916
If I remember right,
you did say

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,583
you wanted to hang
on your days off.

318
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,041
I was just trying to be nice.

319
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,875
But I specifically asked you
to meet me at the mall,

320
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,125
because I really wanna buy
Moroha an awesome present

321
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,041
to celebrate his promotion
to Rank C!

322
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,208
Why does that
involve me, exactly?

323
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,250
Right.
That's a very good question.

324
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,625
The thing is,
I don't have a clue

325
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,875
about what to give him.

326
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,833
Plus, I'm a little short
on cash, to be honest.

327
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,500
So I thought we could
go in on a present together

328
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,958
and split the cost.

329
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,875
--[SHIZUNO] See ya later.
--[SATSUKI] No, don't go!

330
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,791

331
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,375
Well, if I must.

332

--[whines] Still no luck.
--[CHILDREN giggling]

333
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,125
I think I'm just about done.

334
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,958
I'm really sorry I made you
go through this.

335
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,083
You know, when I'm exhausted,

336
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,916
a little sugar
always does the trick.

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
Huh?

338
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,708
Strawberry banana
will suit me just fine.

00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,583
I'll get you a crepe!

00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,750
Thank you for waiting.

[SATSUKI]
I'm scared,

360
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,291
but if I run away now,

361
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,958
then I don't deserve
to be with Fraga.

Arculth, come forth!

363

If you're planning on
hurting these people,

364

you'll have to
come through me first!

365

Shizuno! Look after the kid
while I handle the monster!

366
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,875
Satsuki, wait!
You can't do this on your own!

367
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,375
It's fine, I just gotta
keep that thing occupied!

[MAN] Quick, let's get him
out of here!

That's right, I'm the one
you want to fight, not them,

370
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,791
so don't go trying
to cheat on me

371
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,916

00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,416
lend me your breath,
let your freezing be

375
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,750
more silent than death.

376
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,000
You're doing it!

377
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,750
I contacted Moroha
and the officials at the school.

378
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,125
The shopping center is
being evacuated as we speak.

379
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,375
Then you've done your part.

380
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,208
Just make sure you
get yourself out of here!

381
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,125
I'm not going anywhere
if you aren't.

382
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,000
In my former life, I was revered
as the Netherworld Sorceress,

383
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
and since you definitely
need a helping hand,

384
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,500
I'm happy to watch your back!

385

Not that I actually
need your help, Shizuno,

all the same!

There's no way.
This cannot be happening!

392
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,375
It's a multi-headed type?

393

We don't stand a chance

You need to boost your prana

You might kill me,

You remember the
Dreadnought Class Metaphysical

if not more so.

Then what are we all
just standing around for?

416
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,041
Satsuki and Shizuno
need reinforcements!

00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,000
Ha!

481
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,166
Yin Yang Kurikara!

482
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,166
[MARI]
I was right about him.

483
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,083
Wait, huh?

484
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,875
Me? In the reserve unit?

485
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,166
When lives were on the line,

486
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
you faced danger
without flinching.

487
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,458
That's way more than
I can say about myself.

488
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,416
You have a strong
sense of justice,

489
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,666
and the Strikers
would be honored

490
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,916
to have someone like you.

491
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,833
The opportunity's yours
if you want it.

492
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,833
Wow! This is so incredible!
Me a Striker!

493
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,875
Mr. Haimura.

494
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,083
I don't think my decision
to exercise caution

495
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,708
was a mistake in any way.

496
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,666
[JIN]
But...

497
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,583
I also think your brave
decision to fight was amazing.

498
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,958
You're a Striker.
Will you stay with us?

499
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,541
Yes, sir.

500
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,125
Glad to hear it. Then I will see
all three of you at practice!

501
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,791
[laughs] I'm really in!

502
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,625
Now that I won't be
left out anymore,

503
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,166
we can all hang!
Guys, I am so happy.

504
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,625
--Yay, me!
--[SHIZUNO] Hey, just make sure

505
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,666
you don't start to get on
my last nerve, okay?

506
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,000
You know what? I've decided to
make it my personal mission

507
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,166
to improve your personality

508
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
and make you less
of a stupid jerk face.

509
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,375
It's gonna be tough,
but that won't stop me!

510
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,750
[laughing]

511
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,083
Shoot me now.

512
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,875
Hey, so, in a former life,
were you and I together?

513
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,791
I've gotta go.
Another time, perhaps.

514
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,666
[MAYA]
In what kind of places

515
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,083
do you find miracles?

516
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,083
Lost deep within a forest?

517
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,041
At the top of
a tall, tall tower?

518
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,208
Miracles happen everywhere.

519
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,500
Two former lives.
Two sets of memories.

520
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,708
The more you remember,
the stronger you'll become,

521
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,291
inside and out.

522
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,375
This is your fate, Moroha.

523
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,791
You're the Oldest Fallen Hero.

524
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,333
[SHIZUNO]
Moroha, I'm dying to know

525
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,041
which kiss was better,
mine or Maya's?

526
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,541
Please tell me the truth.

527
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,916
[MOROHA]
Uh, not touching that one.

528
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,916
[SHIZUNO]
Next time,

529
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,083
"The Netherworld Sorceress!"

530
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,125
[MOROHA]
Spelling!
