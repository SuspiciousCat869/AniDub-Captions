00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,583
[shouts]

166
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,666
What the hell?

167
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,625
It's almost like
he's turning into a monster.

168
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,875
Haimura's no
Jack-in-the-box today.

169
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,416
[MAYA gasps]

170
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,416
He's a Pandora's box this time,
one of rage and despair.

171
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,708
[angrily]
You die today!

172
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,041
[grunts]
Come! Fight me!

173
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:58,833
[shouts]

174
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,000
[grunts]
Die! Die! Die!

175
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,166
Look at the wounds!

176
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,875
Those are magic letters!

177
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,541
What is he casting?

178
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
The level 13 that beat
the Russian Terror?

179
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,750
[groans] Since letters
are carved into its body,

180
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,916
the beast will not be
able to dispel them.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,708
This is brutal thing to do,
and he has lost all control.

182
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,208
Die, you bastard!

183
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,083
Stop it, Haimura!
If you don't slow down,

184
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,083
you'll wipe the entire city
off the map!

185
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,666
He's not normal Moroha at all.

186
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,958
He is now murderous beast.

187
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,458
Exactly liking I used to be.

188
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,291
[WAITRESS]
What's happening over there?

189
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,833
I have no idea,
but it isn't good.

190
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,583
I will destroy everything
if that's what it takes!

191
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,625
But you're gonna die!

192
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,666
I'm sending you back
to the fire where you belong!

193
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,041
[SARASHA]
What do you think you are doing?

194
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,208
[SATSUKI]
Who's there?

195
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,166
[SARASHA] Why are you
lying there doing nothing,

196
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,750
when something terrible
is happening

197
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,291
to big brother
at this very moment?

198
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,250
[SATSUKI]
Because he doesn't want my help.

199
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,916
[SARASHA]
Remember.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
[SATSUKI]
Remember what?

201
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,416
[SORCERESS] If this is
all it takes to finish off

202
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,125
the Netherworld Sorceress,

203
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,291
then I would say
you are insignificant.

204
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,000
[SHIZUNO] You can think
whatever you like.

205
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,083
But I tried to help Moroha

206
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,583
and there was nothing
I could do.

207
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,250
[SORCERESS]
Remember.

208
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,833
[SHIZUNO] Remember?

209
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,208
[SARASHA] While Fraga was
off taking on countless enemies,

210
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,083
you were always at home,
safe and sound.

211
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,625
[SATSUKI] Yeah, but that's
because he was worried about me!

212
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,250
He was protecting me!

213
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,916
[SARASHA] That's right,
and you are a cowardly girl

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,958
who relied on his worries
to keep you from harm.

215
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,708
[SATSUKI] You're wrong.
That's not true at all.

216
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,250
The truth is--
the truth is

217
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,333
I always wanted to go with him!

218
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,583
[SARASHA]
Then maybe it is time

219
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,625
to finally
do something about it.

220
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,958
[SATSUKI] Huh?

221
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,250
[SARASHA] How many times
must you watch him go away

222
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,125
and leave you behind
in the dust?

223
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,958
[SATSUKI] I don't know.
I don't know!

224
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,458
Well, then maybe
it is time to rise.

225
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,333
Walk the same path
as big brother

226
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,708
and fight by his side
till the bitter end.

227
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,083
[SORCERESS]
Have you forgotten already?

228
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,791
You were once a nameless slave

229
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,000
without a single thing
to call your own.

230
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,833
[SHIZUNO]
I could never forget that.

231
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,625
I had no hope
for the future back then.

232
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,166
I lived only
for the sake of living,

233
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,875
because what else could I do?

234
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,166
[SORCERESS]
So, who was it that freed you

235
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,125
from your chains
and gave you life?

236
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,250
Who was it that instilled
in you a new sense of hope?

237
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,833
[SHIZUNO]
Who else? Shu Saura.

238
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,916
[SORCERESS]
It is your turn to pay him back

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,291
for what he gave to you.
It is time for you

240
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,291
to free him from the shackles
that bind him.

241
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,833
[SORCERESS] Do not forget.

242
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,583
A good wife always stands beside
her husband, no matter what.

243
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,833
[BOTH]
I remember. Everything!

244
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,125
[MOROHA]
But you're gonna die!

245
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,500
I'm sending you back
to the fire where you belong!

246
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,708
[shouts]

247
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,125
[gasps]

248
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
[cracking]

249
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,791
[gasps]

250
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,375
[MOROHA]
Satsuki? Shizuno?

251
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
Or is it?

252
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,041
[SHIZUNO] You are
half correct, half incorrect.

253
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,291
It is me and yet it is not me.

254
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,333
[SATSUKI]
Remember, big brother.

255
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,083
We will always be together,
no matter what.

256
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,583
In our past lives, or this one,
we stand by you.

257
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,833
And in our next life,
we will be there.

258
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,833
--For all time.
--For eternity.

259
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,708
I remember now. Everything!

260
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,875
I'm Fraga,
the Master Swordsman!

261
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,583
I'm Shu Saura,
the Dark Lord!

262
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,125
And now...

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Moroha Haimura!

264
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,583
Did Haimura just transform?

265
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,666
He's embodying two former lives

266
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,625
within one flesh
at exacting same time?

267
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,875
In the end,
good ol' Jack was able

268
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,416
to pull something wonderful
out of Pandora's Box.

269
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,833
Yay! He's okay!

270
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,041
--Unbelievable!
--He's so cool!

271
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,833
Amazing.
He's a Savior all right.

272
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,666
[STRIKERS]
We are the Saviors!

273
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Kamee ran around
using healing magic

274
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,916
on everyone
and really saved our skin.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,125
--[humphs]
--It's true.

276
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,875
Every once in a while,
he's useful.

277
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,916
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
When things get dangerous,
a real hero always runs!

279
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,541
Listen up, Strikers,
we have a job to do.

280
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,875
We're going to create
an opening for Haimura!

281
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,541
[STRIKERS] Yes, sir!

282
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,625
[shouting]

283
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,833
[shouting]

284
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,083
[emphatically]
Suck on this!

285
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,583
[grunting]

286
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,833
All right,
give 'em hell, Moroha!

287
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,458
Thanks a lot, guys.

288
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,875
You're not alone this time,
big brother.

289
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,541
Now. We have work to do.
Come, my love.

290
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,875
Let's finish this!
Spelling!

291
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,541
Purgatory in the netherworld.
Wildfires on the ground.

292
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,708
The flames are impartial,

293
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,333
and consume good,
evil, and chaos alike.

294
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,083
They purify all
with fierce charity.

295
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,583
All must die,
and return to dust.

296
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,291
Is this really the world,
or nirvana?

297
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,833
This still desolate irony of my
home, burned to the ground.

298
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,833
Endless despair, as far
as the eye can see.

299
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,958
[TOKIKO laughs]

300
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,166
Here's a level 3
that's topped off

301
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,625
with some naughtiness.
You freak!

302
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,958
Watch out,
cause here comes the pain!

303
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,458
Hah!

304
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,625
[growls]

305
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,791
Don't worry, Moroha,
we're here, too!

306
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,875
From Russia with Love,
Ancient Dragon! Ha!

307
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,125
Go! Take him out now!

308
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,500
All right.

309
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,166
Thank you, guys,
for everything.

310
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,333
--Haimura!
--You've got this!

311
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,958
Yeah! We're all rooting for you!

312
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,166
Beat that damn dragon down,
Moroha, just like you did to me!

313
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,333
Moroha's come back to us, Mari.
He's home for good now.

314
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,916
For the first time in a long
while, I feel like there's hope!

315
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,166
[grunts]
It's the sonic attack again!

316
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,000
[EDWARD]
Silvery Peak Argasten!

317
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,041
I see the young girl I met long
ago has grown up quite a bit.

318
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,916
--Sir Edward!
--[EDWARD] Oh dear me!

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,708
All right then, lad!
It's your turn now!

320
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,583
