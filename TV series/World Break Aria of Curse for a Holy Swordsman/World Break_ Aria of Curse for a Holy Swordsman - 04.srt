[EDWARD] As far as
the Ancient Dragon is concerned,

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,333
I went and tested
his true strength.

00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,333
[TADANORI]
Sir Edward,

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,833
are you saying
you fought Moroha?

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,666
No need to worry.
It was only a small test.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,541
No one was hurt,
I can assure you that.

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,458
So, what was your opinion
of him?

8
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,750
Utter disappointment,
I'm afraid.

9
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,333
Sadly, I simply cannot
endorse him for Rank S.

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,625
Damn it!
I was testing him.

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,875
And the bastard
took it easy on me.

12
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,750
[EDWARD] Sad but true.
I wish I could say otherwise.

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,458
Sorry, chap,
but my honest opinion

14
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,166
is that he just isn't ready.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe he did
have some assistance,

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,208
but he still defeated
a Dreadnought Class!

17
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,416
Put three Rank A's
in the same place

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,166
at the same time,
and they might just

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,666
create a miracle.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,708
Besides, the other two,
aren't they skilled

21
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,750
in their own right?

Ahh!

Maya, why are you--
how did you--

27

Guess you didn't hear the news,
as of this very moment,

I'm your new roomie!

This is gonna be amazing!

31
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,500

Listen to me.
I think you'd better hurry up

35
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,250
and get back to your sister.

36
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,750
She's okay with it.
Actually, it was her idea.

--For real. This'll be fun!

Oh, boy.

I really hope this isn't
against the law.

Considering you helped defeat

You're not gonna believe

The principal has decided
that this Maya psycho

had rice balls before?

They're not fancy,
but they're really good.

Of course I've had rice balls,

It's not really, but I heard
it was pretty good here,

so I thought I'd give it a try.

I heard the cook here
perfected his curry bread recipe

Wow, that's crazy.

--Yes, I do.
--Why?

[MOROHA grunts]

Listen, Shizuno...
in this world,

167
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,708
no chains can bind you.

Even without your memory,

you still say the same things.
You haven't changed a bit,

My intention is for Shizuno
to become an executive

as soon as she graduates.

178

It certainly sounds like
we're on the same page.

179
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,833
You will miss her, Tadanori.
Very much.

Oh, don't worry about that.

As far as

I told you I'd crash your place
if you lied.

What the hell are you thinking?
This is private property!

I could have you
thrown in jail for trespassing!

I'm gonna apologize,

you know everything about me,

No, wait! Don't say it!

200

I killed the Metaphysical.
And I did it on my own.

Liar! You already
had your chance

to climb the ladder
to Rank S, and you blew it!

Do you understand
what you're doing here?

What this means?

205
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,666
If you become Rank S,
your life belongs to them.

You won't have
any freedom anymore.

Yeah. Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.

Moroha... I don't get it,

209
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,708
why would you do something
like this for me?

210

You're really asking that?

211

If it makes you happy,
there's nothing I wouldn't do,

I don't deserve happiness.
I deserve to be damned.

214

You've always been a fool.
Death ripped us apart already,

and here we are,
standing together once again.

compared to what
we've been through.

I'm not doing this because
of what happened

in our former life, Shizuno.

220

Not at all. I'm doing this
because of the person you are

invincible for just an instant.

are applications of Adamant.

I can finally fight
at full power.

320
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,750
Oh, yeah?

321
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,375
Purgatory in the netherworld.
Wildfires on the ground.

322
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,250
The flames are impartial,
and consume good, evil,

323
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,125
and chaos alike.

324
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,708
You never learn, do you, lad?

325
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
[MOROHA]
All must die and return to dust.

326
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,875
What?
His dark art was a feint?

327
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,750
The age of decadence
shall not end.

328
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,250
Let the trumpets sound.
The time of judgment has come!

329
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,625
Yin Yang. Kurikara!

330
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,333
Huh? Playing the trump card,
are we?

331
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,333
Oh, my. Well, bollocks.

332
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,333
[yells]

333
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
He has two ID tags?

334
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,875
[EDWARD]
Well done, Mr. Haimura.

335
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,958
You've actually forced me
to manifest

336
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,708
Silvery Peak Argasten.

337
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,291
Sir Edward...
I hope you're okay.

338
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,916
[EDWARD]
Ha! Don't you see?

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,041
It's useless.
I'm indestructible!

340
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,708
You're wrong!
Nothing is indestructible!

341
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,708
[laughing]

342
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,125
Well, you're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

343
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,000
He's strong. But there's
gotta be a way to beat him.

344
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
I have to do this for Shizuno!

345
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,125
Shizuno.

346
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,916
You will bring many lands
to ruin, and on your quest

347
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,291
you will take many thousands
of lives.

348
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:03,125
But, a greater number of lives
will also be saved.

349
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,125
You'll save them.
Just as you saved me.

350
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,125
Even if the whole world
turns its back on you,

351
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,250
I will always be by your side.

352
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,000
Because after all, I am yours.
I am your wife.

353
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,000
Now and till the end of time.

354
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,500
I remember now. Everything!

355
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,708
Defy gravity!

356
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,833
Spelling. Enders, ice wolves,
lend me your breath.

357
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,750
Let your freezing
be more silent than death.

358
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,708
In this world,

359
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,791
even the prosperous

360
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,041
inevitably decay.

361
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,166
It is inescapable,
divinely ordained karma.

362
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,000
Just as water flows downward...

363
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,958
That's grand. Quite grand!

364
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,125
He's using a Level Eight
Dark Art.

365
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,333
I thought the Russian Terror
was the only one

366
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,666
who could do that.

367
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,833
[SHIZANO]
Then I would say

368
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,125
you thought wrong.

369
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,083
He's singing the curse
of a Holy Swordsman

370
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,000
like it's an aria.

371
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,083
You've done more than prove
your worthiness,

372
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,125
you've completely
blown me away!

373
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
I desire a beautiful
world of death.

374
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,666
Join us! Come,
abandon your humanity!

375
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
I desire for all to stop!

376
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,416
I desire for everything
to stop! Now!

377
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,791
Cocytus!

378
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,041
You'll become a caged monster
just like the rest of us!

379
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,458
You'll be
our lucky number seven!

380
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,958
[laughing]

381
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,916
Sir Edward, no!

382
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,375
[SATSUKI]
What do you mean

383
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,333
you didn't technically
beat him?

384
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,333
I just froze him so he'd stop
coming after me like that.

385
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,708
I wanted you to get revenge
for me almost throwing up

386
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,666
in the car.

387
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,041
[MARI]
Throwing up?

388
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Sorry, guys, but I tried
everything I could think of,

389
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,208
and all I managed to do
was crack his helmet a little,

390
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,125
so if there was a way
to beat him once and for all,

391
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,083
then I'd love to hear it.

392
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,208
How's your knee, Satsuki?

393
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,375
It'll be fine in a few days.

394
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,083
And are you holding up okay
after all that?

395
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,958
I'm great.
Mainly because Satsuki

396
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,916
was there to watch my back.

397
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,291
[SATSUKI giggles]

398
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,500
[MARI]
I'm really happy

399
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,083
you're all okay.
Sorry it's not very roomy

400
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,375
here, but it'll have to do.

401
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,333
Please make yourselves
at home, everyone.

402
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,791
[MOROHA, SATSUKI, SHIZUNO]
Thank you so much.

403
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,750
(doorbell rings)

404
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,291
Hello, loves!

405
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,375
Worry not,
I won't try anything.

406
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,083
As a knight, I admit it freely.

407
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,833
You won that duel,
fair and square.

408
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,500
And as previously discussed,

409
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,750
Shizuno will not have
to study abroad.

410
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,791
Great.
So what are you doing here?

411
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,333
There's something
I've been dying to ask you,

412
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,541
my friend.

413
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,833
That day at the cafe,
when I attacked you.

414
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,666
Why didn't you dodge my punch?

415
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,458
[MOROHA]
Well, because I knew

416
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,000
you weren't really
gonna hurt me.

417
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,625
[EDWARD] And how did
you know that exactly?

418
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,166
It was obvious.

419
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
I could tell by looking
at your prana.

420
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,375
Come now, you silly fellow,

421
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,333
there's no way you could see
something like that.

422
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,458
Mr. Haimura, I can say
without a doubt

423
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,916
you have absolutely
not disappointed me.

424
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,500
As one of the Head Six,

425
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,166
and as commander of British HQ,

426
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,041
I officially endorse
your promotion to Rank S.

427
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,166
What did he say?

428
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,166
That someday it's very likely

429
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,250
that you'll become the core

430
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,750
of the Order
of the White Knights.

431
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,166
And that I should do everything
in my power to seduce you.

432
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,041
Now.

433
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,666
Your brother's a big jerk.

434
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,541
But, I'm just glad
that you and I

435
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,416
aren't gonna end up
being separated after all.

436
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
So you're cool with this whole
Netherworld Sorceress thing,

437
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,500
right?

438
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,958
Well, I'm not quite sure.

439
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,958
It's a little late
to play innocent.

440
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,291
I'm not trying to play games
at all.

441
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,791
But the thing is,

442
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,875
I don't want to force anything
on you like Satsuki does.

443
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,000
Take it slow.

444
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,458
You're just going
to have to remember

445
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,208
our former life
on your own, okay?

446
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,166
You're free.

447
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,625
In this world,

448
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,125
no chains can bind you.

449
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,583
Not unless you let them.

450
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:47,041
I was nothing but a slave
till you granted me freedom.

451
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,125
And now
you have a responsibility

452
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,333
to hold onto me.

453
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,458
Don't you see?
Now and till the end of time.

454
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,083
No matter what happens,
I'll be here.

455
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,333
Even after we die
and we're born anew.

456
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,416
My love is yours.

457
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,208
For this moment and forever.

458
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,708
You saved me.
You set me free,

459
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,625
but you chained
our hearts together.

460
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,333
Come what may,
I will always be by your side.

461
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,791
I promise.

462
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,166
[MARI]
Hey Maya. How is Moroha?

463
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,916
[MAYA]
Surprisingly barrel-chested.

464
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,041
[MARI]
Why do you know that?

465
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,083
[MAYA] Next time,
"We Are the Summer!"

466
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,666
[BOTH]
I remember! Everything!
