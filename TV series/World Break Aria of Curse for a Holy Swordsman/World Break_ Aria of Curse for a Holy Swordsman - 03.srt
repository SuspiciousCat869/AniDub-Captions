1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,833
You're close
with the Ancient Dragon.

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,375
Well, I must admit
I'm more than impressed.

3
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,041
Plus, you two lovebirds

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,083
defeated a Dreadnought
Class Metaphysical,

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,791
a mighty feat even
for the most powerful Savior.

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,250
Well done, Shizuno.

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,625
You do our family name proud.

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,750
I appreciate
your kind words, brother,

9
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,416
but he's just my friend.

10
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,291
Huh.

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,625
[SATSUKI] Yo! Are you
falling asleep or something?

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,125
Hey. Welcome back
to real life.

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,666
Oh. Sorry,
what were we talking about?

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,166
Uh, doy! That Metaphysical
we took down.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,375
The Principal is trying
to give all three of us credit

16
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,750
when clearly Moroha was the one
who saved the day in the end!

17
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,041

19
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:00,916
Huh?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,666
[MAN grunts] Ah.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,041
[SATSUKI] The fact is,
you were the one who destroyed

22
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,458
the Metaphysical.
We didn't really do anything.

23
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,500
That's not true,
you held it off long enough

24
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,583
for them to clear the area
and evacuate the mall.

25
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,750
You two deserve
as much credit as anybody.

26
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,458
I guess. But that beast
was a Dreadnought class.

27
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,250
It's amazing
that you even touched it!

28
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,291
You really think so?

29
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,083
Of course. Not many Saviors are
capable of doing what you did,

30
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,833
outside of the Head Six,
I mean.

31
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,750
-[MAN humming]
-[MOROHA] "The Head Six"?

32
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,375
[SHIZUNO] That's what
they call the top Saviors

33
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,666
in the Order
of the White Knights.

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,041
[SATSUKI]
They're super powerful.

35
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,250
The only Saviors
in the world at Rank "S."

36
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,333
[MOROHA] Wow.

37
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,666
-[MAN humming]
-Sit anywhere you like.

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,208
We'll be with you
in just a minute.

39
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,458
Ah, yes.

40
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,208
-[GROUP] Huh?
-[humming continues]

41
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,166
[WAITRESS] Do you have
any questions about the menu?

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,916
Tally ho!
What a lovely day it is!

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,416
I'd fancy a tea. Is it organic?

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,375
Um, I'll have to look.
Just a sec.

45
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,333
Hey, Boss?
I could use a little help here!

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,125
[SATSUKI]
Can I help you, sir?

47
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,208
[MAN] Hmm?

48
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,500
[giggles]

49
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,125
My tea. I insist
it be made properly.

50
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,583
Oh. Well, in that case--
hold on, you're not

51
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,708
one of those bourgeoisie
tea drinkers, are you?

52
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,500
Yes. Actually, I know all
there is to know about tea.

53
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,666
The tea leaves
must be "Mackwoods" brand,

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,625
pasteurized milk is critical,

55
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,875
and if you want sugar,
it must be Japanese!

56
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,458
Please, that's not tea!

57
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,333
It's the kinda overpriced crap
you'd order at Starmucks!

58
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,458
Uh. This is just a simple café.

59
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,958
Fancy orders like that are
kinda hard for them to fill.

60
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,666
Oh. That's such a pity.

61
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,791
Let me guess,
you're from the UK, right?

62
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,541
Yes. You're quite perceptive.

63
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,708
So, he's a Brit,
guess that explains

64
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,666
why he's such a snob
about his tea.

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,625
Well. I don't know about that.

66
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,250
Café's in England
are so primitive,

67
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,750
-they still use bags!
-[growls]

68
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,541

Make him a frou-frou drink!

69
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,875
-Ohh.
-[SATSUKI] This is the Manager's

70
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,750
pride and joy, tea made
with a hint of tapioca milk!

71
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,833
It looks marvelous!

72
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,833
Oh, I forgot to mention
that it's a spicy tea!

73
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,583
[grunts]

74
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,500
-[coughing]
-Ugh! A waste.

75
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,041
Bollocks! How dare you call
that perverse concoction tea?

76
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,708
This is a declaration of war
against my country!

77
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,875
Right. I'll go get a towel.

78
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,291
I'm truly in shock.

79
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,000
Honestly, I don't even know
what to say.

80
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,541
[BOTH chuckle]

81
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,958
[MAN] You haven't tried this
abomination, have you, Moroha?

82
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,541
No. I haven't.

83
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,208
[thinks]
He's not there.

84
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,208
[breathes heavily]

85
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,333
[thinks] What is this?
Has time stopped?

86
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:48,416
No, it hasn't. It's just
this guy. He's that fast.

87
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,041
[chuckles]

88

[GROUP grunting]

89
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,166
Huh?

90
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,125
Tell me, could you really
not move just now?

91
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,375
Or perhaps...
you simply froze up.

92
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,875
If you were planning to kill me,
I'm sure I'd be dead.

93
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,708
So, stop playing games
and tell me who you are.

94
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,291
Chap, I must say
I'm disappointed. Huh!

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,916
-[laughs, humming]
-[MANAGER] Bye. Thanks.

96
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,166
So, does someone wanna tell me
what just happened?

97
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
That was "Decimation,"

98
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,416
the most secret
of all Celerity Light Arts.

99
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,208
Wait, do you know that guy?

100
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,083
He's one of the Head Six

101
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,041
The top man of British HQ,
Sir Edward Lamperd.

102
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,958
[SATSUKI] I heard the powers
that be sent that fancy guy,

103
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,666
Edward, here to do a full
inspection of Akane Academy.

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,333
[SHIZUNO] But I bet he's
really here to check out Moroha.

105
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:29,000
And it's not just the UK--
America, China, France, Russia.

106
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,666
[SHIZUNO]
Every country in the world

107
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,000
wants to get a look
at "The Oldest Fallen Hero."

108
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,083
[SATSUKI]
I already knew he was awesome!

109
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,416
He's so important,
the Head Six make special trips

110
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,625
just to see him!
[laughing]

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,208
-It's true.
-But it's incredibly rude

112
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,250
to roll in and pick a fight

113
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,416
straight out
of the gate like that!

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,750
Why didn't Moroha show

115
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,416
that British wanker
what he's capable of?

116
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,916
-Don't know.
-Yeah. Well. We'll see

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,458
who's disappointed when
Moroha becomes an "S" Class!

118
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,208
Then Edward and the rest
of those Head Six creeps

119
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,708
will be bowing down before him!

120
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,166
Are you sure you want him
to become an "S" Class?

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
-Huh?
-A Rank "S" serves his country

122
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,875
as the ultimate
defensive weapon.

123
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,041
They fight, but they have
no freedom at all.

124
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,000
They need permission
to go for a walk,

125
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,916
much less spend time
with friends or take a trip.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,666
On top of that,
they see the most horrific,

127
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,625
grueling types
of combat imaginable,

128
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,916
often against enemies they have
no chance of defeating.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,875
Oh! Wait. What?

130
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,250
So you're saying
we couldn't take trips together?

131
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,041
How would I deal
with that kind of heartache?

132
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,125
-You know, at times like this...
-What am I going to do?

133
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,958
...I actually envy her tiny,
sugarcoated brain.

134

[STUDENTS chattering]

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,625
Mmm! [gasps]

136
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,916
Moroha! Hey!

00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,833
-It's her.

That's the psycho
who tied me up!

139
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,416
I heard about a different
part of that story.

140
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,083
Hey, that was for medical
reasons only, I swear.

141
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,916
Wait, what was your name again?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,708
I'm Maya Shimon. I don't think
we were properly introduced.

143
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,500
Cool, so "Maya"?
What a pretty name.

144
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,708
[grunts]

145
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,041
You're way too young
to be a student,

146
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,708
so what the heck
are you doing here?

147
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,125
I'm a prodigy.
Grade School was pointless

148
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,000
because I awakened
as a Savior so early,

149
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,750
so they sent me here
with my sister, Mari.

150
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,208
But I'm sure you already
know her, everyone does.

151
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,875
It doesn't ring a bell.

152
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,541
You really are dim, aren't you?

153
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,708
Her older sister's
the Principal.

154
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,291
Huh? Wait.

155
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,333
So then you already knew Maya,
didn't you?

156
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,375
Mm-hmm.

are gonna work together.

00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,208
Can I have
a second-year volunteer

who's willing
to lead by example?

-Hmm?
-You were really hoping

165
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,083
I'd step up, weren't you, sir?
Listen up, rookies!

Hey, new guy! Bring it on!

'cause you're
some kind of super hero,

over my red-hot coals!

-This guy's a total loser,

so why'd they put him
in the Strikers?

175
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,375
My second year class is kinda
wondering the same thing.

[TADANORI] If you'd give
your attention to the arena,

00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,250
the Ancient Dragon

Hmm? I would watch, but I'm

Purgatory in the netherworld.
Wildfires on the ground.

You had your fun, Kamee, now
it's time for me to have mine.

Hey, you're not supposed
to know how to do that yet!

Please forgive me! I'm sorry
I tried to burn you up!

Welcome to Principal Shimon's
office. Have a seat.

212
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,583
Oh hi.
I was expecting your sister,

213
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,166
since you said she'd be in.

214
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,500
She's not back yet,
but you can wait here.

215
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,541
Thanks.

[MAYA chuckles]

217
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,708
Let me guess,
you've come to ask about Shizuno

218
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,666
and her older brother,
haven't you?

219
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
Uh, yeah. That's right.

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,291
I can tell you everything I know
about them, if you'd like me to.

221
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,833
Mari's busy all day entertaining

222
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,166
some important foreign
dignitary, so there's no telling

223
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
when she'll actually
be back in her office.

224
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,625
-Did you trick me?
-[giggles]

225
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,041
I said she'd be here,
I just didn't say when.

226
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
[MAYA] Their family
is extremely well off,

227
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,458
and they live
in a huge extravagant mansion.

228
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,333
As a matter of fact,
they're wealthy enough

229
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,250
for Shizuno's grandfather to
finance this entire Academy.

230
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,208
Her brother wants to raise
his family's overall profile,

231
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,416
so his primary goal is to make
Shizuno an executive as well.

232
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,291
And so,
before she enrolled at Akane,

233
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,458
he went to great lengths
to train her as a Kuroma

234
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,458
and get her a position
with the Strikers.

235
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,375
He's using his own sister...
like she's some kind of a tool.

236
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,500
I guess so.

237
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,416
She was pretty down
in the dumps for a long time,

238
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,291
but ever since
she became friends with you,

239
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,250
her attitude
completely changed.

240
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,250
It's like
she's a brand-new person!

241
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,958
[EDWARD] I hear you took part
in defeating that Metaphysical.

242
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,083
How I envy the talent
of the Japanese Branch.

243
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,250
We could use an outstanding
Kuroma like you at HQ.

244
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,041
Were it not for the unparalleled
ability of our Ancient Dragon,

245
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,416
I fear my sister wouldn't
have made it back alive.

246
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,208
I'm told Mr. Haimura even
disobeyed a direct order

247
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,458
from his commander and risked
everything to save her.

248
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,541
While we're all impressed
with Mr. Haimura,

249
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,583
Shizuno is a fine Savior
and quite capable.

250

would fall on my head right now.

[SORCERESS] It's cold.
And yet another land has fallen.

254
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,416
All because you used
a forbidden spell.

This place. This icy hell.

It will never see another blade
of grass grow again.

00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:51,500

That was my other former life.

Or is this a dream?
Either way, it sure feels real.

It's you.
The Netherworld Sorceress.

No. Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about,

but you can call me that
if you want to.

Go ahead.

00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,125
Say what? And what
should I "go ahead" with?

275
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,041
If you want to kiss me,
then go ahead and do it.

Come on, are you crazy?
There are people everywhere!

you been standing there?

[mockingly] "If you
wanna kiss me, go ahead."

Relax. Take it easy!

287
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,541
[ANGELA] According
to Principal Shimon's report,

288
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,333
it was a trio of students
who defeated that Metaphysical.

289
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,041
However, there is
no evidence to prove it.

290
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,958
Is that so?
Quite unusual I would say.

291
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,375
Chairman Urushibara seems
more than a little uneasy

292
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,166
about you not giving
your consent yet.

293
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,583
Well, I'm afraid he's just
going to have to wait.

294
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,291
He'll get my answer
once I've had a chance

295
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,916
to see what the bloke
is really made of.

296
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,083
[ANGELA] But, Sir Edward,
you must exercise caution,

297
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,541
lest this turns
into an international issue.

298
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,750
[sighs] Yes, I know.
Oh! That's right.

299
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,625
Do you have an update
about tonight's dinner plan?

300
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,416
We have a reservation at the
best sushi restaurant in town.

301
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,750
Sir, I hope that's okay.

302
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,541
I thought a quiet dinner
would be nice.

303
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,875
[EDWARD]
No, cancel it.

304
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,583
[tires screeching]

305
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:03,041
Um, sorry about that.
Did you just say, "Cancel it"?

306
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,083
[EDWARD] Yes.

307
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,416
-Oh.
-Let's make it "to go" instead!

308
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,125

[TACHIMURA]
Master Moroha Haimura

311
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,541
awaits you in the dining room.

312
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,666
Thank you.

[sighs]

314
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,250
Hey, Shizuno, what's up?
I just got here!

315
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,500
Oh, Moroha!

316
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,833
Did my brother
make you dress up like this?

317
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,291
-[TADANORI laughs]
-Yeah.

318
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,125
I won't blame you
if you wanna laugh at me.

319
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,333
You look handsome.

320
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,583
There's no need
to be embarrassed. Really!

321
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,375
Well. Thank you.
You look nice too.

322
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,500
That's a great dress.

323
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,041
I'm kind of used to seeing you
in your school uniforms.

324
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,833
You look amazing!

325
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,958
Thank you.
That's sweet.

326
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,541
Please forgive me

327
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,666
for the last minute nature
of my invitation.

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,833
Oh. It's cool. This steak
is ridiculously good!

329
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,375
I couldn't help but notice
that you and my little sister

330
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,333
are getting along quite well.
Is she proving useful to you?

331
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,250
Uh, "useful"?
Of course.

332
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,416
Not to mention
she's a really great person.

333
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,083
Your responsibility is
to be by Mr. Haimura's side

334
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,750
and give him anything
he might need. Got it?

335
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,458
Yes, I understand, brother.

336
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,291
Let me ask you something.

337
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,791
Do you know
what one must accomplish

338
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,041
to be recognized
as an "S" Class Savior?

339
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,500
No. Afraid I don't.

340
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,875
-Hmm?
-To achieve Rank "S,"

341
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,291
a Savior must singlehandedly
defeat a Metaphysical,

342
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,708
one that is beyond
his ability to defeat.

343
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,250
Sound familiar?
It's what you've already done.

344
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,791
The-- the thing is,
I didn't beat it by myself.

345
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,541
All three of us
had a hand in it.

346
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,125
But if the other two
got their stories straight,

347
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,583
Rank "S" would be yours.

348
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,208
You could be
certified immediately

349
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,375
-and achieve something...
-[gasps]

350
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,750
...most people only dream of.

351
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,291
One little white lie,

352
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,125
and you'd be the Japanese
Branch's number two.

353
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,083
Wealth and power would
be yours for the taking.

354
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,791
If what you really want is
to repay your aunt and uncle,

355
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,416
you could do that
a dozen times over

356
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,125
and still have riches to spare.

357
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,250
That's true, but at what cost?

358
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,916
Wealth like that
doesn't come free,

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,458
and you know it.
He'd be giving up so much.

I'm sorry... for the way my
brother was acting back there.

364
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
Oh, no big deal. It's fine.

365
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,000

seems kinda lonely.

I guess it just doesn't
feel like you.

369

Does that make sense?

[SHIZUNO]
Yes, it does.

371

was picked for me

or forced on me
by someone else.

to have their own interests.

be devoted to the family name.

But sleep? That's one thing even
they can't take away from me.
