00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,000
[EDWARD]
We're all met. Seeing as such,

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,250
I think it's high time
we began our proceedings.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,750
We're here
to discuss the promotion

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,708
of Moroha Haimura as Rank "S."

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,291
For my part, I vote "nyet."

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,541
I stand
with the Russian Terror on this.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,291
Japan Branch votes yes.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,083
Haimura's power is more
than suitable for Rank "S."

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,708
And how does everyone
else feel about it?

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,875
For the moment, I'd rather
defer to the judgment

11
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,208
of my esteemed colleague
from the United States.

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,916
[ARLENE] Well, I'll say this.
It seems to me

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,666
we don't have enough data
to properly assess the viability

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,208
of Mr. What's-His-Name
as a candidate.

15
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,291
Fair enough,
but he did slay a metaphysical

16
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,416
with nine heads all by himself.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,708
[CHARLES]
But where's the proof?

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,708
He killed the beast
with such efficiency

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,250
that no one had time
to record it.

20
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,958
If that's not good enough,
then I just don't know what is.

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,750
[VASILISA chuckles]

22
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,041
Perhaps the gentleman
from Japan is biased?

23
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,458
--[CHARLES] She's right.
--[SURUGA grumbles]

24
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,708
If you were in our position,
you'd want proof, too,

25
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,333
and you'd shoot down
any vote till you had it!

26
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,500
[ARLENE] Hmm. I'm afraid I agree
with my colleague from France.

27
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:14,000
[EDWARD] Hold on! Your
reluctance is understandable.

28
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,000
I had my doubts about the boy
as well until I saw his power!

29
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,333
[groaning]
Oh, please no!

30
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,000
Not one like this right now!

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,416
[EDWARD]
Ando, what's happening?

32

--A new Metaphysical.

Doesn't look like the target's

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,333
picking up speed just yet.

[MAN on radio]
Roger that.

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,833
Maintain your distance
and continue your pursuit.

39
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:25,875
[PILOT]
Yes, sir.

Oh no. It's 300 meters long.

42
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,125
[KAMEKICHI] Wait.
I thought "Dreadnought Class"

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,291
was as big those things got!

44
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,916
That used to be the case,

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,541
but this one is officially
called a Fortress Class.

46
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,791
Sir. What's its
current position?

47
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,541
[JIN] Moving southeast
across the sea of Japan.

48
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,583
In one hour,
it'll pass by right by us

49
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,791
and then likely
make landfall on Honshu.

50
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,083
If that monster sets
a foot on land...

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,916
It'll be a catastrophe!

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,916
Reinforcements
are coming, right?

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,583
I'm afraid they won't be.

54
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,583
The Japan Branch
has ordered us to withdraw.

55

[ALL gasp]

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,541
[JIN] With the Branch Chief
temporarily out of pocket

57
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,500
and considering how unfamiliar
we are with the Fortress Class,

58
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,500
they've decided to err
on the side of caution.

59
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,583
[TOKIKO] Hold on a second.
Isn't the Principal

60
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,291
with the Chief and the rest
of the Head Six right now?

61
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,208
[MAYA]
Yeah! That's a good point.

62
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,791
Why don't they just use Mari's
Transportal to get back here?

63
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,708
Honestly, team, I don't know.
But the bottom line is

64
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
we all take orders
from somebody.

65
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,291
But shouldn't
we do something, Captain?

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,291
I don't have a choice
in the matter.

67
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,000
And even if I did, I would
still choose to withdraw.

68
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,500
I won't throw you
into a battle,

69
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,750
not when we have
zero chance of victory.

Captain, why didn't they
maintain a safe distance?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,416
Maybe that thing
outsmarted them somehow.

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,958
[JIN] If it did, that certainly
doesn't bode well for us.

I hope you understand
my decision.

We don't have much time,

so gather your things
as quickly as you possibly can.

The evacuation process
is underway.

The locals are departing

Mmm. Ah!
I don't know what's wrong,

really, really sick!

You and I both know
there's no possible way

00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,125
we can defeat that Metaphysical
without the Head Six--

[VASILISA] I'm not being
unreasonable at all.

soothes the exhaustion we feel.

473
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,750
I hope, with all my heart,
that we finally get

474
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,333
some peace and quiet,
so we can close our eyes

475
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,333
and fall asleep
to the beautiful lullaby

476
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,458
of the waves ebbing and flowing.

477
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,291
[VASILISA]
I need you to go to Japan

478
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,625
and take care
of a little situation for me.

479
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,666
--[WOMAN] Of course.
--Just so you know,

480
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,208
the target's Rank "S."

481
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,083
This will not be
a walk in the park.

482
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,166
In my absence,
do everything you can

483
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,750
to embody the power
of the Russian Terror.

484
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,333
Yes.

485
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,458
[TOKIKO laughs]
While the Captain's asleep,

486
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,208
I'll go see Moroha! [yelps]

487
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,458
[JIN] Your head is
as soft as a ripe tomato.

488
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,750
Next time,
"The Silver-Haired Stranger."

489
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,000
[BOTH]
Spelling!
