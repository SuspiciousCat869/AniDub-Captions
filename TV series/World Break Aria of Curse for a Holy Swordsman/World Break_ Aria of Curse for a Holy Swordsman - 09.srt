I leave Sir Edward's side

31

to look after a wanker like you?

32
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,541
It's quite an insult

Thanks.
I'm excited you're here too.

Then, of course, there's
Sir Edward himself to consider.

He's helping you
with this private war

36

against the Russian branch,
which confounds me.

44

No. I was dead serious.

I'm really not
gonna kill anyone.

[scoffs]
What, are you deaf?

48
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,500
I have no idea where Terror is,

49
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,333
and if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

50
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,958
[MOROHA]
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

That right?

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,916
I want you to send your "Terror
Empress" a message for me.

"Haimura has come here
to wage war."

Just what in the hell do you
think you're doing right now?

55
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,583
After this, I'm gonna go speak

56
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,375
to the Khabarovsk
field office chief,

57
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,125
so feel free to pass
that along to her as well.

58
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,375
Stop this! You came here
to wage a war, did you not?

59
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,500
Typically one doesn't give
the enemy valuable intelligence!

60

Yeah, but I don't have time
for prisoners and interrogations

no one takes you seriously.

When you're asleep,
do you see your previous life?

72

Does the past come back
to you like a dream?

73
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,208
Why are you asking what
you already know answer to?

74
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,625
I dream a lot. I'm always alone
on the battlefield, fighting.

Come on. Let's get outta here!

86
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,250
Wait! You're not really going
to spare him, are you?

87
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,416
Think about it, right?

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,791
That guy's a Rank "A"
from the Russian Branch.

89
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
It'll take more than a little
pinprick to slow him down.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,333
Well, then you should've
bloody finished the job.

91
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,166
At any rate,
isn't the Russian Terror

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,416
the one you're really after?

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,583
--Don't worry, I've got a plan.
--[sighs]

94
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,458
Look. We don't have
a clue where she is.

95
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,375
Sir Edward's intel
hasn't helped us,

96
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,791
and interrogating a bunch
of field chiefs won't either.

97
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
But if I start beating up
her people one by one,

98
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,416
then I'll have her attention.

99
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,000
And once I have it, she'll be
forced to make the first move.

100
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,875
Good plan.
Except for the fact

101
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,500
that once he teams up
with the others,

102
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,708
you'll most likely have
to fight him all over again.

103
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,166
--You're wrong.
--Hmm?

104
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,916
As a matter of fact,
I don't think he'll circle back

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,166
with the other officers at all.

106
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,875
He'll be so ashamed
of his failure,

107
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,250
he won't want anyone to know.

108
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,875
[ANGELA]
I do hope you're right.

109
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,875
The chiefs are extremely loyal
to the Terror, though,

110
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,583
so that's something to consider.

111
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,291
[groaning]

112
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,083
But what if he does tell her?

113
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,125
Even if he knows his loyalty
might cost him his own life?

114
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,458
It's a possibility.
I meant it when I said

115
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,125
I didn't wanna kill
anyone in this war.

116
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,958
But if she does,
then she'll show the whole world

117
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,625
what kind of a monster
she really is.

118
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,750
So, it's not leniency,
it's strategy.

119
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,125
Yeah. This is
absolutely the best way.

120
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,750
In the end, you'll see.

121
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,375
--Just like a Jack-in-the-box.
--Huh?

122
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,916
That's what you are.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,375
With you, you never know
what's going to pop up.

your business quickly.

I'm quite sleepy,
as you can see, so go on.

131
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,541

[VASILISA] And?

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
By all rights, I should take
my own life right now!

134
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,875
But if I'm going to die,
with your permission,

135
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,083
I would like
to take him down with me!

159
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,541
[roars]

160
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,000
[screams]

161
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,916
[BERNARD]
So. You see, Haimura?

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,416
This is power of Terror Empress!

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,833
You'll never reach her level
no matter how hard you try!

164
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,291
Death is pure bliss.
Ecstasy! Heaven!

165
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,291
[BERNARD]
Long live the Russian Terror!

166
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,000
[KATYA thinks]
What a damned fool.

167
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,166
[DARKO] According
to Bernard's final report,

168
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,791
it appears Haimura plans
to strike Khabarovsk next.

169
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,791
What shall we do to prepare?

170
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,250
--We needn't do anything at all.
--[DARKO] Huh?

171
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,458
We'll let Haimura make
the first move.

172
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,625
In the meantime,
those of you here

173
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,750
will strengthen our defenses
around Krasnoyarsk.

174
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,583
[DARKO gasps]
Madam Terror,

175
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,541
are we to abandon
everything east of Siberia?

176
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,041
[VASILISA] Even if I order them
to surround him right now,

177
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,916
they won't be
in position in time.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,833
--[KATYA sighs]
--[DARKO] Ah, yes, of course.

179
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,875
Very insightful,
Terror Empress!

180
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,166
That is clearly
the best course of action!

181
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,458
I demand this: Should any
of you meet Haimura in battle,

182
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,958
if he defeats you,
you must cut off

183
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,000
one of his arms before you die.

184
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,791
[DARKO and KIRSAN laugh]

185
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,625
So. Uh.
We're not both gonna sleep

186
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,250
in the same train car, are we?

187
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Well, well, well.
Does the boy have trouble

188
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,083
falling asleep
in unfamiliar places?

189
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,041
Perhaps he would like a little
cuddle to help him fall asleep?

190
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,000
--Are you offering?
--Ah!

191
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,875
Cause that sounds
like fun, actually.

192
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
Hey! What do you think
you're doing, creepster?

193
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
I was just joking, you hornball!

194
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,500
You are not to cross this line,
do you understand me?

195
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,083
Do it and I'll kill you
on the spot!

196
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,166
And what are we supposed to do
when we need to change clothes?

197
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,041
We face away from each other,
and cover our eyes!

198
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,000
If you so much as do
anything remotely creepy,

199
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,750
I'll nut punch you! [grunts]

200
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,750
Well, good night then.
This was a great talk.

201
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:41,833
[wind blowing]

202
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,708
[whispering]
Yes. We're quite all right.

203
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,208

204
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,333
[train whistle blows]

205
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,000
[shouts] Huh?

206
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,500
You hear me, loud and clears.

207
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,875
I'm his little sister now.
You are no longer needed here.

208
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,500
Look. My big brother
only has one little sister,

209
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,958
from now till the end of time,

210
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,041
and that little sister is
right here, Ruskie! [grunts]

211
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,958
I beg to be disagreeing.

212
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,500
Moroha told me
he and I are family.

213
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,583
Ugh! Fine, if you wanna be
part of his family,

214
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,750
you're gonna have to be
his big sister!

215
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,000
No, I am little.

216
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,500
[growls]

217
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,875
Please shut up.
There's no reason for you

218
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,291
to keep fighting over something
so incredibly trivial.

219
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not trivial at all!
As a matter of fact,

220
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,416
my entire identity as a human
is based around it!

221
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,291
Someone shoot me now.

222
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,458
[muffled scream]

223
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,791
Please, Miss Urushibara.

224
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,500
--Hmm?
--I am wanting you to help me.

225
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,375
Talk some sense
into this person,

226
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,625
so she will give up
her little sister crusade.

227
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,250
And what makes
you think I would actually

228
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,291
--help you with anything?
--[BOTH gasp]

Well. Well. Well. Well. You see?

00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,708
Urushibara's on my side,
not yours, you weirdo!

[LESYA]
Sweet death, take me.

232
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,208
Listen, you two.
It's past time you put an end

233
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,875
to this silly feud of yours.
Moroha'd be so disappointed

234
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,791
if he came home to find you
fighting over something

235
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,166
as meaningless as who gets
to be his little sister.

236

[BOTH gasp]

237
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,166
He's out there
putting his life on the line

238
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,791
and fighting a war
all by himself. Come on!

[BOTH] Uh...
[chuckle nervously]

we are. For big brother's sake.

I just hope he's okay.

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,916
I worry about him being
over there all alone.

00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,625
Yeah!

251
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,583
I hate the idea
of Moroha not having me.

252
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,916
I keep him warm during those
bitter, cold Russian nights.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,250
All I desire is him to live.

254
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,458
I want him to show me
the smile on his face once more.

[SATSUKI]
Don't worry, ladies!

256
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,750
He's not about to lose
to those Russian idiots!

Remember that name,

00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,083
so you can tell everyone
who it was that beat you.

Eight. Trust me.

I hope you're happy.

This is what happens
when you share intel.

274
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,791
[MOROHA] Enough of that.
I've gotta find a safe place

275
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,625
to fight them where no civilians
will be put in harm's way.

[ANGELA sighs]

Every time I turn around,
you're on your cell.

278
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,625
I am using my phone
to help you solve

your problem,
if you must know!

It's a walk, but there's
a secluded wooded area nearby.

Oh.

Wait. You're not
going alone, are you?

Hey! Come back!

I'm not some bell hop
you can flick a coin at!

I know you're out there.
Show yourself!

291
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,041
I'm the Krasnoyarsk
field office chief.

My name is
Kirsan Romanovich Pavlyuchenko.

There's no point
trying to escape us.

296

You're surrounded by Rank A
Russian field office chiefs.

297
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,041
You don't stand a chance.

[MOROHA]
What makes you so sure?

299
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,000
[grunts] This doesn't have
to end in bloodshed, Haimura.

300
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,750
Just leave here
and go back to Japan in peace.

--[MOROHA] Huh?
--If we do battle here today,

303

Defying an order
from the Terror means death,

304

but if it will save lives,
I don't care what happens to me.

This is for Bernard

No. They're twins.

Yeah, right. Liar!
