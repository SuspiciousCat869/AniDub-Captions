I don't know what you think
that was all about,

26
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,208
but it was definitely not some
sort of post-coital scenario.

So don't let your perverted mind
run away from you!

That's what you are!

You said you were fighting
this war on your own,

and yet you still went to
the trouble of saving my skin!

[ANGELA]
We didn't have sex!

55
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,375
My name is Katya Eskevna Honda.

56
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,041
I'm a half Russian, half
Japanese Savior from Russia.

57
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm 18 years old

58
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,541
and currently head of the
Yekaterinburg field office.

59
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,041
How very interesting.

60
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,666
So, tell us, how did you
know about our hideout?

61
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
Oh, well,
that's an easy question.

62
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,416
One of my staff members tailed
you when you arrived at station.

63
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,166
If you knew we were here
the whole time,

64
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,666
then why didn't you
come after us sooner?

65
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,083
[laughs]
You didn't look very friendly.

66
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,541
As a matter of fact,
you looked like

67
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,250
you were ready to kill somebody.

--[KATYA chuckles]

I'm not looking for fight.

70
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,916
I'm looking for
a peaceful resolution.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,375
You and I have
something in common, Moroha.

72
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,875
Neither of us has desire
to take human life.

73
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,166
That's why I know you're
the right person for this.

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,666
You're the only one who can
help make my dream reality.

75
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,250
Your dream?

76
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,083
My friend, Yuri.

77
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,041
I need your help saving her
from the Russian Terror.

78
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,958
In Russia,
Saviors do not really have

79
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,333
any family to speak of.

80
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,875
That way,
if they're treated badly,

81
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,666
no one will step forward
and complain.

82
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,875
The Terror seeks them all out,

83
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,833
and forces them
to fight one another.

84
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,500
The winners become
her bodyguards,

85
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,750
and the losers are cast aside.

86
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,500
So, your friend Yuri
was picked to be a bodyguard,

87
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,500
and now
she lives like a prisoner.

88
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,958
Well then, I suppose I know
exactly where we're headed.

89
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
To face the Terror.

90
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:39,000
We're going to Yekaterinburg
where the Russian Terror lives.

91
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,750
All right.

92
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,458
Yes. I'll speak to you soon.

93
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,041
Where are you going?

94
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,416
To the bathroom.
Why, you wanna come with me?

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
You're not funny.
Not one bit.

96
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,291
But what if I fall in?

97
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,541
[ANGELA]
Idiot.

98
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,666
Anyway, did you know that things

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,416
would turn out like this
in the end?

100
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,416
What do you mean?

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,541
The war with the Terror.

102
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,500
You knew we'd
find someone like Katya

103
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,875
who'd have the courage to
face her and rally the people.

104
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,291
[MOROHA]
No, I didn't know.

105
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,000
Wish I could say I did,
but the truth is,

106
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,208
I got really lucky.

107
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,375
I certainly hoped
the Russian branch

108
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,416
would have some
decent people in it like Katya.

109
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,250
I guess I'm just
an optimist at heart.

110

[BOTH chuckle]

111
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,708
You know what I think?

112
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,208
That you're quite a guy,
Haimura.

113
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,416
Second only to
Sir Edward, of course.

114
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,625
Right?

115
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,583
[KATYA]
Here we are at last.

116
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,708
[MOROHA]
Nap time.

117
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:41,958
Oh. Oh no.
The flick. Works every time.

118
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,125
[MOROHA]
That should knock her out

119
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,583
for a little while.

120
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,708
[ANGELA]
She seems like she might

121
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,791
be handy in a fight.

122
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,666
Perhaps we should
bring her along.

123
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,375
[MOROHA]
Katya can't come.

124
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,166
The Russia of tomorrow
is gonna need people like her.

125
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,541
Why do you care so deeply

126
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,416
about what happens
to someone else's country?

127
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
what does that
have to do with you?

128
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,500
[MOROHA]
We live on the same planet.

129
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,166
What's good for one
is good for all.

130
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,333
Am I right?

131
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
Ugh. Ridiculous idealism.

132
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,791
[ANGELA]
Look, are you certain

133
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,541
you don't need
my blades just in case?

134
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,875
If anything happened to you,

135
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,000
I'd never be able to
face Edward again, so no.

136
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,833
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself!

137
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,125
[MOROHA]
Enough of the bold words.

138
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,291
I'm gonna be busy
fighting the Russian Terror,

139
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
and I won't have time
to worry about protecting you

140
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,291
or anyone else.

141

[grunts]

142
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,791
Sometimes, I hate you
so much, Haimura!

143
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,375
That sucks,
'cause I was actually

144
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,833
starting to like you
quite a bit.

[DARKO]
Madam Terror,

148
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,208
Haimura didn't kill
a single one of us!

149
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,750
His leniency is
clearly his weakness.

150
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,458
Empress, I returned to you,
not because I ran in fear,

151
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,041
but because I wanted you
to know the truth!

152
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,041
[VASILISA]
That's enough.

Ma'am?

154
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Whatever the case,
in the end you failed.

155
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,333
You know what this means.
You must die now.

156
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,583
[DARKO]
No, please don't do this!

157
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,041
Don't kill me! Terror Empress,
please spare my life!

[DARKO screams]

159
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,125
[VASILISA]
Worthless.

Oh.

Purgatory in the netherworld.
Wildfires on the ground!

The flames are impartial,
and consume good and evil,

They purify all
with fierce charity!

328
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,875
All must die
and return to dust.

329
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,416
God has forsaken mankind!

No way!

Here comes the next one!

Shizuno, use your
Defensive Magic!

I remember... everything!

344
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,416
You're the one
who did it first, Terror,

345
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,375
so no complaining
when I return the favor.

It all began in the water.
It all returns to water.

00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,708
In other words, water is life,
and yet death, too.

349

The mother that bears us...

Wow. It's a level 13 spell.

Haimura is about to
throw a curse at it!

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,708
[MOROHA]
But that cruelty and uncertainty

353

have already forgotten the face
of their most beloved mother.

354
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,333
I will devour billions of lands.
An eternal void, never filled.

355
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,958
An eternal pleasure,
never satiated.

356
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,000
All things in life must change

357
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,041

He did all this?

361
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,083
Amazing.

362
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,208
A brand new curse.

363
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,500
Help me! I can't swim!

Hmm.

Who cares?

Anywhere that's
far away from here!

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,916
I'm more afraid of Haimura
than I am of you,

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,208

A tyrant's end

Now are you done?

I swear to never trouble you
again, Moroha Haimura!

385
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,625
In fact,
if you'll let me back you,

386
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,791
I'll do whatever you say
from now on, no matter what!

Let me live, and I promise you
I'll be your slave forever.

[MOROHA]
When your people made mistakes,

389
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,333
you didn't forgive them.

390
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,041
You purged them from this earth,

391
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,791
and now you're
begging for your life?

392
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,958
I'm not ready
to leave this world yet.

393

I don't want to lose
the empire, either!

Please, just allow me
to keep living,

to be a good person.

It's so simple,

but for some ridiculous reason,

401

it's the hardest thing for
people like you to understand.

managed to pull it off.

must be gently shining

on Moroha and the rest of them.

would come to Yekaterinburg.

ominous darkness.
