for agreeing to meet with me.

this is our first time.

Da.

So if we've never met, how come
you wrote me this love letter?

00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,083
Is this some kind of trap
or something?

12
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,875
Uh...

When I just now saw you,

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,375
it was what you call
love at first sight.

18
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,708
Uh...

19
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,083
Most people
send love letters

20

after they fall in love
at first sight!

21

Maybe then my source
gives unreliable intelligence?

22
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,500
I was told is custom
to invite sweetheart to gym

23
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,250
and profess undying love.

24
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,250
But maybe now I see this is
bad form on my part.

Oh my.

26

that is a custom here,

wanna be my girlfriend.

I embrace death.

Aah!

322
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,375
Do you want one?

323
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,041
But this is racket, da?

324
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,750
You pay lots of money
and yet get no prize.

325
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,583
[MOROHA]
Not if you know how to play it.

326
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,583
For me?

327
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah, it's a present.

328
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,708
You wanted it, right?

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,416
Hear me, earthly beings.

330
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,541
You are all in for
a world of hurt.

331
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,916
All right! Time for Marice
to unleash her hellish attack!

332
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,625
Let's get ready
for the Ultimate Gehenna!

333
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,208
Hold on just a second.

334
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,208
how in the heck do you know
the name of the enemy's attack?

335
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,916
Huh? Oh, well,
'cause I just now invented it?

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,625
You're behind this again?
Ah, man.

337
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,125
Listen to me, big brother,

338
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,708
'cause this is
for your own good.

339
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,416
The Ultimate Gehenna attack
is serious black magic

340
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,125
that destroyed
the seven heavens

341
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,958
and turned them
into fiery hells.

342
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,375
You think you could
uninvent it?

343
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,583
In case you forgot,
she's aiming it right at us!

344
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,666
This magic could
reduce Earth to ashes.

345
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,166
Plus, it would still
have the power

346
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,791
to wipe out the universe
100 times over!

347
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,333
This planet has no future,

348
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,041
overrun as it now is with
the arrogance of humanity.

349
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,916
This is divine punishment.

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,666
[EIJI] That doesn't mean
it's okay to pass judgment

351
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,416
and let it
be destroyed, does it?

352
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,791
[DEKOSUKE]
I seriously can't believe...

353
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,083
[ANGELA]
Describe her for me.

354
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,833
[SHIZUNO] She's pretty,
with sleek, silvery hair

355
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,625
and a massive pair
of you-know-whats.

356
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,708
I'd say she's about
15 years old.

357
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,875
She says her name's
Elena Arshavina.

358
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,541
It can't be.

359
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,541
[SHIZUNO]
Wait, do you know her?

360
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,791
[ANGELA]
Be careful.

361
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,416
They call her "the Maneater."

362
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,125
Sorry for the wait.

363
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,541
Spasibo.

364
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,041
That brings back memories.

365
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,541
I used to play catch with
my uncle when I was growing up.

366
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,541
Your uncle?

367
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,125
Not with father?

368
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,000
I would have,

369
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875
but my mom and dad passed away
when I was a little kid.

370
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,416
I guess we have
something in common.

371
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,208
We both know
how hard it is to grow up

372
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,583
without a mother and father.

373
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,125
But I still have
my aunt and uncle,

374
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,750
and I'm incredibly
grateful for that.

375
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,666
Just like you still
have your brother.

376
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,833
We're lucky.

377
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,875
My brother will be with me,
now and till the end of times.

378
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,458
That's nice.

379
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,541
Lesya, I'd really like
to meet him.

380

381
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,916
And I would very much
like to meetings as well

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,416
with your aunt and uncle.
This okay?

383
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,416
Of course.
That'd be awesome.

Oh.

392
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,208
I wondered if you'd
show your face.

393
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,500
I thought you might not.

394
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,541
My face is showing.

395
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,416
Tell me what this is about.

396
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,541
Don't worry,
it's not a love letter.

397
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,083
But there's something I want.

398
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,666
I want to face off
with you, one-on-one.

399
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,000
Assuming, that is, you're not
too afraid to fight me.

400
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,458
You mean
to challenge me to duel?

401
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,083
That's right.

402
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,166
And why not?

403
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,125
You're the Maneater, after all.

The Savior-murdering Savior.

It's fine if you don't
wanna answer me.

407

But you will stay away from him.

And you'll keep a safe distance.
Because, if you don't,

have to answer to me.
