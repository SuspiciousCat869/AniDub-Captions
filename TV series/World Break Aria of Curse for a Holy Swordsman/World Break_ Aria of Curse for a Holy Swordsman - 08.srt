1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,666
She's suspended?

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,916
Seriously?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,958
Afraid so.

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,833
Wait, I don't understand.

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,541
What the heck
did Shizuno do wrong?

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,125
I wasn't told the reason.

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,583
but all I know is
Lesya is out today too.

8
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,000
So whatever happened,

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,666
I'm guessing it has something
to do with her.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,041
You're probably right.

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,166
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

12
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,625
You didn't have
to come see me today,

13
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,791
but thanks.

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,791
Sure.
Are you okay?

15
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
Your leg's pretty banged up.

16
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't worry, I'm fine.

17
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,791
Have you ever heard
of the Maneater?

18
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,375
No. Who's that?

19
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,541
She's a deadly
Russian Branch assassin

20
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,250
with a magic sword that
consumes prana and mana.

21
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,291
Rumor has it she once even
wounded Sir Edward in a duel.

22
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,333
What?

23
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,333
Elena's not who she says she is.

24
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,750
I'm sorry to tell you this,

25
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,041
but she is the Maneater.

26
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,416
[gasps]

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,208
Lesya, an assassin?

28
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,333
This has got to be
some kind of mistake.

29
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,000
But it's not.
Trust me.

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,333
I confirmed it yesterday.

31
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,333
Oh yeah, how?

32
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,458
Sorry I didn't come
to you first,

33
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,458
but I had to know.

34
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,291
I challenged Elena
to a duel.

35
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,333
I hope you're able to forgive me
for doing this behind your back.

36
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,833
But in the end,
my instincts were exactly right.

37
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,500
That is enough.

38
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,875
Didn't you hear me?

39
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:03,833
She's an assassin.

40
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,458
I said that's enough!

41
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,458
[gasps]

42
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,708
I'm just glad you're okay.

43
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,416
Moroha.

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
You've gotta be more careful.

45
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,666
What if you had gotten hurt?

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,208
If anything happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

47
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,875
I really am sorry.

48
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,125
[crying]

49
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,750
Even if Lesya is the Maneater,

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,750
that doesn't
change anything for me.

51
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,333
I know this sounds crazy,

52
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,500
but deep down,
I know she's a good person.

53
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:41,458
[panting]

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,250
Brother...

55
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,708
Lesya! Lesya!

56
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,166
Lesya, you have to wake up!

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,541
[gasps]

58
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,208
I hardly think this is
the time to be taking a nap.

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
We have a situation
on our hands.

60
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,041
It's likely Moroha's
discovered the truth

61
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,833
about who you really are.

62
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,416
Da. I know.

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,208
Tell me, why didn't you
kill Urushibara?

64
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,375
Don't you want
to complete the mission,

65
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,916
and live happily ever after

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,208
with your brother by your side?

67
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,958
Da. Of course I do.

68
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,916
[bell rings]

69
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,041
It isn't safe here.

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,125
[sighs]

71
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,125
Well, it looks like
she's still alive.

72
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,791
You are so rude.

73
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,750
Don't you know staring into
someone else's window

74
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,291
is an invasion of their privacy?

75
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,375
Yeah, my bad.

76
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,791
Hi.

77
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,083
I'm really sorry about
what Shizuno did yesterday.

78
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,666
An icy Dark Art,
with a hex thrown in the mix?

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,875
It looks like it did
quite a number on you.

80
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,041
She can be
pretty harsh sometimes.

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,958
This'll take a while to heal.

82
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,083
But eventually,
you'll be good as new.

83
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,250
There is plenty of Kuroma
at Russian branch,

84
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,833
But no one ever uses Dark Art
for healing on me.

85
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,541
It's very unusual.

86
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,791
Bon appetite!

87
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,916
It's Satsuki's special risotto!

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,333
Great, are you up for eating?

89
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,125
I can feed it to you,
if you need some help with it.

90
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,458
Spoon feeding another woman?
With me here?

91
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,708
Get real.

92
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,208
You and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

93
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,250
[MOROHA] Course not.

94
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,291
I am confused.

95
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,041
You two are brother sister, da?

96
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,083
We're not.

97
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,625
But in a former life
we used to be.

98
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,541
This is simply unbelievabling.

99
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,916
Two siblings reincarnated
during same period

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,250
is practically miracle.

101
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,333
True love does
make miracles happen!

102
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,166
Honestly, true love aside,

103
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,541
the fact that we
actually cross paths

104
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,041
with someone
we knew from a past life

105
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,125
is pretty miraculous
in and of itself.

106
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,916
And us too, Lesya.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,791
We're together right now
due to basically

108
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,875
an incredible
series of coincidences.

109
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,875
Here, this risotto is going
to knock your socks off!

110
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,458
Well, say "ah."

111
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,916
Ah.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,791
[grunts]

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,875
-[muffled screaming]
-Oh, uh...

114
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,333
So sorry about that.

115
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,375
It is clear that Miss Ranjou
wants to be murdering me.

116
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,458
Now I must take my own life
before she does.

117
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,333
Sweet death!

118
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,791
I already told you I'm sorry!

119
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,416
Please forgive me!

120
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,916
This is getting way outta hand.

121
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,291
[baby crying]

122
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,416
What are you to Moroha?

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,041
I am very curious
to know this answer.

124
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,166
I'm his friend.

125
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,416
And a future member
of his harem.

126
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,291
[giggles]

127
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,500
I am not in
understanding of this.

128
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,000
[giggles]

129
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,541
Huh?

130
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,333
[crying]

131
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,000
Why do I always cry like a baby
when I chop up onions?

132
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Aah!

133
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,125
Oh god, oh man, oh god!

134
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,166
Aah!

135
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,333
Help me!

136
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,541
Uh...

137
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,958
[SATSUKI] Ta-da!

138
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,750
I thought you might be longing
for a taste of home,

139
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,416
so I made a special
Russian dish just for you!

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,916
It's borscht.

141
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,958
[SATSUKI]
Be honest. Is it tasty?

142
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,750
All right then! There's way more
where that came from

143
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,416
If you eat a lot
and get plenty of rest,

144
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,666
you'll be back to one hundred
percent before you know it!

145
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
Da, I will dos.

146
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,416
And if you don't want
to sleep alone,

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,041
feel free to call me
whenever you like

148
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,500
and I'll be right there!

149
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, will dos.

150
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,375
You should totally
take her up on that.

151
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,791
Maya's an awesome hug pillow!

152
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,708
That I am.

153
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,208
Hey.
Hold on a second,

154
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,833
does that mean you're
using her as a hug pillow

155
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,916
when you're
sleeping at night?

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
[MAYA] That he is!

157
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,500
-[SATSUKI] Huh? What the hell?
-[MOROHA] No, no, no, no, no.

158
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,500
Of course I'm not!

159
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
Hi, Elena!
How are you?

160
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,541
Uh...

161
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,958
Enjoying your time
at Akane Academy so far?

162
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:13,833
Da.

163
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,041
Yeah, me too.

164
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,833
I'm even considering
officially staying on

165
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,708
with the Japanese branch
after graduation.

166
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,166
You should stick around, too,

167
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,958
it's a perfect place
to start your career!

168
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,291
Uh...

169
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,083
[laughing]

170
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,291
[SATSUKI]
Moroha!

171
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,250
[MOROHA]
What's up?

172
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,583
No, I can't.

173
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,250
I would be betraying my brother.

174
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Just give it some time.

175
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,000
When graduation comes around,

176
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,250
and you've made
some more friends,

177
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,875
I bet you'll
totally love it here.

178
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
So much so, that you'll wanna
live in Japan forever.

179
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,916
Girl, you're home.
Trust me. Kay?

180
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,083
[LESYA] I worry
this plan is not working.

181
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey.

182
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm glad you've returned.

183
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,166
And I'm glad to see you
on your feet again.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
Just don't push it too hard.

185
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,875
Do not worry, I am feeling fine.
And so, I have request for you.

186
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,916
On our next day off.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want you to go
on date with me.

188
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,166
Thanks for calling
and letting me know.

189
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,375
Goodbye.

190
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,916
[phone ringing]

191
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,666
[groaning]

192
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,000
[phone ringing]

193
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,416
I'm here. What?

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,625
[SHIZUNO] Satsuki. Did Moroha
happen to mention

195
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,416
anything about what
he's doing this afternoon?

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
As a matter of fact he did,

197
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,916
and it made me mad!

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,875
He says he's going on another
date with the ruskie!

199
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,291
-The nerve of that boy!
-[gasps]

200
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,750
Why aren't we walking
arm-in-arm today?

201
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,500
Huh?

202
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,416
Leprazam!

203
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,041
They call me the Maneater.

204
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,125
My sword devours
any insidious villain

205
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,666
who dares threaten the mighty
soul of Mother Russia.

206
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,333
Oh, Lesya.

207
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,166
Mister Moroha Haimura,

208
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,500
Today you die.

209
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
[SATSUKI]
Lesya, a Russian assassin?

210
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
Do you really think it's true?

211
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,208
I know it is.

212
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,333
You go ahead,
we'll talk later.

213
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,625
Right.

214
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,958
[SATSUKI]
Sofie, it's you.

215
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,500
Sorry.
Hate to do this,

216
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,375
but I can't let
you two interfere.

217
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,500
But why not?
I don't understand?

218
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,625
Because the American Branch
stands to benefit

219
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,666
from the Maneater
attacking Moroha.

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,958
They want Elena dead,

221
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,958
and they think he's the only one
who can do it.

222
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,416
But what if he gets hurt?

223
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,083
You go on in.

224
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,208
I'll hang back here
and take care of her.

225
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,375
Please, be careful.

226
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,291
I just told you,
you can't go in there!

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,833
That was fast.

228
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,208
Come on, then.

229
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,541
Let's duel.

230
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
[grunting]

231
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,416
This isn't good.

232
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
She absorbs prana?

233
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,125
persisting will!

234
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
Her sword is powerful.

235
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,583
She's really good.

236
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,541
Herculean strike!

237
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,875
Her sword can even absorb
prana from a distance?

238
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,083
Ugh.

239
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,583
Go on then,
take your best shot.

240
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,750
You came her to kill me.

241
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,291
So go ahead
and do your job.

242
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,708
[yelling]

243
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,333
[grunting]

244
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,083
Summer training camp
did wonders for you, Satsuki.

245
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,583
You've improved.

246
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,583
Well, losing isn't really
an option for me.

247
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,958
I know.

248
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,833
But unfortunately, I can't
afford to lose either.

249
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,625
May the best woman win, right?

250
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,958
Staying on the defensive
won't get me anywhere with her.

251
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,041
I've gotta do something
before it's too late!

252
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,833
Strange.

253
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,333
Typical Shirogane
apply swordplay

254
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,833
based on strength
of their prana.

255
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,625
Why spend so much time training

256
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,083
to improve
your swordplay itself?

257
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,708
I don't really know.

258
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,958
When I first started fighting
I struggled to keep up,

259
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,708
so I decided I never wanted
to feel that way again.

260
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,583
I can do better than this.

261
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,500
I can still fight harder.

262
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,791
I have plenty of room to grow.

263
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
Plenty of room to improve!

264
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,458
I remember.

265
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,083
I remember everything!

266
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,541
[LESYA]
What are you up to?

267
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,750
Well, if you wanna know,
come over here and find out.

268
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,916
I will grant this wish.

269
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,041
Uh... that's unbelievable.

270
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,458
In my former life,

271
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,875
I never found a weapon
that could withstand my prana!

272
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,625
And I would imagine
that's still true today!

273
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,166
Aah!

274
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,833
How much prana do you have?

275
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,583
I've heard about American excess
but this is ridiculous!

276
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,500
You gonna make this
a contest or not?

277
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,083
Find your courage.
Set your heart and soul ablaze!

278
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,666
I know you can do it, Satsuki!

279
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,583
Listen, calm down
and take a deep breath.

280
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
You're psyching
yourself out right now.

281
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,250
Don't lose heart,
just stay focused on your goal.

282
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,541
Come on!

283
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,958
Adamant!

284
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,708
Aah!

285
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,500
[panting]

286
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,875
[gasps]

287
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
Well. I can't fight
if my weapon's gone, can I?

288
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,625
Darn. You did it.

289
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,583
Wow! You never give up,

290
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,333
and I adore that
about you.

291
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,666
-You're the cutest thing
-[muffled] Sofie, stop it!

292
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,208
-I've ever seen.
-Seriously, I can't breathe!

293
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,750
Go on. Pick it up.

294
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,375
Fight me.

295
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,500
That's what you came here for,
so grab your sword and do it.

296
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,583
I have to kill you,
I have no choice.

297
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,083
There is not another way!

298
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,083
I do understand.
It's your brother, right?

299
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,500
If you don't kill me,

300
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,291
then those jerks at the Russian
Branch will kill him.

301
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,000
Let me help you, Lesya.

302
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,333
Listen up.

303
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,708
If I rescue him from the Terror,
you'll be free.

304
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,125
I'll make sure you're released
from her grasp forever.

305
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,458
I promise.

306
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,583
Such a thing is not possible.

307
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,583
I know what it's like

308
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,958
to not be able to save
someone you care about.

309
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
I went through it
when I lost my parents.

310
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
I never want anyone
to have to feel that way.

311
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,250
Please, let me help you.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,708
You are kind.

313
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,833
You would risk everything
to save my brother.

314
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,500
Elena!

315
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
I know why you think
you're doing this,

316
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,166
but you've been deceived
by the Russian Terror.

317
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,458
I swear to you!

318
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,208
She lied!
You don't have a brother.

319
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,416
You never did.

320
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Of course I have a brother.

321
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,958
How dare you say this!

322
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,500
The director of the institution
told me the truth.

323
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,333
When you were discovered,

324
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,833
you were alone on
a dark, snowy night.

325
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,791
[baby crying]

326
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,625
[SHIZUNO]
You couldn't have been more

327
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,041
than a few weeks old at most.
Think about it.

328
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,583
If you did have a brother,
where did he come from?

329
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,250
Cause he wasn't with you.

330
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,625
I've had enough
of your stupid lies!

331
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,916
Okay. You should at least
be able to tell me his name.

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,791
Yes, of course,
my brother's name is...

333
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,250
His name is--

334
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,958
My brother's name is...

335
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,125
Can you tell us
what he looks like then?

336
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,458
Or his age?

337
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,541
His age...

338
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,750
No.

339
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,458
No, I--

340
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't.

341
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,291
Why not?
Why not?!

342
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,916
Because what Miss Urushibara
said is absolutely true.

343
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,375
It's pleasure to meet you both.

344
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,250
I am Kondrat, of the venerable
Russian branch.

345
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,583
I don't understand
what's going on here.

346
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,500
My brother, he is real.

347
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,625
On the contrary, my dear.

348
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,875
I planted it in you,
this idea of a brother.

349
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,875
But unfortunately,
that's all he is.

350
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,291
An idea.

351
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,833
The only thing harder
than inventing a false reality

352
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,041
is maintaining it.

353
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,041
All it takes to destroy
the illusion

354
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,458
is one wrong thought,

355
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,083
and all those years of hard work
are down the drain.

356
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,875
[MOROHA]
What kind of monster are you?

357
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,916
How could you do this?

358
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,541
[LESYA]
I understand.

359
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,833
I have no one,
and I never did.

360
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,208
If I were to die,

361
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,333
what difference could it
possibly make?

362
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,708
Lesya!

363
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,375
Hahaha!
Don't waste your time!

364
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,250
I'm afraid no one's voice

365
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,916
will be able to reach her now.

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
Where the hell's it going?

367
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,833
Oh, don't worry.
I am right behind you!

368
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,666
Hahaha!

369
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
Isn't this a neat trick?

370
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,375
If their spirit is broken
badly enough,

371
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,416
I can even occupy
a Savior's body!

372
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,208
Now, let us get back
to the battle,

373
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,916
although I imagine fighting me

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,916
and protecting Urushibara
at the same time

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,166
will prove to be
a bit of a challenge!

376
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,583
Good work, Lesya.

377
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,375
Haimura cannot kill you.
Nicely done.

378
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,083
[laughing]

379
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,041
[gasps]

380
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
Excellent!

381
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,750
Your prana is
impressive to be sure!

382
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,750
But let's see how you do
when I absorb it

383
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,166
and use it against you!

384
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,958
No. you can't
lie asleep any longer.

385
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,166
I remember
everything from my past!

386
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,750
Come, Salatiga! Now!

387
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,083
Ha!

388
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,500
Let's go!

389
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,000
But how?

390
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Saturn!

391
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,833
Aah!

392
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,125
Don't say it doesn't
matter if you die,

393
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,583
because of course it does!

394
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,208
If you need a reason to live
then I'll be that reason,

395
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,666
because your life matters to me!

396
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,125
I will be your family.

397
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,458
Now and forever.

398
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,916
[crying]

399
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,000
[KONDRAT screaming]

400
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,541
Please! My eyes!
They burn! Help!

401
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,333
Funny...

402
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,083
I do not seem
to recall telling you

403
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,666
that you could touch my foot.

404
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,916
Aah!

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,166
The one thing
I will not tolerate is failure!

406
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Well, Mister Haimura,

407
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,916
you have freed Elena
from my grasp

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,958
by burning away
her possessed mind.

409
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,625
You're quite a clever boy.

410
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,875
How did you know?

411
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,625
Ah, just a hunch.

412
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,666
I thought you might
make a run for it.

413
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,625
This is something that
I need to do on my own.

414
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,125
[MOROHA]
You sure are stubborn.

415
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,541
I am very sorry.

416
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,666
And while I thank you for
everything you've done for me,

417
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,666
I have to leave now.

418
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,041
Please just let me go.

419
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,375
Sleep. Near Death.

420
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,875
[phone ringing]

421
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, I'm certainly surprised
to hear from you, chap.

422
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,208
I take it this isn't
just a courtesy call?

423
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,416
[MOROHA]
I need your advice, Edward.

424
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,666
I'm gonna go to war
with the Russian branch.

425
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,000
But I'm going alone.

426
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,416
[MAYA]
Elena Arshavina.

427
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,541
May your life be reformed
into a shining beacon,

428
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,250
like Holy Sword Salatiga.

429
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,666
May you be reborn
with peace and happiness.

430
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,458
A nice prayer, indeed.

431
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,791
But one that led Moroha
into starting a war.

432
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,791
[ELENA] Moroha, how many
children would you like to have?

433
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,541
[MOROHA] That's not
what I meant by family.

434
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,416
[ELENA] Next time,
"Journey to Siberia."

435
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,666
[BOTH] Carve through
this tumultuous life!
