1
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,291
He beat the Russian Terror,
and he'll be coming home soon.

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,916
Hooray!
Moroha's coming home!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,791
[laughing]

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,208
This is the greatest
news of all time!

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,041
[MARI] Apparently, he's going
to stay there tonight,

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,625
so he wants me
to use Transportal

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,541
to bring him back
tomorrow morning.

8
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,333
Tomorrow?
Oh, boo!

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,708
Shit, man!

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,000
That punk is probably
having a threesome

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,291
with some hot
Russian babes right now.

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,250
He's so lucky!

13
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,583
[SOPHIE]
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

14
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,791
Even a warrior needs a break
every now and then.

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,333
[MOMOCHI] I'm bummed. I really
wanted to go to Russia too!

16
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,791
What's wrong?

17
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,333
I'm just sad cause I thought
I was gonna see him tonight

19
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,083
and now I have to wait
until tomorrow morning!

20
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,291
Oh, don't worry.

21
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,458
He'll be home
before you know it, okay?

22
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,125
Yeah. Sure.

23
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,333
[ANGELA] This has been
a long time coming,

24
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,000
but the day I give you a piece
of my mind is finally here!

25
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,416
I hope you're proud
of yourself, you imbecile!

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,333
Thanks to your damned curse

27
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,375
they have to redraw
the entire map of Russia!

28
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,708
Perhaps they should
change the name

29
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,083
to "The Kingdom of Haimura!"

30
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,416
I bet that'd make you happy!

31
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,125
Please stop yelling. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,833
Hey, Angela.

33
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,416
Maybe it's time
to quit the screaming

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,625
and let it go already.

35
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,291
Da, when you consider
that nobody died,

36
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,125
I'd say things could have
turned out much worse.

37
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,041
Are boys even
allowed in here?

38
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,958
Obviously, they do
things differently

39
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,250
here in Russia, you idiot.

40
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,291
You'd know that
if you weren't such a boob!

41
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,333
All right.

42
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,041
Okay, simmer down you two.

43
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,541
Besides, what harm could
a little coed time do?

44
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,916
You've seen each other naked.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,416
--Uh--
--Uh...

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,166
[ALL]
What did you just say?!

47
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,958
Uh, it's not what--

48
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,333
Well, Angela,

49
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,541
I certainly hope
you have an explanation.

50
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,666
During our time together,
things got a bit complicated.

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,166
He saw my tits.

52
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,333
Oh, life, you are so cruel.

53
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,083
Why would my
belovable big brother

54
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,916
do such a thing
with this British wench?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,041
Give me a freaking break!
We've already been through this,

56
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,166
he's not your big brother,
he's mine!

57
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,416
That is incorrecting.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,125
Grr. He's not your big brother,
and you know it!

59
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,666
--[arguing continues]
--It's completely nuts.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,625
They've been like this
since we left Japan.

61
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,083
Okay, fine!

62
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,791
I challenge you
to a duel

63
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,666
to prove who the real
little sister is!

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,125
I am accepting!

65
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,583
[MOROHA] Why are
they doing this?

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,291
Neither of them are
really my sister anyway.

67
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,791
[ANGELA] These idiots.
He's so not worth it.

68
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,166
Whichever one of us
lasts the longest wins!

69
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,416
Understooding!

70
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,375
[groaning]

71
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,375
[growling]

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,916
Oh, it's way too hot for me!

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm getting out of here.

74
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,375
Yeah, me too.

75
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm dizzy.

76
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,833
I should go,
or I'll pass out.

77
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:50,875
[MOROHA]
Wait...

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,000
I won't quit!
I have the strength

79
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,041
of my love for Moroha
to keep me going!

80
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,000
There is no heat as hot as
the passion I feel for him!

81
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,333
Oh, you think so?

82
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,916
[laughs]

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,333
Let's see how long you last when
we throw in some power squats!

84
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,375
I'll be doing you one better!

85
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,791
[grunting]

86
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,291
You're going down!

87
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,333
[MOROHA] Guys, this is
getting kinda silly.

88
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,833
[BOTH] You stay out
of this, big brother!

89
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,333
Naturally.

90
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,666
Come on.
Let's see who's stronger!

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,375
All right.

92
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208
--[SATSUKI] Ready go!
--Now they're arm wrestling.

93
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,250
Whatever, I have
absolutely no intention

94
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,375
of getting involved
with these morons.

95
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,000
Just give up!

96
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
Nothing you can do
will change the truth!

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,166
He's mine!

98
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,875
He's not, and he never will be!

99
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,875
Now you die!

100
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,541
[laughing]

101
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,208
And now I die.

102
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
I win and you lose,

103
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,291
which means I'm
the real little sister

104
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,291
and you're not!

105
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,958
Hahaha--

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,166
Whoa, are you guys okay?

107
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,750
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

108
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,625
Spelling!

109
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,250
Child of ice, child of snow,

110
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,583
lend me your chill. Render them
frozen with your fierce breath!

111
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,916
White Breath!

112
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,833
[shivering]

113
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,250
Achoo!

114
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,541
Frozen.
My whole body is ice.

115
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,250
Here. Some Russian tea
will warm you up.

116
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,208
That's sweet of you.

117
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,333
They're complete morons.
Right?

118
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,791
Wait just a second!

119
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,541
Shizuno's the one
who sat back and watched

120
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,541
while we did this to ourselves,
where'd she run off to?

121
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,416
Achoo!

122
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Eww, that's so gross!

123
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,166
[MOROHA sighs]

124
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,791
[SHIZUNO]
Are you chilly?

125
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,250
I figured the cold air would do
you some good after that sauna.

126
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,541
[MOROHA]
I'm fine.

127
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,708
Just getting used to being
around people again.

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,875
It was just Angela and me
for such a long time.

129
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,000
So, does that explain why
you two saw each other naked?

130
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,875
Look, nothing happened.

131
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,291
I'm only giving you a hard time.

132
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,625
Angela and I kept in touch
the entire trip.

133
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
Right.
Of course you did.

134
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,583
Just promise you won't run off

135
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,875
on some dangerous
adventure again.

136
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,083
We've always been together
and always will be,

137
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,125
in our past lives
and in this one.

138
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,250
Since you brought up
our past lives.

139
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
Well, when I was gone

140
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,166
I had the strangest dream.

141
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,333
About what?

142
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,333
I don't remember
it very clearly.

143
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,875
But there was this monster
I'd never seen before.

144
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,833
I don't know what it was,
but it would take away

145
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,166
what mattered most to me
in my past lives.

146
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,208
Worst dream I've ever had.

147
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,583
But Moroha,

148
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,500
what if it wasn't
about your past?

149
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,000
What if it was a premonition

150
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,166
of events destined
to happen in your future?

151
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,833
That can't be.
No way.

152
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,541
I hope.

153
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,375
[ANDO] All right.
I understand.

154
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,708
Please tell Mr. Haimura
hello for me.

155
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,000
Was that Mari on the line?

156
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,208
Yes.

157
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
She said that the Russia group

158
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,916
--will be back soon.
--And now in other news,

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
In the western
Ural Mountains of Russia...

160
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,416
[EDWARD] I wish I could've
been there to see it for myself.

161
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,541
Curse versus curse.

162
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,333
I bet it was
as stunning to behold

163
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,916
as the famous Battle of Kursk.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,791
Don't be ridiculous, Edward,

165
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,375
thanks to this
the Russian government--

166
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,500
[groaning]

167
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,416
Ando!

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,875
Oh, no.

169
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,666
This means there's going
to be a Metaphysical attack!

170
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,166
[YURI] Wow!

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,416
[YURI]
So, this is Transportal!

172
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,375
It's been a pleasure, Moroha.
Thank you for everything.

173
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,333
The pleasure was all mine.
Glad I was able to help.

174
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,291
Come on slowpoke,
it's Time to go!

175
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,750
Yeah! Right!

176
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,000
[phone ringing]

177
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,041
[gasps]

178
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,541
I'm back!

179
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
I'm so glad you're home!

180
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,041
Welcome back, Satsuki.

181
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,541
Well, at least it's not
freezing here.

182
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,541
[laughing]

183
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,083
That was a speeding homecoming.

184
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,375
Moroha!

185
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,083
That was a strange sensation.

186
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,416
I must say the transportal
is quite useful.

187
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,583
Satsuki! Where is he?
What happened?

188
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,000
That's a good question.

189
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,250
[KATYA] Once again,
you're saving the day!

190
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,541
[MOROHA] I'm the one who
brought down Russia's rank S.

191
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,833
There's no way I'm not
gonna help out.

192
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,291
We appreciate this,

193
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,041
but the Russian Terror's
learned her lesson,

194
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,375
and should be back soon.

195
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,500
It's coming.

196
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,666
Katya, can you handle support?

197
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,208
Of course.

198
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,458
Yuri and I will do our best
to keep that thing stationary!

199
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,833
Right behind you!

200
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,333
[whimpering]

201
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,000
He promised me.

202
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,083
But he still didn't come back!

203
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,500
[crying]

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,416
Moroha had to stay.

205
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,916
But he said since
everybody was worried about us,

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,166
we should get home
as soon as possible.

207
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,458
Mmm...

208
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,666
He also told me
that he missed you most of all.

209
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,583
Ever since he went away
to Russia to fight the Terror

210
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,000
I've been sleeping
in our room alone.

211
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,541
And every morning when I wake up
my eyes are red from crying.

212
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,416
Well then,

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,750
the only solution for that

214
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,666
is for you to come sleep
in my room tonight.

215
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,000
I won't lie to you.

216
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,416
I probably won't make
a good substitute for him.

217
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,166
What is going on?

218
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,750
We don't know
much at this point.

219
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,166
Moroha defeated the Metaphysical
that appeared in Russia,

220
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,333
that much I'm sure of.

221
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
As far as Ando goes...

222
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,958
who knows?

223
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,875
His pain is getting
worse by the minute.

224
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,458
He passed out and now
he's completely unconscious.

225
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,625
Anyway, do me a favor
and be on standby, all right?

226
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,083
[ANGELA] What for?
I haven't seen you in weeks,

227
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,666
can't I just come home?

228
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,208
It's just a tiny precaution.

229
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,916
I have a bad feeling
about this, Angela.

230
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,250
[dog barking]

231
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,583
No reason to be
down in the dumps.

232
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,750
Come tomorrow,

233
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,041
--big brother will be back--
--[knocking]

234
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,125
What are you doing here?

235
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,416
I just figured you girls
might be lonely tonight.

236
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,791
So I thought I'd come over
and keep you company.

237
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,083
As far as I'm concerned,

238
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,250
--the more the merrier!
--[knocking]

239
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,791
This isn't up to my usual
standard of class and elegance--

240
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,083
Ugh!

241
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,541
But maybe if I slum it here
with you tonight,

242
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,750
I'll learn what it's like
to be a regular type person.

243
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,458
Well, excuse me

244
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,541
--for being lower middle class!
--[knocking]

245
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,875
Hmm?

246
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,250
You ladies have
room for one more?

247
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,250
Oh wow!
You too, Sophie?

248
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,500
I have arrived.

249
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,500
Ah, life.

250
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,000
Hi!

251
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
Uh...

252
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,916
How about I keep
you sexy ladies occupied

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,541
with a little X-rated
adult entertainment?

254
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,541
--[girls chatting]
--Um...

255
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,875
I'm just worried
we're violating the fire code.

256
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,333
It'll be a huge deal!

257
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,291
We're having
a cool pajama party!

258
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,791
Guys!
No way!

259
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Satsuki, aren't you going
to be a polite host

260
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,875
and offer your guests
some refreshments?

261
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,416
I hear that in Japan,

262
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
girls always eating chippings
of potatoes at pajama party,

263
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,250
so I brought bag.

264
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,583
And I brought us
some fizzy cola, of course!

265
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Yes, of course.

266
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,291
A perfect drink for a barbaric
American palate such as yours!

[girls chatting]

268
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,958
Okay, fine! Let's have
a stupid pajama party!

269
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,458
You heard that, right?

270
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,708
Oh, yeah. Sure did.

271
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,750
I heard it loud and clear.

272
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait. Why are you
all acting so weird?

273

--[chuckling]
--It is obvious.

274
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,833
As you know, in Japan when
girl has proper pajama party

275
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,500
she must also have pillow fight.

276
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,250
Huh-- Aah!

277
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,583
Oh, my.

278
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,708
I'm sorry, I guess don't
know my own strength.

You are so dead!

No.
But still.

to be lonely anymore.

really be embarrassed

at your age.

00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,083
[gasps]

327
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,291
[MAN] What in the name
of everything holy?

328
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,125
[people talking]

329
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,333
What the hell is that?

330
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,625
[people yelling]

331
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,125
[roars]

332
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,583
[alarm blaring]

333
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,958
[MARI]
Attention all students.

334
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,333
If you are not a Striker,

335
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,875
take refuge immediately
in arena number one.

336
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,250
This is not a drill.

337
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,833
I repeat.
If you are not a Striker,

338
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,416
take refuge immediately...

339
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,208
This must have something to do
with that nightmare last night.

340
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,666
I have a feeling
this isn't a coincidence

341
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,625
this is happening
while Moroha's gone.

342
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,666
Nobody panic!

343
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,291
Haimura might not be here
to fight off that monster,

344
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,458
but the rest of the Strikers
sure as hell are!

345
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,083
We can do it, girls!

346
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,166
[cheering]

347
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,666
[JIN]
All right, Strikers, listen up.

348
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,333
We have never
seen a metaphysical

349
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,750
this powerful before.

350
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,583
Chief Suruga
has been hospitalized

351
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,958
and Haimura's still in Russia,

352
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,166
so until backup arrives,
we're on our own!

353
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,541
Sir Edward of British HQ
is en route.

354
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,041
But we don't know
when he'll arrive exactly.

355
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,708
And we don't know
if it'll be too late.

356
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,458
The principal is taking refuge

357
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,625
so she can prepare
to use Transportal.

358
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,791
We have to hold this beast off

359
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,083
until Transportal
can be used again!

360
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,916
We cannot falter, Strikers!

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,625
If we do, our people
will surely suffer.

362
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,250
Make no mistake, everyone:

363
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,375
the fate of Akane Academy hinges
on the outcome of this battle,

364
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,500
which is why
every single one of us

365
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,375
has to push our abilities beyond
what we thought was possible!

366
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,666
Haimura can have his vodka,
cold weather and hot ladies.

367
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,083
I'm in!

368
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,916
This Academy make me realize

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,791
the kind of person
I wanting to be.

370
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,833
I will fight to the death
to protect it.

371
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,875
And I'll be right behind you!

372
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,708
Pardon me, Captain.

373
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,041
On behalf of my colleagues
at British HQ,

374
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,416
I would like to fight with you.
Will you oblige me?

375
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,416
Absolutely.

376
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,291
Then I am at your service, sir.

377
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,875
Henceforth I shall be under
the command of the Strikers!

378
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,916
All right then, people!
Sound off!

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,416
[ALL]
We are the swords of salvation!

380
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,875
Tell me, Strikers, who do the
swords of salvation fight for?

381
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,000
[ALL] We fight
for all innocent people

382
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,166
who can't stand up
and fight for themselves!

383
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,666
We strike for our peace,
our lives, and our justice!

384
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,625
Oh man, that thing's huge!

385
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,833
The good news is
it's not a multi-headed type

386
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,833
and not nearly as big as the one
we fought over summer vacation.

387
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,583
You guys!
We can do this without Haimura!

388
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,916
We don't have a choice.

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,791
Otherwise, Akane Academy
is history and so are we!

390
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,333
I hope they can hold it off
long enough to give me a chance!

391
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,125
It just smiled?

392
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,625
Everybody, spread out!

393
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,250
The Metaphysical knows
what our plan is!

394
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,750
No. The ambush.

395
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,125
That's unbelievable.

396
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,333
Where the heck did it go?

397
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,125
Hush!

398
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,625
Stand fast.

399
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
[yelling]

400
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's move, now!

401
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,500
Everyone out of the forest
on the double!

402
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,583
Run fast!
Go! Go! Go!

403
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,750
[roars]

404
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,750
Hit it with
your highest level, Strikers!

405
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,708
Take the bastard out!

406
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,416
[SHIZUNO]
Bright White Frost!

407
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,333
[TOKIKO]
Incinerate!

408
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,500
[KAMEKICHI]
Lightning!

409
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,083
[gasps]

410
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,166
No way.

411
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,791
The Metaphysical just used
a super high-speed

412
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,583
dispel counter-chant.

413
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,625
In other words, that monster
has the ability

414
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,875
to nullify any spell
we throw its way.

415
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,750
But that's impossible!

416
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,208
Hold on.

417
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,416
If it can nullify our spells
then what else can it do?

418
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,333
[SHIZUNO] Even worse.
It can use them against us.

419
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,166
[TOKIKO] Everyone!
Defensive magic!

[KATYA]
What is going on?

422
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,958
I remember everything.

423
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,541
[grunts]

424
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,333
It always shows up
again and again,

425
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,000
even after I'm reborn
into a new era.

426
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,583
This monster--
No, this demon

427
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,541
that takes from me everything
I love.

428
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,708
It ends now!

429
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,583
[MAYA] It was like hellfire,
engulfing all things.

430
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,916
Burning away all our hopes
before our very eyes.

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,375
Our hope that Moroha would
safely return to us once again.

432
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,333
Our hope we would survive.

433
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,875
Our hope that night would be
washed out by day

434
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,125
and that, in the end,
good would triumph over evil.

435
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,708
But all we could do was look on
in utter hopelessness.

436
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,708
[growling]

437
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,125
[MOROHA]
Last episode.

00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,000
"Surpass Two Lives."

439
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,500
Young man, carve through
this tumultuous life!
