[MAYA]
It's been almost a month since

2
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,291
Moroha and Sir Edward
went toe to toe.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,833
Summer's already here,
and summer time means one thing:

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,791
Summer Vacation!

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,833
Listen up, everyone.

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,416
This year's summer
training camp will be held

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,708
on a small island in
Yamaguchi Prefecture.

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,708
[JIN]
I hope you guys are ready!

9
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,291
Moroha, what kinda stuff

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,958
do you think we'll be doing
at training camp?

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,583
Maybe something like--

12
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,416
--Ah!
--[TOKIKO giggles]

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,250
Hey, Moroha! You better cancel
your plans after school!

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,833
I, Vice Captain Tokiko Hanzaki,
hereby order you to report to me

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,375
immediately after
the bell rings,

16
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,208
because you and I are
going shopping together!

17
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,291
Uh?

18
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,458
[TOKIKO]
I'll get you something

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,958
extra sexy to wear to the beach!

20
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,416
A tiny little Speedo!

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,166
Then we can see what you're
really packing down there!

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,250
Cool! Will you buy me
a tiny Speedo, too?

23
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,416
[JIN]
Mmm.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,458
[murmuring]

25
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,666
[JIN]
Since we'll be at the beach,

26
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,583
I know you'll be
tempted to play around,

27
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,000
but I ask that you
please keep your focus.

28
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,375
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

29
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,458
As if I didn't have
enough floozies

30
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,791
going after my man.

31
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,083
An even scarier one
just joined the competition,

32
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,000
but I've got
a trick up my sleeve!

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,583
Yep. I'll buy the sexiest
bikini they've ever seen!

34

--[SATSUKI laughing]
--Mama, Mama, look!

35

That girl is really weird!

36

[MOM]
It's not nice to stare.

37
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,041
[TADANORI]
Since you're going on vacation

38
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,458
with Mr. Haimura, and since
you have to look presentable,

39
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,291
you need clothes! Ha.

40
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,458
[SHIZUNO]
What is all this?

41
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,875
[TADANORI]
I've hired the best designers

42
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,083
and stylists money can buy!

43
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,625
If you're the sexiest girl
at the beach,

44
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,333
the boy will be
putty in your hands!

45
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,500
This is too much! Ah!

46
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,958
You could even
come back pregnant,

47
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,583
and the family
wouldn't be upset at all!

48
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,125
I'm sure bearing a child
as a student is quite stressful,

49
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,750
but don't worry.
I'll make all the necessary...

50
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,541
Please, don't do this
to me, brother!

I guess this store will do.

53
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,333
[MOROHA]
Hey. What's up, Momo?

54
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,166
Oh, hi. [whimpers]

55
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,750
If you want my opinion,

56
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,500
I think you'd
look better in the bikini.

57
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,333
[MOMOCHI]
Oh! Nobody asked you!

58
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,000
And besides, my boobs
don't look right in a bikini.

59
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
They're way too small!

60
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,666
Hey, that's not true.

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,958
You're really cute.
You'd look awesome.

00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,083
Ah!

00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,208
No! Everybody says
I'm so flat chested,

64
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,875
I'm practically
an ironing board!

65

They say I look like
a little boy!

66
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,375
Anybody who'd
say that to you is a jerk.

00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,333
No! Ah!

Yes. It's transportal,

also called
the "Gate of Passage."

used once a day.

and show everyone
your new swimsuit?

buying a swimsuit,

saw my choice of outfit,

would be less indecent. Jerk.

00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,916
[ALL]
Right.

161
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,541
I know what I'm gonna pick!

162
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
Yeah, what's that?

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,375
--[SATSUKI] Hmm.
--[MOMOCHI whimpers]

164
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,666
There's only one challenge
I feel like taking on.

165
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,583
And that's to run
faster than you, Momo!

166
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,750
[MOMOCHI]
Huh?

167
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,458
Um. That's nice,

168
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,833
but I'm really not interested
in participating.

169
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,000
Mmm. [chuckles]

170
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,833
Not interested in participating?

171
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,125
Or could it be that
you're afraid of

172
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,958
having to eat my dust, girlie?

173
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,750
[SATSUKI]
Hmm.

174
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,666
No, not really.

175
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,375
It just feels like
I'd be picking on you.

176
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,375
[SATSUKI]
Uh-- uh...

177
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,791
I'm not so full of myself
I think I can take you down

178
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,000
without proper preparation,

179
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,208
but don't you think
"picking on me"

180
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
is taking things
a little bit too far?

181
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,125
If I were a more
sensitive person,

182
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,250
I think I'd cry! [crying]

183
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,291
[sighs] Okay.
Fine, we can race.

184
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,333
[MOROHA]
Ready?

185
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,458
Set!

186
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,458
Go!

187
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
[SATSUKI]
Ah!

188
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,541
[MOROHA]
Are you okay?

189
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,041
Uh. Yeah, one more!

190
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,916
[SATSUKI]
Ha!

191
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,083
Ugh!

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,125
Grr.

[SATSUKI screams]

194
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,583
Run, girls, run!

195
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,958
It's shocking
she doesn't realize

196
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,625
she has no chance
of beating her.

197
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,708
She knows next to nothing
about running.

198
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,416
It would take her a lifetime
to be as fast as Momo,

199
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
and I'm not sure even
that'd be enough!

Don't be such a bore.

204
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,250
It's your nickname.
I've just decided!

205
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,583
You're like a Jack-in-the-Box.

206
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
You never quite know
what's going to pop out!

207

You dog.

208
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
Speaking of popping out,

209
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,416
you're on the beach
with those beautiful ladies

210
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,916
while I'm stuck here working!

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,125
Hold on a second.
How do you know where I am?

212
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[EDWARD]
I'm shagging your Principal.

213
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,041
Just kidding!

214
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
She told me about it when
I called to make arrangements

215
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,791
for the Head Six meeting
being about you.

216
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,958
What? About me?

217
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,375
Care to hear more, mate?

218
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,791

Quite cheeky!

224
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,708
Who was that?

225
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,291
[MOROHA]
Sir Edward.

226
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,000
He's endorsing me for Rank S,

227
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,541
but someone named
the Russian Terror is opposed.

228
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,375
I don't know who that is,
or why I'm supposed to care.

229
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,125
She's a very dangerous person!

230
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,458
What?

231
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,833
[MAYA]
The Russian Terror!

232
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,250
She's one of the Head Six!

233
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,708
Mari says she's
the most lethal one of them all.

234
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,291
I'm to blame for this.

235
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,875
I never should have let
Sir Edward know

236
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,958
about your true power
in the first place.

237

[MOROHA]
Shizuno, it's not your fault.

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,583
Huh.

[SATSUKI whimpering]

00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,875
Oh yeah, I feel great.

242
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,541
[MAYA]
Today, after

243
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,625
a hard day of training,

244
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,333
we split watermelons for fun!

245
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,291
Of course, Moroha had to shout,
"What a waste,"

246
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,125
and then proceeded to eat until
he was sick to his stomach!

247
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,041
Then we tested our courage,

248
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,833
but really,
nothing scared as much as

249
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,541
Captain Jin
and his super freaky,

250
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,916
intense Vice Captain, Tokiko.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,416
He caught her trying to sneak

252
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,208
into Moroha's bed
after lights-out,

253
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,291
so he punished her by
squeezing her head super hard!

254
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,166
I'm so happy that she's made
so many new friends.

255
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,416
[MAYA]
Which reminds me,

256
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,333
Moroha and Satsuki
are sneaking out at night.

257
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,833
They think we don't know,
but, boy, are they wrong.

258
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,916
I need you.

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,208
Help me.

260
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,708
I wanna run faster than Momo,

261
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,541
and you're the only one
who can teach me.

262
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,625
Maybe you should
pick something else.

263
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,250
No!
I've already committed to this.

264
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,833
I can't just give up now!

265
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,541
I'm really sorry to bother you.

266
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,333
I don't want to be
the annoying little sister

267
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,958
who always gets in your way
in this life, too!

268
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,291
Hey! It's okay.

269
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,583
You need to calm down, Satsuki.

270
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,416
This is not calm!

271
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,625
But it's nice.
We've never done this before.

272
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,958
[MOROHA]
I remember.

273
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,625
My memory of being Fraga

274
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,166
is that I was always
off fighting somewhere,

275
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,666
always on some new adventure.

276
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,916
Yeah, and I was always
left behind waiting for you.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,708
Right.

278
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,083
It was because I didn't want to
endanger you on the battlefield.

279
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,458
Or was it because you didn't
trust me to handle myself?

280
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,750
No way.

281
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,125
I always knew
your hidden potential,

282
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,750
but if it ever came out,
well, you would have never

283
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,291
been able to walk away
from the battlefield.

284
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,583
You'd have stayed there fighting
for the rest of your days,

285
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,291
and that's not
what I call a life.

286
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,916
I didn't want that for you.

287
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,916
I didn't know.

288
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,041
[MOROHA]
When I fought Sir Edward,

289
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,250
I knew I could
leave Angela to you.

290
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,291
I had no doubt
you could handle her.

291
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,833
[gasps]

292
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,125
[MOROHA]
Does that make me pathetic?

293
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,833
No, not at all. Thank you.

294
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,708
Do me a favor.

295
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,750
Give up on trying
to beat Momo in a race,

296
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,416
'cause it's not gonna happen.

297
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,583
It's not your fault.
It's because she's a Shirogane,

298
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,083
or to put it a different way,
speed is her special power.

299
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,458
And since Celerity
is essentially all she has,

300
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,708
she focuses
on her gift constantly.

301
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,958
Even if you could
get faster than her,

302
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,916
that would take
a lotta work,

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,458
I wouldn't want you
to rub it in her face

304
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,666
and take away her pride.

305
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,625
Okay.

306
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
That makes sense.

307
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,708
You have your own
strong qualities, Satsuki.

308
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,375
If you focus on
developing those, then--

309
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,750
[SATSUKI]
Answer me this.

310
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,250
When the Strikers are training,

311
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,000
how come Momo
is always your partner?

312
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,583
Oh, well, because...

313
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,666
nobody else on the team
can keep up with our Celerity,

314
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,291
so we're a good match
in that way.

315
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,375
I don't care about her
stupid Celerity.

316
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,041
I just don't want anybody
besides me to be your partner!

317
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,375
[MOROHA]
Look...

318
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,375
there's no guarantee

But don't worry, bro.
The silver lining here is

that since you're

00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,416
to cheer me up
and help me understand.

477
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,666
She said the "me" now
and the "me" from before

478
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,958
are the same person
with the same soul.

479
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,875
The old me is what fuels
the light that I give off now,

480
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,166
the new me.

481
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,833
The Principle is pretty awesome!

482
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,416
[MAYA]
She's the best!

483
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,416
Who the hell do you losers think
paid for all of these fireworks?

484
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,125
Totally not cool leavin' me

485
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,625
out on the fun, people.
Totally lame ass!

[giggles]

487
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,583
You're like a bunch of
old timey geezers

488
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,333
telling stories
around the camp fire!

489
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,791
If you really wanna
heat things up,

490
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,541
how about a little sexy time?

491
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,458
Sorry we left you out, butt boy!

492

[KAMEKICHI]
Hey! Don't do that!

493
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,833
It's not safe!

494
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:36,958
Ah!

495
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,333
Moroha, come on!

496
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,500
Let's knock boots!
Yeah! Let's bone, now!

497
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,958
Uh, we have a child with us.

498
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,291
Maybe turn down the volume
a little on the nymphomania?

499
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,500
Oh, get over it!

500
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,958
Maybe it's time she learned
a thing or two

501
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,291
about the birds and the bees?

502
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,583
Ah!

503
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,000

where you point that thing!

00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,125
One crazy, super slutty slut
dead ahead!

507
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,875
Time for some payback!

You bitches have
just declared war.

511
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,833
You want a piece of me?

512
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,125
I'll light you on fire
and burn you to a crisp!

--[GIRLS scream]
--[TOKIKO] Spelling!

514
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,750
Hey, Butt Boy, there are still
about half the fireworks left,

515
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,875
so grab some
and light them up, ASAP!

516
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,083
Sounds really fun.
I'll get right on that.

517
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
[MOROHA]
Shizuno?

518
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,958
I was worried about you.

519
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,125
Sorry. It took me a little while
to change into this.

520
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,125
I hope you like it.

521
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,416
My brother made me
bring this outfit with me.

522
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,875
But maybe it's
not such a bad thing?

523
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,958
Well, I gotta go.

524
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,333
I have an important errand
to run for Kamee.

525
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,833
You said we were gonna
spend some time alone together.

526
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,833
Do you like my robe?

527
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,833
It's a Yukata.
Know what that means?

528
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,333
It means I'm not wearing
a bra under here.

529
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,083
Stop it, okay?

530
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,125
[MOROHA]
If you wanna hang out with me,

531
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,500
that we can do.

[singing in Japanese]

534
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,083
By the way,
sorry I haven't been able

535
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,208
to spend much time with you.

536
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,500
That's okay.
Training camp was more fun

537
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,541
than I thought it would be.

538
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,916
It was fun.
Yeah, you know?

539
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,500
I was thinking.

540
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,416
One day I'd like to come back
here with my aunt and uncle.

541
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,291
Well, not to impose,

542
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,291
but if you do manage it,
I hope you'll invite me.

Oh. You mean
with my family here?

544

Yes. It'd be really great
to meet them.

Hold on. Are you saying
you wanna meet my family?

546
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,458
[giggles] Eventually, yes,
I would like that a lot.

Tomorrow's our last day here,

Fireworks in the night sky,

lighting up and burning out
all too soon

00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,625
just like a summer day

passing by before
you have a chance to enjoy it.

At that very moment,

another light was
about to be extinguished

Beneath the vast darkness
of the water

loomed something
extremely dangerous.
