1
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:06,903
Marry me.

2
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,293
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

3
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:27,638
You're looking particularly smug.

4
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:28,995
Smug, me?

5
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,222
I look smug?

6
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:36,222
I assume something good must have happened?

7
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:39,367
Uh! Well, I guess so, yeah.

8
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,402
At least I think so.

9
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,110
You know, you're just like an open book.

10
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:47,858
Hey, Rhan.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,153
What do you think finding happiness...

12
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:52,186
What do you think it's all about?

13
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:55,676
To begin with,

14
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,286
happiness means different things to different people.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,339
To some, it means having food on their table.

16
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:04,065
To others, it means books on their shelf.

17
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:08,503
Some believe that doing one's very best
is what truly matters in the long run.

18
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,640
And some are only content if they
can overcome hurdles in their path.

19
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:17,013
Some take joy in witnessing and
nourishing the happiness of others.

20
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:20,160
While some, sadly, revel in others' sorrow.

21
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:25,540
I gotta say, I didn't expect such a long
response. You're giving me a joy thesis.

22
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:30,701
That said, most creatures do
not realize this about themselves.

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,393
They do not know what, in
actuality, will bring them happiness.

24
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:39,290
Yet, they still talk about their desire to
find happiness as if they knew where to look.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,638
One day, such people may learn
that they were blessed all along,

26
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,415
but they will never realize it when they're happy.

27
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:50,413
In my opinion, to know the truth, one
must simply listen to their own heart.

28
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,064
Make sense?

29
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:55,982
I hope that successfully answered your
question and made you somewhat happy.

30
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,608
Oh, god. Why?

31
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,205
Why is everything so awkward?

32
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:43,473
How did I pursue him like I did up until yesterday?

33
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,246
This is so hard!

34
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,260
Maybe I could ask to kiss him again.

35
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:52,483
Would he accept this time?

36
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:56,847
Yeah, surely he would. I mean, he did propose to me.

37
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,124
We're like a couple now... Probably.

38
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,243
I'll give it a shot later.

39
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,013
Yeah, I'm gonna go for it.

40
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,422
I have a plan!

41
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,444
What was that look about?

42
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:16,245
Oh, quit blushing! You're embarrassing yourself!

43
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,754
So, listen.

44
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,472
What is it?

45
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:24,693
About yesterday's, um, well, you-know-what.

46
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,085
Oh, yeah.

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,571
I, um...

48
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,388
I just want you to know I fully intend to keep my promise.

49
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,430
I'll spend the rest of my life
making you happ... Oh! There you are!

50
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,844
Look left, you crazy kids!

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,054
It's okay, Willem.

52
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:44,457
I made a promise to you, too. Remember?

53
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,285
I'll be with you forever.

54
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,847
Hey Boss,

55
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,180
where do you want me to put this?

56
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,253
Oh, over there is fine.

57
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,597
Sorry to keep you waiting, but I'm here now.

58
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,069
What is this?

59
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,977
Supposedly, they're the forces
of the visitor Elq Hrqstn.

60
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,098
Elq Hrqstn?

61
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,495
According to legend, this
world was once home to gods.

62
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,194
But they attacked the humans in a bid to wipe them out.

63
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,909
The one at the top is Carminelake,

64
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,751
the middle one is Jadenail,

65
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,992
and the last one is, uh...

66
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,699
He's Eboncandle.

67
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:26,472
Yeah, that's the one!

68
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:29,138
Ha, ha, ha! Of course you'd know.

69
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,222
Of course.

70
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,513
After all, I did personally fight him.

71
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:33,440
Uh?

72
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,721
Come on, Willem you're tryin' too hard.
You don't have to be like that with us.

73
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:38,634
It's true.

74
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,972
I should have asked them what happened with the war.

75
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,107
After we took each other out, I mean.

76
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:50,847
Yeah, whatever you say, friend, but for
now, let me lead you to your destination.

77
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,055
Hey! Look, Pops is here!

78
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:11,251
Sis, hurry! Pops has finally made it back to us!

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,508
Can I say "I'm home" now?

80
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,339
Doesn't feel right anymore.

81
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:26,930
Ship sailing the starry sky.

82
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,263
Light in the palm of the hand.

83
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,430
Clay doll walking on all fours.

84
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,834
Something feels weird.

85
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,313
It's like I'm being called.

86
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,162
Underground?

87
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:38,583
What is it?

88
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:41,138
Everything okay there, missy?

89
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,738
What is that thing?!

90
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:02,513
It's a monster!

91
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:05,148
Yes, that much is fairly obvious, you fool!

92
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,847
What I want to know is what the-- Come back here!

93
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,774
Oh, no.

94
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,388
Why did you leave? This is so terrifying.

95
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,416
Timere?

96
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,400
Son of a--

97
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,975
Looks like we fell pretty far.

98
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,763
Apparently, there's been a massive cave below Gomag City,

99
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,305
but what is it for?

100
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:33,354
Chtholly...?

101
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:50,305
Willem, why are you...?

102
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,388
What were you thinking?!

103
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,930
You know your body can't handle this kind of strain!

104
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,100
I'm fine, don't worry about it.

105
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,413
Hey, you all right?

106
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:02,163
Think so.

107
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,805
I have a feeling we need to get out of here, and fast.

108
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:05,797
Yeah, but how?

109
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:10,307
This looks to be the underground ruins where
that idiotic officer sent out a squad to scavenge.

110
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,869
You see all those markers that lead down that way?

111
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:15,055
Hopefully, they'll direct us to the exit.

112
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,812
Course, that's assuming the
path hasn't caved in somewhere.

113
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,450
Not long ago, I could've just flown out.

114
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,388
There's no need to worry, I promise to keep you safe.

115
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,763
Well, I'd rather be the one keeping you safe.

116
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:33,180
I understand, but guardians have the right

117
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,926
as well as the duty to guard their charges, don't they?

118
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,739
Who are you calling your charge?

119
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,714
I thought I was your, uh, you know, your um...

120
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,651
Oh, you know.

121
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:48,036
Oh... What is that stench?

122
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,133
Oh, yep. Found it.

123
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,230
These soldiers are the excavations squad, right?

124
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,712
Yeah, poor guys. This was terrible.

125
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:01,365
These wounds are definitely a timere's work.
You can tell because of how savage they are.

126
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,358
That thing's hangin' around nearby, we're in big trouble.

127
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:05,627
Timere.

128
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,262
One of the beasts that destroyed the world.

129
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,058
If they were really humans all along,

130
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,833
then the monster that did this...

131
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,617
Elq.

132
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,743
Hm?

133
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,105
Yes, yes.

134
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:31,888
You want me to go there?

135
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:32,376
All right, then.

136
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,002
Chtholly?

137
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:33,638
What's wrong?

138
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:34,287
I'm on my way.

139
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:35,305
Hey! Chtholly!

140
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,650
Missy! Oh, come on!

141
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,496
Do you know what she's doing?

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,517
Men, prepare to take off immediately!

143
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,323
We can't, sir!

144
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,770
Shaft Three's been done in.

145
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,673
I am a veteran First-Grade Technical Officer!

146
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,305
I can fix that in my sleep!

147
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,847
I'm telling you to be ready to leave once I'm done!

148
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,055
Is that understood?!

149
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,055
Right! Yes, sir!

150
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,638
Hey! Welcome back!

151
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,846
Same to you.

152
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:57,915
Where's Rhan?

153
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,041
She's keeping watch over there.

154
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,767
Can we call it a day now? Haven't we taken out enough?

155
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,802
You really believe that's possible?

156
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,578
No, I just want this nightmare
to end before more people get hurt.

157
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:11,685
Won't be over for a while, though.

158
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,472
Worried about Chtholly, Grick, and that T.O...

159
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,441
I hope they get back in one piece.

160
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:19,138
Don't be stupid!

161
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:20,722
Leave that crap behind!

162
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,930
But I went to all the trouble to find it!

163
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:26,138
We don't have time for this nonsense,
our lives are far more important!

164
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:27,722
I'm not saying they're not...

165
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:30,035
"Our lives are far more important," huh?

166
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,921
Wise words, I'd say.

167
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,132
Not that I actually understand them.

168
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,047
Get some rest. I bet you're tired.

169
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:41,604
I'll take care of this.

170
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,497
Got a job to do.

171
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,930
Lives to guard, futures to save, and all that.

172
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,814
Same old, same old, but I love it!

173
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,159
Chtholly, wait!

174
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,022
Chtholly!

175
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:09,254
Please, stop. What are you doing?

176
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,473
Willem, is that you?

177
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,655
Yes, it's me, but you need to focus right now.

178
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,138
Don't lose sight of yourself!

179
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,282
Uh! Will ya look at that.

180
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:25,420
Amazing. I never thought I'd get the chance to
see two of these within a borgle's short lifespan.

181
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:27,605
Oh, ouch!

182
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:29,947
Poor thing's been stabbed clean through.

183
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,992
Is that Seniorious's hex?

184
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:33,431
Is who what?

185
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:37,864
You know how fairy tales have curses that
can turn people into frogs and things like that?

186
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,803
This is the same idea.

187
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,755
A curse that can turn anyone,
god or immortal, into a corpse.

188
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:48,789
A world-altering ability exclusive
to the holy sword Seniorious.

189
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:53,868
If it was used on her, then there's no
way she was just an ordinary little girl.

190
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:57,222
Uh?

191
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,240
Chtholly?

192
00:11:58,638 --> 00:11:59,575
Chtholly!

193
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,030
We gotta go!

194
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,347
Grab a hold of your girl and run!

195
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:05,491
I got it.

196
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:07,378
Listen to me, Chtholly, we're leaving.

197
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:09,494
Please, try to stay in control of yourself.

198
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:10,927
Hang on.

199
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,275
I won't let anything happen to you.

200
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,388
Willem...

201
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,305
I'm here, right here.

202
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,160
I'll always be here with you!

203
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,888
I can't... I don't know...

204
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:21,937
Chtholly?

205
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,576
Talk to me. What is it?

206
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,406
This way! Willem hurry, we're running out of time!

207
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:27,053
Chtholly?

208
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,847
Please, Chtholly, say something!

209
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,946
Chtholly!

210
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:37,847
Ah! Damn it, even the pressure valves are blown!

211
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,097
What, they are?

212
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,598
Is the ship done for then?

213
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:41,722
Hell, no!

214
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:43,442
I am not about to die here!

215
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,416
I want you to bring me every last
thing I could use to repair this bastard!

216
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,436
I never managed to bring happiness
to anyone in my entire life.

217
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,906
That's why I wanted... wanted to make you girls...

218
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,934
All I wanted to do was to make you happy.

219
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,511
But I just... I...

220
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,246
Why does everything always have to end up like this?

221
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,015
You okay, missy?

222
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:17,940
I just want to be in there with them.

223
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,513
Of course you do.

224
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,984
I'm sure that would make them feel a lot better.

225
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,233
I'm sorry. I wish I could've
done more than just bring her back.

226
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:32,661
It's all right. This wasn't anyone's
fault, so there isn't anyone to blame.

227
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:36,055
We all knew the ice we were walking on with her was thin.

228
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,880
Where am I?

229
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,957
I'm doing this for one reason.

230
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,357
It's for my love.

231
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,305
For love?

232
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:01,268
For that reason alone, I have come to slay a god.

233
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:05,513
And yes, I fully realize I'm here on a fool's errand.

234
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,180
But I have no other choice.

235
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:11,430
This man, he's the walking definition of stupid.

236
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:16,119
So I have to move on these idiotic ideas
before he can think them up for himself.

237
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:20,434
Because, Willem's a complete and utter moron.

238
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,390
Time to say goodbye.

239
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,722
Rest in peace!

240
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:28,082
Uh?

241
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,060
What was that?

242
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:49,263
Welcome back to me, Chtholly.

243
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,527
I do know you. We've met before.

244
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,805
Do you wanna know something?

245
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,256
Because I have something I want you to know!

246
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,553
Tell me.

247
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:04,760
A long, long time ago, a race called
"humanity" was attempting to destroy the world.

248
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:10,848
To prevent the destruction, the Poteaus,
three gods who were watching over the world,

249
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:15,751
decided to lead an army in
order to wipe out all of humanity.

250
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,263
Sadly, they failed.

251
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:24,073
A human brave killed their master before they
could overpower their enemy to save the world.

252
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:27,127
No one could stop the humans now.

253
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:31,508
They turned into beasts and obliterated everything.

254
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,263
I bet you're wondering who their master was.

255
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,469
Her name was Elq Hrqstn!

256
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,097
She was the last of the visitors,

257
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,052
and she died as a child.

258
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:45,046
You're Elq. That's your name, isn't it?

259
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:48,732
Uh-huh, but it is also the name of your soul.

260
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:56,138
Fairies like you are created
from the souls of children

261
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:59,022
who were too young to realize they were dead.

262
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,905
Ever since the day Lillia arrived
and killed me, I've been dreaming.

263
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,638
I dream of being like her,

264
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,462
I dream of being as brave and as strong as her.

265
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:11,772
And I dream of putting my life on the
line and fighting for the people I love.

266
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,605
Is that what I am?

267
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,766
Yes, that is what all Leprechauns are.

268
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,707
What will happen to me, then?

269
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:21,430
You already know, do you not?

270
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:24,304
No dream is able to last forever.

271
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,963
And dreams are so quickly forgotten,

272
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,722
until nothing at all remains of them?

273
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,562
It's all right.

274
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,727
You made it back here to me just in time.

275
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:46,175
Rhan!

276
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:55,013
Thank you. I'm so exhausted.

277
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,513
Would you like to switch out
with Nephren for a short time?

278
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:00,057
Nah, she's kinda preoccupied.

279
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:06,247
Besides, I figure we've probably taken
out all the timere in the area by now.

280
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:11,388
By the way, Nopht, how is your body currently feeling?

281
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,373
Oh, it's super great
for some crazy reason,

282
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,596
and what's more, Desperatio's doing
everything exactly the way I want, too!

283
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:20,129
Same for me.

284
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:26,180
In which case, could what we're experiencing somehow
be positive effects from that rather dubious massage?

285
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,305
Oh...

286
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,191
Meaning, that man

287
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,261
wasn't simply touching us like
he did for perverted reasons.

288
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,055
Wow, talk about mean.

289
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,315
You really do hate that guy, don't you?

290
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,347
I just don't accept him as readily.

291
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:43,138
It appears that our break time has been cut short.

292
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:44,388
No problem, here.

293
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:48,443
Given the shape I'm in today, I
could take on another 10 or 20, easily!

294
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:51,555
How about a hundred or two, instead?

295
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:54,972
I think that might be a little too much.

296
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:55,861
Is that so?

297
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:57,211
Unfortunate.

298
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,305
Huh?

299
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:00,975
Get ready.

300
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,692
At this point, we must prepare for the very worst.

301
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:07,642
Yep, certainly looks that way.

302
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,781
This whole thing is the very worst.

303
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,555
In the end, I failed to do it.

304
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:15,055
You failed to do what?

305
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:16,275
Talk to her.

306
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,513
I wanted to communicate with Chtholly again.

307
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,485
I'd have even settled for a fight.

308
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:24,630
I was given yet another chance, and I wasted it.

309
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,082
I see.

310
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,101
All right.

311
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,133
Emergency repairs done!

312
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:45,972
Power up the circuits, now!

313
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,086
Roger that.

314
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,885
Powering up the circuits!

315
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,980
Ready and aim!

316
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,263
Fire!

317
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,075
Captain!

318
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,565
Stay back.

319
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,040
We are the only ones who can kill these beasts.

320
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,526
B-But how?

321
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Don't ask.

322
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:22,184
Know this battlefield is ours and kill or be killed
applies to us. This fight is no longer your fight.

323
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,449
Oh god.

324
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:46,926
You hurt yourself protecting us.

325
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,457
Are you all right?

326
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,550
You need to go.

327
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,592
Run.

328
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:02,801
I won't be able to hold them off much longer.

329
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:03,925
Go, now.

330
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:07,712
Three is too damaged for
it to stay on the grid!

331
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,543
Two and six are fine, though!

332
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:10,972
Reroute the load to them!

333
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,072
Oh, for cryin' out loud, I've only ever flown small ships!

334
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,822
Can you give a guy a break?

335
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:26,934
Chtholly.

336
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:29,313
I don't...

337
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,670
I don't know what to say.

338
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,445
You don't?

339
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,042
Maybe that's because you never
really cared that much about her.

340
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,021
Remember how you couldn't stop Lillia from fighting?

341
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:46,060
All you did was use another
wielder of Seniorious as a substitute.

342
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,261
You couldn't keep your promise to Almaria, either.

343
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:52,388
So you made a different promise with this girl instead.

344
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,195
You never really saw Chtholly for who she was,

345
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,791
and you always treated her like a child.

346
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,494
That way you'd have an excuse to discount her.

347
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,159
You're wrong! I wanted her to...

348
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,545
You need to face it.

349
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:06,547
You lied to them.

350
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,039
I will make you happy, Chtholly.

351
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:13,930
I failed.

352
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,812
I fell short of my promise... again.

353
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,197
And now you.

354
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,522
Yet another beast?

355
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:36,942
Welcome, then, but
you should know,

356
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:40,341
right now, I need someone to take some rage out on.

357
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,250
There's barely anything "you" left of you.

358
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,930
Your mind and body have been almost entirely replaced.

359
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:54,048
They've been replaced by my body and mind, naturally.

360
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:58,185
I'm glad you made it here before
you disappeared completely, though.

361
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,263
Your joys, and your sorrows,
oh, and your love for someone.

362
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:03,859
I know you must surely still remember those things,

363
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,280
just a little bit? You do, do you not?

364
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,823
Yes, but only a very little bit.

365
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:12,888
Yay! That must be a relief.

366
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,802
Everything's all right, and you're still Chtholly!

367
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,292
Will... em...

368
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,873
Final Episode: Chtholly.
