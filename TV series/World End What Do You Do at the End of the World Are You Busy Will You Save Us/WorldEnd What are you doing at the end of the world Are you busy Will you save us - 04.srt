1
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,313
Perfect ending.

2
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:38,879
That was so good!

3
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:45,678
That was beautiful.

4
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:47,230
So mature!

5
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,303
Hope I fall in love one day!

6
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,563
Can I assume that wasn't exactly your thing?

7
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,605
Nope. At least not with the lizards.

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,888
There's been no word, if you're still worrying.

9
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:01,547
Hard to believe it's already been a couple of weeks.

10
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,210
Worrying is about all I can do.

11
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,872
Worrying and waiting.

12
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:11,896
At times like these, I find it's best to stay busy,

13
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
don't you agree?

14
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:14,980
That being said, mind doing me a favor?

15
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:16,063
What kind of favor?

16
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,337
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're
order is ready. Sorry to interrupt, sorry!

17
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,396
Wow, that looks amazing.

18
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,240
Thank you so much, master!

19
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,230
I said I was sorry!

20
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:29,043
Please! Don't eat me. Don't eat me!

21
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:32,104
All right, what did you do to him?

22
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:33,929
Nothing! What would I do?!

23
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,480
Not good.

24
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,859
Why they haven't called in a
professional to fix this is beyond me.

25
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:16,304
Guess I can try patching it, though.

26
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,342
Chtholly, will you get me the hammer, please?

27
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:25,093
Chtholly?

28
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,025
Ithea?

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,352
Ren?

30
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:38,396
Chtholly?!

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,563
Ithea?!

32
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:40,666
Ren?!

33
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:43,046
Chtholly! Chtholly!

34
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:44,317
Chtholly!

35
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:48,077
You must accept the truth.

36
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,301
Have you forgotten, Willem?

37
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,105
We sent those three girls off to battle for us.

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,280
You're not going to find them.

39
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,563
They're gone.

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,407
We lost them, Willem.

41
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:04,799
They died.

42
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,108
They're all dead now.

43
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:14,480
These damn nightmares are really starting to get to me.

44
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,451
What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?

45
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:19,537
Uh? I, uh, aha!

46
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:22,129
Look over there, we can finally see it!

47
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,271
Where, where is it?

48
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,146
Woo-hoo! Yes, I can see it!

49
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,021
Corna di Luce!

50
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:39,771
A hop, skip and a jump away, my ass.
It took a full day to get over here.

51
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:48,689
Go figure. Apparently even the disfeatured
can live normal lives in this city.

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,670
It's such a beautiful place!

53
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,652
Tiat had a dream.

54
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,860
It was of somewhere she's never been before,

55
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:03,875
and of specific sights that she's never seen.

56
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:07,227
She also even spoke with someone she's never met.

57
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,500
It was that kind of dream.

58
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:16,267
Drinking milk is not gonna make you
taller immediately. You know that, right?

59
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:18,488
Just 'cause it hasn't happened doesn't mean it won't!

60
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,602
Tiat has been trying to drink
as much milk as she can every day!

61
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,480
I bet she'll just shoot right up!

62
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:26,855
So is that unusual? Sounds like a generic dream.

63
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,355
It's hardly generic.

64
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,938
Apparently, the girls can tell there's a difference.

65
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,480
The moment they wake up,

66
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:35,157
they're aware that the dream they had was a special one.

67
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,927
It's considered a harbinger.

68
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:44,579
All fairies who have the harbinger dream are required
to get a checkup at Corna di Luce's general hospital.

69
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:46,840
Huh?

70
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,831
Have a good day.

71
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,194
What?! Are you kidding me?!

72
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:03,000
That's the clock tower from The Iguana
Bride, the movie that we just watched!

73
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,355
I'm in awe!

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,987
While we're here, are there any sights you wanna see?

75
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:10,237
It's your first time out of Island Sixty-Eight, yeah?

76
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,730
Uh? Thank you, but no.

77
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,996
I did not travel to this island to have fun.

78
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:17,467
I'm here to follow my destiny and
become a great fairy soldier like Chtholly.

79
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,710
Besides, what could I possibly
want to see. I mean, really.

80
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,980
That's what I thought.

81
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,119
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

82
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:34,568
How about while we're on the way to the
hospital, we stop at a few places that look good?

83
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:38,183
Uh! Hm... Well.

84
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:40,256
All right. I guess it's fine.

85
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:44,378
If you're just dying to sightsee that
much, then I don't mind tagging along with you.

86
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:45,421
Me?

87
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,306
Come on! We're wasting time. Let's get going!

88
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:51,091
Yeah, sure thing.

89
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:52,730
Ahh!

90
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,723
Look! Can you even believe it?

91
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:56,668
Can I even believe it's a bench?

92
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,663
They used it in <i>When the Bell Rings Thrice</i> !

93
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:03,021
In that exact spot, the heroine wept
while holding her former lover's tail!

94
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:05,563
Is that another romance movie with lizards?

95
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,230
You haven't heard of it before?!

96
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:11,965
While filming, the actress playing the heroine
actually laid her eggs. It was a really big deal!

97
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,058
Yeah. Sounds like a big deal.

98
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:19,830
Island Eleven's Corna Di Luce happens to be the setting
of a bunch of different films. I mean, of course it is.

99
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:23,373
It's overflowing with history. A jewel in the sky!

100
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:26,578
It's practically a stew pot of legend and adventure!

101
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,678
Did you just call it a stew pot?

102
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,467
That's the staircase from the
famous scene in <i>The Airship Thief</i> ,

103
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,980
where the main couple got in
a fight and clawed each other!

104
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,670
I heard that the shed skin of the
lead actor fetched a fortune at auction.

105
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,049
I wonder who bought it. I'm
so jealous! Talk about lucky!

106
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,117
You sure do love lizards...

107
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:50,473
In <i>Each Scale Is a Symbol of Love</i> , the
heroine and the soldier, covered in scales,

108
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:52,896
smacked their tails right below us in this river!

109
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,223
While filming, the director
made sure there was enough food

110
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,396
for every single person working on set that day!

111
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,521
A million steel bottle flies, can you even imagine that?

112
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:02,611
And did the cast and crew actually eat that much food?

113
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:04,271
Right, very good question.

114
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:06,053
This is fascinating.

115
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,783
Have a good day.

116
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,205
Whoa, this is the lickity café.

117
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,746
It was in <i>Sweet Nest</i> and they did stuff
like those people over there are doing.

118
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,496
I can't believe it's actually happening in
public like that, in the middle of the day.

119
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,313
I don't really understand you,

120
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,388
but I still get the feeling kids
shouldn't be seeing that stuff.

121
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,987
Time's up, Tiat. Gotta go.

122
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,425
Random lizardness calls again.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,955
The Great Sage statue in Fulshter Memorial Plaza!

124
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,746
Oh, is it famous for something?

125
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:44,390
He founded this city a long, long time ago,

126
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:47,688
but this is also the most
popular spot for lovers' rendezvous.

127
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:50,878
Because of that, it appears in
several of my favorite movies.

128
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,673
The fountain's good luck, too.

129
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,413
Legend says if a couple vows
their eternal love to each other

130
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,152
in front of it, they'll be happy
for at least five whole years.

131
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:06,205
If you ask me, that legend is a serious disappointment.

132
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,782
Destroy!

133
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,538
Destroy!

134
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,688
--Destroy! Destroy! --Destroy! Destroy!

135
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,021
Please, I'm begging you.

136
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:14,646
That's all we've got!

137
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,037
Please stop, you don't have to do this!

138
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,230
Cease and desist.

139
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,605
Cease and desist.

140
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,561
Uh. Let's go. C'mon!

141
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,521
Yeah.

142
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:24,567
Move it!

143
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,063
You'll pay for that!

144
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,355
You're under arrest.

145
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,705
No! Damn it!

146
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,822
Are you okay?

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,813
Oh, I'm good. Thank you.

148
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,355
Uh! Hey, put me down! What are you thinking?!

149
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,705
I'm not a baby...!

150
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,385
Of course. I'm sorry.

151
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,022
Was it the Annihilation Knights again?

152
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:47,355
Don't you remember?

153
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:49,847
The stall's owner supported the mayor.

154
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:51,313
What was that?

155
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:55,630
No matter where you go, there are always
people who have too much time on their hands.

156
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:58,026
Whoa, we really have to get moving.

157
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:58,658
Uh!

158
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,788
We don't want to be late, do we?

159
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,238
Punctuality and all that.

160
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,163
The sightseeing ends here! Let's go, Willem.

161
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,718
I'm ready for this!

162
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,980
Wonder if she knows how obvious it is that she's not.

163
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,995
Come on, hurry up, Willem!

164
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:18,556
Coming!

165
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,373
Tiat and Willem Kahmesh, yes?

166
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,021
NyNy told me you'd be here today.

167
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:28,221
Who's NyNy?

168
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:30,455
Oh, you must mean Nygglatho.

169
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,700
I'm prepared to get the checkup started if you are, Tiat.

170
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,921
All right, my dear. You come with me.

171
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:37,771
Uh... Oh, okay.

172
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:44,521
Hey, Tiat.

173
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:45,394
Uh?

174
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:50,116
Looks like our airship back
home isn't until tomorrow evening.

175
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,435
Hm?

176
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,302
We'll have some free time once you're done.

177
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,771
We can probably take an exploratory stroll.

178
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,326
If you want to, that is.

179
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:23,461
Oh, good. There you are.

180
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,271
Now, I've given health checks to several
of the girls from the fairy warehouse before,

181
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:34,387
however, you are the first caretaker other
than NyNy to make the effort to accompany one here.

182
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:35,771
I think it's nice.

183
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,066
Anyway, Tiat will be done shortly.

184
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,361
She's a sweet, responsible girl.

185
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,660
What exactly is this checkup for?

186
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,288
Why do you ask, did NyNy not inform you?

187
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:47,128
Not in detail, no.

188
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:55,848
Well, to start with, not every fairy
has the capability to wield a dug weapon.

189
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:57,413
The power is there, yes,

190
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,375
but it does not awaken in all of the girls.

191
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,601
That must be where the harbinger dream comes in.

192
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,940
It serves to awaken the ability in them.

193
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,273
Exactly.

194
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:12,871
What we do here is tune their bodies to
make sure they grow up healthy and strong,

195
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:16,324
so they can fight one day as proper dug wielders.

196
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,698
Our enemy is very powerful, and our dug weapons precious.

197
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:26,258
Forcing swords onto children when they're
still immature and weak would be pointless.

198
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,758
They're tuned, huh.

199
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:34,771
Tiat's growth is steady and is as we expect of her age.

200
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,591
She has no major health issues to speak of.

201
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:43,795
The only problems are her digestive organs are
struggling to process all the excess milk she drinks,

202
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:47,281
and a few of her teeth are beginning to develop cavities.

203
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,796
I'll tell her to back off the milk.

204
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:53,953
We have to accept that the fairies are unnatural beings.

205
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:59,062
At times, a problem may present itself
that severely affects their bodies.

206
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,952
In the worst cases, they can suffer mental disintegration.

207
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:06,567
Some lose their minds completely.

208
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:12,931
But, in Tiat's case, if you were worried
about her, there's really no reason to be.

209
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,823
That girl is firmly in control of
herself as well as her potential.

210
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,874
To put it simply, she's in great shape.

211
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:21,047
That's certainly a relief to hear.

212
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,641
Uh? Hey.

213
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,268
You all done with your checkup?

214
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:26,172
Mm-hmm!

215
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:29,746
I'll stay the night, and tuning will
begin first thing tomorrow morning!

216
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,730
We'll be finished with everything by noon,

217
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,021
so you can come by and pick her up around then.

218
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,007
Thank you.

219
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,379
Will you be okay?

220
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:40,038
Can you stay overnight by yourself?

221
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:43,230
Ugh, of course I can stay! I will be perfectly fine!

222
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:44,996
Um, will you be okay, though?

223
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:46,646
Where're you gonna stay tonight?

224
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,774
I'll be sleeping at the Guardian Wings Military HQ.

225
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,635
Evidently, they have a resting room for officers like me.

226
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:55,252
What does that mean?

227
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,093
I'm hoping it means I'm pretty
high up in the pecking order.

228
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:01,263
Oh, just wait.

229
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:05,158
I'll be all grown up tomorrow!
I've never been this excited before!

230
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,896
Unfortunately, tuning won't make you any taller.

231
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,727
Aw! What?! No, I was counting on some height.

232
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,480
Try to hang in there anyway.

233
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:14,855
We'll see you tomorrow.

234
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,348
Take care of our girl.

235
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,926
She will be all grown up tomorrow.

236
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,079
Wow.

237
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,834
She doesn't really know.

238
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,547
How could she?

239
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,943
Becoming a soldier, going off into battle so young.

240
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:39,895
They're forced to grow up too fast.

241
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,188
It's not fair.

242
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,697
If you'll follow me, Technical Officer Willem.

243
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,843
Whoa, technical officers actually
do rank high in the pecking order.

244
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,605
You're welcome to use this room while you're staying here.

245
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:58,471
Goodnight, sir.

246
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,639
Oh, one moment.

247
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,659
Sir?

248
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:05,845
You haven't by chance heard anything about the
battle on Island Fifteen? They were facing the timere?

249
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,031
No, sir. We've had no word, yet.

250
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,763
I see. Sorry to keep you. You may go.

251
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:12,707
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,763
So much for getting a good night's sleep.

253
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:30,084
I think this bed was actually too comfortable.

254
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,249
Might as well go for a walk.

255
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,391
I'm supposed to go sightseeing with Tiat later.

256
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:45,555
I could go ahead and plan the route.

257
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,955
Thanks for nothing, Corna di Luce.

258
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,540
See, I told you this was bad.

259
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,688
Let's patch it up for now before it gets worse.

260
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,813
And how do you propose we do that?

261
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,705
Do you have a ladder that tall, because I sure do not.

262
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,802
Right, you have a good point.

263
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:15,928
Only one thing to do. We'll just have to
build a ladder with whatever we can find.

264
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,827
Sorry, are you all right?

265
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,867
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

266
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,690
All right, then.

267
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,281
No, um, wait a second!

268
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:36,230
For what? I thought you said not to worry about it, so...?

269
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:40,063
No, it's not that. I wanted to say I
was the one to blame for running into you.

270
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,638
I'm keeping my blade sheathed.

271
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:42,582
Okay.

272
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,411
Very nice of you to say.

273
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:45,871
Hold on, your blade is what?

274
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,474
I wonder if you could help me.

275
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,438
I have an important request I
need to ask of Officer Limeskin.

276
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,593
Do you know if there's any way I could see him?

277
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:55,914
Officer Limeskin?

278
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,368
I hate to tell you this, but that giant lizard isn't here.

279
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,886
He's off fighting somewhere.

280
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,768
Can you at least tell me when he'll be coming back?

281
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,746
No, but I sincerely wish I could.

282
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,288
They put up a damn magic field,

283
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:11,936
uh, they put up a barrier
around the battlefield for privacy.

284
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,373
We can't communicate.

285
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:13,794
You're sure?

286
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,688
Yes, We have to send word.

287
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:16,898
This is confirmed?

288
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:19,163
You're sure it's about the battle with the timere?

289
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,139
Wait!

290
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,465
Tell me what happened!

291
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,105
I can't, it's classified.

292
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:33,007
The information I've been given can
only be circulated on a regulated channel.

293
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,330
Pay attention, and try that again.

294
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,746
I'm Officer Willem Kmetsh.

295
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,396
U-Uh! Forgive me, sir.

296
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,872
The dug weapons, the fairy soldiers.

297
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:44,146
Both the dug weapons and the wielders are under my care.

298
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,395
I should know, I have the right to
know all the data pertaining to them,

299
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,521
 and the news about the battles they take part in.

300
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,438
This is an order.

301
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,381
I want you to tell me everything you know!

302
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,621
What happened out there?!

303
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:56,405
Sir.

304
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,980
I just received an official update from Fleet One.

305
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:02,408
The information is regarding the
results of the battle on Island Fifteen.

306
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,266
The defense of the island.

307
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,499
The defense has failed.

308
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,085
If you'll excuse me, sir.

309
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,951
What's wrong? What did he say?

310
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:24,830
What is going on? Are you all right, sir?

311
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,863
Hello? Hello?

312
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,688
Hello? Can you hear what I'm saying, sir?

313
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,691
Oh, please answer me!

314
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,675
The other day you made sweets
for the little ones, remember?

315
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:40,804
That's what I want.

316
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,942
Can you make me butter cake, maybe?

317
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:48,601
Sir, um, if you'd only speak to me,

318
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:50,700
perhaps I could help you somehow.

319
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:53,561
What?! Really?!

320
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,455
We just received it from General Command HQ.

321
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,522
How many casualties?

322
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:58,948
What about survivors?

323
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,396
Fleet One of the second Division has returned.

324
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,546
We've received an accurate casualty report!

325
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,417
Send medics, just in case!

326
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,730
I think it would be best

327
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,938
if we send word as soon as possible.

328
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:14,580
Agreed. A certain someone's heart is
probably jumping out of his chest right now.

329
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:15,352
But...

330
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,105
Given the circumstances,

331
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:23,063
I'll allow you to use the communication crystals.

332
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:24,110
See?

333
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,703
We've even got the big bad boss's permission.

334
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:29,630
Huh?

335
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,646
But when you use a communication crystal,

336
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,688
the other person can see us, too.

337
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,501
And I'm covered in mud.

338
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
I haven't even taken a bath, yet.

339
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,938
Don't worry about that. You're perfect as you are.

340
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:47,761
Uh?

341
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:51,033
Am not. Plus, I'm afraid it would be kind of rude.

342
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,282
I'm just not mentally ready.

343
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:16,563
You're okay!

344
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,021
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

345
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:33,896
What is this?

346
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
What's going on?!

347
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,891
Ow, that's hurting. I can't breathe.

348
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,355
Seriously, I can't breathe!

349
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,975
Did he pop up out of nowhere, or was that just me?

350
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,938
I'm not sure, my eyes could not keep up with him.

351
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,188
Perhaps he used a secret, lost art?

352
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:49,538
This is why I said I it would be
best to send word as soon as possible.

353
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:55,390
Yes, you did, but admit it. Like the rest of us,
you never expected to find Willem this broken up.

354
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:56,923
No, you're right.

355
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,538
Are you even listening to me?!

356
00:20:58,563 --> 00:20:59,938
Let me go!

357
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:04,505
I mean, this is bizarre, especially
considering he usually likes to play things cool.

358
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,146
Well, he's pretty cute when he tries to play cool,

359
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,905
but that doesn't really suit him, either.

360
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:13,438
Ha! Regardless, I was expecting him
to be far less emotional, you know?

361
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:17,730
This is just how Willem is,
hyper focused and hyper intense.

362
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,867
He needs to be looked after, so he won't get hurt.

363
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:25,110
Yeah. That makes perfect sense. I
totally get where you're coming from.

364
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,278
What do you think, Chtholly?

365
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:31,146
I think you should finish your
stupid conversation and come help me!

366
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:35,665
Do you? Because I feel like we should
let him embrace you until he's satisfied.

367
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:38,855
No! Don't do it. My spine
will break, I'll suffocate,

368
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,438
or I'll die of embarrassment before that happens!

369
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:46,946
I dunno, if you can yell like that, I seriously
doubt we need to worry too much about you suffocating.

370
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:51,299
Please, don't worry.

371
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,702
We're all right here.

372
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,748
I promise we're not going anywhere.

373
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,206
Ren.

374
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:01,313
Mmhmm.

375
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:04,384
Ithea.

376
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:05,678
Hey, what's up?

377
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:06,904
And then...

378
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:09,478
...Chtholly.

379
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,186
Seriously, let me go already.

380
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:12,787
My heart can't take any more!

381
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:25,132
Things are gettin' a lil' messy.

382
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,553
Next Episode: from dawn till dusk.
