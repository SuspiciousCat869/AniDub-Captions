1
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,620
I feel like I must know you.

2
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,351
It's been a while, hasn't it?

3
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,523
Forgive me.

4
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,863
Seems it's a bit too long.

5
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,626
I can't quite put a name to your face anymore.

6
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:51,848
Tell me.

7
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,761
You wanted to fight them.

8
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,314
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:58,707
I believed that was the only way I could help people.

10
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,061
I fought so I could protect what was important.

11
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,651
The truth is, though, I was being delusional.

12
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,071
I never protected anything.

13
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:11,672
I let it all slip through my fingers.

14
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:14,530
What I'm doing now doesn't actually matter.

15
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,217
Nothing is going to change.

16
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:19,396
How many times will I have to suffer through this lesson?

17
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,780
All I know...

18
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:25,510
All I've ever really known is to fight.

19
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,655
What am I doing here?

20
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:29,962
I wish I knew.

21
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,880
You! Stabilize the ship, and do it now!

22
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:14,538
In case you haven't noticed, I've got my hands full!

23
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,238
Attention, everyone on board!

24
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,696
The bridge and power circuits are top priority.

25
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:20,530
Defend them at all costs.

26
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,321
The ship will crash otherwise.

27
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,469
Grit your teeth and fight, soldiers!

28
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,253
Yeah, that's easy for you to say!

29
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,155
Oh, God!

30
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,613
Get off! No!

31
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,280
Thanks! Just in time!

32
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:44,946
Stay back.

33
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,321
Wait. You sure you're okay?

34
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,762
We can fight with you!

35
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:50,321
Do what I said.

36
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,932
Stay back. This is what I'm here for.

37
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,855
Come on! There's no end to them!

38
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:16,488
That said, my sword is
performing better than it ever has.

39
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:19,611
I guess the T.O.'s skills must
be the real deal, after all.

40
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:22,544
My body's in incredible shape, too.

41
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:24,399
Historia and I can do this.

42
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:26,946
Oh, no!

43
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,355
Hey. You all right?

44
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,770
What in the world did you just do?

45
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,085
Save you. How's it look up there?

46
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,921
Nopht and Nephren? Are they still fighting, too?

47
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,205
I saw Nopht not very long ago.

48
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,692
And, yes, as far as I know she's still fighting.

49
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:14,367
Nephren, though, I haven't seen in a while.

50
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:18,014
I can only assume she must be in the
hold guarding the people trapped there.

51
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:29,489
No.

52
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,414
How did you get that kind of wound?

53
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,819
What have you been doing?

54
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,744
I've been... fighting.

55
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,677
Whether in the past, or now.

56
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,050
Fighting... is the only thing I've ever been good for.

57
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:49,602
The only thing I've... been good at.

58
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,418
Not you, too.

59
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,413
Even you had to go and die.

60
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,497
I still don't get what you meant by that line.

61
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,620
The "our lives are more important" thing?

62
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,906
And if they are, why?

63
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,914
Wonder how the girls are doing. Hope they're okay.

64
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,010
Got any idea how long I've been out?

65
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,163
Oh, not terribly long.

66
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:43,109
A couple of minutes at most.

67
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,602
That's not too bad.

68
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,294
You shouldn't be moving around like that.

69
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,060
Not with those injuries.

70
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,664
Does this mean you're worried about me?

71
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,512
I simply would prefer it if you did not commit suicide.

72
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,698
Or use my friend as an excuse.

73
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,986
Understood. I'll try not to.

74
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:05,398
You're awfully strong, aren't you?

75
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:08,789
Even unarmed, you can hold your own against timere.

76
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,986
Suppose so.

77
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,958
Were all humans like you?

78
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:14,825
Was "ridiculously strong" a common attribute?

79
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:16,747
It wasn't.

80
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,770
I was because... I used to be a brave.

81
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:22,914
I was special, one of the chosen warriors.

82
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:25,314
We took out enemies to save people.

83
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,080
Being a brave was a dream of mine.

84
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,705
So I trained in sword and hand-to-hand combat.

85
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,947
I even learned how to tune carillons.

86
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:37,495
I gained as much strength as a
person could through sheer effort.

87
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,276
But it wasn't enough.

88
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,251
Whatever "strength" I had was useless.

89
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:46,575
I couldn't save who I cared about.

90
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:48,747
Not Almaria.

91
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,489
Not Lillia.

92
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:53,770
Not Chtholly.

93
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:56,814
Doubtful.

94
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,722
Winning in battle is not the only way to save people.

95
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:00,881
Sit tight here.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,314
Just for a little while.

97
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:06,007
Generating more venenum now would be suicidal.

98
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,608
And you don't like that.

99
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,381
Say what you will.

100
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,999
You were a source of salvation for Chtholly,

101
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,769
even if you can't see it.

102
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,705
Hey.

103
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,406
What?

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,965
I need a favor.

105
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,372
It'll be the last one.

106
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:48,436
No way!

107
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:49,888
Oh, please?

108
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,869
I think I made a promise to him.

109
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,784
It was a promise that he wouldn't have to fight anymore.

110
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,664
And I... I would take on the rest of his battles.

111
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,247
I would fight them for him.

112
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,817
No means no, and I said no!

113
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,276
I also need to tell him something.

114
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,511
I have to go.

115
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,454
No matter what?

116
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,789
No matter what.

117
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:18,952
But, you'll disappear entirely if you go back there again.

118
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,455
I don't mean just your memories.
Your most important feelings will go!

119
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:23,580
All of it.

120
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,959
All of you will be gone forever!

121
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,310
I don't want to let that happen.

122
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,539
Sounds awful. But letting things end this way?

123
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,012
To me, that would be worse than anything.

124
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,464
Chtholly...

125
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,386
Please say yes.

126
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,670
Let me go.

127
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,765
One last time.

128
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,553
Let me go back to him.

129
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:09,709
She's been hit!

130
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:10,883
Damn it!

131
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,372
...thing's gonna pay!

132
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,580
Get the bastard! Keep her safe at all costs!

133
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:16,598
I'll get this side!

134
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,563
I'm over here!

135
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:25,247
Get back.

136
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:44,539
What's wrong?

137
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,799
We gotta help her!

138
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,115
Damn you. Get off!

139
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:53,822
Go away! Get off!

140
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,381
Get off, get off, get off!

141
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,145
Will you go away?!

142
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,680
We've regained control of the main rotor.

143
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,040
Good work, soldier!

144
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:10,214
We've lost altitude-control
wings three through five.

145
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,555
Seven is done for, too.

146
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,164
What?! Agh, you!

147
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:14,247
You need to fix this!

148
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,789
Oh, fine. I will. Now! Listen to me!

149
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:20,167
We're leaving this area at top speed!

150
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:24,205
All hands, grab on to something
so you don't get thrown off!

151
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,484
It's our girl!

152
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,368
Hold tight.

153
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,323
Comin' to get you.

154
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,084
Don't...

155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,804
Please stay away.

156
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,705
It's too late.

157
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,332
The Gate's opening.

158
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,938
I... I...

159
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,655
I can't hold it off...

160
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,883
You just hang in there, missy!

161
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,742
And hurry up, toad, grab her!

162
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:00,615
Ren!

163
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,332
Willem?

164
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,718
Yes! It's me!

165
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:36,113
You're okay!

166
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:37,191
I think--

167
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:41,039
I think I maybe managed to finally save someone.

168
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:41,914
Huh...

169
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,856
Hold on.

170
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,311
I'll pull you up now.

171
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,080
Willem...

172
00:12:56,164 --> 00:12:57,612
Please, don't say it.

173
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,813
I generated too much venenum.

174
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,382
It's too late.

175
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,437
I'll figure something out!

176
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:05,789
The Gate will probably open soon.

177
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,895
If it does, this entire ship will blow.

178
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,863
I said I'll figure it out!

179
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,116
Willem, saving people is my job.

180
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,522
It's the job of all Leprechauns.

181
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,846
Ren, what are you--?

182
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,387
It's all right.

183
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:27,740
Don't worry.

184
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,520
You've already saved us plenty of times.

185
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,895
So please, you have to let me go.

186
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,509
Don't say that.

187
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,751
Ren, I can't let you go.

188
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,175
This isn't right.

189
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,023
I can't... Ren!

190
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,330
Okay, this is real bad.

191
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:21,535
It's almost funny how much I can't move now.

192
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:30,535
Hey. What are you...?

193
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,288
Don't be stupid!

194
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,663
If you can get up, then you
need to hurry and hide somewhere!

195
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,372
Chtholly!

196
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:56,095
What am I gonna do with him?

197
00:14:57,432 --> 00:15:00,501
Please stop, Chtholly! Come back!

198
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,282
We'll handle the fighting, even your share.

199
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:07,383
You don't have to fight anymore, so please, don't do it!

200
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:10,104
You're free to pursue your happiness now.

201
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:12,766
So go grab it, and don't let go.

202
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,404
Be happy for us!

203
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,653
Otherwise, we'll never be able to live with ourselves!

204
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,248
You're wrong.

205
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,414
I can't find happiness.

206
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:25,478
Meaning there's really no reason for me to pursue it.

207
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:29,639
How can one pursue what they already have?

208
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,241
Why would I try?

209
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,807
Don't you understand?

210
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,554
I'm the happiest girl in the world.

211
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,080
Books burning down.

212
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,455
Snake swimming in the flames.

213
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,497
Crumbling silver moon.

214
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,080
Princesses fighting to the death.

215
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,539
Lies of the dead. Big bell ringing.

216
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,789
Pillar of milk pouring...

217
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,859
Ribbon drifting in the sky.

218
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,901
Chtholly. Hang in there!

219
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,584
I'll save her if it kills me.

220
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,671
Chtholly...?

221
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,003
We swore never to part.

222
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,964
With our vow, came euphoria.

223
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,238
We swore to be together forever.

224
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:51,372
With our vow, came peace.

225
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:54,671
My love for him was undeniable.

226
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,661
What she meant to me was undeniable.

227
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,229
There was no greater happiness.

228
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:05,535
There was no greater joy.

229
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,647
Yet, he offered more.

230
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,415
I promised to make her happy.

231
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:15,336
And I delighted in it.

232
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:18,205
And I-- I was comforted.

233
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,872
The gifts of love and bliss he presented
to me were unlike anything I'd ever known.

234
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:26,122
She granted me more than I ever believed possible.

235
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:27,664
But I...

236
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,304
My life became his, and his mine.

237
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,240
He blessed me with his world.

238
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:36,164
There is no joy ever known that can compare with my own.

239
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,029
Will... em.

240
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,396
Thank you so much.

241
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:46,927
You goddamn fool.

242
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,606
I'll never get used to it.

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,179
No matter how often it happens,

244
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:03,651
losing warriors never gets easier.

245
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,414
The struggle within your hearts
must have been the most difficult.

246
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,440
There's no battle more merciless and painful than that.

247
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,713
Well done on staying fighters until the very end.

248
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:23,330
I've never been so angry!

249
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:26,414
I told that girl not to fight
anymore! I said that it was our turn!

250
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:28,080
But no, of course not!

251
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,839
She just couldn't help her stupid self! Damn!

252
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:33,665
Whatever, the happiest girl in the world, my ass!

253
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,050
How could she possibly think
we'd be okay with this situation?!

254
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:40,830
She goes out in a blaze of glory,
and all's well that ends well?

255
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,568
There's nothing well about any of this, okay?!

256
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,461
Nopht, please be quiet.

257
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,376
One's happiness is one's own to define and to decide.

258
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:57,039
Looking down on someone else's decision or trying to
make that choice for them is nothing more than oppression.

259
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,270
Well, then, pardon my oppression-ness!

260
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:02,878
You know.

261
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:07,234
All things equal, if anyone can bestow happiness,

262
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:08,747
it's people like you.

263
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,997
People who will always stay true to
the good within their oppressive natures.

264
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:18,971
It looks like spring is coming.

265
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,524
Five more laps!

266
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,114
Hard work and spirit!

267
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,330
Well, they're certainly full of energy.

268
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,289
Yeah, you can say that again.

269
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:39,204
Apparently, the girls are working hard today.

270
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,804
They sure are.

271
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,232
Although, kinda sad their favorite
older fairies aren't here to help 'em.

272
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:47,876
They might be getting a little too worked up.

273
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,724
This does take me back.

274
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:53,727
Chtholly was just like that, too.

275
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,893
She lost her older sister figure like they did.

276
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:01,443
And she also used her sorrow and loss
as motivation to grow even more powerful.

277
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,715
Ah, the joys of youth.

278
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,332
I don't know. I don't think I could ever do that.

279
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,709
I'm sorry, could you maybe
pretend you didn't see this?

280
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,193
It's not the best example to set.

281
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,308
You know, as the eldest.

282
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:31,269
See what? I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,140
No response at all?

284
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:48,872
My pulse tracing is sure to locate anyone,

285
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:51,541
so long as they're alive, that is.

286
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,247
Come on, now.

287
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,329
Black Agate Swordmaster.

288
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:59,925
Excuse the interruption, Great Sage.

289
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,785
Of course, that's it!

290
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,914
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

291
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:05,789
I didn't mean to frighten you again.

292
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:07,174
Please forgive me!

293
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,299
Listen to that!

294
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:26,747
Poor thing hasn't let go of her
feelings from her past life yet.

295
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,580
She must have a really pure heart.

296
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:31,122
By that, do you mean simple and naive?

297
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,109
That is one way to look at it.

298
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,963
Good evening, sweetheart.

299
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,132
It's so nice to meet you.

300
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,209
So stubborn.

301
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:42,008
Ugh. Here, let me try something.

302
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,892
There we go.

303
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:53,122
See? She got tired and is now silent.

304
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:55,191
That's enough of that...

305
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:00,521
Welcome, little one.

306
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:05,639
Welcome to this fragile, dying world
with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

307
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:07,600
We're happy to have you.
