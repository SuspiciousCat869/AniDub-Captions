1
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:05,414
H'yah!

2
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:18,169
It's so cold.

3
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:24,309
Where'd this come from?

4
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,508
Chtholly? Are you up yet?

5
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,216
Ugh, I'm bored. I'm bored. I'm bored.

6
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:08,841
I'm so bored, bored, bored, bored, bored!

7
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,431
Nopht, stop. Please be quiet.

8
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,870
Come on, I know you've gotta be bored, too, Rhan.

9
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,382
What is that? Ancient book?

10
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,377
Yes, one of yesterday's finds.

11
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:24,098
Are you telling me you can read emnetwiht writing?

12
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:26,231
I can connect the dots between the words.

13
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,891
After that, it's just an educated guess.

14
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,841
Ah. Well?

15
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,053
What are the emnetwihts saying?

16
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:37,888
The human race...

17
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:41,182
should have... never come into being.

18
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:47,149
The visitors were who created
them, and the cost was great.

19
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,727
The gods failed. Blame the gods.

20
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:53,269
They failed us. It was their biggest mistake.

21
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,841
That's crazy.

22
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,860
Remember, this isn't 100%. It's a best guess.

23
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:02,608
Beasts by humans.

24
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,844
Truth unleash.

25
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,550
Oh, this might be the other way around.

26
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:10,909
Humans unleash the beasts,

27
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:15,497
and fill the world with, with the ashen truth.

28
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,027
Oh wow!

29
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,333
Yes, I know. Now, get off me.

30
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:24,145
Sounds to me like your book is talking
about the beasts destroying the surface.

31
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,508
Like a prophecy. Something wild like that.

32
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,788
It's not.

33
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:31,119
This seems to be a fairy tale or a textbook of sorts.

34
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:36,683
I think it's more likely humans created
the beasts in accordance with this idea.

35
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:41,216
At least, that would be the natural
assumption. Yeah, it makes sense.

36
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:43,779
Uh?

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,976
However, it almost seems like...

38
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,433
Who's there?

39
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,671
Hey, I'm looking for the waiting
room for the fleet escort. Is this it?

40
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:00,276
I'm a salvager with your fellow passengers,

41
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,016
the Orlandry Merchant Guild.

42
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,762
Everybody calls me Grick, 'cause it's my name.

43
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:14,141
Chtholly!

44
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:16,503
I'm so happy you're not a ghost!

45
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,925
Oh, Tiat...

46
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,271
Sorry, she hasn't fully recovered from everything yet.

47
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:24,243
Poor thing was out of sorts
the entire time you were broken.

48
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,691
So, please be patient with her outburst.

49
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,039
I was.

50
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,466
I don't know why.

51
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,243
For some reason, I just felt so down.

52
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,050
I see. I also see that you've grown taller.

53
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,108
Hello, Chtholly!

54
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,966
You're all better now, right?

55
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,452
Well, good morning.

56
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:47,733
You feelin' okay?

57
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:50,008
Uh. Uh-huh.

58
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,533
Good morning.

59
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,063
Are you going on a trip?

60
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:55,858
Is that why you're wearing your hat?

61
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,733
Oh, no.

62
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,608
My hair refused to cooperate
today, so I'm trying to hide it.

63
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,800
Anyway, tell me how practice was this morning!

64
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,248
Piece of cake!

65
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,861
Oh, I made me hungry.

66
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,364
That's enough, girls.

67
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,938
Breakfast will be ready when you're ready.

68
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,745
Meaning after you've all washed up.

69
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,671
Yes, ma'am!

70
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,026
All right, let's make our escape now.

71
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,675
Not eating breakfast with us?

72
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,050
Just in case,

73
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,400
I want her to get checked out as soon as possible.

74
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,043
Of course.

75
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:33,018
Um, bye.

76
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:45,208
So you're the survey unit's adviser, then?

77
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,674
That's me.

78
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,306
I figured I should at least come greet
those who hold my life in their hands!

79
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:53,400
Can't hurt to be nice to the ones
in charge of protecting my crew!

80
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,216
That's a weird thing to say.

81
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,343
We look like we're beast fighters?

82
00:05:57,443 --> 00:06:00,345
You can't honestly believe the two of us can protect you.

83
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:03,397
Frankly, no, not at all. It's
still hard for me to accept.

84
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:06,535
Really, it seems as if it's some kind of stupid joke.

85
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,258
But the thing is,

86
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,782
you're here and you've got dug weapons with you.

87
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,475
Matches everything I've heard
about your kind too perfectly.

88
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,591
Whadda they call you again?

89
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:17,898
Leprechauns?

90
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:19,045
That's right.

91
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,183
You sure do know a whole lot.

92
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,983
I have a couple of friends who
keep me pretty well informed.

93
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:27,011
Now. Here, I brought you a token of friendship!

94
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:30,083
You haven't been home in more than a month.

95
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,014
I bet you miss good food.

96
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,341
Picked these up on Island Thirty-One on my way here.

97
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,146
Hope you like meat pies!

98
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:41,403
You can't possibly be serious!

99
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,812
I'll have you know our favor is not so easily bought.

100
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,956
We'll gladly take them.

101
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,116
Rhan, how can you say that?

102
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:52,708
As it turns out, at the moment we
have nothing in particular to do.

103
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:56,662
We could talk to him for a bit.
I think there's no harm in that.

104
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,149
Whatever.

105
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,972
It's fine with me if it's fine with you!

106
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:02,800
Now, then.

107
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,341
"Grick," was it?

108
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:05,484
That's right.

109
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,591
Have you been a salvager very long?

110
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,673
Yeah, I suppose you could say that.

111
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:10,841
Really?

112
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:12,878
Have you ever run into a beast?

113
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:19,198
Huh? Why would you ask that question, you actually
think you can learn something about those things from me?

114
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:20,065
Yes.

115
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:23,410
I want to know more. To start with, what are they?

116
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,745
Where and how were the beasts even born?

117
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,846
Why did they wipe out the emnetwihts on the surface?

118
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,823
You seem to care an awful lot about them.

119
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,318
Yes, while the beasts may threaten your very existence,

120
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:37,190
they are the reason for ours.

121
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:39,710
Isn't it natural to be curious about one's origin?

122
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,866
I would learn a lot more if I could
just bite off a little piece of your flesh.

123
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,370
Please don't.

124
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,383
Nygglatho.

125
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:28,175
Is there anything wrong?

126
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,341
Like with my body, I mean.

127
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,684
Hm. Is there something wrong?

128
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:36,890
Don't worry, I wouldn't call it "wrong."

129
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,881
Thanks for shopping with me.

130
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,008
It was nice.

131
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,298
I appreciate you carrying the stuff back, too.

132
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,675
I also had an errand to run, so don't even mention it.

133
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,133
From what I understand,

134
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:54,341
you've been working at that bakery for quite a while.

135
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:55,860
How did that happen?

136
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,133
The military brass did not like the idea at all,

137
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:02,254
but Nygglatho helped convince them to let me do it.

138
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:05,275
And what do you think, Officer Willem?

139
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,098
How do you feel about us weapons working for money?

140
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:11,798
Is there something wrong with
wanting to be like everyone else?

141
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:16,569
I feel like grown-ups are supposed to ensure
that kids can do whatever they want within reason.

142
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:20,300
As long as it's not dangerous
or plain wrong, it's okay with me.

143
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,212
Thank you!

144
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,383
Oh, I love you so much, Officer Willem!

145
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,606
I've never had a father before,

146
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,832
but you seem like what a father should be.

147
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,291
That's sweet to say.

148
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:34,464
I actually already consider you
girls to be my kids, more or less.

149
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,008
You really do?

150
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:44,103
Hold on, if you're our father, then
what person would that make our mother?

151
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,821
Maybe Nygglatho?

152
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,246
Doesn't seem fair to Chtholly.

153
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,768
All right, time to get going.

154
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,612
I have to start the cooking, now.

155
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:58,592
I gave you the silver test,
and it came up negative.

156
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,778
It did? Wow, okay.

157
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:01,991
What does that mean?

158
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,525
Silver powder has a natural reaction to irregular death.

159
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:09,938
To put it simply, it's a drug we
use to detect the presence of spirits.

160
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:13,063
And since leprechauns are a type of spirit,

161
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:18,320
I was expecting your blood to turn black immediately
after I mixed it together with the silver testing agent.

162
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,899
But there was no reaction at all.

163
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,853
I don't know the reason, but right now,

164
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,677
your body is not scientifically a leprechaun's.

165
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,696
Wait! What are you talking about?

166
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,841
Then, what's happened to my body?!

167
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:34,883
I have no idea.

168
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,800
It's just the only conclusion that I can make, well,

169
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,008
based on the findings.

170
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:42,586
Is that... Is that why my hair is changing?

171
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:48,096
There's the possibility it could
be a side effect of your coma.

172
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:54,621
Nygglatho, what's going to happen to me?

173
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,779
You honestly don't feel anything
wrong with your body?

174
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,770
No, I don't.

175
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,554
I feel perfectly normal.

176
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,946
Well, then. I guess try not to worry about it for now.

177
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,894
Give me time to do a little
more research. I'll figure it out.

178
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,791
And don't get any ideas about dyeing your hair.

179
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,495
I doubt that it's gonna bother Willem.

180
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,568
Why would you say that?!

181
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:24,458
Uh?

182
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,133
Until we get all of this cleared up,

183
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:33,341
I want you to be sure and stay away from your dug weapon.

184
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,604
There's just no telling what might happen.

185
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,563
All right. I can do that.

186
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:43,286
Although, what am I gonna do if I can't wield a sword?

187
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,008
I dunno.

188
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,610
Maybe you can work on getting married instead?

189
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,575
I'm being serious here.

190
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,254
Surely, you realize Willem's
contract will eventually expire.

191
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,489
Of course, we both know how he is.

192
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,970
I'm certain he would stay if we all asked him.

193
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,441
Then, can't we just do that?

194
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,553
Of course not! Asking is way too easy.

195
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,370
Instead, we'll aggressively
remind him that this is his home.

196
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,545
Then, no one will have to ask him at all!

197
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:17,891
And obviously, the best way to make him feel like
this is his home is for him to have a wife and family.

198
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,473
What? Is that how this stuff really works?

199
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,468
That is how this stuff works.

200
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:26,820
Honestly, I was considering volunteering
myself for the job in question, but I thought...

201
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,006
Please don't!

202
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,206
If you did, then...

203
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,711
then I wouldn't stand a chance.

204
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,122
I suppose it's time for you to start fishing.

205
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,708
You better work some magic and hook that man fast.

206
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,163
Don't procrastinate, either.

207
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,281
Otherwise, me or some other
girl will get him before you do.

208
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,709
Time to dig in!

209
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,621
Whoa! It's heaven.

210
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,085
You're a little too good at this stuff, T.O.

211
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,611
What does that mean?

212
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,578
You knew she wouldn't eat it
if you only baked some for her,

213
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:11,196
so you found a way to make
sure she had her cake and ate it.

214
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:13,975
I gotta say, I'm impressed you baked enough for all of us!

215
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:16,419
Pretty good, if I do say so myself.

216
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,884
Hey, Ren. Where is she?

217
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,050
Um, probably her room.

218
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,675
Why, did something happen?

219
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:28,315
No, she just prefers not to eat
sweets in front of anyone else.

220
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,738
Mm-hm. She likes to think she's fancy.

221
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,733
But, it's not as if it bothers her that much.

222
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,998
You should totally take some to her room yourself
and spend some sugary-sweet "quality" time together.

223
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:40,593
Heh.

224
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't make it sound inappropriate.

225
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:47,042
It's just, I dunno.

226
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,691
The other girls look up to me, so I
don't want to look childish in front of them.

227
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,818
And um, from what I've been told,

228
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,422
when I eat stuff like that...

229
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,466
...let's just say that I could ruin my own reputation.

230
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:01,095
With sweets, I kinda go crazy.

231
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,717
What is that look for?

232
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:09,100
You're making a really big deal
out of something that's ridiculous,

233
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,893
which sorta proves that you're still a kid.

234
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,008
Excuse me?!

235
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,550
Shall I also get you some tea?

236
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,020
Well, my lady?

237
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:22,541
Heh.

238
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,341
It smells so delicious.

239
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:29,468
It is.

240
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:30,794
Looks delicious.

241
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,758
Yes, that's because it is.

242
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,041
You sure?

243
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,606
Like, it's okay for me to eat this in front of you?

244
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,550
Do you even need to ask?

245
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,952
Who do you think I baked it for, silly?

246
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,710
I kept my promise.

247
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,096
I did it.

248
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,550
Must've been rough.

249
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:17,649
Yes.

250
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,675
Yes!

251
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,035
It was, it was so hard.

252
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:26,647
I know I said this yesterday,

253
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,406
but welcome home, Chtholly.

254
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,155
I'm home.

255
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:38,508
I made it back.

256
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,008
I finally got to say it.

257
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,230
And I finally got to hear it.

258
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,258
Does it look weird?

259
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:53,637
The red hair?

260
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:02,114
It's a very pretty color, and it looks great.

261
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,267
Oh, good. Thank you.

262
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,883
All right. I'm fine now.

263
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:10,466
You sure about that?

264
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,716
You're not feeling sick or anything?

265
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,804
I'll be mad at you if you push yourself.

266
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,717
I'm fine!

267
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,596
And I have cooking, laundry, and lots
of other responsibilities to focus on.

268
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,910
There's no reason to get upset.

269
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:21,795
I know.

270
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,599
Just wait. I hope that you're ready!

271
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,966
That's what I said!

272
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,782
Ladies! Did you forget something?

273
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,190
Like wiping your shoes off before coming inside?!

274
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,975
Huh? Sorry, Chtholly.

275
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,430
If I'm really freed from being a fairy soldier...

276
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,382
If I'm really allowed to pursue my dreams,

277
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,937
the same dreams as most normal people, then...

278
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:58,840
I want to live, standing side by side with him.

279
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,878
I want to see the same things, walk down the same path,

280
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,135
eat the same food, and go to the same places he goes.

281
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,695
I want to spend my whole life that way, with him.

282
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,178
Getting better at homey stuff is all well and good,

283
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,389
but I mean like...?

284
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,122
It's only for Willem?

285
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,632
Look at who's making another spicy meat dish!

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,127
And seems to me this one's tailored
to a certain someone's taste buds, too.

287
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:50,902
Oh, shut up and get out of here! Only the
person cooking is allowed in the kitchen anyway!

288
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:55,005
It's a very pretty color, and it looks great.

289
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:56,175
Ooh-hoo.

290
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,270
What? You were eavesdropping!

291
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,532
Ha, ha! Amazing how girls in love are so full of life!

292
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,405
What?!

293
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:05,833
Although, I don't know about hogging the whole kitchen.

294
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,561
I mean, that sure is a lot of work
just to get to one guy's stomach.

295
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,088
How is said fairy soldier?

296
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:17,633
It's been around five days since she
woke up, and so far, she seems fine.

297
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,716
Does she?

298
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,853
Good, that's wonderful to hear.

299
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,377
Uh, so...

300
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,216
What's with the getup?

301
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,028
They're civilian clothes.

302
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:29,778
I happen to be under suspension
for leading a losing battle.

303
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:31,653
I can't wear a uniform right now.

304
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,862
Hopefully, this is only temporary.

305
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,624
Uh-huh. So uh,

306
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:39,250
why are we making off-duty lizards come all this way?

307
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,028
What's this conversation about?

308
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:44,348
To discuss Chtholly's immediate future, right?

309
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,628
Did I not mention that to you earlier?

310
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,916
I thought we three needed to talk about it.

311
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:49,936
Hm?

312
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,730
Those girls are technically weapons.

313
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:54,390
It's not like they can retire.

314
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,212
And, although Chtholly is not a leprechaun at the moment,

315
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,668
she's still considered a fairy soldier on paper.

316
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,432
Which means she can't turn down an order to sortie, huh.

317
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:05,612
So then what about on your end?

318
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,263
You're first officer, could you adjust the sortie lineup?

319
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:14,330
I could if I was in charge, but there's a chance
the order might come from higher up in the command.

320
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,443
Hold on.

321
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,128
You know the Great Sage?

322
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:19,987
Doesn't he have military influence?

323
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,755
--Huh? --What?

324
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,722
Yes, I know him.

325
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:26,198
He's the military's top advisor,
everyone knows the Great Sage.

326
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:29,077
Then make sure he receives
a report that goes like this:

327
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,383
"In order to research leprechaun physiology,

328
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,332
Technical Officer Kmetsch has chosen soldier
Chtholly Nota Seniorious to be a test subject."

329
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:39,862
What is that about?

330
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,288
Just call it a hunch.

331
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,070
If I ask to be given responsibility for her,

332
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:45,526
I bet he'll agree to it.

333
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:48,350
Mostly because he'll assume that'll make me owe him one.

334
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:53,153
So what kind of relationship do you
imagine you have with the Great Sage?

335
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:54,487
Don't worry about that,

336
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:56,691
worry about how we're going to replace Chtholly.

337
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,782
Ithea and Ren can't handle it,
not if they're by themselves.

338
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:00,486
Oh.

339
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:03,136
Right, well, about that. There's, uh...

340
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:03,896
Hm?

341
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:08,350
I heard from the guild that beasts
attacked the surface survey team.

342
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,012
Apparently, the <i>Saxifraga</i> was sunk.

343
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:12,891
Saxi...

344
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,979
It sunk? What of the warriors that were aboard?

345
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:19,273
Both were a bit worn out, however, apparently unhurt.

346
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:20,987
Hang on a second, you guys.

347
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,521
"Survey team"? "Both"?

348
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:25,534
Oh, yeah.

349
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:28,753
I keep forgetting that you only
arrived here like a month ago.

350
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:32,809
Do you actually know how many
battle-ready fairies we currently have?

351
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,502
Aside from Chtholly, three.

352
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:37,112
That's with Tiat, who hasn't been paired with a sword.

353
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,378
No, we have five girls ready.

354
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:42,282
There's Ithea, and Nephren, Tiat, I guess.

355
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,613
We also have Nopht and Rhantolk.

356
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,862
Well, where are those girls right now?

357
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,505
You could try putting two and two together?

358
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,468
No way...

359
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,728
Yes way.

360
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:03,445
I think that's correct, but how can we really know...

361
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,271
What is that?

362
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,398
It's a Beast!

363
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:31,587
You idiot!

364
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:34,078
That thing reacts to sound and motion.

365
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:36,164
Just be still and keep quiet.

366
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:43,675
Come on. What the hell is goin' on over there?

367
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,820
Huh?

368
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,860
Wow, that is not a good sign.

369
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:22,057
I expected a beast to put up a better fight.

370
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,583
Completely insane.

371
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:28,017
Are you talking about the beast?

372
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,839
Or perhaps...?

373
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:11,006
Next Episode: slight light, slight hope.
