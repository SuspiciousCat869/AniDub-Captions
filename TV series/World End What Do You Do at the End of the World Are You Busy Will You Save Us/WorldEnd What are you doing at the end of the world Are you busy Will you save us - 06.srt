1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,423
I'm so glad you're here!

2
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,252
Welcome home!

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,065
Chtholly?

4
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,348
I'm back home.

5
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:19,907
Jerk.

6
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,782
You mean there's a man here who can tune dug weapons?

7
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,513
No, no, no, no.

8
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,240
Sorry, it was not my intention to frighten you.

9
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,823
I know this scary face doesn't help.

10
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,240
However, it still seems like
you're telling me a tall tale.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,925
I once knew a monster that could
tune dug weapons, but he's long gone.

12
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:11,711
In there, huh?

13
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,892
Yes, Great Sage.

14
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,258
According to what I've been told, he can tune dug weapons.

15
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:17,236
You've brought him this far to meet me,

16
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,714
so we might as well get on with it.

17
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:23,004
It's been a long time since I've met
a con man with this much originality.

18
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:28,170
Hello? Souwong?

19
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,503
Really good to see you.

20
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:32,312
Wow, you look different. In like a super old way.

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,545
No, that can't be Black Agate Swordmaster?

22
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,741
No one's called me that in a long time.

23
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,586
Magus of the Pole Star.

24
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,760
You look delighted to know that we're both doing so well.

25
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,612
You spent 500 years petrified on the surface?

26
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,494
I assumed you were dead because my
pulse tracing never got any response.

27
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:53,717
None, ever!

28
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:56,670
Well, you wouldn't. I was petrified,
so my heart wasn't beating.

29
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:59,482
Give me back the tears I shed that day!

30
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:02,032
Ah, you mean you cried for me.

31
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,211
No, I did not.

32
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,811
Don't be silly.

33
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,250
I would never waste my time crying over someone like you.

34
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,742
Sure.

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,801
So, what's your deal? Why are you still alive?

36
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,197
What's it been... 500 years, now?

37
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:17,590
You...

38
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,643
What is that?

39
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:23,150
You weren't the only one
killed during battle, you know.

40
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:28,100
I was taken out at the same time as Emissa.

41
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:35,765
However, just before I passed, I was able to place a
curse on myself, a curse that would alter my life force.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,378
What I am now can no longer be considered human.

43
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:43,009
But that's mainly because I
can't die of injury or old age.

44
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,062
I see.

45
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,661
Don't get the wrong idea, your pity isn't necessary.

46
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,311
I'm actually very happy with
the way my life has turned out.

47
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,295
No. It's not about your story.

48
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,795
I'm more shocked that Emissa was killed in battle.

49
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,578
Look at 'em go.

50
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,311
Ya think that's Emissa?

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,426
Nah. It's most likely Hillgram.

52
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:10,852
Saw some gaping ridgelines on the way here.

53
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:15,012
Makes sense. Will you look at this
party? It's practically full of monsters.

54
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:17,686
You're one to talk.

55
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,902
Huh, Black Agate Swordmaster?

56
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,568
How many times do I have to tell
you to stop calling me that, Souwong?

57
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:29,086
Also, you seriously need to stop
wearing that cape. You look ridiculous.

58
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,836
Now, that's not fair.

59
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,191
I mean, he's so itty-bitty, how are we
supposed to spot him if he's not wearing it?

60
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:36,795
But it is ridiculous.

61
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:41,878
I guess that means it really does
suit the great Magus of the Pole Star.

62
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:45,670
Ah! You two are so good at getting on my nerves!

63
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,506
Mm?

64
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,274
Well then, eat this and try to relax.

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,836
It's one of Almaria's special ginger cookies.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,770
Almaria baked something for me?!

67
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,628
No, for me!

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,632
No, you're both wrong. It's for...

69
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:02,670
Good grief.

70
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,927
What am I gonna do with you guys?

71
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,764
I haven't been able to reminisce,

72
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,086
at least not before now.

73
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,387
Seems this job's helping me deal with the past.

74
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:13,287
Yes, of course!

75
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,024
That makes perfect sense!

76
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,420
You are the only one who can tune carillons.

77
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:22,185
No one is more perfect for the
fairy warehouse caretaker job!

78
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,329
But now, I don't know if I should leave you there
to rot or give you something more fulfilling to do.

79
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,339
Not to interrupt your brainstorm attack,

80
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,724
but you don't have to worry. I'm perfectly fine.

81
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,420
And I swore to return soon, so I need to get back.

82
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,124
Get back? To where?

83
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,670
Are you talking about the fairy warehouse?

84
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,568
Yeah.

85
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,369
I'd love to stay and chat, but I just can't right now.

86
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,420
It's nice to know we're both still alive, though.

87
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,327
No so fast.

88
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,670
Before you leave, there's
someone I'd like for you to meet.

89
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:48,512
Uh?

90
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:52,920
But I should warn you, this is probably
someone you never imagined you'd see again.

91
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:54,708
You can't be serious.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,795
You don't mean another one of our friends survived?

93
00:05:57,878 --> 00:06:00,248
We will be heading for Island Two.

94
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:02,603
Ready an airship for us immediately.

95
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,287
No, hang on a sec. I never said I'd go!

96
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,220
Souwong! Wait!

97
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,895
Room without an exit.

98
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,253
Black cat that doesn't stop meowing.

99
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:18,586
Who's the unfamiliar blue-eyed girl?

100
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,217
That was a weird dream.

101
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,336
Please come back, Willem.

102
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,340
Please.

103
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,633
Oh, no.

104
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,772
She's gonna be so mad at me.

105
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,862
Fun, feels like we're entering
the temple of an evil clan.

106
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:52,465
I may have known you forever, but I
still don't get your bizarre style.

107
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,086
Look who's talking.

108
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:59,966
Five hundred years, and you're
still wearing a ridiculous white cape.

109
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,880
Don't make it sound like a disease.
It's a part of my very heart and soul!

110
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:06,827
I would never cast my cape aside, not in a thousand years!

111
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:10,878
Thank you.

112
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,266
Where did that come from?

113
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,855
Why would you thank me?

114
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,802
Just felt like saying thank you.

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,350
Don't worry about it.

116
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:18,954
No, no, wait. Why not?

117
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,609
What are you grinning for? Don't be weird.

118
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,412
Out on a walk, are we?

119
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,257
Well, it is a pleasant day.

120
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm meeting her?

121
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,096
Not her. Look lower.

122
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:42,295
Greetings, you oversized piece
of trash, I've come to see you!

123
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,936
Uh! If it isn't the great Sage.

124
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,981
Wonderful timing. I was getting unbelievably bored.

125
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:48,634
Mm...

126
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:54,341
I've brought an old acquaintance I'd
like you to meet. All right, Eboncandle?

127
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:58,029
Ah! Yes, of course, I recognize you!

128
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,753
Yes, but where do I know you?

129
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,436
Oh! We fought...

130
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,228
Tell me, Souwong, please tell me this
isn't real and it's all just a bad dream.

131
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:09,051
If you want, I don't mind slapping
you so you can make sure you're awake.

132
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:11,003
I think I'll pass.

133
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,455
It's been eons, has it not, human brave?

134
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:25,436
I never imagined the day would
come when our paths would cross again.

135
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:31,920
Although I wish very much that it were not so,
sadly, we are fated to always cross swords, too.

136
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,687
Warriors like us are not given such luxuries, uh.

137
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,653
Look, you can give all that warrior crap a rest.

138
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:40,170
Really? How dreadfully boring.

139
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:43,253
Not to be rude, but why the hell do you look like that?

140
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:49,720
The Eboncandle I fought in the past had skin,
flesh, and you know, an actual body from the neck down.

141
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:53,170
You ask as if you weren't the one
who burned my remains to a crisp!

142
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,186
Can you imagine my shock when I awoke in this state?

143
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,502
This is your fault!

144
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:01,807
Although, it is not your fault that I
have had to consistently use much of my power.

145
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,561
I've not had the strength to heal myself completely.

146
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,711
I get it.

147
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:08,086
The "paradise" or islands in the sky,

148
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,753
they were built by the two of you.

149
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,127
That is correct.

150
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:16,637
In order to escape the seventeen beasts, I used
brute force to elevate surface land into the sky.

151
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,320
Somehow, it's managed to last 500 years.

152
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,628
Eight-tenths of it is thanks to my powers.

153
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,878
At this point, you have to know
what the seventeen beasts are, right?

154
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,920
What the hell happened to make them appear?

155
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,392
Where did they come from?

156
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:35,156
Hm... The beasts are the true sin of humanity.

157
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,795
To begin with, they're ancient--

158
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:39,103
Do you remember True World, by chance?

159
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,420
Uh. Now that you mention it, yeah, I think I do.

160
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:45,170
Are you talking about that really old,
militant cult we were ordered to take out?

161
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,478
Yes. The beasts are biological weapons

162
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,029
that were born as a result of
True World's failed research.

163
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,312
Makes sense.

164
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,954
That's why emnetwihts are
blamed for destroying the surface.

165
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,003
It's because of them.

166
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:58,058
Correct.

167
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,125
And they're not wrong. Humans did destroy the surface.

168
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:06,333
But wouldn't you like to take the surface back now?

169
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,670
You may be one of the most annoying
guys I ever met. Rotten to the core,

170
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm talking personality, heart, and soul-all of it--.

171
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,878
But you also have the best and most reliable skills.

172
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:19,920
Which means you're more than
worthy to be a part of our plan.

173
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,461
In fact, you're a crucial factor at this point.

174
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:23,568
Indeed.

175
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,711
I thought the surface was overrun.

176
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,273
Isn't it a danger zone with beasts everywhere?

177
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,170
What are you planning?

178
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,370
We will attack them ourselves.

179
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,085
What?

180
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:37,670
Now that you're here, we also have the ability to
use carillons that couldn't be tuned or wielded before,

181
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,878
giving us more power than we'd expected.

182
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,165
This is significant progress for us.

183
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:47,295
The battle will more than likely require
all resources from every Règles Aile city.

184
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,571
It will be a long road. Dangerous.

185
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:53,263
However, we stand a good chance
of coming out on top this time.

186
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,787
We can procure as many fairies as we need.

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,545
The only problem previously was
the shortage of usable carillons.

188
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:00,493
What?

189
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,395
I--! Uh. Nothing. Uh, nothing at all.

190
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,982
Said too much again.

191
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:08,721
We are the special weapons
you were sent here to care for.

192
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,312
It's you.

193
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:15,311
You're the ones who've been producing the girls.

194
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,852
Attention operatives: move on the double!

195
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,503
Unknown beast detected.

196
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:26,045
Island Fifteen will hereby be abandoned.

197
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,475
Strategic HQ is to fall back to Island Sixteen.

198
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,461
Hardcover picture book.

199
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:40,670
Black and white zigzag.

200
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:41,836
Swaying boat.

201
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,878
Damaged cocoon.

202
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,086
Red water. Ashen wind.

203
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,378
Seven-eyed frog.

204
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:47,836
Endless orange road.

205
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,003
Fabric with a silver glint.

206
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,753
Stop it, stop!

207
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:57,062
Who are you?! Shut up! Shut up! Get out of my head!

208
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,909
Chtholly...

209
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:11,336
I promised.

210
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,128
I will go back.

211
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,461
I promised!

212
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,753
I promised. I promised him!

213
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,795
I promised!

214
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:24,920
These weapons use the enemy's own force
against them as soon as contact is made.

215
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:31,753
Lion eating a snake.

216
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,878
Round rainbow.

217
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:33,878
Pile of gold coins.

218
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,170
Tiny bowl filled with sweets.

219
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,420
Burning signpost.

220
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,628
Fish flying between the stars.

221
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:39,795
Just shut up!

222
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,670
It doesn't matter what you say!

223
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,844
I'm going back!

224
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:59,555
I... I have to go back, to go...

225
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,740
Go back... to him.

226
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,103
Go back to him.

227
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,920
Those fairies are borderline unstable ghosts,

228
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,378
they're souls of children.

229
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,378
Souls who aren't aware they're
dead when they wander into our world,

230
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,253
still trapped in the immaturity of their former youth.

231
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,336
Remember, they're not really life forms.

232
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:27,376
And one of my necromancy skills allows me to
produce fairies from wandering spirits like theirs.

233
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,423
Since they do not fear death,

234
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:35,003
they make ideal, mass-produced weapons
that can cause venenum explosions.

235
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:37,045
Their life-spans are very short.

236
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:41,311
And their spirits are so fragile that if
they generate too much venenum during combat,

237
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:45,428
memories of their past lives can come
back, causing mental disintegration.

238
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,436
But we're trying to protect the world here,

239
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,778
these are simply sacrifices
that can and must be overlooked.

240
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,503
How are you girls feeling?

241
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,253
You three slept in pretty late today.

242
00:13:58,336 --> 00:13:59,545
We did, yeah.

243
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,003
Can you blame us? That battle was rough.

244
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,427
I think I'm dead.

245
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,045
We'd like to take it easy for a while, if that's okay.

246
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,655
Right, Chtholly?

247
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,261
Chtholly?

248
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,373
Well, that's fine with me.

249
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,670
No need to push if you're still so worn out.

250
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:19,045
On that note, you should excuse
us from chores for the time being.

251
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,298
Not happening.

252
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,094
Sorry. I think I need to go get some more sleep.

253
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,209
Flat spider.

254
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,545
Used-up candles and burned envelopes.

255
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:46,836
Please stop...

256
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,128
--Half-eaten cookie. --Please.

257
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,920
Metal bird and rainbow-colored arrowhead.

258
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,003
Vivid mine.

259
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,086
Stomach with a thorn.

260
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,074
Please, shut up.

261
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,086
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

262
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,104
Shut up! Shut up!

263
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:04,132
We made a promise...

264
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:08,190
What if I, what if I'm the one who breaks it?

265
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:13,802
Aw. I was really looking forward
to eating all that butter cake.

266
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,336
Threads made of morning dew.

267
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,056
Breaking world. Father.

268
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,961
Yellow plushie.

269
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,295
Shining skylark nest.

270
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,961
Pebble in a paper packet. Carnival in water.

271
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,253
Black cat that doesn't stop meowing.

272
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,920
Dazzling gray sky. Kiss of a golden butterfly.

273
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,086
But who are you?

274
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,253
Who are?

275
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,553
Who am?

276
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:37,144
Who am... Who?

277
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,227
I don't know who I am.

278
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:59,253
The fairies are our only way to make use of the
carillons, and this is a fact even you cannot deny.

279
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,878
Yes, I realize they're needed for basic defense.

280
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,250
But their lives shouldn't be thrown
away to satisfy imperialistic urges!

281
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:08,895
What would you have me do?! The world
as we know it heads steadily toward ruin.

282
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,767
Règles Aile's existence is already
on borrowed time and borrowed power.

283
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,636
We have no choice, we must find
a way to return to the surface.

284
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,900
Must we? Are you sure there's not a better way?

285
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,335
All those people living out there, now,

286
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,170
they consider Règles Aile their home!

287
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,961
Not the damn surface!

288
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:25,530
You know that!

289
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,128
What about you, do you consider these islands your home?

290
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,350
Don't pretend like you don't want to go back!

291
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,473
Souwong, let's say we do take the surface,

292
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,333
who are we gonna find there?

293
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,836
Will there be any of our family
or our friends to welcome us home?

294
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,878
Mm.

295
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:54,221
Great Sage, I would give this fight up for the
moment, if I were you. That is one resolute man.

296
00:16:54,295 --> 00:17:00,797
Once he makes a decision to protect something, he will
protect it, even if that means sacrificing his own life.

297
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:06,877
You mean to tell me you care more about
fairies who will soon die than this world's future?

298
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,222
I do.

299
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,456
Now I need to go.

300
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,148
I promised to get back to them quickly.

301
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:18,805
Then, Willem Kmetsch, I take it this
is your decision on the matter today.

302
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,244
Yes, it is.

303
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:25,410
I always thought you took the hero part
of heroic brave a little too seriously.

304
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,822
So did I.

305
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,054
I've come with an urgent report.

306
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:34,067
It's about the wielder of the dug weapon Seniorious.

307
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,011
Memories of her past are returning.

308
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,779
Her mind has begun to disintegrate.

309
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,668
And just like that, he is gone.

310
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,754
Why did you not tell him the truth about the beasts?

311
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:53,534
I used to look up to him
like he was an older brother.

312
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:59,684
So if there's any way I can help it, I'd rather
not make him hate me more than he already does now.

313
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:03,711
No, it's mine!

314
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,000
Nuh uh, because I took it first!

315
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,136
Hey, do you guys know where Nygglatho is?

316
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,967
She went up in the mountains!

317
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,586
Whenever someone doesn't come back, she goes up
into to the mountains to fight bears for a while.

318
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,920
Oh, right.

319
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:21,455
Then I guess we'll be having
stewed bear for dinner tonight, huh?

320
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,436
Hey, what's wrong with you, Tiat?

321
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,600
You seem gloomy.

322
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,503
Uh, I dunno.

323
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,961
It feels like there's a big hole in my head.

324
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,290
Why? Because Chtholly broke?

325
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,390
Maybe, yeah.

326
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,229
You should know she kept her promise.

327
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:47,478
She wasn't supposed to return from battle,

328
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,747
but because of you she somehow made it home.

329
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:54,920
And she did everything she could to make
sure she had a little bit of time left.

330
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:55,972
Yeah.

331
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,545
I knew she'd keep her promise,

332
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:02,365
even though I wouldn't say or do what she wanted.

333
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:05,847
I did nothing for her.

334
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,682
Chtholly!

335
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:00,130
Are you looking for something?

336
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:02,436
Uh-huh. Jade-ebo!

337
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,213
"Jade-ebo"? I see.

338
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:07,915
Hey, who are you?

339
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:10,154
My name is Elq!

340
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:11,889
Elq, huh?

341
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,755
I can help you find Jade-ebo, if you want.

342
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:17,518
I don't mind looking with you.

343
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,277
I mean, this place seems huge.

344
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:26,110
Who, me?

345
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:30,939
Oh, yes, my name is... huh.

346
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,953
I think I forgot. Who am I?

347
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,406
Huh?

348
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:36,773
I don't know,

349
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:40,587
but I remember there's something important.

350
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:46,088
Oh, yeah. I remember I have to go back.

351
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,086
No matter what?

352
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,347
No matter what.

353
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,226
Even though it's only gonna bring you bunches of pain?

354
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:56,880
Yes, even then, because I have a promise I have to keep.

355
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,262
Okay.

356
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:22,619
It's rare to see you drinking anything other than tea.

357
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:26,807
I'm glad you're here, Willem.

358
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,415
I'm so tired of being forced to cry all alone.

359
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,211
In the past,

360
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,878
I wanted to fix things that couldn't be fixed,

361
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,063
like unhappiness or the tragedies people went through.

362
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,009
But I was always too powerless.

363
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,173
In the end, I couldn't do anything.

364
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:47,057
I started to wonder why I even tried.

365
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,617
Still do.

366
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:52,512
You'd think I would've learned my lesson.

367
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:01,955
But I wanted to make Chtholly happy.

368
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,171
I'll never understand it.

369
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,219
What did she ever see in me?

370
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:15,066
How do you not know the answer to that?

371
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,753
Just think about it.

372
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,559
You gave me so many of my firsts.

373
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:27,238
At that market, you became the first stranger to help me.

374
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:30,719
You were the first to take me somewhere with a great view.

375
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:34,449
The first to inspire all these different emotions in me.

376
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,498
You're the first person who let me lean on them,

377
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,105
and the first opponent I lost to.

378
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,609
There're so many, I can't keep count.

379
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:50,000
Which is why, well, it seems pretty obvious that
you'd be the first person I ever fell in love with.

380
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:55,197
Take the hint already, you dummy.

381
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,128
What happened to me, anyway?

382
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:04,378
I remember getting to the
warehouse and having a weird dream.

383
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:06,769
And then I was mad that you wouldn't come back.

384
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,344
Why are you looking at me like that?

385
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,377
Welcome home, Chtholly.

386
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,152
Welcome home.

387
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,588
It's a miracle of love.

388
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,328
I don't know about it being love or not, but, yeah,

389
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:56,558
I'd say this is definitely a miracle.

390
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:59,795
Knowing Chtholly, though, she
probably ignored the consequences

391
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:03,179
and paid a huge price to make whatever this is happen.

392
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:10,526
Next Episode: home, sweet home.
