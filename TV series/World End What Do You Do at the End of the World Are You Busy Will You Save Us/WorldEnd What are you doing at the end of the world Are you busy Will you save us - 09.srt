1
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,987
Solitude in white darkness.

2
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:22,300
Prayer echoing across a cramped room.

3
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:25,768
It gets worse every day.

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,668
What am I gonna do?

5
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,032
Oh, it's just you.

6
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,464
That's right!

7
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:38,167
Ithea Myse Valgulious here!

8
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:42,821
Now. Mind telling me exactly who you are?

9
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,485
Who am I?

10
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,931
What do you mean?

11
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,579
I want you to tell me who you are.

12
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,081
Spell it out for me.

13
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,402
My name is Chtholly Nota Seniorious.

14
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,315
I didn't need to worry!

15
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,788
You're definitely still my friend Chtholly.

16
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,245
Worry, about what?

17
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,991
I don't understand.

18
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,550
Why would you worry?

19
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:46,760
Look, you need to ignore all those nonsensical
visions, words, and memories of that past life.

20
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:50,829
Otherwise, they're gonna just eat away at
you until you start losing your own memories,

21
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:53,869
and I really don't want it to make you forget who you are.

22
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,086
So all these memories, they're true, they're real?

23
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,547
A girl with red hair keeps telling me that.

24
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,200
Do not think about her anymore!

25
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,233
She doesn't matter.

26
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:09,318
That girl has nothing to do with you.

27
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,020
She's a total stranger, and of no relation.

28
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:15,371
I want you to think about who
you are, like as much as you can.

29
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,731
Cling to every memory you still have now.

30
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,541
Don't let them be swept away by someone else's.

31
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,913
And no generating venenum anymore.

32
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,515
Jeez, what were you thinking?

33
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:33,146
But, I had to help her, I...

34
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,371
No "buts" allowed, Chtholly.

35
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,329
Yes, you were very lucky one time.

36
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:38,405
You came back!

37
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,722
But, who knows what might happen next time, though.

38
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:44,371
Avoid anything that might trigger a memory of a past life,

39
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,254
and do not generate venenum.

40
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:50,463
If you wanna stick around for as long as
possible, you need to follow these two rules!

41
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,098
I knew it.

42
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:55,257
My stupid disintegration never actually stopped, did it?

43
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,233
So, you still decided to live on, yeah?

44
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,185
Listen. I've got a story for ya, okay?

45
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,684
It's about a girl I once knew. We were really close.

46
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:18,051
Just like you, the girl's past life slowly but
surely ate away at her until her own persona vanished.

47
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:23,185
Meanwhile, the other girl who woke up
in her place felt pretty lost, herself.

48
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,895
She'd thought she'd died,

49
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,920
but here she was in a place she'd never been before,

50
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,164
and in a body that wasn't hers.

51
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,788
Lucky for her, she came across a diary that
belonged to the girl who'd completely disappeared.

52
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,707
She'd written in it every single day without fail.

53
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,441
Ithea?

54
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:55,020
She was a bubbly, nosey girl.

55
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:57,177
I think she focused on everyone else

56
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,510
so she wouldn't have to reveal her feelings.

57
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:04,157
Yep, that's the kind of girl Ithea Myse Valgulious was.

58
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,017
When it happened,

59
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,673
I thought perhaps killing myself was for the best.

60
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:12,204
But then, we'd both be gone.

61
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,645
It would mean nothing.

62
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,785
I realized there was only one way for me to atone.

63
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:17,949
I'd stay.

64
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,330
I'd have to take over being Ithea,

65
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,585
and I'd never, ever let anyone know I wasn't really her.

66
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:30,611
Funny, somehow I've made it all the way to
today just by saying that to myself over and over.

67
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:31,885
I see.

68
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,028
I'm so sorry.

69
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,539
She had a diary. Maybe I should start one, too.

70
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,478
Try asking yourself this, first.

71
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,696
Do you want someone to take over your life?

72
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,550
How does the Chtholly here,

73
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:58,923
the you right now, how does she want to live? Hm?

74
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,463
The me here.

75
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,076
The me now.

76
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:10,326
Uh.

77
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,150
It's getting kinda chilly out.

78
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,704
I'll help. I'm not as warm as Nephren,

79
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,805
but I'll do my best to keep you comfy.

80
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:18,413
You're just gonna have to make do.

81
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:20,499
Thank you, but y'know,

82
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,649
you actually seem pretty warm to me.

83
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,888
It makes me happy to hear that.

84
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,215
Chtholly.

85
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,829
You think you can keep this from the T.O?

86
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:31,695
Yeah.

87
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:35,021
Besides, knowing would only make him worry even more.

88
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,078
And I refuse to be the damsel in distress type.

89
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,106
That's it.

90
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,352
I know what I want to do.

91
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,677
Right now, I just want to savor the joy of being with him.

92
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:48,802
I want to revel in being normal.

93
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:53,454
See, there's that whole "look
at me, I'm in love" thing you do.

94
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,454
Told ya. I knew you were
definitely still good ol' Chtholly!

95
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:57,493
Oh, stop.

96
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,151
You're the only one.

97
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,704
About Ithea and the diary.

98
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,559
You're the only one I've told.

99
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,645
Then, it can be our little secret.

100
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,379
Are you gonna ask me?

101
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,204
Like, don't you wanna know my real name?

102
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,667
Or find out what kind of person I was before?

103
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,015
You're Ithea, too, though.

104
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,640
A bubbly, nosey girl. One who focuses on everyone
else so she doesn't have to reveal her feelings.

105
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,143
She's a fellow fairy, and one of my best friends.

106
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,084
That's all that really matters.

107
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:42,996
It is. Thank you.

108
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,501
That's such a relief.

109
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,358
Let's go!

110
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,269
Mm?

111
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,691
Oh, was that just you, Chtholly?

112
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,575
I'm sorry. Was I being too loud?

113
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,794
Your hair is still changing.

114
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:22,140
Yeah. I'm really starting to like it.

115
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:26,221
Yes, I can tell. I mean, you're owning it!

116
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,148
Thank you!

117
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,361
I'm done being all mopey.

118
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,573
But even when I'm sad,

119
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,621
even when I feel like I'm being torn apart,

120
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,158
even the tears that are always ready to flow,

121
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,305
they all prove I'm still here.

122
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:52,916
All the worry, the frustration, the sorrow, and the joy.

123
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,861
They're all different parts of what
make up the person standing right here,

124
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,118
the person alive right now.

125
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:05,402
The girl who is, without a doubt, me... Chtholly.

126
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,588
Yes, at least for now.

127
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,125
You're knitting?

128
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,397
It's gotten pretty cold lately.

129
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:29,016
The little ones don't have anything
warm enough to wear, so I thought I'd help.

130
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:32,146
That's nice.

131
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,582
So, whatcha say?

132
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,247
Some people think this color suits me, do you?

133
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:47,888
Okay, what's the matter?

134
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,007
You don't have to worry.

135
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,500
All right, then. If you say so.

136
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:08,982
Thank you, Ren.

137
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,913
How's Collon's cold?

138
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,264
Is she gonna be okay?

139
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:28,221
Still not over the hump yet, I'd say.

140
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,189
I'm gonna pick her up some medicine later.

141
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:32,715
Sounds good.

142
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:43,239
Oh, yes, this is great!
You're improving so much!

143
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,147
Chtholly. When you get a chance, will
you put this under Collon's pillow for me?

144
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,673
It's an ancient talisman to prevent
nightmares when you have a cold.

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,204
Is that okay? I'm worried about her.

146
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,871
Her cold has lasted so long.

147
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,663
Oh, right. That's fine.

148
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,289
Collon. Got it.

149
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,370
Uh.

150
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,580
How neat! I didn't know you had something like this.

151
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,371
Not me. Seniorious provided it.

152
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,213
Did you say Seniorious?

153
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:17,080
Yeah, I told you that dug weapons were
comprised of several different talismans, didn't I?

154
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:18,739
Uh...

155
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,913
The other ones prevent cuts when
the blade isn't imbued with magic,

156
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,819
or they raise an alarm when the wielder uses an alias.

157
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:28,225
They're kinda useless at the moment,
so I figured we might--

158
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,771
You put that talisman back right now!

159
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,832
What has gotten into you?! Do I have
to remind you that dug weapons aren't

160
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,806
every day little charms that we can hand out
willy-nilly for whatever we want whenever we want it.

161
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,846
They're ultimate weapons, ones that
should be prioritized better than this!

162
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,265
You're being overdramatic, and you know it.

163
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,818
Unless you think Collon's not a priority,

164
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,124
and that she doesn't need a good night's sleep.

165
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,579
What am I gonna do with you?

166
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:57,559
Oh, fine. Of course, I'm worried about her, too.

167
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,296
Just promise me you'll put it
back before you go to the surface.

168
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,755
I promise.

169
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:06,348
Speaking of the surface, do
you think they're okay down there?

170
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,538
What were their names again? Nopht and Rhantolk, right?

171
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,128
Yes, and there's currently no need to be troubled.

172
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,564
For what it's worth, the military is
rushing to finish the ship's remodeling.

173
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,483
Well, that's reassuring to hear.

174
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,329
I'm concerned about that artifact they recovered, too.

175
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:25,659
Oh, that's right.

176
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,323
Lapidemsibilus.

177
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,038
You're worried about it 'cause you
worry about me which you do too much.

178
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,371
He's an overprotective daddy, this one.

179
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:34,448
Uh. Shut up.

180
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,746
What? It's better than being
an overprotective sugar daddy!

181
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,746
Oh, come on. Not you, too.

182
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,119
You both should shut up. Neither of you are making sense.

183
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,926
Uh... Here we go.

184
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,407
Huh...

185
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:54,410
What?

186
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,538
You've been doing more stuff like that lately.

187
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,679
It gives you that traditional, girly girl charm.

188
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,917
I have to count the stitches, so I'd
appreciate it if you didn't distract me!

189
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,889
What? I was just trying to compliment you.

190
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,640
That was a compliment?!

191
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,072
You're still up, Rhan?

192
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,663
Wow, yes.

193
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:22,746
I wonder how long this rescue squad
is gonna take, it's been like forever.

194
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,288
I just got the word.

195
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,757
It's gonna take them even longer to get ready.

196
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,788
You're trying to read that again?

197
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:30,704
I am.

198
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,157
Figure anything out?

199
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:33,877
I haven't.

200
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:40,564
But I believe I can come up with an alternative
interpretation for this passage. Humans by the surface.

201
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:42,437
No...

202
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,318
By the humans, the surface...

203
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,142
The surface's...?

204
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,130
Nopht, will you kindly and immediately get off me.

205
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:01,549
It's open.

206
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:05,746
Staying up late again?

207
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,609
I guess, kinda.

208
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,957
Um, so uh.

209
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,204
You know all those things that you do?

210
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:14,816
Hm?

211
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:16,996
All those things that you do.

212
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,104
Can you teach me how to do them, too?

213
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:25,402
Like how to tune the swords, and
that weird thing you did for me.

214
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:28,523
You know, the thing you did with your hands.

215
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:30,831
Why are you looking at me like that?!

216
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,733
What's gotten into you?

217
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,288
Lately, you haven't given me much attention,

218
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:38,413
probably because you didn't have a reason to.

219
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:42,954
I thought you'd make time for me if I was
learning, and any time spent together works for me.

220
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,960
You can't be serious.

221
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:50,821
Although I can't fight, I'm still forcing you to take
me to the surface with you, so I would like to be useful.

222
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:55,135
None of those skills are
something you can master overnight.

223
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,187
You would have to put in a lot of time and effort first.

224
00:14:58,538 --> 00:14:59,241
Mm.

225
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,487
Don't get too worked up.

226
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:05,285
I know how you feel, but I'm still
not going to make you push yourself.

227
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,913
Don't be silly. I wouldn't push myself.

228
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,506
And don't you play dumb.

229
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:12,913
You've been losing your memories, haven't you?

230
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:16,788
I didn't realize that you knew.

231
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,453
I could tell from watching you.

232
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,590
So you were watching me.

233
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,263
But, if we have Lapidemsibilus,

234
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,993
we won't have to worry about that.

235
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:28,240
Is that map of the surface?

236
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:31,647
Yep, it's the area near the ruins,
where the survey team was attacked.

237
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:35,165
Isn't this where the rescue squad is supposed to land?

238
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,545
That's a bit close to camp, don't you think?

239
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:42,323
Oh, but I suppose that would
make it easier to transfer the haul.

240
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:44,909
Well, aren't you
quick on the uptake?

241
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:47,842
I am your secretary, after all!

242
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:52,282
Where we're going is your home, isn't it?

243
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:54,775
Five hundred years ago.

244
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,552
Would you want to go back?

245
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:00,191
This island has become my home now.

246
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,231
Our home.

247
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:03,064
It is. Yes.

248
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,660
Hey. What was your city like?

249
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,647
Did it have really amazing food?

250
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,733
Were you in love there?

251
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,954
What's all this, why the sudden interrogation?

252
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,037
It's my understanding that one needs
detailed intel on their destination beforehand.

253
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:16,617
But wait!

254
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,388
I'm gonna go get some more tea, first.

255
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:19,223
Be right back.

256
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,600
Give me a break, you're just curious.

257
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:27,032
This is so good.

258
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:30,038
Rather than worry and be stagnant,

259
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,797
I'll keep moving forward, one step at a time.

260
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,783
My footsteps may fade behind me,

261
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,436
and the path ahead may be dark as well.

262
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,941
But, I won't regret the past,

263
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:45,392
or be pessimistic about the future.

264
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:48,877
I will simply live here in the moment.

265
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,263
Because no matter how I fight it,

266
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,829
the clock keeps ticking down on me.

267
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,871
11... 12... 13... 14...

268
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:00,940
Perfect!

269
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:10,288
Auntie Nee!

270
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:15,534
And time, it keeps on passing by.

271
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,769
I'm glad I finished in time.

272
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,704
Uh, this is for Tiat.

273
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:27,121
Me? Really?

274
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,819
Thank you so much! I'll love it forever!

275
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,755
This one is for... Lakhesh!

276
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:37,788
Wow, um, thank you very much, Chtholly!

277
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,309
What about Collon?

278
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:42,714
Hey, what about me, where's mine?

279
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,412
Collon needs to wait her turn.

280
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,071
Here you go, sweetie.

281
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:49,121
Oh, it's so warm!

282
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:52,121
The rest of you better hurry
and get your butts over here, too.

283
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,405
Chtholly's giving out presents!

284
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,773
All right, so what's the deal with this party?

285
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,539
It's a snowfall fest.

286
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,288
It's for snowy nights, when you can't go out.

287
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,871
Instead, you wine and dine all night long.

288
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:04,695
Huh.

289
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,020
It's a popular event these days,

290
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,360
but originally, it was one of our troll festivals.

291
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:13,670
Uh... I think I'll pass on the details.

292
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:18,537
But, let's say it's also a send-off
for those of you headed to the surface.

293
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,190
It's really not that big a deal, is it?

294
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:24,578
Um, so we have presents for the older fairies, too.

295
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:27,368
Although, I guess they aren't exactly from us.

296
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,871
Gosh, you look so lovely, I
could eat you up right now!

297
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:36,230
Let go! You're squeezing me too tight! I
can't breathe, and you're gonna wrinkle my dress!

298
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:40,375
Mm! I'm telling ya, that there is one high-class lady.

299
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,694
I tip my hat to Lady Phyra's good taste.

300
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,871
Why would she send us all this?

301
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,558
It's for the snowfall fest, apparently.

302
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:49,604
Oh, um.

303
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,929
"Thank you all for your help when you were here last.

304
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:55,621
I know this isn't much, but I wanted
to send some gifts for the snowfall fest.

305
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:59,090
I hope you all come to visit
me in Corna di Luce again soon!"

306
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,540
What is it, Ren?

307
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,448
There is something for you.

308
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:07,805
Cheer up.

309
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,413
I can't believe that little...

310
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:12,539
Gorgeous!

311
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:16,871
Look at that.

312
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:21,543
Get over there. If there's ever been a
time to compliment her, this is that time.

313
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:23,989
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I know what to say.

314
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:27,079
Say everything you want.

315
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,746
Ask everything you need.

316
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,621
Putting it off can be a bad idea,

317
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,665
and you know that better than anyone.

318
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:44,246
Hey, Chtholly.

319
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,050
Uh?

320
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,121
You look absolutely beautiful.

321
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:56,624
I...

322
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:58,977
I know!

323
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:04,459
This should be enough clothes.

324
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,158
What about books, though?

325
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:11,100
Chtholly, it's almost time to leave.

326
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:12,679
Oh, okay.

327
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,653
Who am I, really?

328
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,038
See you later.

329
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,604
We're off, girls.

330
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:28,077
I can't stop it.

331
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:30,366
My memories are slowly fading.

332
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,640
The person I am is crumbling away.

333
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:35,572
You girls better be good for Nygglatho, okay?

334
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:36,785
Be safe.

335
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,640
We'll prepare a "welcome back"
party for you while we wait.

336
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:44,809
Don't push yourself.

337
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:46,447
It's a promise, right?

338
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,773
It's a promise.

339
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:55,581
I'm...

340
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,246
I'm so sorry.

341
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,677
It's sad.

342
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:04,568
I've forgotten more than half of what I knew about them.

343
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:08,496
I can relearn the names I can't remember anymore, however,

344
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,320
I know the memories I've lost will never come back.

345
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,310
As everything I am falls apart,

346
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,797
can I even be called Chtholly at this point?

347
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,367
It's heartbreaking.

348
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm hurt and just so sad.

349
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,378
But right now, I want to hold all these
feelings as close to my heart as I can.

350
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,730
Because the moment they disappear, too...

351
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,474
...that's the moment there will be nothing left of me.

352
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:16,887
Ren!

353
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:21,532
Heh! I never expected you to
be a part of the rescue squad!

354
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:25,003
I swear, you're just as teeny-tiny as ever!

355
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,956
Hey, since you're here,

356
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:32,457
that must mean the massive timere you guys
were fighting ended up being taken out, huh?

357
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,288
Which then means Chtholly opened the Fairy Gate.

358
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:35,988
Um.

359
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:37,788
I guess that's, uh...

360
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,919
You know, Chtholly and I never got along that well.

361
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:42,292
But now.

362
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,775
I feel like I should have tried
harder --talked to her more.

363
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,497
Um...

364
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:50,023
Don't "um" me.

365
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:52,043
I need to grieve for Chtholly.

366
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,868
So, long time no see, Nopht.

367
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:54,548
You!

368
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:55,355
Eh?

369
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,054
It's a ghost!

370
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:58,937
Hey, wait up!

371
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:01,473
You don't understand, I'm still alive!

372
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,667
Well, that's a good way to start.

373
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:10,666
Next episode: my happiness.
