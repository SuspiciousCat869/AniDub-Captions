1
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:06,935
We swore never to part.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,056
With our vow came euphoria.

3
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,850
My love for him was undeniable.

4
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:22,731
There was no greater happiness.

5
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,774
Yet, he offered more...

6
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:32,438
...and I delighted in it.

7
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:40,855
The gifts of love and bliss he presented
to me were unlike anything I'd ever known.

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,509
My life became his, and his mine.

9
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,202
He blessed me with his world.

10
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:51,392
He rewarded me with assurance.

11
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:56,122
There is no joy ever known that can compare with my own.

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,961
Uh?!

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,302
Careful! You trying to hurt someone?

14
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,485
That wasn't me, so calm yourself!

15
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,843
Oh, for crying out loud!

16
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:32,735
You better stop!

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,291
I've got you, now!

18
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:53,065
Stop! You're gonna make me fall!

19
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,760
Not enough time for venenum!

20
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:12,617
That hurt.

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,218
I'm sorry!

22
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:16,553
Are you, um...

23
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,020
Are your organs intact?

24
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,905
Come back!

25
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,048
She looks weird, Mommy.

26
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,693
Don't stare, it's rude.

27
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:28,872
Now, what's this?

28
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:31,753
Wonder why someone without
any fur would be on this island.

29
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,210
Oh no, I lost my hat!

30
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,568
Get out of here, you freak.

31
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:35,610
Yeah, get out.

32
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,465
We don't like your kind, disfeatured.

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,051
Yes, I'm aware.

34
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,277
Hold on a second.

35
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,997
I'm leaving, okay. Let go.

36
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,841
Seriously, hold on.

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,010
I pulled this out of that little cat's mouth.

38
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,104
Yours, right?

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,123
Yes, thanks.

40
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,810
Are you all right?

41
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:01,193
I'm good. I gather you must be new here?

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,138
Yes.

43
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:04,636
Hope you tolerate intolerance well.

44
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,760
Is he one, too?

45
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,071
Looks like it.

46
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,137
Seems suspicious to me.

47
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,923
Heh. Come on. This way.

48
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:28,429
That'll do the trick.

49
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:29,622
Thank you. So, are you...

50
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,010
This island has no good food or local specialties.

51
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,117
But you...

52
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:38,010
You may have noticed it's not very welcoming
to those of us who lack fangs or horns.

53
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,571
Not great for tourism.

54
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,817
Yes, I already know that.

55
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,009
Follow me.

56
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,385
I'm sure you've had it with this place by now.

57
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,377
I'll show you to the port so you can get off this island.

58
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,135
No, wait!

59
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:53,187
I appreciate your help.

60
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,520
And I'm...

61
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,185
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,745
It's just, I--

63
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:02,073
Well, I realize I have no right to ask anything of you,

64
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,437
but, um, would you...

65
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,520
All right, where do you want to go?

66
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,401
Is this the view you were hoping for?

67
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:51,729
I've seen sky islands from
higher up and farther out before,

68
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:55,708
but gazing down on one from the heart
of the city like this is brand new.

69
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:59,849
I've always wanted to do it,
just never really had the chance.

70
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:00,865
That so?

71
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,230
But now, I've officially made my wish a reality,

72
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,790
and I got to make some great memories, too.

73
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:11,985
Thank you again for today.

74
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:15,467
So many wonderful experiences,
and it's all thanks to you.

75
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,633
I think you're giving me too much credit.

76
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,611
What about them? I'm guessing they're here for you?

77
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,443
Today's been kinda like a fairytale, but time's up.

78
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,433
Mind if I make one last request, fairy godfather?

79
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,177
It's a small one.

80
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,113
I'd appreciate it if you'd forget you ever met me.

81
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,943
Forget I ever met you...?

82
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,325
Farewell!

83
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:48,426
Curious, but I suppose it's none of my business anyway.

84
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,902
Long time no see, Grick.

85
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,156
How's Anara doing?

86
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,802
He screwed up big time last month.

87
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,708
Wound up becoming Third food.

88
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:04,981
I'm so sorry to hear that.

89
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,723
Well, don't be. That's the life of a salvager.

90
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:11,801
From the moment we choose to treasure
hunt on the surface, we're prepared to die.

91
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,040
That's true.

92
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:19,821
No need to be sad! Now, on to happy news.
I think I might be able to land you work!

93
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:21,987
Yeah, it's for the military.

94
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,728
Come on, kid!

95
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:26,355
You could at least pretend to be excited about this.

96
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,467
They're not lookin' for special skills or experience.

97
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,688
The only quality they require
is someone who's trustworthy.

98
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:33,688
Hm...

99
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:36,052
No.

100
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,928
Sorry, but I gotta pass.

101
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,461
You'll have to ask a different loser.

102
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,956
Look, they're also insisting on a disfeatured,
with no horns or fur. You're perfect for this.

103
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,487
In fact, you're the only one they could hire, and you.

104
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:46,510
I said no.

105
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,992
I appreciate how you try to look out for me,

106
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,965
but I choose to live here of my own free will.

107
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,093
I understand.

108
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,200
You wanna keep living like an outcast.

109
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,228
Dead man walking and all that, right?

110
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:06,723
Why try to find something that makes you
happy when you've already decided not to be?

111
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,355
I get where you're comin' from, kid, believe me.

112
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,781
But I can't help it.

113
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,098
I want you to be able to live
a normal life up in these skies.

114
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,423
I want you to accept what I know.

115
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,848
The dead won't come back.

116
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,603
But you're not dead, you've still got a life to live!

117
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:24,802
Look, you can make a ton of cash on this thing, okay?

118
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,563
Why not at least get all that debt off your back?

119
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,995
Give yourself a chance to find the right path.

120
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:33,575
What's going on with this coffee, it tastes salty.

121
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,492
Oh, damn it all. Ok, Fine!

122
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:41,867
So you'll take the job, then?

123
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:43,969
Yes. You positive they'll want me?

124
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,277
Did you tell the military I can't
even fight, let alone kill someone?

125
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:48,874
Don't worry about that.

126
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,240
You're just gonna be the caretaker of a
warehouse that holds some special weaponry.

127
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:56,468
Already sounds like a bad idea.

128
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,638
Wonderful! I'll tell them you're coming!

129
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,677
Get 'em to fill you in once you're there.

130
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,473
Ah. Whoa, you're not kidding, this coffee is salty.

131
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,745
Would've been nice to know that the
warehouse was on a different island.

132
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:23,647
It's Cold.

133
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:28,010
Oh, no.

134
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,927
Wolves are the last thing I need.

135
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,302
It's been a long time since I felt being a
disfeatured may not be in my best interest.

136
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,244
And now the bridge is falling apart.

137
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,206
This is great... Stuck in the middle of nowhere!

138
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:52,218
Attack

139
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,177
Wait!

140
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:19,197
Pannibal, what do you think you're
doing running off on your own like that?

141
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,593
I've taken down a suspicious individual.

142
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:24,246
Right, like there's even anyone else here.

143
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,248
Hey, it's you.

144
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,746
I, what, wait, what are you doing here?

145
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,792
Me? Whoa, so many questions.

146
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,339
First things first. Help me.

147
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,555
Something's wrong.

148
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,815
This is nothing like what Grick said.

149
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,192
Just a minute.

150
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:56,718
Ahh! Ha, ha, ha!

151
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,677
It's been forever, Willem!

152
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,806
Welcome to the secret weapons warehouse!

153
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,843
Oh, my. Have you grown a bit taller?

154
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,887
Why are you here of all places...

155
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:08,924
...Nygglatho?

156
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:09,944
Why, you ask.

157
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:13,715
Why wouldn't I be here, silly?
This is my job, where I work!

158
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,746
Damn it. Grick set me up!

159
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,718
I take it you two are still good friends?

160
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,697
Were good friends is more like it.

161
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,840
Try to keep it down while we're inside.
Everyone's in bed this time of night.

162
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,713
"Everyone"?

163
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:32,938
Mm-hm! This warehouse is run jointly by the
Guardian Wings Military and the Orlandry Merchant Guild.

164
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:36,930
So, at least on paper, it requires
caretakers from both parties.

165
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:39,052
I represent the Orlandry.

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,288
You are the military caretaker.

167
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,590
Yes, that much I know.

168
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,796
Oh, you look so yummy in your uniform!

169
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,110
I feel like I'm choking...

170
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,873
Now, there's really no need
to rain on my parade, is there?

171
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:53,598
Everyone knows good toppings only accentuate the flavor
of a dish, which means to me you're, at the very least,

172
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:56,499
twice as appetizing as I believe I've ever seen you be.

173
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,218
So you're saying my life is in twice as much danger.

174
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,127
Oh no, oh, ye of little faith.

175
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:02,606
Have you already forgotten?

176
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:06,485
While, yes, I may be a troll and while, yes,
you may be an extremely rare feast in my eyes,

177
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,242
I have no plan to dig in.

178
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:08,843
Not yet.

179
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,218
Wow. Thanks.

180
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,510
Can you imagine the shame?

181
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,936
You're the last of your kind, after all.

182
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:21,297
I know better than to waste you on a
passing burst of craving, no matter how strong.

183
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,513
Of course, if you were to give me permission
to eat you, I would certainly consider it.

184
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,647
Do I have your permission?

185
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:30,442
Hell, no.

186
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:32,652
No? Oh, won't you please consider it some more.

187
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,093
I'd be fine with a non-dominant arm.

188
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,141
Even a finger would do for now.

189
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:40,002
Stop it. Can we get down to business, please?

190
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:42,992
So, what exactly am I supposed to do?

191
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:43,985
Not a damn thing.

192
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,743
Huh?

193
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:48,295
Wait, you're not planning to stay
on this island, as well, are you?

194
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,360
Well, obviously. How else will I do my job as caretaker?

195
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:54,142
I'm legitimate military, now, so I'm sticking around.

196
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,695
I only ask because the previous two caretakers
didn't bother showing up after the first day.

197
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,385
Really?

198
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:00,510
What do you want to do?

199
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,154
You don't have to stay here, you know.

200
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,654
I can arrange something.

201
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,927
Off-island accommodations, maybe?

202
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,718
You say that like I won't get stabbed in
the back the moment I take my eyes off you.

203
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,010
Wow, so mean!

204
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:14,343
What kind of monster do you take me for?

205
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,965
The kind that eats people.

206
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,481
Anyway, I'm just not one of those guys
who quits a job they've committed to.

207
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,767
I fully intend to stay right here.

208
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,601
Uh! Oh, I had a feeling I could count on you!

209
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,860
It'll be fun after so long to
get to take care of you again.

210
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,962
That makes me kinda happy.

211
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,984
Don't get the wrong idea, Willem.

212
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,943
This isn't about a man and a woman spending time together.

213
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:44,241
It's about a troll trying to fatten a
tasty-looking lamb before she devours it.

214
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,126
Care to share what that scary look is for?

215
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:48,491
Just to confirm.

216
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,777
You're not planning to eat me, correct?

217
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,052
No, I'm not.

218
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:55,140
Genuinely, my only desire is to take care of you.

219
00:14:55,165 --> 00:15:00,093
Don't you know that trolls are bound by their
natural instinct to serve every guest with dedication?

220
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:03,010
Trust me. I swear I won't try to eat you, yet.

221
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,642
So, in return...

222
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,235
Let me use my other instinct!

223
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,178
Can we get back to the topic?

224
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,802
This building is the weapon warehouse
I'm supposed look after, is that right?

225
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:14,632
You're so mean to me.

226
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,655
And yes, this is the building.

227
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,010
But it looks nothing like a warehouse.

228
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,108
Where do they store all the guns and artillery in here?

229
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,510
Let's continue the discussion tomorrow.

230
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,385
It has gotten rather late.

231
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,234
Plus, the naughty walls have ears.

232
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,718
--I'm sorry! --Hey! Stop shoving me!

233
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:36,677
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

234
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,302
Oh, hi, Nygglatho.

235
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:39,343
Thanks for having us!

236
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,277
Yes! Please, have us!

237
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,561
Get back to your rooms, ladies.

238
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:48,249
'Kay, but before we do, we think it'd be
nice to properly greet the new caretaker.

239
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,033
Go now, or I'll eat you.

240
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,347
Goodnight, Miss Nygglatho.

241
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,800
Goodnight, girls!

242
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,888
Well, how about I show you to your room, then?

243
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,691
It kinda seems like I'm not the only one allergic to you.

244
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:06,102
Oh, you big meanie.

245
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:11,782
All, right.

246
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,917
If anything, this place is unexpected.

247
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,583
Poppa!

248
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,354
Hey, Pops?

249
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:22,792
Sheesh, Poppa, how long are
you planning to stay asleep for?

250
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:26,640
You think he's asleep?

251
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,234
Don't ask me. I've never seen a man before.

252
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,427
We should probably keep it down, guys.

253
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,341
Why do you always have to shove me around like that, gah!

254
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,860
Hey, caretaker. Beautiful night, isn't it?

255
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:39,135
We're here!

256
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:42,127
Shh! Nygglatho will hear you.

257
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:44,806
Shh!

258
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,027
So, who might you girls be?

259
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,468
--My name's Collon! --I'm Pannibal.

260
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,093
If you talk at the same time, he can't hear you!

261
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,777
Sorry, I'm Lakhesh.

262
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:57,355
Collon, Pannibal, Tiat, and Lakhesh.

263
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay, I think I've got your names down.

264
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,985
Where'd you come from, mister?

265
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,802
What's your name?

266
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,093
And out of all these questions you've been asked,

267
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,510
which one will you choose to answer first?

268
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,937
I guess I might as well go with
your question to start this thing off.

269
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,843
Spicy meat dishes are usually my favorite,

270
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:19,078
and I can't stand reptrace cuisine.

271
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,343
Nygglatho and I are basically a farmer and her lost lamb.

272
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:24,778
And I lived on Island Twenty-Eight until this morning.

273
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:29,445
My name's Willem Kmetsch.

274
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,892
You can call me Willem.

275
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,635
I hope you girls like me.

276
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:34,902
I'll be living here.

277
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,468
Wait, you mean you're gonna stay?

278
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:37,479
Probably.

279
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:38,635
Ohh!

280
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,177
It's not that big of a deal.

281
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,574
Oh, but it is.

282
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:45,927
You have to understand, none of the caretakers
with the military have ever lived here before.

283
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,779
Yeah, Nygglatho did mention that.

284
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:49,440
Oh, good grief.

285
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:52,220
How could you possibly think this was a good idea?

286
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,385
You were clearly told to give him space, weren't you?

287
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,882
Um, we sort of, uh...

288
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,677
Curiosity got the best of us!

289
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:02,183
You should have known better. We don't
have the kind of power to resist Curiosity!

290
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,157
Should I let Nygglatho know?

291
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,093
--Have a good night! --Goodnight!

292
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:10,747
Nice to meet you, Willem. See you tomorrow!

293
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,093
I swear, those girls.

294
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,885
Sorry about that.

295
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,269
The little ones tend to get pretty worked up.

296
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:18,318
I don't mind at all.

297
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,580
I'm actually used to dealing with children.

298
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,577
But, what are they doing here?

299
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:27,802
Well, whatever you do, try not
to spoil them too much, okay?

300
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:30,385
We don't want it going right to
their heads, and it will, so...

301
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:32,590
I'll try.

302
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:35,304
Huh?

303
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,343
Oh, um. So, about Pannibal.

304
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,930
Sorry she attacked you.

305
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,736
She didn't mean anything by it.

306
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,037
For what it's worth, I'm not mad.

307
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:47,929
You provided hot water immediately,
so I even avoided getting a cold.

308
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:49,860
Good. Good.

309
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,052
One more thing.

310
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:51,892
Um...

311
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,058
Chtholly.

312
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,851
That's my name. It's Chtholly.

313
00:18:59,279 --> 00:18:59,610
Mm?

314
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:00,927
It's really belated.

315
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:06,357
You know, because the time we've spent in the town
with the fairy tale thing and the cat, and never mind...

316
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,003
Oh, right. Gotcha.

317
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:10,510
It's a pleasure. I'm Willem.

318
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:11,962
Oh, yep.

319
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:13,855
I know.

320
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,525
I was told that.

321
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,828
Anyway. Sorry to disturb you.

322
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,193
Good night.

323
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:25,934
Wait, just for a minute.

324
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,093
There's something I'm kind of confused about.

325
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:29,135
Real quick.

326
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,177
My understanding is I'm a caretaker
for special military weapons.

327
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,092
Correct.

328
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,670
And we're in a warehouse,

329
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,760
a warehouse that's used to store those weapons?

330
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:37,932
That's right.

331
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:43,697
Then why does this look absolutely nothing like a
warehouse? Why don't I see a single weapon anywhere?

332
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,687
And, for the love of all things
confusing, please at least answer this...

333
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,773
Who are you girls?

334
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,939
And why are you living in a military facility.

335
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,010
Did you take this job without knowing we were here?

336
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:58,795
Yeah.

337
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:02,135
And you spent time with the
little ones without knowing anything?

338
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,185
Yeah.

339
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:05,420
Let me, take a wild guess.

340
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:09,052
You're one of those people who
just goes with the flow, aren't you?

341
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,052
Oh, very well.

342
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,303
I can clear this up.

343
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:18,939
The answer to the first set of questions lies in
the second set, and the answer to the second set,

344
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:19,590
well...

345
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,410
It lies in the first set!

346
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,703
Yeah, real clear.

347
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,502
Try not to over think it.

348
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:30,963
The truth is, it's us. We are the special
weapons you were sent here to care for.

349
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:32,563
What...?

350
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:33,677
Make sense?

351
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,468
We're all so glad you've come.

352
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:38,095
Starting tomorrow, you'll be our new caretaker!

353
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:16,759
Here you go.

354
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,777
Thank you, looks good! I'm so hungry!

355
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,635
Should be as good as it looks.

356
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:25,922
Come on! It's the night before the final battle, Pops!

357
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,927
Nothing interesting to say?

358
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:29,206
Huh, like what?

359
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:33,593
"Once this war ends, I'll get married
and have kids," you know, somethin' like that?

360
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,759
Yeah, I dunno.

361
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,468
Seems like asking for bad luck.

362
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:40,873
Why, because it's the kind of thing characters
always like to say right before they're killed?

363
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:44,496
When they get taken out in the beginning
it's supposed to be more dramatic.

364
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,321
I understand that reasoning. I really do,

365
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:50,870
but I think it's sadder when
characters you're attached to die.

366
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:53,802
Either way, though.

367
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:59,732
Must be awful to get killed off because the
creator's just an idiot. No matter their absurd reasoning.

368
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:01,145
Well, yeah.

369
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:06,614
Now, Pops, you're heading into the final
battle, which means we need to find you inspiration.

370
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,302
Something concrete you can hold on to in order to survive!

371
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,760
You know, like a reason to come back here.

372
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,308
Anything'll do.

373
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,522
You've gotta find one.

374
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:23,254
You've got to. Because if you don't, I'm afraid
I won't be able to send you off with a smile.

375
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:27,970
Butter cake.

376
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:29,303
Do what?

377
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:31,543
Yeah, your butter cakes are pretty incredible.

378
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,476
You should bake an extra-large one for my next birthday.

379
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:35,439
For real?

380
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,536
You'll fight to return alive just to eat some cake?

381
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:39,177
Why, you got a problem with that?

382
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:41,731
No, I don't. I just thought that maybe...

383
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:44,861
Fine, whatever.

384
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,887
I'll settle for butter cake.

385
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,292
In return, since you suggested it,

386
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:51,568
I'll feed you so much of that cake

387
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:53,438
you're bound to get heartburn.

388
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:58,215
Unfortunately, the young fighter would never return home.

389
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,885
Less than a year later his world would be gone,

390
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,371
and humanity would be decimated.

391
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,480
Next Episode: late autumn night's dream.
