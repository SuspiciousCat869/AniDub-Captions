Karen: I just wanna say thanks
for all your help.

172
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,179
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

173
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,181
I know how much
you wanted to fight me,

174
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,983
and I'm sorry you didn't get to.

175
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,686
‐ Not even.
If another Squad Jam happens,

176
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,920
we can fight you then.

177
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,889
‐ We got to use
an anti‐tank rifle,

178
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,423
so it was still super fun.

179
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,424
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

180
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,493
Operation Sweets was a success.

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,596
‐ Well, dig in,
'cause I got more.

182
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,998
Team: Oh, we will!

183
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,866
Boss: The 20th's
in a couple days.

184
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,502
Isn't that your birthday,
Karen?

185
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,303
‐ I can't believe
you remembered.

186
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,740
‐ It's a little early,
but this is from us.

187
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,176
‐ We hope you have the happiest
birthday ever, Karen!

[Karen gasps]

189
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,983
Gosh, that's cute.
It's just darlin'.

190
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,619
Thanks, guys.

191
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,621
Both: Hurry up,
and put in on already!

192
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,422
‐ Yeah, we wanna
see how it looks!

193
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,226
‐ Are you excited to finally
meet up with the real Pito?

194
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,194
‐ Mm‐hmm.

195
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,632
What's with the backpack?

196
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,700
‐ An experienced traveler
packs light

197
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,537
and buys whatever they need when
they get where they're going.

198
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,238
You see M anywhere yet?

199
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,474
‐ His name's Goushi,
Goushi Asougi.

200
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:45,178
Goushi: I'm sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in traffic.

201
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,246
‐ Whoa.

202
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,482
‐ Hi, Goushi.
This is Miyu Shinohara.

203
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,053
She's my best friend,
my VR mentor, and Fukaziroh.

204
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,255
‐ 'Sup! Glad to finally meet
the real M!

205
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,824
You're, like,
way hotter than your avatar.

206
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,460
I had a dream we were married.
Weird, huh?

207
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,962
Wanna grab a drink later?

208
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,565
‐ Uh, I'm flattered
you think I'm attractive,

209
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,099
but I can't go out with you,

210
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,968
because I'm in love
with someone else.

211
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,371
‐ Dang it! That someone else
is Pito, isn't it?

212
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,073
‐ That's right.

213
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:18,011
Karen: Goushi,
where exactly are you taking us?

214
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,379
‐ Oh, you don't have to worry.

215
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,815
I'm not kidnapping you
or anything like that.

216
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:25,552
‐ That's good to hear, 'cause,
FYI, we're still teenagers.

217
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,921
Well, I am.
Kohi turns 20 tomorrow.

218
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,824
‐ Oh. I didn't know that.
Happy birthday.

219
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,993
‐ Now you know,
you should get her a present.

220
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,661
‐ I can't now. I'm driving.

221
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,496
My boss might have one
for her, though.

222
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,601
‐ Oh. Hey, your boss wouldn't
happen be Pito, would she?

223
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,835
‐ Uh‐huh.

224
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,704
‐ So what's she like?

225
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,772
‐ I'm not supposed
to say anything.

226
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,641
She wants to surprise you.

227
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,810
But if you want, I can tell you

228
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,845
all about how we met
and fell in love.

229
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,447
‐ Heck, yeah! Go on.
Tell us. Tell us.

230
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,749
‐ I don't know.

231
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,283
‐ Oh, I don't mind, really.

232
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,953
As a matter of fact,
Pito's the one who suggested it.

233
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,590
She said she had nothing
to hide from LLENN.

234
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,158
But it's your call.

235
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,292
‐ Kohi?

236
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,730
‐ Okay. if you don't mind
and Pito said to.

237
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,765
‐ Take a look at this.

238
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,901
Miyu: So what's up
with Mr. Tubbs?

239
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,236
He looks like a beached whale.

240
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,539
Definitely a zero
on the boyfriend scale,

241
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,774
a big, fat zero.

242
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,710
‐ Sorry, why are you
showing this to us?

243
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,412
‐ That's me,
back when I first met Pito.

244
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,181
‐ No way!

245
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,750
Yeah, that is you!

246
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,386
Your, eh, hair's different,
but it's the same handsome face.

247
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,088
‐ Why, thank you very much.

248
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,957
You know,
ever since I can remember,

249
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,491
I'd been grossly overweight.

250
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,295
I had no self‐confidence
and no social skills whatsoever.

251
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,165
And then I saw her.

252
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,502
She was so beautiful,
I fell in love on the spot.

253
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:49,803
Miyu: You ask her out?

254
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,904
‐ No, I stalked her.

255
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,238
‐ Hey, officer!

256
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,609
‐ So, then,
that girl was Pito, I guess?

257
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:56,610
‐ Yeah.

258
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,479
To my eyes, she was a goddess.

259
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:03,049
I've never seen a more beautiful
woman in my life before that day

260
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,818
and haven't seen one since.

261
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,220
‐ Uh, there's
two gorgeous honeys back here.

262
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,289
‐ No offense.
You're both very pretty,

263
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,858
but you don't
hold a candle to Pito,

264
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,393
to me, anyway.

265
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,228
‐ How tragic. Please go on.

266
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,131
‐ We officially met one evening.

267
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,467
I was doing my usual routine,
following her,

268
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,170
staring at her beautiful figure
as she walked,

269
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,207
fantasizing about walking
next to her.

270
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,009
‐ Creepy! And?

271
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,744
‐ All of a sudden, she stopped,

272
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,713
turned around,
and started talking to me,

273
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,982
and then she asked me to come
back to her apartment with her,

274
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,383
‐ so I did.
‐ [squeals]

275
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,086
‐ Before I knew it,
she had me hogtied on the floor.

276
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,322
‐ What?
‐ She scolded me,

277
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,456
then cursed me.

278
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,526
Then she beat the living hell
out of me.

279
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,393
She called me a bastard

280
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,697
and said she knew
I was following her all along.

281
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,434
I found out my goddess
was really a demon in disguise,

282
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,337
a sadist with a penchant
for violence and destruction.

283
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,906
She took a ton
of embarrassing photos

284
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,675
and threatened
to go to the police

285
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,343
and accuse me of stalking.

286
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,246
I was pretty much
her slave after that,

287
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,248
or manservant.
Take your pick.

288
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,784
I was at her beck and call
every day.

289
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,453
I couldn't have a job
or go to college.

290
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,454
‐ That sounds...

291
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,756
‐ Wonderful, I know.

292
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,457
They were
the best days of my life.

293
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,258
Both: Huh?

294
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,826
‐ Living with a beautiful woman

295
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,628
and indulging her whims,

296
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,064
for a man like me,
there's no greater blessing.

297
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,467
‐ [thinking] <i>Now I get it.</i>
<i>"M" stands for "masochist."</i>

298
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,435
‐ Uh‐huh. Sounds like love.

299
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:32,739
‐ It is.
It might not be conventional,

300
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,875
but we loved each other.

301
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,677
We still do.

302
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,613
Miyu: Is that why you lost
all that weight? For her?

303
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,048
‐ Actually, she had me
running errands all the time,

304
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,884
so it just happened.

305
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,218
‐ We should
totally write a book,

306
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,953
"Lose Weight
the Manservant Way"!

307
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,988
[laughs] We'll be rich!

308
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,923
‐ Yeah, no.
‐ Aww.

309
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,291
‐ Anyway, there we were,

310
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,194
living together in our own
happy, warped way,

311
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,698
and then November the sixth,
2022, happened.

312
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,699
‐ Miyu: Huh?
‐ [gasps]

313
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,300
‐ What happened then?

314
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,304
Karen: That's the day
"Sword Art Online" went live.

315
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,108
<i>The day she missed out</i>
<i>on playing a real death game</i>

316
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,344
<i>and started looking for</i>
<i>that experience in other games.</i>

317
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,480
<i>She thought she found it</i>
