152
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,242
to survive here, even if I
have to kill you to do it!

153
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,476

155
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,614
‐ Yes, ma'am!

156
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,517
‐ So, dung beetle,
why the hell are you here?

157
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,185
‐ I wanted to be
a cute girl, is all.

158
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,587
‐ You came here to survive!

159
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,989
And here, you need
one of these to survive.

160
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:46,159
Tell me, do you know
what this is called?

161
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,628
‐ A gun, ma'am?

162
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,864
‐ Correct. You're pretty sharp
for a dung beetle.

163
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,832
‐ [sighs]

164
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,535
‐ You can use
two types of guns here.

165
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,570
One's optical.
The other's live‐ammo.

166
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,705
Your basic optical gun is light.

167
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,307
It shoots longer distances
with accuracy.

168
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,011
The energy packs are a breeze
to swap out, too.

169
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,148
The drawback is, if you
fire it at another player

170
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,051
and their shield's up,
it only does half the damage.

171
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,052
‐ Uh...

172
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,588
‐ And then
there's live‐ammo guns.

173
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,492
The bullets they fire
have actual mass

174
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,663
and can rip through shields
like a hot knife through butter,

175
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,765
but their trajectory's
affected by wind,

176
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,132
and the mags can get heavy.

177
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,635
If you're fighting
monsters in the field,

178
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,836
use an optical gun.

179
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,672
Use live‐ammo guns on players.

180
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,706
You got all that?!

181
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,874
‐ Yes, I think‐‐

182
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,076
‐ "Yes," what?!
‐ Yes, ma'am!

183
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,043
‐ I will now teach you

184
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,279
the basics
of how to handle a gun.

185
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,781
‐ Wh‐What are you doing?!

186
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,516
‐ That is the Bullet Line.

187
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,651
It shows up
when you or your enemy

188
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,186
puts a finger on the trigger.

189
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,622
It shows a bullet's path,
and if you see it,

190
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,223
you either fire
at its origin point

191
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,259
or get the hell out of the way.
You got it?!

192
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,260
‐ Yes, ma'am!

193
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,662
‐ Keep your elbows in,

194
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,431
hold her steady,
and squeeze the trigger.

195
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,168
That is the Bullet Circle.
It shows the area you'll hit.

196
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,204
When you fire,
your bullet will land

197
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,740
at a random point
inside that circle.

198
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,075

Take aim, calm down, and fire.

210

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,791
‐ And with its pink outfit,

308
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:28,328
you won't even know it's there
'til you hear its guns.

309
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,933
‐ <i>It'll ventilate you</i>
<i>before you even</i>

310
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,468
<i>get a chance to see its face.</i>

311
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,207
‐ [gasps]

312
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,577
‐ You're even teenier
than the rumors say.

313
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,279
Nice to meet you, Pink Devil.

314
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,448
I guess you got
so used to beating everyone

315
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,751
that came out here,
you let your guard down.

316
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,886
Are you having fun killing?

317
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,156
I mean, it is "GGO."
It's just a game,

318
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,925
and what's wrong
with killing people in a game?

319
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,994
There's nothing wrong with that.

320
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,362
Even so...

321
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,565
‐ [gasps]

322
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,201
‐ never let your guard down
in here.

323
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,937
‐ Wait. What?
Aren't you gonna shoot me?

324
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,739
‐ Of course not.

325
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,042
I was just curious
what this Pink Devil was like,

326
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,944
so I came to see for myself.

327
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,212
I never expected you'd be

328
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,915
this teeny‐tiny
cutesy‐wootsy girl, though.

329
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,484
Hey, what do you say
we go back to town

330
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,385
and have some drinks?

331
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,253
Let your Big Sis here treat you.

332
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,790
There aren't that many
female players around here,

333
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,658
so we might as well be friends.

334
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,994
Karen: <i>And that's how</i>
<i>I met this strange woman</i>

335
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,197
<i>named Pitohui,</i>
<i>or Pito for short.</i>

336
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:39,800
‐ Ooh!

337
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,669
So that's how you keep
on the down‐low in town.

338
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,337
So sneaky.

339
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,472
Anyway, time for introductions.

340
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,644
My name is Pitohui,
or just Pito for short.

341
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,813
And you? What's your name.

342
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,815
‐ [gasps] Nice to meet you.

343
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,382
I'm LLENN. That's it.

344
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,753
‐ No way? "LLENN"?
That's the cutest name ever.

345
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,855
And relax. I won't bite you.

346
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:02,856
‐ Ohh.
‐ What?

347
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,791
Are my tats freaking you out?

348
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,226
‐ No, not at all.

349
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,929
‐ It's okay. Like I said,
girls are rare here,

350
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,463
so I was always getting hit on,

351
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,433
but once I got my tats,
the creepers left me alone.

352
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,268
Maybe you should
get some yourself.

353
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,671
‐ No, thanks!
Pitohui, have you‐‐

354
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,472
‐ Just Pito is fine.

355
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,074
‐ O‐Okay, Pito.

356
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,044
Have you been playing VR games
a long time now?

357
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,112
‐ Yeah. You could say that.

358
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,616
I've been playing "GGO" since
the very first day it came out.

359
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:33,654
It's got a bloodthirsty vibe you
won't find in other VR games.

360
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,356
How long have you been playing?

361
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,124
‐ This is the first one.

362
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,226
I started about
three months ago, actually.

363
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,695
‐ No way. You're just a noob?

364
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,564
Sneaking up on people
and murdering 'em

365
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,832
left and right
like you do takes talent.

366
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,167
You vicious little thing!

367
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,870
‐ Maybe I should dial
the murdering back a bit.

368
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,472
‐ Not even. Hey, I know.

369
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,174
Let's register as friends.

370
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,142
I can teach you a lot
about this game.

371
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,845
Besides, I'm sick
of playing with sleazy guys.

372
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,514
Come on. What do you say?

373
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,515
‐ Okay.

374
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,318
And that takes care of that.

375
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,287
We're gonna have fun
playing together.

376
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,488
‐ Yep!
‐ [sighs]

377
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,657
I didn't realize it was so late.

378
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,058
You gonna log off?

379
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,927
‐ I wanted to go and check out

380
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,461
some live‐ammo guns
before I did.

381
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,231
‐ Heck, I know
the best place in town.

382
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,335
This shop only deals
in rare secondhand stuff.

383
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,970
Everything here's been looted

384
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,007
from ruins
and the toughest monsters.

385
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,742
LLENN: Wow!

386
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,045
Amazing.

387
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,648
This place has everything.

388
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,916
‐ LLENN, over here.

389
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,551
This looks right up your alley.

390
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,653
It says
it just came in yesterday.

391
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,222
Check it out.

392
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,391
‐ What is that?

393
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,997
Gosh, that's cute.

394
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,866
It's just darlin'!

395
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,669
‐ Someone sounds
like they're from Hokkaido.

396
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,938
‐ I want it. I need it.

397
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,707
I gotta have it!

398
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,511
‐ I know that feeling.

399
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,212
There's nothing
like walking home

400
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,681
with a brand‐spankin'‐new gun.

401
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,551
You wanna get used
to how she handles.

402
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,118
‐ Yup.

403
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,454
‐ Now that she's yours,
she needs a name.

404
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,123
‐ A‐Am I supposed
to give my gun a name?

405
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,291
‐ Yeah, of course.

406
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,426
‐ I wonder what to call her.

407
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,362
I know!

408
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,565
‐ I hope it's cool. Well?

409
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,533
What'd you decide to call her?

410
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,835
‐ She's P‐chan.

411
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,103
‐ Perfect.

412
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,304
Yeah, it fits.

413
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,206
And now that P‐chan's
got her name,

414
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,275
you make sure
to feed her every day

415
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,077
with the blood of your enemies.

416
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,279
A gun will never betray you,

417
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,314
and the more enemies
you kill with her,

418
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,783
the stronger she's gonna be.

419
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,788
‐ Yeah. I'll make sure
to kill tons of enemies!

420
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,725
Karen: <i>So Pito and I teamed up</i>
<i>as a two‐person squad.</i>

421
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,327
<i>Whenever we were online</i>
<i>at the same time,</i>

422
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,797
<i>we'd hang out</i>
<i>or go hunting together.</i>

423
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,700
<i>I never saw her</i>
<i>use the same weapon twice,</i>

424
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,035
<i>so I figured</i>
<i>she was super rich.</i>

425
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:05,238
<i>Other than that, I didn't</i>
<i>really know much about her.</i>

426
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,674
‐ [yawns]
‐ You got any hobbies, Pito?

427
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,976
‐ Huh? Mm...

428
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,612
other than playing "GGO"?

429
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,513
Nothing, really.

430
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,748
‐ Well, I like
listening to music.

431
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,884
I'm really into stuff
like classical and soundtracks.

432
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:21,287
As for pop singers,
Elza Kanzaki's my favorite now.

433
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,123
‐ Music's your thing, huh?

434
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,659
I hardly listen to it,
to be honest.

435
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,029
‐ Seriously? I don't know why,
but I sort of got the impression

436
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,197
you were a huge fan
of music, too.

437
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,733
‐ I can't even read music.

438
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,368
Heck, if you knew me IRL,
you'd be shocked!

439
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,737
‐ Oh, I'm sorry about that.

440
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,005
We shouldn't talk
about real life in here.

441
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,142
‐ No, it's okay. We know
each other pretty well by now.

442
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,745
I mean, at this point,
I don't see what harm it'd do

443
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,180
if we met in the real world
and introduced ourselves.

444
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:51,251
Would you be down for that,
a little off‐line hanging out?

445
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,687
Think you got the guts to?

446
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,423
‐ I don't know. I think
you'd be more surprised than me.

447
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,826
‐ I just got an awesome idea.

448
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,629
How about one of these days,
we have ourselves a duel?

449
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:05,331
And if you can beat me,
you get to pick where we meet.

450
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,701
‐ But I don't wanna
have a duel with you!

451
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,236
Like, there's no way
I'd ever beat you.

452
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,139
‐ Okay.
Then how 'bout this instead?

453
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,742
Train your butt off
'til you think you're ready.

454
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,044
Then, if you can
blow my head off with P‐chan,

455
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,479
we can meet up
anywhere you want.

456
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,048
‐ A‐Are you kidding me?

457
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,617
Okay, you got a deal!

458
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,252
One of these days, me and
P‐chan will take you down.

459
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,889
‐ Sweet.
I'll look forward to it.

460
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,825
Now then,
let's make it official.

461
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:32,959
‐ What do you mean?

462
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,829
‐ To seal the deal,
