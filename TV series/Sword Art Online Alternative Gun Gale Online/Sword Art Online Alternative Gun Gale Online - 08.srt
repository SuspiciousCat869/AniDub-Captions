They won't see me,
'cause of the houses,

322
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,685
but I won't see them, either.

323

That's where you come in.

324
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,655
Find someplace high,
and spot for me.

325
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,591
Every time I shoot,
tell me how far off I was,

326
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:58,992
and I'll adjust my aim.

327
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,294
‐ Okay, but can you
hit 'em like that?

328
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,296
‐ Hah! Can I hit 'em?

329
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,032
Do you know how many hours
I spent practicing?

330

Look, who says you
have to fight eye to eye?

These kind of weapons

334

are all about getting 'em
when they least expect it.

335
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,342
I practiced
by setting up targets,

336
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,912
measuring distances,
and shooting by feel.

337
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,847
I got pretty darn good
at it, too.

338
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,082
Just give me a distance,

339
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,217
and I can hit anything
with my eyes closed.

340

giving me accurate info.

Two are up and running

One more to go.

355
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,998
He's over the platform,

You're a genius with

that's what.
They're working together now.

I bet someone called
for a cease‐fire.

Whoever it is must be
a good negotiator,

'cause they convinced
all those teams to join forces.

393
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,241
Now they're in command
of an army of dozens of people,

they're on their way

403

There's strength in numbers,

they have the numbers.

Sure, M's an amazing player,
