<i>unless you untie it.</i>

167
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,629
‐ Yeah, I know!

168
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,165
[sighs] Stupid knot.

169
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,466

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,943
I took care of SHINC.
How are you doing?

174
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,279
‐ Eh, not good. Frustrated.

175
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,981
LLENN's not coming out.

176
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,384
I shot up her partner
and everything.

177
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,157
I can't believe
she's not coming to her rescue.

178
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,326
‐ God, would you
just finish her already?

179
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,394
[Pito chuckles] What's that?

180
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,131
Kindness? Mercy? Compassion?

181
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,367
M: Mercy and compassion
are the same thing,

182
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,503
and, no, it's not about that.

183
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,740
LLENN isn't coming to save her,
because she doesn't have to.

184
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,942
This isn't a real battle.

185
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,144
And while you mess around
with her friend there,

186
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,979
LLENN's figuring out
our blind spot,

187
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,949
and the last surviving team's
closing in.

188
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,986
I want to X her out ASAP so we
can be ready for everyone else.

189
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,255
Pito: Can't we just wait
a little longer?

190
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,223
‐ Fine. I'll kill her.

Oopsie.

194
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,166
Only got her hand.

195
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,368
Still getting
used to this rifle.

196
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,909
Damn, she's tough!

197
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,178
LLENN sure knows
how to pick a teammate.

198
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,412
[laughs]

199
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,081
She's not a threat anymore,

200
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,817
at least
for the next two minutes.

201
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:28,188
‐ Um, Hey, LLENN,
I got bad news for you.

202
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,824
It was an honor
serving on your team,

203
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,027
<i>but my hands and feet are gone,</i>
<i>and I'm stuck.</i>

204
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,329

charged in by yourself!

205
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,232
<i>‐ Yeah, but I don't regret it</i>

214
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,817
If I killed Pito at the start,

215
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,251
none of this
would have happened!

216
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,055
But they dropped us
so far away from each other,

217
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:05,526
and then people got in the way,
and my ammo supply went down.

218
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,828
And then,
when I finally get to her,

219
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,363
she's turned into
a rampaging monster.

220
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,000
I wanted to take a minute and
figure out a plan of attack,

221
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,202
but everyone just ran in
and got killed.

222
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,042
Instead of doing something,

223
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,346
I'm still
standing here, shaking.

224
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,515
Aah! I've had it!

225
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,717
I'm done worrying about Pito!

226
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,253
She can win this thing
for all I care!

227
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,656
She's so strong,
she probably will.

228
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,092
Why should I stress over someone
killing her before I do?!

229
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,994
That's her problem, not mine!

230
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,463
And if she kills me first,
that's fine, too.

231

00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,509
I'll use my gun
if I have bullets left

Are you worried I'll miss her
from here or something?
