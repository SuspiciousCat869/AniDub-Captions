You don't even need to bag it!

Oh, I love you.

I didn't think
I'd ever find you again.

00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,156
Now then, what to call you.

P‐chan two?
Or P‐chan the second?

No, we're just
gonna go with P‐chan.

Ohh. I can't wait

‐ Man, talk about fast.

‐ No wonder she's so famous.

28

she did it.

the best moves ever!

not my moves. They're LLENN's.

‐ That's totally the same thing.

You control your avatar's moves,
after all.

Without you, LLENN wouldn't be
as amazing as she is,

But, like, it's true.

out of all of us.

Look at how burly Sophie is.

46
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,534
She's way scarier‐looking
than my avatar.

‐ [laughs] I don't know.

48
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,506
You're both pretty intimidating.

this is my avatar.
Her name's Toma.

‐ Mi's from Russia, and one
of the coolest things about her

52
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,481
is her real‐life skill.

53
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,284
Her dad taught her
how to drive a stick shift.

Mm, I'm sorry
if I seem pretentious.

62
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,705
‐ Huh?
‐ Oh, Moe's always been weird

63
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,507
about the avatar she got,
'cause she thinks

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,643
she looks
like some stuck‐up celebrity.

65
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,311
We told her it's no big deal,
but still...

66
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,648
‐ My turn! Check it out.

67
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,816
Tanya's the girl
I get to play as.

68
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,754
‐ Risa's the only one whose
avatar sort of looks like her.

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,524
‐ That's it! Now you know which
avatar each one of us plays as.

70
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,726
‐ Thanks. That helps a lot.

71
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,829
Um, do you still want
to watch the rest of it?

00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,965
‐ Yeah, of course we do.
‐ Naturally!

73
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,533
‐ We wouldn't miss it!
‐ Please. Please.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,734
‐ Heck, yeah, we're watching!

75
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,970
‐ We wouldn't miss
this opportunity.

76
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,171
The whole point of us

77
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,806
coming here to watch
the footage with you

78
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,241
is so you can explain
how you killed us all.

79
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,143
That way,
we can take a bunch of notes

80
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,378
and learn from our mistakes

81
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,947
so, the next time we play,
we can beat you.

82
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,716
All: Please teach us your ways!

83
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,950

86
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,462
‐ Do you guys always have
your study sessions together?

87
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,465
‐ Doing stuff like this
helps us be a better team.

88
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,134
‐ How?
‐ It's hard to believe now,

89
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,404
but last year around April,
we didn't get along at all.

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,639
‐ That is hard to believe.

91
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,208
‐ Back then,
we were totally hopeless.

92
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,712
When we'd try to do a routine,
we'd be all out of sync.

93
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,616
Do you know what
a full‐dive Sports Simulator is?

94
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,250
‐ Mm‐mmm.

95
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,885
‐ It's popular with athletes.

96
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,354
With it, you can practice
your form and technique

97
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,789
in any sport virtually.

98
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,290
You still need
real‐world strength

99
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,792
to get anything
out of it, though.

100
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,062
‐ Is that why you were so nimble
during our last battle,

101
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,531
'cause you used that to train?

102
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,865
‐ [giggles] A little.

103
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,834
Like I said,
we didn't get along,

104
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,202
and we were getting
on the coach's nerves.

105
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,403
‐ Boing!

106
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,540
‐ Hey!

107
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,976
Sorry. Anyway, our coach
finally told us all,

108
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,110
"Before I can do anything,

109
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,813
you girls need to work
on becoming a team first,"

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,150
so we all talked
and came up with an idea.

111
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,384
‐ Play a game together.

112
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,187
‐ Exactly!
If we formed a party in a game,

113
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,957
we'd naturally be forced
to work together to beat it.

114
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,693
‐ And playing characters
in a virtual world made it easy

115
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,663
to forget the issues we had with
each other in the real world.

116
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,397
‐ Huh.

117
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,867
[thinking]
<i>In a way, we're a lot alike.</i>

118
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,503
Boss: Our world is nothing
like the one in "GGO,"

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,672
so when we heard about it,
we thought, "Yeah!

120
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,407
Let's try this game where
we have to kill to survive."

121
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,810
‐ So you started playing it,
and then‐‐

122
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,179
Kana: Yup. We totally
got hooked on it.

123
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,747
‐ We still have
our disagreements.

124
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,784
‐ But after so many battles
where we almost died...

125
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,851
[all giggle]

126
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,287
‐ we get along
better than ever now!

127
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,690
‐ I'm glad it all worked out.

128
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,825
‐ We wanna keep getting better,

129
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,927
and if they decide
to have another SJ,

130
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,196
our goal's to become
the number one team!

131
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,231
‐ Uh, what about gymnastics?

132
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,166
‐ Huh? Oh, sure.

133
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,068
But we really
wanna win at "GGO."

134
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,436
So how about you?

135
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,672
If they have another tourney,
are you gonna enter?

136
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,409
‐ Uh, not if
something important comes up.

137
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,645
There's stuff
I wish I could do over,

138
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,914
but I got
what I wanted out of it.

139
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,450
Besides, teaming up with M
was a one‐time thing.

140
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,653
‐ I don't know
how I feel about that.

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,022
Part of me's happy,
and part of me's not.

142
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,190
Without you there,
it'd be easier to win,

143
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,260
but what sucks is
we won't get the challenge

144
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,929
of fighting you again.

145
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,065
Thanks for
having us over today.

146
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,535
Girls: Thanks for
the tea and cookies, too!

147
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,103
‐ Hope we didn't take up
too much of your time.

148
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,706
‐ No, you didn't.
I'm on spring break.

149
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,275
‐ You're so lucky!
You can full‐dive all you want.

150
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,045
‐ Actually, I can't.
I'm going to visit my folks.

151
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,614
‐ Then while you're gone,
we'll be training

152
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,783
and practicing tactics
and getting stronger.

153
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,085
‐ [chuckles]
If they have another tourney,

154
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,987
you'll have a good chance
at winning.

155
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,690
[Boss groans]
It's really gonna suck

156
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,959
if we don't get
to fight you again.

[laughs]
Welcome back to Hokkaido!

159
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,935
Bet it's super cold
for a Tokyo girl like you.

160
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,171
‐ Ooh! Love the hair!
‐ [camera snapping]

161
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,305
You look cute!

162
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,974
Did your folks
flip out about it?

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,242
I bet they did.
They did, didn't they?

164
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,745
Gotta get the back. Oh, yeah!

165
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,180
Okay, look over here!

166
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,082
Hot. Very hot!

167
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,417
Now, uh, lose the sweater.

‐ I saw the video.

170
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,955
SJ looked like
it was a blast to play,

171
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,125
and, oh, my gosh, you fought
like such a beast out there.

172
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,494
No mercy. Like, I like it.

173
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,163
So, girl, what's the deal
with you and M?

174
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,364
Why'd you split up?

175
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,166
‐ [tape fast‐forwards]
‐ Interesting.

176
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,136
Oh, well, as long as he doesn't
know your name and address,

177
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,137
you're fine.

178
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,171
‐ Yeah, I guess.

179
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,073
I doubt we'll ever
meet in real life.

180
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,210
‐ Hope not. Some hard‐core
gamers can be such weirdoes.

181
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,345
Heck, I'm one of 'em,
so I should know!

182
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,847
Speaking of, the other day,

183
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,582
I got owned
by this Zekken person.

184
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,917
They were so good,

185
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,719
they must have spent
thousands of hours playing!

186
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,687
I'm talkin' all day,
all night playing!

187
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,222
Now that's not normal.

188
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,924
‐ Oh, wow.

189
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,927
‐ Ooh, they got more
Elza Kanzaki songs.

190
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,128
‐ [gasps]

191
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,631
‐ I wonder when
her next concert's gonna be.

192
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,032
I heard she's taking a break.

193
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,100
I think she's traveling
overseas or something.

194
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,771
Hopefully she'll be back soon,
but for now, let's rock.

Easy, LLENN! Don't scream.
It's me, M.

233
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,307
‐ [stammers]

234
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,576
You're kidding.

235
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,177
You're M? I don't believe it.

236
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,179
‐ But I really am M.

237
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,617
‐ O‐Okay, let's just say
you are M for now.

238
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,854
How'd you know I'm LLENN,
and how'd you find me?

239
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,421
‐ I'll explain later.

240
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,890
I had to talk to you,

241
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,592
'cause something
important's come up.

242
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,126
We shouldn't be seen together.

243
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,028
Is there
someplace quiet we can go

244
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,364
where we can, you know,
sit down and talk?

245
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,133
‐ And what'll happen
if I say no?

246
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,704
‐ If you do, on the night
of the next Squad Jam,

247
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,273
someone will die.

248
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,611
M: There.

249
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,812
‐ Thanks.

250
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,617
Are you really M from the game?

251
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,786
‐ Yup.
‐ Can you prove it?

252
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,253
‐ No, I can't.

253
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,022
‐ [creak]
‐ Mm.

254
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,191
Why should I believe
anything you say, then?

255
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,327
‐ Look, I'm not lying.
I wish I had proof, but I don't.

256
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,564
‐ You could tell me something
only M and I would know.

257
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,299
‐ Even if I did,
what's to stop you

258
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,735
from thinking I heard it
from the "real" M?

259
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,004
See, there's that. I'm sorry,

260
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,573
but you just have to trust
that I'm telling the truth.

261
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,641
‐ That's so not fair.

262
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,209
‐ No, it's not.

263
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,445
‐ You still haven't
answered my first question.

264
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:55,448
How'd you know I was LLENN,
and where'd you get my address?

265
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,785
‐ I'll tell you, but you
have to hear me out first.

266
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,486
I'm sorry.
It has to be that way.

267
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,988
‐ Go ahead.

268
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,224
Tell me whatever it is
that's so important.

269
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,327
But before you start, can you
at least tell me your name?

270
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,163
‐ Oh, yeah, right.
It's Goushi Asougi.

271
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,566
I'm sorry I didn't
introduce myself before.

272
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,569
‐ All right, Goushi.
Let's hear what you wanna say.

273
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,738
‐ Please, Karen!
‐ [gasps]

274
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,606
‐ Don't talk. Just listen.

275
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,874
There's something I need,

276
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,009
and you're the only one
I can turn to.

277
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,779
<i>‐ Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>Is he hitting on me?</i>

278
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,148
‐ I'm sorry to have
to dump this on you,

279
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,751
but if you don't help,
two people will die.

280
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,752
‐ Pardon?

281
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,554
‐ Two people will die,

282
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,122
me and the real Pitohui.

283
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,891
‐ Say what?

284
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,993
Does this have anything to do

285
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,729
with what you told me
back in SJ about Pito?

286
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,532
‐ It does,
and I meant every word of it.

287
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,268
Pito really is crazy.

288
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,804
‐ You're not gonna cry again,
are you?

289
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,173
‐ Pito's signing up for SJ 2.

290
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,876
She's forcing me
to put a team together.

291
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,344
‐ With you and Pito
on the same team,

292
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,514
you guys have
a good shot at winning.

293
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,550
‐ And she'll be playing to win,
that's for sure.

294
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,918
But like everything with her,

295
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,687
the stakes are
what matters most.

296
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,189
She told me
that if she didn't win,

297
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,457
she was going to commit suicide,

298
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,160
not in the game, for real.

299
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,929
‐ [stammers]

300
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,031
‐ She said I have to die, too,

301
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,867
and that if I didn't
kill myself, she'd kill me.

302
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,803
When she says
she's gonna do something,

303
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,538
she does it,
and there's no stopping her.

304
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,509
‐ So you're pretty much
in the same situation as before.

305
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,243
‐ Yeah.

306
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,945
‐ [moans]

307
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,346
This is nuts.

308
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,382
Why is Pito forcing you
to do weird stuff like this?

309
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,584
It's just a game.

310
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,720
You shouldn't have to die
for real if you lose.

311
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:43,223
‐ She's been obsessed with death
for as long as I've known her.

312
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,992
She's always looking
to put herself in situations

313
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,261
‐ where her life is on the line.
‐ Why is that?

314
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,464
‐ It goes all the way back
to "Sword Art Online."

315
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,668
Try to imagine what it was like
being trapped in it.

316
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,638
You can't log out,
knowing that if you died there,

317
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,640
you'd also die
in the real world.

318
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,343
‐ Wait. Are you telling me Pito
is one of the "SAO" survivors?

319
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,047
‐ Uh‐uh. I mean, technically
she played it and didn't die,

320
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,482
but she's not an "SAO" survivor.

321
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,717
She's the opposite.

322
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,185
‐ What do you mean?

323
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,321
‐ In a twisted way,
she's more like an "SAO"...

324
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,957
failure, or loser.

325
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,692
‐ An "SAO" loser?

326
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,495
‐ The real Pito played "SAO"
during the beta‐testing phase.

327
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,532
She played it all the time,
day in, day out.

328
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,635
She was even looking forward
to playing the official release

329
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,236
the day it went public.

330
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,072
‐ But she didn't get to.

331
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,574
‐ No, she didn't.

332
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,577
That day, she had something
she couldn't get out of,

333
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,513
something life‐changing,
an amazing opportunity,

334
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,517
and she couldn't pass it up.
She cried her eyes out,

335
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:47,253
and then she made the decision
that set her life's course.

336
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,522
Thank God.

337
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,090
‐ She made the right choice.

338
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,693
She didn't get trapped
in "SAO" with the others.

339
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,027
Talk about lucky.

340
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,262
‐ That's what a normal person
would think,

341
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,398
but Pito's not normal.

342
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,234
When she found out
"SAO" was a game

343
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:04,938
where the life‐or‐death stakes
were real, she snapped.

344
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,107
She cursed herself
for missing out on it,

345
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:11,144
and she screamed, wailed,
sobbed, became violent.

346
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,614
Death was her obsession,

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,950
and the chance to experience it
had escaped her.

348
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,753
Pito raged for a long time,

349
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,522
but she eventually cooled off.

350
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,457
She started putting
all her energy into her work,

351
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,493
and, as a result,
she became very successful.

352
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,396
‐ So she's the president
of a company or something?

353
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,366
‐ Yeah, you can say that.
Anyway, ever since the newer,

354
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,502
safer VR games
landed on the market,

355
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,038
she's been spending
all her free time playing,

356
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,642
although they don't
seem to satisfy her.

357
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,110
Games that don't have
real life‐or‐death stakes

358
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,279
aren't enough
to get her pulse racing.

359
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,414
‐ <i>It doesn't need to be racing.</i>

360
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,183
<i>Normal games</i>
<i>are intense enough.</i>

361
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,785
<i>You don't have to die.</i>

362
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,554
‐ And then about two years

363
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,956
after Pito started
that new career of hers,

364
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,891
the "SAO" Incident was over.

365
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,993
When she heard the stories
the survivors told

366
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,228
about the nightmare
they just lived through,

367
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,364
it set her off again,
but even worse.

368
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,733
‐ [gasps]
‐ She heard about these players

369
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,770
who roamed the game
killing others in cold blood.

370
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,906
They were in a guild that
specialized in assassination.

371
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,141
‐ What?!
I thought that was a rumor.

372
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,743
‐ It wasn't.

373
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,478
According to the survivors,

374
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,981
killing was this group's
reason for living,

375
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,383
and they slaughtered
countless innocent people.

376
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,819
In the end,
a group of players got together

377
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,220
and hunted them down,

378
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,723
killing most of them
and locking up the rest.

379
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,492
‐ That sounds like a nightmare.

380
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,961
‐ I thought so, too,
but Pito didn't.

381
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,631
In her mind, it was
the perfect opportunity.

382
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,132
If she'd been in "SAO,"

383
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,001
she could have been
an assassin like them

384
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,603
or the one
that brought them down.

385
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,838
For her, it was
all about the killing.

386
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,372
It didn't matter who or why.

387
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,843
She missed her chance to kill,
and that frustrated her.

388
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,477
‐ That's crazy.

389
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,214
‐ I know.
That's what I've been saying.

390
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,283
She's even more obsessed
with that goddamn "SAO" now

391
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,852
than she ever was before.

392
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,054
I mean, for the past few months,

393
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,123
she seemed to be
doing all right.

394
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,660
Playing "GGO" was letting her
blow off some steam.

395
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:09,029
But when she
couldn't participate in SJ,

396
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,131
it caused her
to relapse something awful.

397
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,167
Pito: <i>I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking,</i>

398
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,537
<i>how'd I know?</i>
<i>It's simple, really.</i>

399
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,740
<i>I'm here for the same reason.</i>

400
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,509
<i>There's all kinds of stuff</i>
<i>in my real life that I hate</i>

401
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:25,946
<i>or can't do anything about,</i>
<i>but here in "GGO,"</i>

402
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,682
<i>I get to unload</i>
<i>on monsters and people</i>

403
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:31,251
<i>and kill the hell out of them</i>
<i>with no regrets.</i>

404
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,022
‐ So the reason Pito
wants to gamble her life

405
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,424
is to turn SJ 2
into another death game,

406
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,293
and all because
she wants to experience

407
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,728
what being in one's like?

408
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:42,729
‐ That's right.

409
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,397
‐ But what can I do? I mean,

410
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,300
shouldn't you tell, like,
the police or a psychiatrist?

411
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,203
‐ I can't.
If this is what she wants,

412
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,705
I have to go along with it.

413
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:55,642
‐ But why? Is it because
you respect her intentions?

414
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,643
‐ Yeah.

415
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,945
‐ Even if it means
doing something crazy

416
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,081
or, worse, suicidal?

417
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,383
‐ Yes.
‐ Uh...

418
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,219
sorry. I don't understand
any of this.

You want me to beat her?!

If you do, I guarantee
she won't commit suicide,
