Hah! You missed!

Light her up with your Line.

168

When she dodges it,
I'll take the shot.

Man #2: They're holding
at 855 meters.

179
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,753
We should still
be out of their range.

180
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,454
Not sure what they're
up to, though.

181

‐ I don't get it either.
Don't let your guard down.

Boss: <i>Sophie, you're up.</i>

[M panting]

189
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:34,668
No way. They got themselves
a PTRD‐41,

190
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,070
the Degtyaryov anti‐tank rifle.

191

Moe: I still can't believe

193
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,446
we finally got our hands
on an anti‐tank rifle.

194
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,282
Risa: We couldn't have gotten it
if it weren't for Sinon's help!

195
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,218
‐ It's great, but a big piece
of gear like that

196
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,087
will be hard to carry
during battle.

197
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,090
Me and Kana are both
strong enough to carry it.

198
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,026
Plus, our shoulders
can be used to stabilize it.

199
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,995
‐ No way. I don't like it.

200
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,497
If one of you guys gets shot,
we lose a player,

201
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:05,999
and we can't use
the gun anymore.

202
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,635
‐ Actually, it'd be better
if one of us gets shot.

203
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,972
In fact, if it comes down to it,
I'd happily die for the cause.

‐ [gasps]
‐ Remember?

205
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,476
In SJ, a corpse is
an Immortal Object

206
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,345
and stays put for ten minutes
where it was killed.

207
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,048
That means for ten minutes,
my body will be

208
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,385
an invincible pedestal
and block all the bullets.

209
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,126
We brought along something
special just for this moment

210

It's the ultimate anti‐M weapon.

We call it the M‐gun!

212

Time to die!

213
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,972
M: They have
a Degtyaryov anti‐tank rifle!

214
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,774
One shot from it,
and you're dead!

215
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,876
Find some cover, and stay down!

00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,385

Thanks, Sophie! We did it!

‐ All right!
That takes care of M's shield.

227
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,262
Time for the next assault.

00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,064
Get ready to charge!

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,966
Tanya, take point again.

230
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,468
Toma, drop the rifle,
and take flank.

231
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,304
Roza, as soon as you're
in range, light 'em up.

‐ A pincer attack?

251
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,687
‐ Yeah. Here's the plan.

252
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,924
At the 14‐minute mark,
we'll confirm PM4's position,

253
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,926
then attack 'em from the south.

254

Once we're set,
you hit 'em from the north

9 1/2 minutes later.

256

Move in, and take Pitohui out.

‐ I don't know about this.

258
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,003
That's nine minutes
you'll be fighting PM4 alone.

‐ Don't you worry.

260
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,641
We have something that'll
punch through M's shield.

261
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,376
They won't have time
to realize we're the diversion.

00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,979
And besides,
even if they wipe us out,

263
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,581
it'll still be worth it.
