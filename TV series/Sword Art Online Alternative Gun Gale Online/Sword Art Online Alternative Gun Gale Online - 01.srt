00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,003
Damn it!

[automatic gunfire]

159
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,344
‐ It shouldn't
be much longer now.

00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,947
LLENN: <i>What shouldn't?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>

161
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,817
‐ Nothing.
Just stay where you are.

162
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,724
‐ We're a rapid‐fire nightmare,
yo! Boo‐yah!

163
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,293
‐ We won't stop firing
'til we run out of bullets!

164
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,864
‐ The Japan Machine Gun Lovers
are here to get it on!

165
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,866
Whoo‐hoo!

166
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,837
‐ Uh...

167
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,039
‐ Yo, we got bogies on ou‐‐

168
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:29,743
‐ It's a sniper!

169
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,612
[gasps] They're behind‐‐

170
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,346
‐ Take cover!

171
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,081
‐ Oh, crap!

172
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,586
‐ [gasps] The shooting stopped.

173
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,487
M: <i>Another team</i>
<i>snuck up behind them</i>

174
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,123
<i>and started picking them off.</i>

175
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,725
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

176
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,360
<i>I'm heading over to you now,</i>
<i>so don't shoot me.</i>

177
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,564
‐ [sighs] That was too close.

178
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,700
I almost died
without firing a single shot.

179
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,902
[bush rustling]

180
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,903
Hey, M.

181
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,405
‐ You can borrow my scope.

182
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,243
I didn't tell you before, but I
saw that other team on the scan.

183
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,312
They were close enough that I
figured they'd move on 'em.

184
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,149
‐ How come the machine gunners
didn't notice them?

185
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,284
‐ Don't know. Maybe when
they checked the scan,

186
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,353
they didn't realize
they were as close as they were.

187
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,390
Or maybe they saw how close you
were and didn't check their six.

188
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,192
Either way,
those guys were sloppy.

189
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,696
‐ Wait! This whole time,
you were using me as a decoy

190
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,831
to get
the machine gunners killed?!

191
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,666
‐ Yup.

192
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,634
‐ Glad I could help out.

193
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,236
‐ Let's watch the action
from here.

194
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,407
There were five machine gunners.

195
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,376
Three are dead. That leaves two.

196
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,412
‐ They're totally distracted
by the sniper team.

197
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,947
Wanna take 'em out?

198
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,182
‐ No way.

199
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,918
We're gonna sit here
nice and quiet for now.

200
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:45,852
‐ [groans]

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,487
‐ Movement to the left of them

202
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,522
on the wide street.

203
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,924
Behind that torn‐up bus.

204
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,395
You see how they're advancing?
Nice and tactical.

205
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,496
‐ Just the four?

206
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,164
‐ No, that's not the whole team.

207
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,600
‐ How do you know?

208
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,635
‐ Where are the others?
You see 'em?

209
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,204
‐ No, but they're out there.

210
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,106
Those four are taking
the shortest route

211
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,208
to the machine gunners.
They're using cover and moving

212
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,943
like they know
where they're going.

213
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,246
That means there's probably
two snipers up in a building

214
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,915
telling them which way to go.

215
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,918
They're the ones that took out
the machine gunners.

216
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,821
Wherever they are,
they had nice, clean shots.

217
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,288
‐ I don't see 'em.

218
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,657
‐ That's the point.

219
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,358
A sniper that reveals
their position

220
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,062
by letting their barrel hang out
in the open's a dead sniper.

221
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,932
I gotta hand it to 'em,
splitting up a team of six

222
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,801
the way they're doing's
a heck of a strategy.

223
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,102
Whoever they are,

224
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,404
they definitely know
what they're doing.

225
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,373
Those two are goners for sure.

226
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,177
‐ Huh?
‐ Eh?

227
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,779
‐ Run!

228
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,885
‐ [yelps]

229
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,359
‐ They're out in the open now.

230
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,761
You gonna shoot 'em, or what?

231
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,128
‐ Hell, no.

232
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,030
I could take one of 'em out,

233
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,933
but the others would scatter
by the time I reset.

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,769
Better to let 'em go.

235
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,436
Besides, they won't
bother with us.

236
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,906
They probably think
we retreated into the forest.

237
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,407
‐ They're on the move now!

238
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,876
‐ Got snipers.
‐ Where?

239
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,079
‐ The building with the arch,
coming down the side.

240
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,050
‐ What the heck? No way.

241
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,420
‐ They're rappelling. Way faster
than taking the stairs.

242
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,256
I didn't know you could get
a skill like that here.

243
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,257
I want it.

244
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,594
‐ That's not
just the "GGO" skill.

245
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,929
Trust me. I have it.

246
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,598
The version
you can get in‐game

247
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,001
doesn't let you descend as fast
as those guys are doing it.

248
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,903
‐ Then how?
‐ Like I said,

249
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,005
they didn't pick up
moves like that in here.

250
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,307
Those guys know
how to rappel for real,

251
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,009
and they're good at it.

252
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,712
‐ Who are they?
Mountain climbers, maybe?

253
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,313
‐ Not the way they handle guns.

254
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,416
‐ If you know what they do
in the real world,

255
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,854
why don't you just come
right out and tell me already?

256
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,990
‐ It's a guess, but seeing
how they move as a unit,

257
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,027
have tactical skills,
and rappel as fast as they do,

258
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,097
I have a feeling they all
have serious combat training.

259
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:11,898
‐ For real?

260
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,000
‐ Those guys are pros.

261
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,670
Handling weapons
is part of their job.

262
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,305
They might be cops or soldiers,

263
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,743
maybe even special forces.
Take your pick.

264
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,911
‐ [gasping]

265
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,284
What?! Isn't that the same
as cheating, then?!

266
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,620
They can't play if they're
professional soldiers!

267
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,523
‐ Last time I checked the rules,
they didn't say they couldn't.

268
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,858
‐ [groans]

269
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,226
‐ "GGO" is perfect
for folks like them.

270
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,996
They can play it to train,
and now with Squad Jam,

271
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,098
they can test their skills
against others.

272
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,601
‐ So now what?
If we don't take them out,

273
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,236
we can't get in the city,
and we're stuck.

274
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,706
Can't we just charge in,
guns blazing?

275
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,509
‐ Nope.
‐ Can't we at least try it?!

276
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,377
Fine. Have it your way.

277
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,013
Okay, now what do we do?

278
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,115
‐ You consider yourself lucky?

279
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,283
‐ Excuse me?

280
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,786
‐ Up to this point,
would you say your life's

281
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,621
been blessed with good luck?

282
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,456
‐ Hmm, never thought about it.

283
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,526
You know, yeah!

284
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,460
My life has been lucky.

285
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,362
I'm a lucky girl.

286
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,397
[thinking]
<i>I think.</i>

287
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,933
‐ Good enough.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,002
We're gonna bet
on that luck of yours.

289
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,571
We'll wait here
'til the next scan.

290
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,773
If luck's on our side,
we'll make our move.

291
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,974
‐ What are you thinking?

292
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,010
‐ I'm betting
the machine gunners

293
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,747
made so much noise it attracts
the other teams to the area.

294
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,448
While the pro team's
dealing with them,

295
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:39,185
we'll hop onto the highway and
make a beeline to the end of it.

296
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,054
Then, we'll head
into the residential area

297
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,889
and hide there
'til the next scan.

298
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,025
‐ Sounds like a plan.

299
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,229
‐ If there's another team
within three klicks of us,

300
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,565
there's a chance
we'll run into them.

301
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,468
‐ Seven teams gone.

302
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,370
That leaves 16 in play.

303
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,739
[gasps] See that?

304
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,441
There's three teams closing
on the pros and one straggler.

305
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:06,079
‐ Guess you were right
about your luck. Good for us.

306
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,915
Bad for those
other teams, though.

307
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,019
‐ Well?
‐ Looks good.

308
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,655
We'll wait
'til the fireworks start

309
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,557
and then get
the hell out of here.

Thank goodness.

‐ And that does it for the scan.

361
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,458
It looks like 15 teams
have been killed off so far.

That leaves eight, including us.

Luck's definitely
on our side today.

‐ Which of the other teams do
you think's gonna come after us?

365
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,901
‐ There's two in the forest
that are close,

366
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,269
but we can ignore them.

367
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,672
Looks like they're having
a bit of a standoff.

368
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,174
‐ If each one's waiting
for the other to make a move,

369
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,809
they'll be there a long time.

370
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,212
‐ I have a feeling this team'll
sneak up on them from behind.

371
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,881
That'll shake things up.

372
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,650
The team at the spaceship
in the marsh

373
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,118
has the upper hand,
tactically speaking.

374
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,220
If they're smart,
they'll stay put.

375
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,322
‐ Hmm.
‐ As for the team in the desert

376
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,758
and the one in the prairie,

377
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,593
I don't know what
their next move's gonna be,

378
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,362
especially the one
near the ruins.

379
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,464
It's weird
they haven't entered them.

380
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,266
It's a good place to dig in.

381
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,969
‐ Mm‐hmm. I was just thinking
the same thing.

'til the next scan.

We got bigger fish to fry
right here.

384
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,376
‐ Yeah you're right,
the pro team.

385
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,080
‐ If they're not in this to win,
but for combat experience,

386
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,248
they won't wait
for others to come to them.

387
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,918
They'll go after
the closest team, us.

388
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:09,289
‐ Well, now what're we gonna do?
We can't beat pro soldiers.

389
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,126
‐ Well, if we play
our cards right,

390
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,995
there's a good chance we can.
