00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,978

00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960

‐ Rest in peace,
whoever you are.

183
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,487
Did you see that, M?!
I got him good!

184
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:56,456
‐ Yeah. I'll say you did.

185
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,726
‐ I can't believe
what an amazing shot you are!

186
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,729
I mean, you didn't waste
a single bullet!

187
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,867
But don't you think
it's kind of weird

188
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,468
they didn't dodge
your Bullet Lines?

189
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,737
‐ They didn't,
'cause they couldn't see 'em.

190
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,373
‐ What are you talking about?
They had to have.

191
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,575
It's supposed to show up

192
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,843
when you put your finger
on the trigger.

193
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,513
I only touched the trigger
when I fired.

194
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,615
‐ Then what about
your Bullet Circle?

195
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,216
‐ I never even saw it.

196
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,352
‐ But then,
how did you aim without it?

197
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,691
‐ Directly.

198
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,458
‐ Huh?

199
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,264
Pito: "GGO" is
a game in the end,

200
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,365
so it needs to be fun.

201
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,768
Certain things are rigged
to be a lot easier

202
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,437
to do here than in real life.
Like shooting.

203
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,206
LLENN: I'm not sure I get it.

204
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,775
‐ I guess the easiest way
to explain is,

205
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,411
say the you in the real world
had a real P90.

206
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,447
Do you think you could hit
a real target from 100 meters

207
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,016
as easy as you can in "GGO"?

208
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,252
‐ I guess not?
I don't know. Maybe?

209
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,123
‐ Nope. In the real world,
there's no system assist.

210
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:03,990
‐ Sorry, a what?

211
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,626
‐ It's called system assist.

212
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,394
As long as your target's in your
Bullet Circle when you fire,

213
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,563
the game pretty much guarantees

214
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,932
you'll score a hit
on it somewhere.

215
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:17,137
You think it's your skill,
but it's the game helping you.

216
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,304
‐ I see.

217
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,774
‐ The assist gets better
the more you level up,

218
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,377
and the higher your level gets,
the better the gun you can get,

219
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,712
which makes you more accurate.

220
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,914
Everything gets easier,

221
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,950
so the player can get
stronger and stronger.

222
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,886
‐ Or faster and faster,
in my case.

223
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,254
‐ I did a test once

224
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,790
where I had my target centered
in my Bullet Circle.

225
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,158
I had it lined up perfect,

226
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,293
then pulled the trigger hard,
so my rifle jerked.

227
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,830
It was sloppy, but where do
you think that bullet ended up?

228
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,299
‐ In the circle?
'Cause the assist?

229
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,803
‐ Not just in the circle.
It hit the target dead center.

230
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,673
That made me see
the trigger on a gun's

231
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,541
like the button
on a controller.

232
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,544
‐ I wonder what would happen

233
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,312
if GGO got rid of the assist,

234
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,815
you know, to make shooting
exactly like real life.

235
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,084
‐ Trying to hit a target
from 100 meters

236
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,352
with an assault rifle
would be impossible.

237
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,790
Without the assist, this would
be the crappiest game ever.

238
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,725
‐ And no one would play it.

239
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,027
‐ Yup. It's a game, after all.

240
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,096
If it were
a straight‐up simulator,

241
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,664
it wouldn't be any fun.

242
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,000
"GGO" works fine as is.

243
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,502
‐ I have a question, ma'am!

244
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,338
What if a good shooter
in real life played this?

245
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,273
Would they be
just as good in the game?

246
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,744
‐ I wondered the same thing,
so I asked someone I knew

247
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,313
with real‐world
shooting experience to play.

248
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,515
‐ How'd they do?

249
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,551
‐ Eh, it was a little confusing
for him at first,

250
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,319
but after he got used to it‐‐

251
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,788
heh‐‐he was
hitting targets like a boss.

252
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,757
‐ Oh.

253
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,626
‐ After he got done
playing the game,

254
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,360
he said something interesting.

255
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,897
He said the Bullet Circle had
a positive and a negative side.

256
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,398
‐ Negative, how?

257
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,769
‐ The assist lets you hit
a target without really trying,

258
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,370
so the practice
you get shooting here

259
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,372
isn't the same
as what you get in reality.

260
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,843
He thought there was a chance
it'd make you a worse shot.

261
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,478
‐ Oh. And the positive side?

262
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,214
‐ The one thing he did like
was how the assist

263
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,051
made it easier to hit targets
from a long distance,

264
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,287
unlike, you know,
sniping at someone in the flesh,

265
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,023
which is insanely hard. I hear.

266
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,760
‐ Yeah, I learned that
in the tutorial.

267
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,028
‐ Sniping requires
tons of experience

268
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,130
and making
the right calculations.

269
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,868
To train, real snipers
have to fire hundreds of rounds

270
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,371
day after day,
over and over and over again.

[gunshots]

272
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,078
They even know how the wind
affects a bullet's trajectory.

273
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,146
‐ When you said, "Directly,"

274
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,183
you mean you never needed to use
your Bullet Circle at all.

275
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,052
You took your shots without it.
You looked through the scope

276
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,921
and did all the aiming
for yourself.

277
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,455
‐ That's right.

278
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,293
LLENN: You didn't
touch the trigger

279
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,095
'til you knew
you were ready to fire.

280
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,631
That way, you didn't
make any Bullet Lines.

281
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,034
That's so awesome!

282
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,104
Gosh, M, do you even know
what this means for us?

283
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,773
There's only one team left now.

284
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,642
We can beat 'em!

285
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,611
We'll get that gold medal!

286
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,646
‐ We just might.

287
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,781
Anyway, scan's coming up.

288
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,583
‐ Eh? Oh, right.

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,619
Can't believe
it's only been an hour.

290
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,087
‐ Doesn't seem like it.

00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,125

‐ Hey, Anna, anything else
moving out there?

There's only two players left

321

M: They're more
than a klick away.

322
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,304
We're safe for now.

323
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,706
‐ Sorry.

324
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,841
It's my fault.

325
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,276
I was dumb.
I let my guard down.

326

‐ There's nothing
to be sorry about.

327
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,581
Even if you know
what to look for,

328
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,518
spotting a sniper's not easy,
especially at 600 meters,

329
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:35,021
and if they're hiding, there's
no way you'd ever see 'em.

330
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,457
‐ Now what are we gonna do?

331
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,226
‐ We'll get as far away
from them as we can.

332
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,996
It'll give us a chance
to top off our HP.

333
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,131
‐ Want me to give you a shot?

334
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,833
‐ Please.

335
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,937
‐ They were far away before.

336
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,640
How'd they get
so close that fast?

337
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:54,708
‐ We got us a vehicle,

338
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,143
so they probably
got themselves one, too.

339
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,212
‐ Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

340
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,282
‐ It's just a guess,
but as the tourney winds down,

341
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,217
they'd make
more vehicles available.

342
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,687
That way, teams can get
to each other quicker.

343
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,256
I bet they got a four‐by‐four
or truck or something.

344
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,993
Also, they gotta have
someone on the team

345
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,294
who knows how to drive it.

346
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,530
‐ [groans] And a sniper.

347
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,299
‐ Don't beat
yourself up about it.

348
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,035
Like you said,
you're a lucky girl.

349
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,504
‐ How? I totally got shot.

350
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,439
‐ True, but you didn't die.

351
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,143
If a bullet hit you
ten centimeters lower,

352
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,078
it would have hit
your heart or lungs,

353
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,514
and that would have been that.

354
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,682
‐ Yeah, I guess.

355
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:39,085
‐ Also, that was probably as far
as that sniper could shoot

356
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,687
and still hit something.

357
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,489
‐ Yeah, but they
managed to hit you, too.

358
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,427
‐ That was luck.
Don't forget I'm a big target.

359
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,664
I saw their Line going
for my thigh, but I ignored it.

360
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:54,735
I could tell by the sound,
their rifle was a 7.26 mil.

361
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,403
It had a short firing interval,
so it's an auto.

362
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,840
That means their mag
held at least ten rounds.

363
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,342
It can perforate you
faster than a bolt‐action can,

364
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,645
so keep that in mind
for next time.

365
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:09,683
‐ I will. I promise I'll keep
my guard up 'til this is over.

366
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,051
I won't get cocky.

367
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,086
‐ That's the spirit.

368
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,321
‐ Now what?
You know where we're going?

369
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,323
‐ The wasteland on your left.

370
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,726
I was thinking
we'd go ashore there.

371
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:20,761
‐ But they have trucks,

372
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,829
so shouldn't we head
for the marsh?

373
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,330
‐ We're low on gas.

374
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:27,768
There's no guarantee
we'd make it across the lake.

375
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,002
‐ Yeah.

376
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,371
Guess that's the only option.

377
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,320
‐ Terrain's good for fighting.

378
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,423
Lots of rocks to take cover
behind and snipe from.

379
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,892
Good for the enemy, too,

380
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,260
but they don't have
someone as fast as you.

381
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,830
We'll head west
as far as we can go,

382
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,933
keep our backs to the lake

Might as well.
