Pito: One more to go, and‐‐

160
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,973
No. Wait. [groans]

161
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,845
Bummer.
I really wanted to kill him.

162
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,382
‐ Damn, dude.
How many did she kill?

163
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,052
‐ I stopped counting
when she got to 20.

164
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,455
‐ She went full‐on berserk.
She even used her hands, man.

165
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:47,427
‐ I know that gun.
It's an M107A1. There's, like,

166
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,330
only supposed to be one
of those on the Japanese server.

167
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,334
‐ Anti‐materiel rifles like that
are popping up more and more.

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,138
In the last B. o. B., this girl
named Sinon had a Hecate Two,

169
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,740
and she kicked all the ass.

170
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,576
‐ Picking those dudes off
was easy with that rifle,

171
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,910
even at her distance.

172
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,079
Man: I wonder what other
surprises she's got.

173
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,848
‐ Now we know
one thing for sure.

174
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,283
That team's gonna
destroy everyone and win.

175
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,486
M's got that shield,
and those tactical‐looking mofos

176
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,021
are nothing
to sneeze at, either,

177
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,824
but with that woman, too,
they're unstoppable.

178
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,060
The other teams are dead.
They just don't know it ye‐‐

179
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,663
‐ Who cares about them?!
check out how LLENN's doing!

180
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,930
Don't count her out just yet.

181
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,532
As long as she's alive,

182
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,901
there's still
a chance she can win.

183
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,543
LLENN: Okay, Fuka,
I'm at 100 meters.

184
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,844
No enemies in sight.

185
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,713
‐ [radio] <i>Roger that.</i>
<i>Light the way,</i>

186
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,147
<i>and I'll catch up to you.</i>

187
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,017
‐ Here you go.

188
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,887
‐ There's your Bullet Line.

189
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,122
Heading over to you now.

190
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,626
[spits] Whose idea was it

191
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,128
to stick a grassy field
in this dome?

192
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,636
[groans]

193
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,370
I'm like a Hokkaido cockroach

194
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,607
scuttling across
the kitchen floor,

195
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,575
if Hokkaido had roaches.

196
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,411
Well, Mom?
Are we there yet, or what?

197
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,013
‐ We're about halfway now.

198
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,816
‐ [groans]
That's as far as we got?

199
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,351
‐ Sorry. We're going
as fast as we can

200
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,720
using the Bullet Line trick.

201
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,922
Besides, it's safer in here.

202
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,525
If we'd gone
around the north side,

203
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,560
we would have bumped into MMTM,

204
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,428
and South,
it would have been SHINC.

205
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,132
Going through the dome is
the fastest way to get to Pito

206
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,299
and the safest.

207
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,770
‐ So what about the three teams
in here with us?

208
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,673
‐ Yeah, them. I guess
this is where we find out

209
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,742
how lucky I am or not.

210
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,644
Are you sure your wings

211
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,478
didn't transfer over
from the other game?

212
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:48,782
I could hang underneath you
and shoot while you fly.

213
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,817
‐ Nope, sorry.

214
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,320
I gave up all my fairy skills
to come help you out here.

215
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,889
[automatic gunfire]

216
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,392
‐ Hmm.

217
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,394
That's ahead and to the left,

218
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,830
mm, about 200 meters from us.

219
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,799
I don't see Bullet Lines,
though.

220
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,768
‐ Then they're fighting
each other.

221
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,736
That could
totally work out for us.

222
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,839
Keep up the good work, guys.
Wipe each other out.

223
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,210
‐ No. It's weird, real weird.

224
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,046
Something's not right
about the way they're shooting.

225
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,347
‐ Like what?

226
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,017
‐ Like this is a trap.

227
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,719
You see those three teams?

228
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,888
I bet you anything
they're working together,

229
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,190
just like the ones
going after Pito.

230
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,626
They must have seen us
on the last scan

231
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,294
and figured we'd
cut through the dome.

232
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,964
‐ Ooh, you're so popular!
This is getting exciting.

233
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,934
So how do you know
it's a trap?

234
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,670
‐ You saw where the three
team leaders were on the map,

235
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,471
so it's kinda weird
all that gunfire

236
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,574
is coming from the same
direction and distance.

237
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,645
The only explanation
is they're all shooting
from the same position.

238
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,414
‐ Wow, you sure have sharp ears.

239
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,149
So what do you wanna do?

240
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,885
Sneak up from behind and
blast 'em back to the saloon?

241
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,855
‐ No. I don't want to waste
my ammo on these guys.

242
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,924
If we keep moving
and be careful,

243
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,191
we can avoid them.

244
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,128
‐ Roger‐dodger.
Lead the way, girl.

245
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,496
‐ I'm gonna take
a little detour to the right.

246
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,032
Could you please give me a Line?

247
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,368
‐ Okay! I'll aim
another 100 meters ahead.

How could I miss you
when I'm standing this close?

Young lady, you never

You know how in SJ,
after a player gets killed,

327
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,503
their corpse
stays on the field

as an Immortal Object
for ten minutes?

329
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,142
That means, after I kill you,
I can grope your avatar,

330
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,178
and I won't get flagged
for harassment.

Every fantasy VR gamer I know

‐ Huh. Not a bad body count.

344
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,892
‐ There were three teams,

345
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,060
so there should be
18 bodies total.

Wait. There is!

‐ Okay, okay. You got me.

Hold your fire. I surrender.

My hands are up,
I got nothing in 'em,

I promise I won't go for it.

You'd blast me
before I could draw anyway.

‐ I would,
but I wanna save bullets,

357
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,683
so I'll let you resign instead.

‐ Okay.
That's way better than dying.

359
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,656
But first, I was wondering
if we could chat for a bit.

360
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,525
I have a small confession.

If you don't wanna shoot him,
I will.

LLENN: What kinda mags
are in those pouches?

‐ Hmm?

368
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,508
Permission to move my hand
and show you?

Don't worry. I'll go slow.

Now show me
what's in those pouches.

Do you use a P90, too?

‐ Nah, I use an AR‐57.
Do you know it?

It's a pretty nifty
piece of hardware!

378
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,104
It's a specially designed
upper receiver

379
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,273
that fits on the lower receiver
of an M16.

It uses P90 mags‐‐

381

‐ Gimme all your mags now,
the ones in your pouches

00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,412
and the ones you got
in storage, chop‐chop!

That's all the ammo
I have in the game.

Why do you wanna bone
a fellow player like that?

386

‐ I'm gonna win this! And I
need your mags to, so gimme!

I got you over a barrel!

his arms and legs.

Could you please go behind
and loot his storage?

but you're as ruthless
as a bunch of pirates.

Uh, news flash.
This is being broadcast.

They can't hear
what we're saying,

but it's obvious
what you're doing.

00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,746
Robbing a defenseless player's
pretty low.

398

It's even worse,
'cause you're ladies.

This moment'll go down
in "GGO" history.

all your mags, or what?

401
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,056
‐ [sighs] Okay, okay,
I'll give 'em to you.

402
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,458
I'll just have to grind away
'til the end of time

403
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,960
to get 'em back, but whatever.

406

Before I do, maybe you
could give me something

407
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,835
as thanks for my generosity?

408
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,136
LLENN: Like what.

409
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,706
‐ Oh, I was thinking
about something small,

410
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:00,841
something like a kiss?

411
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,275
‐ Say what?!
‐ Huh?!

412
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,678
‐ It's just a kiss, a smooch,

413
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,212
a little peck.

414
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,381
I'd love it if I got one
from both of you,

415
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,316
but I'll settle for you, Pinky.

416
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,786
One teeny kiss,
and my mags are yours.

417
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,656
Right here.
One little kiss on the cheek.

LLENN, who cares
about the mags?

421
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,665
I'm gonna blow
his skeezy head off.

422

424
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,769

425
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,270
‐ For real?

426
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,738
Are you crazy?!

427
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,407
‐ This kid's got some issues,
for sure,

428
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,578
but if all I have to do is
kiss him to get at those mags,

429
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,312
it's way better
than robbing him.

430
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,447
‐ Yes! [laughs] I get a kiss!

431
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,883
‐ I get a kiss!
‐ Well, as long as...

432
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,718
‐ I get a kiss!
‐ you're cool with it, have fun.

433
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,120

but I want the mags first!

00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,357
Just do like you promised,
you cutie.

You just hit the jackpot.

Now let me kill this goon.

439
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,470
‐ You look so scary.

440
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,140
‐ I hate giving you
the satisfaction,

441
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,510
but I did promise you.

Even if this is live,

446
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,888
folks'll think you're
just whispering in his ear.

447
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,524
‐ All right. Are you happy now?

448
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,225
‐ You don't even know.

449
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,260
[laughs] My heart's pounding!

450
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,895
[laughs] Love it.

451
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,599
Nothing in the world
compares to how a girl kisses.

452
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,468
It's not all rough and crude
like how guys always kiss.

453
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,437
‐ Uh, I'm sorry. What?

454
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,039
‐ He said he kissed guys.

455
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,475
Do you, like, force them
to kiss you like you do girls?

456
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,278
‐ No! Not even.
Might as well tell you.

457
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,180
You see, I'm a girl IRL.

458
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,582
Both: You are?!

459
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,016
‐ My avatar's female, too,

460
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,119
but it's androgynous,
so I have a guyish voice.

461
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,354
I wish she were chestier.

462
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,223
Wait. It's easier
just to show you.

463
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,359
See? Female.

464
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,161
And in real life, I'm bi.

465
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,129
‐ Hold it. We're in a game.

466
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,497
Don't talk about real life here.

467
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,933
‐ It's cool.
I don't care if you know.

468
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,302
And now that you do,
let's have drinks sometime,

469
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,871
just us virtual girls.

470
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,473
Come on. There's hardly
any girls in "GGO."

471
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,975
