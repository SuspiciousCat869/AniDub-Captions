wondering about something.

Have you heard about Squad Jam?

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,982
‐ Did you say, "Squid jam"?

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,652
‐ Ecch!
Now I'm picturing that. Gross.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,488
‐ What's gross about it?
It's just fermented squid paste.

8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,625
‐ That's not what
I'm talking about!

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,193
You thought I said, "Squid,"
but I didn't.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,562
I said, "Squad." You know,

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,764
like a group of soldiers
on a mission?

12
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,332
‐ But you also said, "Jam."

13
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,300
‐ Not the kind
you spread on bread.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,571
I meant "jam" like, jamming
a bunch of things together.

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,140
‐ Oh, like bullets
jammed in a gun.

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,843
So then, Squad Jam is
just a bunch of squads.

17
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,746
‐ That's right. Squad Jam's
this tournament coming up,

If I don't hear from you
by Wednesday morning,

00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,557
I'm signing you up!

162
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,591
‐ I didn't say I would!

163
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,492
‐ Sorry! I can't hear you!

164
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,361
‐ 'Cause you don't want to!

165

Miyu: <i>No way. This Squad Jam</i>

00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,138
<i>That sounds awesome!</i>

00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,940
‐ Mm, yeah, well...

169
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,610
I'm not sure about
picking fights with people.

170
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,111
That's kind of scary.

171
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,882
And I don't know about
teaming up with some stranger,

172
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,850
even if Pito vouches for him.

173
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:05,852
Part of me worries

174
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,654
I'll just be in his way.

175
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,624
Anyhoo, that's why
I'm calling you.

176
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,392
Since you're
the big VR expert,

177
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,661
what would you do
if you were in my shoes?

178

179
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,864
<i>you should totally do it.</i>

180
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,801
‐ Uh, that's the problem.
I don't know.

181
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,503
<i>‐ Whoa! Hang on a sec.</i>

182
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,070
I just looked it up,

183
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,406
and Squad Jam's
happening February 1!

184
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,874
<i>‐ Yeah. So?</i>

185
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,144
‐ Elza Kanzaki's concert's
that day. Remember?

186
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,146
I told you I'd try
to get tickets for us.

187
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,482
‐ [gasps] I totally forgot.
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,553
If we can still get tickets
to it, I'd rather go to that.

189
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,121
And you can stay over
and stuff, too.

190
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,658
‐ Cool! But what if we
can't get tickets to it?

191
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,530
Mm, this point,
our chances are fifty‐fifty.

<i>Let me know</i>
<i>as soon as you find out.</i>

00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,710
"The rules for Squad Jam

197
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,713
are basically the same
as B. o. B.'s battle royale.

198
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,082
The match begins when the teams

199
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,951
are teleported
to the playing field.

200
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,987
The team that survives
to the end wins.

201
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,223
The setting is a special map.

202
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,525
Teleportation is random,

203
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,293
so where teams start
depends on luck.

204
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,497
Players may use any weapon
they please during battle.

205
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,668
They may also use
any vehicle they find.

206
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,036
Corpses usually disappear
right away,

207
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,607
but in SJ, they will remain
on the map for ten minutes.

The Satellite Scan.

209
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,244
Each player
will receive a terminal,

210
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,381
which will periodically display
their opponents' locations

211

in this thing,

239
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,366
I asked him to run some errands

<i>‐ She knows him in real life,</i>
<i>too. Interesting.</i>

00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,183
Knowing you, I bet
you stayed up super late

00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,217
going over every word.

247
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,619

248
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,953
‐ Then how 'bout you and I

249
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,955
go over
the most important points of SJ?

250
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,592
Teams can have
from two to six players,

251
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,926
no more, no less.

252
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,995
If you shoot
your teammate by mistake

253
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,697
or they get hit
by friendly fire,

254
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,464
their HP will take damage.

255
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,300
Unlike in B. o. B.,

256
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,236
you can communicate
with your team here.

257
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,238
You can't communicate
with other teams.

258
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,808
Corpses stay on the map
for ten minutes

259
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,643
and then return
to the saloon.

260
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,044
At the start of the game,

261
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,614
all teams are dropped
at least one kilometer apart,

262
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,817
but they can
close in on you quick,
so always be on guard.

263
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,286
Snipers can pop your bubble
from 800 meters,

264
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,824
and a machine gun can
ventilate you from 600 meters.

265
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,993
There's one thing about SJ
to always keep in mind.

266
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,795
Get ready to answer this one.

267
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,865
The Sat Scan only shows
where the team leader is,

268
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,967
which means...

269
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,302
‐ Um...
‐ Yes. LLENN.

270
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,840
‐ There's no way to tell where
a team's members really are

271
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,975
unless you have
a visual on them,

272
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,778
which means you can use
your team leader's position

273
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:25,912
to set a trap?

274
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,080
‐ That's my LLENN,

275
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,583
as sneaky as an ant lion
in the Sahara!

276
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,817
You ruthless little bug.

277
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,485
‐ Please don't tease me
like that.

278
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:33,954
‐ Who's teasing?

279
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,623
The way you pop out at players,
spraying bullets,

280
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,891
God, you're vicious!

281
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,860
‐ It gives me the chills.
‐ Question!

282
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,361
‐ Yes! LLENN!

283
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,665
‐ What happens if a team's
leader dies? Do they lose?

284
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,267
‐ That wouldn't be fun
for the others, now, would it?

285
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,370
During registration, you give
each team member a rank.

286
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,574
If the leader dies,
the next rank takes their place.

287
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,908
‐ That's perfect.

288
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,843
It's one less thing
for everyone on the team

289
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,344
to worry about
during all the shooting.

290
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,346
‐ Yup, you said it.
Focus on the fight.

291
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,249
It'd be so cool if
the two of you win this thing.

292
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,920
‐ [sighs] I can't believe
I'm doing this.

293
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,089
‐ There's one last rule
to keep in mind.

294
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,057
The leader's
the only one who can resign,

295
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,193
and if that happens,
the whole team's out, too.

296
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,862
But I'm pretty sure
that's not going to be an option

297
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,698
either of you are gonna go for.

298
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,165
‐ Hmm.

299
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,868
‐ Well, that's everything.

300
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,937
‐ Good luck, squad leader!
‐ [gasps]

301
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,772
What do you mean
I'm the leader?

302
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,208
I‐I can't be the leader.
What's up?

303
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,944
Is the person you're
sticking me with weaker than me?

304
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,514
‐ You're so cute
when you get all frazzled.

305
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,148
He's not weaker than you.

306
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,851
Seriously, he's
the strongest player I know.

307
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,385
‐ Then why me?

308
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,587
‐ Trust me girl, okay?

309
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,288
‐ It's all part of the plan.

Players: Yeah!

464
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,881
M: All right. Gear up.

465
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,282
‐ Right.

466
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,585
‐ Don't forget to pack

467
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,153
your Satellite Scan Terminal.

468
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,255
‐ Mm‐hmm.

469
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,525
‐ And pack this, too.

471

[gasps] Really?

472
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,634
Like, you think I'll need it?

473
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,302
‐ It's good to have
in case you run out of ammo.

474
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,072
‐ But I'm bringing along
a ton of mags.

475
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,474
‐ What if you
get caught in a room?

476
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,477
Sometimes in close quarters,
a knife's better than a gun,

477
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:48,281
especially for someone like you
with a high level of agility.

478
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,051
Strap it to your lower back,
horizontal.

479
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:55,321
When you use it, draw it
with your right, backhanded.

480
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,490
Your enemy
will be bigger than you,

481
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,626
but you can dash
between their legs

482
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,528
and slash at their inner thigh.

483
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,296
That's where
the femoral artery is,

484
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,532
and if you hit it,
you'll do a lot of damage.

485
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,768
If the enemy's
drawing down on you,

486
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,037
dash forward, and aim for
the inner part of their bicep.

487
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,640
Then slash upward, like this!

488
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,075
And if you can get behind them,

489
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,144
slash through their boot
into their Achilles tendon.

490
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,412
Once your enemy's down,

491
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,381
draw the blade
across their neck,

492
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,083
and make a long cut.

493
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,651
‐ <i>Where'd he learn all this?</i>

494
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,220
‐ Go for the eyes
when attacking the head.

495
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,122
Make sure to stab
straight and hard,

496
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,624
and you'll damage the brain.

497
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,826
If you wanna score
an instant kill with a knife,

498
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,928
you either go
for the enemy's throat

499
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,229
or their eyes.

500
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,732
‐ Roger that.

501
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,370
‐ All right. Hope you're ready.

502
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,572
‐ Yep, you know it!

503
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,240
‐ Glad you're fired up
about this.

504
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,975
‐ To be honest,
if I got a ticket

505
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,245
to Elza Kanzaki's concert first,
I wouldn't have signed up.

506
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,548
‐ That sucks
you couldn't get a ticket.

507
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:58,785
‐ It's okay. I'm glad I'm here.
