that means you take point,

160
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,542
and I'll hang back
and bring the fire.

161
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,243
‐ Okay! Sounds like a plan.

162
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,647
Speaking of, there's
a battle tactic I wanna try.

163
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,248
‐ Cool. What is it?

164
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,885
‐ I'll tell you about it after
we sign up for the tourney.

165
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,322
Boss: All right, ladies,
listen up.

166
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,324
It's do‐or‐die time.

167
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,627
We've gotten stronger as a team,

168
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,895
and if we can harness
that strength,

169
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,932
we'll have a good shot
at winning SJ 2.

170
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,735
There's only one player
to worry about,

171
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,738
the big guy who teamed up
with LLENN last time, M.

172
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,373
I'm sure he'll be
in this tourney, too.

173
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,045
He's a phenomenal sniper and
packs a strong portable shield.

174
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,146
‐ [whimpers]

175
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,748
‐ We need to find something

176
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,983
that'll punch
through that shield of his.

177
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,118
I'm talkin' a powerful weapon,

178
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,155
so I say we spend tomorrow
looking for it.

179
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,723
Team: Yes, ma'am!

180
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,727
[cell phone buzzes]

181
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,397
‐ [gasps] No way!

182
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,866
‐ Something wrong, Kana?

183
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,868
‐ LLENN signed up
for the tourney.

184
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,970
‐ Are you sure it's her?

185
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,138
‐ "Team LF."

186
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,040
According to this,
they're seeded,

187
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,743
so the L in their name
has to stand for LLENN.

188
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,145
‐ I'm so lookin' forward
to playin' this now!

189
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,448
‐ That's so weird. I wonder
what made Karen change her mind.

190
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:46,086
‐ A soldier doesn't poke her
nose into her enemy's business.

191
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,921
In fact,
until the tourney starts,

192
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,623
no one's allowed
to contact Karen.

193
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,526
She's our enemy now.
Is that understood?

194
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,827
Team: Roger that, Boss!

195
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,696
‐ After this is over,

196
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,564
I'd love to have
more of her cookies.

197
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,766
‐ I like those
marshmallow things she had.

198
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,768
‐ Her Hokkaido nommies
were good!

199
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,704
‐ That English tea
was amazing, too.

200
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,907
‐ I'll say it was!
I bet it was the expensive kind.

201
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,142
‐ All right ladies,
let's cut the chatter.

202
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,111
It's time to put
our game faces on.

203
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,280
Let's get ourselves ready
to win this thing!

204
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,716
Team: Yeah!

205
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,918
[phone line ringing]

206
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,321
‐ Hey, it's me.

207
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,656
I have good news.

208
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,791
Your little friend
just signed up.

209
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,830
Man: Oh! Ho ho ho! Yeah!

210
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,297
You guys seein' this?

211
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,067
‐ We're so gonna ventilate
that little pisser!

212
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,036
‐ That pink midget's
gonna go down.

213
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,705
‐ Not just her.
The Japan Machine Gun Lovers

214
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,441
are gonna blast the hell
outta everyone we meet!

215
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,409
‐ [team whoop]
‐ [monster roars]

216
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,051
‐ All right, get him!

217
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,318
‐ Yup!

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,455
<i>I've got one mission,</i>

219
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,223
<i>beat Pito!</i>

220
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,665
<i>The only way to save her</i>

221
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,834
<i>is for me to kill her.</i>

222
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,876
‐ The preliminaries started.

223
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,312
‐ Good! Gives us time
to kick back.

224
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,717
‐ Being seeded
sure has its benefits.

225
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,252
By the way, Fuka,
do you know the rules?

226
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,654
‐ I looked at 'em.

227
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,256
‐ Uh‐huh.
So it's a battle royale

228
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,326
between 30 teams
on a special ten‐kilometer map.

229
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,761
Teams have two to six players,

230
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,664
and even though they're enemies,
they can ally if they want.

231
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,465
You know what the Sat Scan is?

232
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,902
‐ It gives the location
of all the team leaders

233
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,770
every ten minutes
on your Terminal.

234
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,906
You're gonna be
our team's leader, right?

235
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,674
‐ Yup. Now check this out.

236
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,475
This time,
something's different.

237
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,245
‐ In the first Squad Jam,
the enemy teams' names

238
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,749
weren't displayed on the map,
but in SJ 2, they will be.

239
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,219
‐ Convenient. After
the first scan ten minutes in,

240
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,921
everyone will know
which team is where.

241
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,590
‐ That info will come in handy
for our mission.

242
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,993
‐ We'll know right where Pito's
team is every scan.

243
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,197
They're called PM4.
Remember that.

244
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,700
‐ PM4. You got it.

245
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,201
Man, what a trip.

246
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,303
I can't believe
we're playin' a game

247
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,240
to keep a couple of weirdoes
from killing themselves.

248
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,810
‐ Yeah. It's more
than a game for Pito.

249
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,780
Something else to worry about
is team SHINC.

250
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,214
They're super‐tough.

251
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,817
They're a rhythmic gymnastics
team in real life.

252
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,086
We should avoid them
'til I take Pito out.

253
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,388
After that,
they can kill us for all I care.

254
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,658
‐ Not even! We're gonna
burn those chicks down

255
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,359
and wipe out
all the other teams, too!

256
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,162
Don't you dare blow your chance
to be two‐time champ.

257
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,431
‐ Okay, fine, whatever you say.
But we'll be facing

258
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,701
the other teams
from the last tourney, too.

259
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,037
They might have upgraded their
skills and weapons since then.

260
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,439
Stay sharp,
and keep your guard up.

261
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,442
‐ Roger dodger! Hmm.

262
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,645
‐ [sighs]

263
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,281
‐ What's with that face?
Is it something you ate?

264
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,650
It's your stomach, isn't it?
You gotta poop.

265
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,051
‐ No, I don't have to poop!

266
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,289
It's just this thing with Pito
suddenly hit me.

267
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,858
I don't know if I'm
good enough to beat her,

268
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,161
and if I can't, people will die.

269
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,264
‐ Beating yourself up about it
now isn't gonna help anyone.

270
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,968
Worry about the ifs and hows
on the day. Got it?

271
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,906
Now that that's settled,
I'm ordering more drinks.

272
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,877
Here. Drink up. It's my treat.

273
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,479
‐ [sighs]

274
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:38,084
Thanks, Miyu. You don't know
how much I appreciate this.

275
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,522
‐ Oh, please. It's just
a mug of iced tea, no biggie.

276
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,889
‐ Not the tea, you dork!

277
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,159
Thank you for always
being there when I needed you

278
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:50,463
and for coming to "GGO"
and for having my back in SJ 2.

279
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,497
You're the best.

280
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,366
‐ No worries. Between us girls,

281
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,502
all that stuff's
a part of being friends.

282
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,903
We never need to say thanks.

283
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,140
But if you want,
you can pay me back someday.

284
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,077
‐ You got it. Whatever I can do,
consider it done.

285
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,983
‐ I think I know
how you can pay me back.

286
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,251
Next time Elza Kanzaki plays,

287

I should have known
you'd pick something hard.

290
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:26,232
‐ All right, I'm ready.

291
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,370
Here I come, Pito.

292
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,105
‐ And with that...

293
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,075
it's time to get my freak on.

00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,793
‐ [crowd murmuring]
‐ There they are.

314
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,996
‐ It's team Memento Mori.

315
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,298
‐ If I had the credits,
I'd bet on them.

316
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,201
‐ Yeah, me, too. They're
the strongest team on the board.

317
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,171
‐ Yeah, but last time,
team SHINC came in second.

318
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,808
‐ Damn, they look down to kill.

319
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,810
David: How's it going, ladies?

320
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,278
The team and I
are looking forward

321
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,213
to meeting up with you
out there on the map.

322
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,816
Just make sure
you don't die early.

323
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,618
‐ Don't worry. We won't.

324
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,219
And if you guys don't mind,

325
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,189
we'd like to get all your names
before we go head‐to‐head

326
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,625
so we know what to put
on your tombstones.

327
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,027
‐ This is gonna be fun.

328
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,629
I can't wait to start.

329
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,832
‐ [chuckles] I've never
seen anyone so eager to die.

330
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,367
‐ Look who's here.

331
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,836
[crowd cheering]

332
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,438
David: So the big guy signed up.

333
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,007
Perfect.

334
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,209
This time,
we'll be ready for him.

335
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,043
‐ Yup.

336
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,779
Man: Who are they?

337
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,246
Man #2: Yeah, and why the masks?

338
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,248
Man #3:
Guess they roll incognito.

339
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,784
Man #4: Maybe they
don't want anyone

340
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,652
to recognize them from B. o. B.

341
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,654
‐ Hey! [laughs]

342
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:32,125
Sorry to keep y'all waiting.
Hi there! Oh, I know you.

343
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,095
Show of hands, who's here today
to watch me slay?

344
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,463
I know. I'm late,
and I'm so sorry about that.

345
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:41,234
Thanks for your support, though.
Love ya! Mwah!

346
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,469
Man #4: The hell was that about?

347
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,772
Man #3: She acts like
she's some kinda princess.

348
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,075
Man #5: Then I guess
those goons must be her knights.

349
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,078
David: Crap.
Of all the people...

350
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,947
‐ You know her?
‐ Yeah.

351
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,249
We were on the same team
for a little while.

352
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,885
It was just after "GGO"
first went live.

353
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,422
She didn't have the tats then,
and her hair was short

354
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,291
so it wouldn't get
in her face in a fight.

355
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,528
‐ How come you never
mentioned her before?

356
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,430
‐ Wasn't important. Those days,
I rocked a shitty gun

357
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,198
and couldn't fight
worth a damn.

358
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,867
Good times back then.

359
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,636
‐ Dude, you sound
like my grandpa.

360
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,939
‐ If you were having fun,
why'd you quit playing with her?

361
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,173
Was she a drag?

362
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,375
‐ No, she was a good player,

363
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,679
fearless. She had great moves.

364
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,982
She was hard‐core
into full‐dive VR games.

365
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,152
‐ Sounds perfect for you.
You should have stuck with her.

366
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,987
‐ No way.
‐ Why?

367
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:38,759
‐ 'Cause she thought everyone
on the team was expendable.

368
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,529
She'd use you for a shield
or toss a grenade at a monster,

369
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,465
even if you were standing
next to it. She didn't care.

370
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:49,202
She'd smile if someone
on the team got killed

371
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,372
or if she did. Creepy.

372
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,876
I don't wanna play with someone
who's got a death wish.

373
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,712
I'm Memento Mori.

374
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,481
I live my life
knowing I'm gonna die someday.

375
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,283
But that freak show? [chuckles]

376
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,586
She lives hers
like she's hoping to die.

377
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,689
‐ That is creepy.
No wonder you bailed.

378
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,592
‐ I heard she quit that team
and joined another

379
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,694
and pulled the same crap
with them.

380
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,630
Word got around,
and no one wanted her,

381
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,899
so she went solo.

382
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,902
Summon: If that's true,
then why's she with M?

383
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,103
‐ Beats me.

384
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,639
But I wouldn't
let your guard down.

385
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,109
Chances are everyone on that
team's just as crazy as she is.

386
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,310
‐ [team grumbling]

387
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,179
‐ Pitohui.
‐ Huh?

388
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,582
‐ It's a bird you can
only find in New Guinea.

389
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:41,121
Its skin and feathers are
poisonous to animals and humans.

390
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:45,191
Pitohui's
a perfect name for her.

391
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,860
[overlapping chatter]

392
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,169
‐ Yo, dudes, I just realized

393
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,704
that teeny pink girl's
not here yet.

394
00:18:57,771 --> 00:19:00,106
‐ She better hurry.
It starts in two.

395
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,108
‐ I hope she
didn't change her mind.

396
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,476
‐ Where is she?

397
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,112
[running footsteps]

398
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,681
‐ [crowd murmuring]
‐ [both panting]

399
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,085
‐ Talk about cutting it close.

400
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,921
‐ I told you
we'd make it here in time.

401
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,923
‐ [cheering]

402
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,358
Man: She made it!

403
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,793
Man #2: LLENN's here
to tear it up!

404
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,928
Man #3: Ah, she's playing
a two‐person team again.

405
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,298
‐ Get out there, and show us
a good old‐fashioned massacre!

406
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,801
‐ Smells like her partner's
a girl, too.

407
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,169
I love this skill.

408
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,137
‐ Where the hell'd
you get a smell skill?

409
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,239
‐ Hey, do we still
have time to get a drink?

410
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,309
‐ What are you talking about?
You'll just get the runs again.

411
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,544
‐ Nah, I'll be fine.

412
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,345
My stomach's
totally empty right now.

413
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,548
‐ How's it going, LLENN?

414
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,751
Congrats on winning
the last tourney, girl. [laughs]

415
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,787
‐ Thanks a lot, Pito.

416
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,193
‐ We'll see
how you do this time.

417
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,133
Announcer: <i>Last call for all</i>

‐ Huh?

424
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:17,183
‐ I just want you to know
I'll be fighting to win today,

425
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,587
and if I do win,
you have to keep your promise.

426
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,255
‐ Hmm?

427
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,390
Not sure what you mean,
but okay.

428
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,792
If you win, remind me.

There's no need to get
all aggro about it.

430

Anything else you wanna say?

431
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,999
‐ I'll kill you. I swear.

432
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,001

440
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,625
‐ Roger that.

441
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,505
Kick ass, Rightony, Leftania.

442
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,739
‐ What'd you say?

443
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,440
‐ Those are the names
I gave to 'em.

444
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,176
‐ They both look
exactly the same,

445
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,646
so how do you know which is
Rightony and which is Leftania?

446
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:23,316
‐ Oh, I got that all worked out.
When they're both equipped,

447
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,251
the one
in my right hand's Rightony.

448
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,753
‐ Wow, that's clever.

449
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,255
‐ I wonder what kinda guns
everyone else is packing.

450
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,658
‐ I don't know,
but I'm sure M's gonna be using

451
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,194
the same rifle and shield
as he did last time.

452
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,562
‐ How about Pito?

453
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,898
‐ I don't know
what kinda gun she'll have.

454
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,967
Every time I played with her,
she had something different.

455
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:44,337
My guess is she'll be using
something pretty wicked.

456
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,806
‐ How 'bout the others with her?

457
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,774
‐ I don't know about those four,

458
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,343
but they won't stop me
getting to her.

‐ [chuckles]

460
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,581
Hey, as long
as no one else kills her,

461
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,650
she won't kill herself
in real life.

462
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,752
And who knows? She might win.

463
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,587
