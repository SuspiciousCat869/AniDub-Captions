1
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,666
Machina.

2
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,083
Akira.

3
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,375
It's nice to meet you.

4
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,541
Although we had
a hostile encounter

5
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,375
with the Gillard Army
on the return trip.

6
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,500
Our mission to capture
the Album was successful.

7
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,541
Major Maclaine is acting
like she can just do

8
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,125
whatever she wants
and then get away with it.

9
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,583
The Gillard Army is officially
contesting the whole incident.

10
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,750
And right now our
case looks pretty weak.

11
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,583
They're pursuing legal action,
like dissolving our contract.

12
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,041
We've got a lot
of material to cover today.

13
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,208
Let's go ahead and move
on to Kazuki and Jin.

14
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,583
Kazuki Tachibana
is at the medical center

15
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,666
being re-evaluated
for his fitness as a Dragonaut.

16
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,875
Jin Kamishina is being
confined inside the base.

17
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,375
Jin Kamishina huh?

18
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,708
So what do we do with him now?

19
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,875
That brat caused
all of this, didn't he?

20
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,291
[RAINA thinking]
Jin Kamishina.

21
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,916
Judging from his
quick-witted decisions

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,916
and the bold initiative

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,500
he displayed during the
shuttle's atmospheric re-entry

24
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,291
I'd say there's a
lot more of his father

25
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,958
in that boy than I thought.

26
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,541
What's the matter?

27
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,125
Continue with your report.

28
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,833
Yes sir, please
excuse me.

29
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,250
Next, we should probably
discuss the Album.

30
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,541
At the moment
she's being held

31
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,500
in a specially-designed
cell with guards posted

32
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,916
so that our research
team can collect data

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,083
on Original Dragons.

34
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,291
That leaves
Gio and Widow.

35
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,291
They're confined
on Tartarus.

36
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,833
Well, there's no
telling when those Dragons

37
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,250
might go on a deadly rampage.

38
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,083
At this point they're damaged
goods and protocol dictates

39
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:54,083
that the rogue Dragons must
be disposed of accordingly.

40
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,958
Keep in mind that Gio and Widow
weren't bound by Resonance.

41
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,541
They took up Communication with
people other than their Masters.

42
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,166
They are also quite
valuable for research.

43
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,666
Is it possible to temporarily
postpone the disposal process?

44
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,750
The Album alone
will be sufficient.

45
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,958
Can't you see that
more research subjects

46
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,333
will only speed
up our progress?

47
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
Just like I told you before.

48
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,666
Those who demand everything
always end up with nothing.

49
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,333
But sir.

50
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,083
Would you just stop it already!

51
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,458
Do any of you have
a shred of decency?

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,375
You talk like they're
some sort of product.

53
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,208
Machina's right here!

54
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,125
They're all right here.

55
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,208
It's okay Akira.

56
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
That concludes my report.

57
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,791
Good work.

58
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,000
Take it easy.

59
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,000
Otherwise you too
will be reevaluated

60
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,083
for your fitness
as a Dragonaut.

61
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,041
[GIO] I can't help but
think about something

62
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,791
that Howlingstar once told me.

63
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,750
He said the destiny
of Earthborn Dragons

64
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,083
who have undergone Resonance
is to protect their masters.

65
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,833
[WIDOW] Then I am
without a destiny

66
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,375
as I have already
lost my Master.

67
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,708
You on the other
hand still have yours.

68
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,291
You mean Kazuki Tachibana?

69
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,583
That's right.

70
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,541
Kazuki is your Master.

71
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
He is not mine at least.

72
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
Have I been so blind
that I couldn't see

73
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,875
my true destiny was
to be Kazuki's Dragon?

74
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,041
Changing one's
destiny is impossible.

75
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,083
But fate can be malleable.

76
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,416
A lesson you won't
live to learn.

77
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
What do you mean by that?

78
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,625
The island we're on now

79
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:48,041
Is for the disposal of Dragons.

80
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,541
This place is a top-secret ISDA
facility where Dragons

81
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,083
that are judged to be
unfit for whatever reason

82
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,791
are secretly disposed of.

83
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,958
This island is a graveyard.

84
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,916
Make no mistake we have been
brought here for one reason.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,208
To die.

86
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,791
There is a powerful
CSS electromagnetic field

87
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,875
that completely
surrounds the island.

88
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,333
For us Dragons,
escape from this pit of death,

89
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,000
is simply not an option.

90
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,583
To hell with them!

91
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,375
Who do they think
they're dealing with?

92
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,833
[AI laughing]

93
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,708
C'mon Brother! Move it!

94
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry up would ya'?

95
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,250
I'll be right there!

96
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,916
Ai?

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,250
Where'd you go Dad?

98
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,500
Mother?

99
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,500
Hello?

100
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,125
Jin.

101
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,791
Toa.

102
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,458
I'm the one who
left you all alone.

103
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,500
It was my fault.

104
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,166
That's why I came back for you.

105
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,625
Toa.

106
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,583
All right you bastards!

107
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,041
Let me out of here!

108
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,375
Let me see Toa!

109
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,916
That all depends
on your attitude.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,708
There now, I'm Yuri Kitajima,
head of the research team.

111
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,083
It's nice to meet you Jin.

112
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,166
What is he doing?

113
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,208
This is Resonance.

114
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,500
So this is it, Resonance.

115
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,875
Resonance is a harmonious
synergy between man and Dragon.

116
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,125
You could call it
a contract of sorts.

117
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,625
Now.

118
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,125
Communicators are born from
eggs that undergo Resonance.

119
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,291
That's Gio!

120
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,833
The person who goes
through Resonance

121
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,458
becomes that Dragon's Master,

122
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
and that Dragon
follows its Master's orders

123
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,041
with absolute obedience.

124
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,708
Absolute obedience?

125
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,291
Gio's Master was supposed
to be Kazuki Tachibana.

126
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,375
Now this is where
things get murky.

127
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,708
As you must know, Gio didn't
choose Kazuki to be his Master.

128
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,791
He chose you instead.

129
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,083
This is of great interest to us.

130
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,625
I don't know what
you expect me to say.

131
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,500
What's even more interesting

132
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,000
Is your relationship
with the Album.

133
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,791
Hold on!

134
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,541
Toa is someone else's?

135
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,041
Someone else's?

136
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,000
That doesn't make much sense,
think about it.

137
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,333
What?

138
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,916
No that's impossible.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It can't be because I never went
through a Resonance with Toa.

140
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,250
The evidence we found
in your body is irrefutable.

141
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,458
During the shuttle
accident two years ago

142
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,708
you went through
Resonance with the Album.

143
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,291
I did what?

144
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,708
So ,Toa.

145
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes.

146
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,500
You see you've been chasing
the Album this entire time.

147
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,916
But what you didn't know,
is that you're her master.

148
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,041
Geez, I am beat.

149
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,083
[AKIRA yawning]

150
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,291
Sometimes I feel
like I understand

151
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,791
less and less every day.

152
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,166
Oh, man.

153
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,791
I don't know what I'm supposed
to believe anymore.

154
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,208
Here.

155
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,458
Take it, I peeled it for you.

156
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,583
Oh, thank you.

157
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,958
So, takin' a break
and relaxing huh?

159
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,333
How can you be so laid back?

160
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,916
--[MACHINA] Here.
--[SIEGLINDE] Hey what're those?

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,416
Oh look at those cute
little apple bunnies.

162
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,541
How delightful.

163
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean, quaint.

164
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,958
This is a gigantic mess.

165
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,791
Mr. Kiril was so
adamant about us

166
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,041
settling things by
the book with the military.

167
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
Then it turns out
that our beloved leader

168
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,125
was totally conned
by that Gillard prince.

169
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,791
Oh well, I guess we
should have seen it coming.

170
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,125
Come on now tell me
what's on your mind.

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,708
What do you mean?

172
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,916
You didn't really
come here to talk

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,875
about all that stuff did you?

174
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,750
Spill it.

175
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,666
Please...

176
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,166
Promise you'll stay.

177
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,875
Never leave us or betray us.

178
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,916
Amagi is dead, Kazuki
is pretty much useless,

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,625
and Jin's not an option.

180
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,000
Akira if you were
to abandon us now

181
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,750
it'd just be me and Raina.

182
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,000
And I don't know how
well I could handle that!

183
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,208
Yeah.

184
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,625
All right.

185
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,791
I promise you.

186
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,875
Hello Doctor!

187
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,041
Guess what it's
almost my birthday.

188
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,458
It's true!

189
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,916
I sure hope I get lots
of awesome presents this year!

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,708
Are you gift grubbing?

191
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,458
How childish.

192
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,708
What's wrong with that?

193
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,166
Fine think about what you
want and then let me know.

194
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,250
All right!

195
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,083
It can't be anything
too expensive though.

196
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,375
What? Oh man.

197
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,333
Well in that case.

198
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,166
[GARNET] I have failed
to bring you Gio, my lord.

199
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,541
I humbly beg for your
pardon in this matter

200
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,458
and hope that you will
overlook my shortcomings

201
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,250
yet again Prince Asim.

202
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,250
Please forgive me.

203
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,041
Never mind about Gio.

204
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,125
My Lord?

205
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,000
The Album.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I now desire the Album.

207
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,791
It's her beauty.

208
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,750
She alone is worthy of me.

209
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,375
My lord, by now the Album

210
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,166
is already in
a secure ISDA facility.

211
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,500
It may not be
possible to obtain her.

212
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,333
Think hard, Garnet.

213
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,208
Why did we have our spies

214
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,041
infiltrate the ISDA
in the first place?

215
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,500
Garnet, I believe
now is the time.

216
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
Sir!

217
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,875
So that's the Album?

218
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,583
Yes, I've compared
her to Gio and Widow.

219
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Each one of those
Dragons has acted

220
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,541
in partnership with someone

221
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,083
that they didn't go
through Resonance with.

222
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,125
Coincidentally all
three of these Dragons

223
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,666
appeared recently
one after the other.

224
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,541
It's fascinating.

225
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
Don't you think so?

226
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,291
We're on the edge of something.

227
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,583
And I'm going to
find out what it is.

228
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,333
What is the Album's condition?

229
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,833
At the moment.

230
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,125
All of her vital signs
appear to be stable doctor.

231
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,000
It looks like the
sedative is working.

232
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,916
[alarm beeping]

233
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,541
The Album has escaped!

234
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,041
Catch her! Somebody! Anyone!

235
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,083
We have to find her!

236
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,833
The Album is escaping!

237
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,791
Sir should we mobilize
the special unit?

238
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,500
No way.

239
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,083
They don't even stand a chance.

240
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,666
Despite that angelic face,
she's really a demon.

241
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,750
Ryoko, have you ever tried
saying something encouraging?

242
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,625
Right.

243
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,166
Sorry.

244
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,625
But she's got a good point,
the Album is an Original Dragon.

245
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,666
How the heck are
we supposed to catch her?

246
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,333
Just do it!

247
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,375
Right!

248
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,291
We'll do our best!

249
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,625
[SIEGLINDE panting]

250
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,458
Wait!

251
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,875
Akira, are you sure about this?

252
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,791
I want you to know that
no matter what happens.

253
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,833
I'm staying with you.

254
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,875
But what you didn't know
is that you're her master.

255
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,791
Me? Toa's Master?

256
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,791
See, you're not alone anymore.

257
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,208
You have me now Jin.

258
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,875
How can that be?

259
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,208
What exactly is Resonance?

260
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,541
Jin! Get up, it's time to go!

261
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,750
What is this?

262
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,625
What's happening?

263
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,666
We don't have much time left.

264
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,875
Get up!

265
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,583
What are you doing?

266
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,916
But, Toa.

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,916
Toa's getting out
of here on her own.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,541
So you'd better get going too!

269
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,208
Right.

270
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,958
I've come for you.

271
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,125
Don't move!

272
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,750
Please don't, I'm here to
take the little ones with me.

273
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,041
Take the little ones with you?

274
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,041
That is my mission here.

275
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,416
Excuse me!

276
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,125
I'm the one in
charge around here

277
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,583
And I won't
allow anyone to lay

278
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,583
so much as a finger
on these eggs.

279
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,041
You're just like...

280
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,833
Every last one of these
eggs is of the earth.

281
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,708
The parking garage is up ahead.

282
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,916
Let's take a car,
and get out of here!

283
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,416
Raina.

284
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,041
This was bound to happen.

285
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,666
Sooner or later.

286
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,250
You mean...

287
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,791
Spare me the lies.

288
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,291
I know that you've given aid

289
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,541
to this dangerous young criminal
on more than one occasion.

290
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,666
Then again you may have
tricked them into doing this.

291
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,083
Is that right, Jin Kamishina?

292
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,208
Well, I...

293
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,875
Raina!

294
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,583
He did no such thing.

295
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Akira and I decided on this.

296
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,416
Machina!

297
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Take another step and he'll be
dead before he hits the ground.

298
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,541
Make her stop this Akira.

299
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,125
And if I say no?

300
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,541
Machina! Think about this!

301
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,125
Maybe you should listen
to your own advice Howl.

302
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,416
Raina!

303
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,750
Keep away!

304
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,375
Everything'll be just fine.

305
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,041
Raina!

306
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
Every last one of these
eggs is of the Earth.

307
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,458
Why? Why would you?

308
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,500
You want me to stop?

309
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,125
That's right.

310
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,041
I want you to
discontinue the experiments.

311
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,708
I want to know why?

312
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,333
Give me one good reason!

313
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,208
Why discontinue this
when we've finally

314
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,166
gotten such a
perfect live sample?

315
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,833
What good can come
from examining her?

316
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,916
Plenty of good will come.
Just wait.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,833
Don't get me wrong
Dr. Kitajima,

318
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm not trying to
steal your chance

319
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,125
at recognition from
the academic community;

320
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,208
and I'm certainly not trying
to hinder this operation.

321
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,541
On the contrary.

322
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,166
Take a moment to consider
that we are tampering

323
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,916
with forces we
don't fully understand.

324
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,875
Perhaps it would be prudent
to leave them be for the moment.

325
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,500
There are many
things that are better

326
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,250
left to the realm
of the unknown.

327
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,708
I see. Then it's over.

328
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,541
You'll have your chance.

329
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,166
Just trust me.

330
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,708
Some day you'll be
properly recognized.

331
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,166
The whole experiment
got dropped just like that.

332
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,458
That's pretty high-handed
even for Professor Nozaki.

333
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,666
Listen Doctor.

334
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,875
Go to Tartarus?

335
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,708
I'm just saying
they've got the same

336
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,625
caliber of research facility
there as they do here, right?

337
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,916
But, Nozaki would never
allow that to happen.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,583
You could get the Album out
there on your own Authority.

339
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,958
All you have to do is explain
the she needs to be quarantined.

340
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,833
I suppose I could do that.

341
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,208
It's gonna be okay.

342
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,000
And then when we
get those results back.

343
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:00,541
Even the professor
will give you some credit.

344
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,041
It's okay Doc, we're
gonna make it through this.

345
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
[RAINA coughing]

346
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,041
Why are you helping me?

347
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,500
We think that
you might be able

348
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,583
to change the relationship
between people and Dragons.

349
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,583
What do you mean relationship?

350
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,208
Like Machina.

351
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,583
No matter what,
she's always by my side.

352
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,416
The reason she's
with me isn't simply

353
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,083
because she's
some mindless puppet

354
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,833
that I have
complete control over.

355
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,583
You have to understand,
Machina and I are together

356
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,916
because we complete each other
in the truest sense of the word.

357
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,208
I love her.

358
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,500
It's ridiculous to even think
that they could be our property.

359
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,041
Both parties
share their existences.

360
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,166
I'm sure you get
it since you were with Gio

361
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,833
even though you
aren't his Master.

362
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,083
There are many things
that are better left

363
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,833
to the realm of the unknown.

364
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,250
It would be prudent
to leave them be.

365
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,458
Why would he tell me that now?

366
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,208
Doctor, I thought
super hard about my present.

367
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,416
What was that sound?

368
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,375
Something's coming for us.

369
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:35,291
It's headed right toward
us at a high velocity!

370
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,583
We got a match!

371
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,333
One of the two vessels is
a Gillard Army submarine!

372
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,000
The Gillard Army?

373
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,333
The other one is--

[EVERYONE grunting]

375
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,666
It can't be.

376
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,333
An Agathion!

377
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:07,958
This is a distress signal
from the ISDA submarine.

378
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,125
I think I'd like The Album.

379
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,583
Still recovering
from the wounds

380
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,291
of their battle at
the base of mount Fuji,

381
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,375
the Dragonauts fall
into a new foe's trap!

382
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,750
Hey

383
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,083
Meanwhile, in Istanbul,
the international bomb plot

384
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,833
by the evil General
Blackeye draws ever closer.

385
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,458
Minute by minute,
second by second

386
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,416
the countdown to
detonation approaches!

Hey! C'mon!

Next time on
Dragonaut: The Resonance!

389

Decisive battle
at 20,000 meters!

390
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,916
Roses blooming in the solar wind
have the fragrance of death!

391
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,166
The time-space dragon Red Gyao
appears and actualizes!

392
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,041
Oh man!
