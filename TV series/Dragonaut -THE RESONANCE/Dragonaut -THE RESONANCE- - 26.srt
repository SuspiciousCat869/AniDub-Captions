00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,958
The only obvious
course of action

328
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,125
is for us to risk
everything for our friends

329
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,041
and take out
this facility at all costs.

330
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,666
Who's with me?

331
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,375
We just have to destroy
the facility, right?

332
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,916
Yes that's correct, and it
shouldn't be terribly difficult.

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,041
I wonder why
Otohime's personality

334
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,291
has been completely
unaffected by it.

335
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,708
You're right she's
completely normal.

336
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,416
Well, I feel
a little bit weird.

337
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,208
It's simple.

338
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,625
Her personality is so normal
it is completely devoid

339
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,083
of anything to
amplify or reverse.

340
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm completely normal?

341
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,166
Okay.

342
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,708
Time to shut down the CSS and
get our weird friends back.

343
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,250
Let's go!

344
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,041
I'm not normal.

345
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,041
I'm deep and mysterious.

346
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,291
Dragonauts, ho!

347
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:02,833
Dragonauts, ho!

348
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,375
It's okay, girl.

349
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,416
The world needs vanilla.

350
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,458
I'm tired of cheering!

351
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,875
We'll save you crazy people,
yeah!

352
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,291
Time to roll out.

353
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,458
Did you guys hear like people
yelling or something?

354
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,708
No, you ladies must
be imagining things.

355
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,375
I think you've got
a nibble, director.

356
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
You!

357
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,041
You tried to trick me
out of my happy place

358
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,750
but it won't work because
I know exactly

359
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,250
what it takes to catch
the perfect fish.

360
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,583
Unless you
become as peaceful

361
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,583
as the deep cool stillness
that is the fish's home

362
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,958
you have not earned the right

363
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,041
to chop off their little
heads and spill their guts.

364
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,416
That's not a fish.

365
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,916
We've finally made it.

366
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,958
Just as I expected.

367
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,375
The CSS antenna is operational.

368
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,416
Okay, this is for
you, Gio. Widow.

369
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,750
We'll turn you back
into your normal

370
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,500
dark and brooding selves
or else we'll die trying.

371
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,333
Kazuki wait.

372
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:11,291
There's something you need to
know about their defenses.

373
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,375
That area is protected by

374
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
genetically manipulated
super plants.

375
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,666
Why didn't you tell me before?

376
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
Why do you hate me!

377
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,791
Let's move out.

378
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,375
We can't let his sacrifice
have been in vain.

379
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,125
I'm not dead!

380
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,416
You can cut me down.

381
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
Where are you going?

382
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,583
So, I'm at this party
and this totally hot chick

383
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,916
gets right in
my face and says.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,166
"I must be dead cause
you look like an angel."

385
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,166
[WIDOW laughs]

386
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,958
[HOWLINGSTAR]
Make the bad noises go away.

387
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,125
I want to clean.

388
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,208
That's wacky, right?

389
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,458
Ohmigosh, that's crazy.

390
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,125
Be careful Akira, you're about
to fall through a trap door.

391
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,083
Your death will be remembered!

392
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,458
Why didn't you stop me sooner?

393
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,291
I'm a vapid void of blah.

394
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,916
You're kind of a being a total
pain in my ass right now,

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that's something, isn't it?

396
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,666
I want you to jump, faster!

397
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,250
You mean like this?

398
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,958
I was jumping twice that fast!

399
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,750
I can't go faster.

400
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,791
I'm starting to get sick.

401
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,666
[laughing]

402
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,708
Somebody please make it stop!

403
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,833
I want to go home to
my mommy now, okay.

404
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,416
I wet my pants
when I get like this

405
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,416
and don't like
wetting my pants.

406
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,083
We're running out of time.

407
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,166
Hurry up, Sieglinde.

408
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,625
Whoops, I've made
some kind of mistake.

409
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,833
How could I let
this happen to me?

410
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,166
Because you didn't listen to me.

411
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,125
Oh, hey there, Jin.

412
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,458
Do you want me to get a you a
nice cool glass of ice water?

413
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,583
And maybe a pair of handcuffs
while I'm up.

414
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,166
I finally made it.

415
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,458
Once I shut this
down, Toa, Amadeus

416
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,708
and everyone goes
back to normal.

417
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,708
I think it's time for
me to save some lives.

418
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,291
Kazuki, Akira, Captain Raina.

419
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,500
Your noble
self-giving sacrifices

420
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,083
will be remembered
by us forever.

421
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,625
You'll be missed.

422
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,416
I hope you can all
rest in peace.

423
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,791
Sieglinde,
we're not dead! So,

424
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,166
I was wondering.

425
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,750
Where did that CSS
field come from anyway?

426
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,041
A team we were
never aware of

427
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,958
was developing it
in parallel to ours

428
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,166
but it didn't work right
so they had to scrap it.

429
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,000
Theirs totally had better
funding than ours though

430
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,500
which kinda makes me pissed.

431
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,958
And the lightning
strike during the storm

432
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,000
caused it to start
functioning on its own.

433
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,291
Well, I guess if you think of it

434
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,625
as part of the entertainment
it wasn't really that bad.

435
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,125
Right, Amadeus?

436
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,750
Stop teasing him Akira.

437
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,875
He feels terrible
about what happened.

438
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,625
I'm not sure he's ever going to
be able to recover from it.

439
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,791
Oh, miss, of course I will.

440
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,958
Well, at least everyone
appears to have turned back

441
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,416
into their normal selves
for the most part.

442
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,166
Howlingstar sucking
his thumb on my lap

443
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,166
is an image I'd like
never to repeat if possible.

444
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,208
You're gonna have to stop

445
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,666
bringing that up
or I will kill you.

446
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,541
Gio and Widow are so much
more fun to be around when

447
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,875
they're not
quite so entertaining.

448
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:54,583
I think there's one
person here who wishes

449
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,083
a certain someone hadn't changed
back to her old self.

450
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,916
Look.

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,750
Uh.

452
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,250
Jin.

453
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,000
What's the matter?

454
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,291
Can you um, do that thing
where you were meowing

455
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,041
like a sexy cat
again for me, Toa?

456
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,916
It was so damn hot.

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,166
It was really really hot.

458
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,916
I don't know how.

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,125
Just try, now meow like a cat.

460
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,500
Like a cat?

461
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,083
Make the cat noise for me Toa!

462
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,208
Jin, what's the matter with you?

463
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,958
I want my old Jin back.

464
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,333
Where'd he go?

465
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,875
Come on, Meow!

466
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:34,291
I've never understood why
humans act so crazy sometimes.

467
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,000
Looks like it's
clearing up out there.

468
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,125
I have to say though.

469
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,708
We've caught nothing.
