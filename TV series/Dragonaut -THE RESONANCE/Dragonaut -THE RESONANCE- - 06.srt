We are currently en route from
Area C carrying 5 bodies.

We've finished with Area G.

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,750
Our unit will continue
the search at Area N.

00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,166
We got a live one here!

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,875
I need assistance, stat!

[gasps]

10
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,583
What the...?

11
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,625
Resonance?

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,291
What?

13
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,458
You're asking to me take

14
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,750
the Lindworm Unit
off of the D Project?

15
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,083
Temporarily.

16
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,583
Go on.

17
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,583
Leave the D Project to the
Vritra Unit for the time being.

18
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,791
The Album is thought to be
hiding in the city on the moon

19
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,333
and in my opinion
the Lindworm Unit

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:46,125
would best be utilized
trying to capture her there.

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,125
The Album could
change everything.

22
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,583
Just think sir.

23
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,250
This Dragon could be the key
to understanding Thanatos.

24
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,000
In that regard, the capture
of the Album could be

25
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:58,375
one of the most important
aspects of the D Project.

26
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,375
[grunts] Unfortunately,
the Gillard Army

27
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,875
is already executing
moon-based operations.

28
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,500
The Gillard Army's objective
is Gio and ours is the Album.

29
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,375
We may find that our missions

30
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,583
are complementary
to one another.

31
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,458
Hmm.

32
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,875
Gio!

33
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,833
All right people, listen up.

34
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,541
We've just received orders
to deploy to the moon at once.

35
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,250
Wait a minute, are we going
there to bring Gio back?

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,083
Our objective is very specific.

37
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,541
We are to capture
The Album... and not Gio.

38
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,208
Kazuki...
you're to stay here.

39
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:00,125
Come on, let's
go Howlingstar.

40
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,833
Raina.

41
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,166
What exactly do
you have in mind?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,458
Suddenly proposing that we

43
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,583
go to the moon to
capture the Album?

44
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
You tell me.

45
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,125
You're the one who put
me up to this right?

46
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,375
This is about the shuttle
accident isn't it?

47
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,416
What are you trying to say?

48
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,250
Oh, nothing.

49
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,458
After these missions

50
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,666
so many of our questions
will be answered.

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,416
We just need to
capture the Album.

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,041
And of course
bring Gio back.

53
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,625
Slow down.

54
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:41,250
Even if the Gillard Army does
somehow manage to capture Gio

55
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,250
they'll never
hand him over to us.

56
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,041
Wait, what do you mean?

57
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,458
Right now their top priority

58
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,541
is to obtain the formula
for Resonance.

59
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,083
In the same way that you
wish to study The Album,

60
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,958
Gio would be a live
test subject for them.

61
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,666
Well, if you knew
that then why would...?

62
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,916
Are you really
willing to turn over

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,083
the Resonance
formula to them?

64
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,208
More often than not when someone
demands everything.

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,375
They get nothing.

66
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041

can't hear Toa's song?

so well before!
