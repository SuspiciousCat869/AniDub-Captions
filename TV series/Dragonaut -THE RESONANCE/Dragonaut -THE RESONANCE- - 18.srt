The world sees them both as
the same uncontrollable blaze.

102

But where would the world be

103
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,541
if it had never harnessed
the power of fire?

I think it would be good

105

if the ISDA and the Gillard
Army continued to cooperate

from here on out.

It has left Pluto's orbit,

proceeding toward Saturn.

Thanatos is
in its Heaven,

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,125
Sakaki wanted to get
rid of them all.

164
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,541
In light of the tragedy on Mars.

165
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,500
I hate to think
about the time bomb

166
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,833
waiting to go off inside me.

167
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,458
One can never be sure.

168
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,458
Professor that
will never happen.

169
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:29,250
Exactly what is it that Thanatos
is planning to do to us?

170
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,833
I don't know.

171
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,708
Thanatos' thoughts don't come
through at all anymore.

172
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,833
There's not much time left.

173
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,000
I can feel it.

174
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,791
[JIN] Well, that takes
care of the shopping.

175
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,000
So, do you want to go
anywhere else today?

176
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,416
I just heard about a new place
from the girls at work.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,583
It's supposed to be
a great little bakery

178
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,833
that opened last week.

179
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,958
The croissants they have
there are to die for.

180
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,166
I love croissants.

181
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,416
Wanna take a look?

182
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,166
Yeah, let's check it out.

183
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,583
Hey Mom, look at that!

184
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,583
It's the first star!

185
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,833
That's not a star. It's Mars.

186
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,166
Mars?

187
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,791
Yes.

188
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,208
A year ago, there was
a terrible Dragon,

189
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,458
who ran wild and
destroyed the planet.

190
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,541
That's why Mars
burns bright red now

191
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:19,416
and you can see
it during the day.

192
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,833
Are Dragons bad?

193
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:25,333
Yes, they're very bad and scary.

194
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,625
Toa...

195
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,666
Thanatos continues to follow
its course towards Earth

196
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,583
and based on
recent observations

197
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,291
ISDA estimates that
we have seven years.

198
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,958
Thanatos will then be
in proximity to earth.

199
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,500
And now for the
financial update.

200
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,583
Gio, we're home!

201
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,916
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes.

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,833
Tonight, we're going
have noodles and a soup.

203
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,333
Aw, if you could have
waited a little bit longer,

204
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,750
I would have
helped you out.

205
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,833
No thank you.

206
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,000
Why not?

207
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,625
You can't cook. I'm sorry.

208
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,250
You mistook
the boiling potpourri

209
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,333
for after dinner tea
and served it to all of us.

210
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,416
Just imagine what you
could do to our food.

211
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,166
Toa it's okay, it tasted great.

212
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
That's so sweet.

213
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,958
But someday I'll have
to learn how to--

214
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,250
Sieglinde?

215
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,583
Who cooked this stuff?

216
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,916
I'll bet you it was, Gio.

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,583
That's correct.

218
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,291
Way too much seasoning.

219
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,166
I can't taste anything
besides salt.

220
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,875
Is that bad?

221
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,500
Why're you here?

222
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh please!

223
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,875
Why would a Dragon need glasses?

224
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,666
Is it a disguise?

225
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
That's pathetic.

226
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,208
I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

227
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,583
It's all the dust in here.

228
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,166
Gesundheit.

229
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,875
After covering up your
whereabouts on Mars,

230
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,875
I wondered what you
guys were up to.

231
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,000
It's sad.

232
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,541
I never would have thought you'd
be here playing house like this.

233
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,875
You disappoint me.

234
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,916
We haven't just
"played house."

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,916
[knocking on door]

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,458
Such a lovely reunion.

237
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,416
Yonamine.

238
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,458
Yeah. How's it going?

239
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,541
Kazuki.

240
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,833
I will grant your wish.

241
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,541
I will kill Jin for you.

242
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,541
Well, what else?

243
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
Looks like the three of you

244
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,458
are doing pretty
well for yourselves.

245
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,083
Um, Yonamine...

246
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,583
Have you been watching
over us this entire time?

247
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,166
Yeah for the most part.

248
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,083
You all should be ashamed.

249
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,541
Living up here like
there's nothing wrong with it.

250
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,541
Some hippie commune.

251
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,041
All alone.

252
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
What have you been doing anyway?

253
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,875
Nothing unusual.

254
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,916
Each one of us is
holding down a job.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,625
And we take turns cooking for
each other in the evenings.

256
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,333
This time together has
been like a dream.

257
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:38,666
Hmm. Like a dream.
Must be nice!

258
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,375
Wake up, Jin Kamishina!

259
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,666
You drag everyone around you
into chaos and at the end.

260
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,208
You retire out to
the countryside

261
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,000
and live out your
little fantasy life!

262
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,833
That's what you call a dream?

263
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,833
You've got to be kidding me!

264
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,875
Your dream had a price,
Akira and Machina.

265
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,416
[RESEARCHER] Agathions
number 01 through number 07

266
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,125
show no irregularities.

267
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:10,833
Moving on to reconstruction of
their remote control units.

268
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:27,083
What've I done? I'm a fool.

269
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,541
What's wrong daddy?

270
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,916
The ISDA, they want to kill
off all remaining Dragons.

271
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,166
[EVERYONE gasps]

272
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,458
We rebelled against them,

273
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,125
and tried to run away
with our Dragons.

274
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,708
But Raina and Howlingstar
have been caught.

275
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:52,250
And Amadeus gave
himself up to save me.

276
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,791
Commander Sakaki is planning

277
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,500
to exterminate
everyone still alive.

278
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,125
But if they do that,
Thanatos might become angry,

279
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,166
and destroy this entire planet.

280
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,333
He's planning to kill Thanatos.

281
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,208
That's Sakaki's
only logical endgame.

282
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,625
But as endgames go,
it's less than satisfying.

283
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,583
Thanatos isn't even
the least bit interested

284
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,541
in the people here on Earth.

285
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,291
Once it has retrieved
the Dragons,

286
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,041
Thanatos will simply leave
this solar system quietly.

287
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,666
Then Earth is
nothing more than

288
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,916
a convenient place
for spawning dragons.

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Of course, that's not going to
convince the rest of the world.

290
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,000
Look at you.

291
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,833
You've become
quite the little human

292
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,500
over this last year,
haven't you?

293
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,041
If this were a
three ring circus,

294
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,666
I think that would
make you the clown.

295
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,041
You may be right.

296
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,500
I think so too, sometimes.

297
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,583
Now what?

298
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,958
What do you want to do?

299
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,041
You can't just cling
to them forever

300
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:05,041
like a turd hanging
off a goldfish, right?

301
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,333
What's so great about Jin?

302
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,083
Why do you waste your life
hanging out here with him?

303
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,041
I just love him.
Isn't that enough?

304
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,041
But you wouldn't
feel that way at all

305
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,375
if you hadn't gone
through a resonance with Jin.

306
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,666
It's not something
you chose on your own.

307
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,708
Something that
I chose on my own?

308
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,208
Jin, I need you to
bring me a bath towel!

309
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,416
It better be clean and
fluffy, preferably blue.

310
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,875
What?

311
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,041
Why should I get you anything?

312
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,708
You've been nothing but
a little snot towards me!

313
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,125
Look twerp!

314
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,625
Amadeus would've had it ready
for me without a word.

315
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,666
I'm not Amadeus.

316
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,958
I'll just leave it here!

317
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,958
Wait, Jin!

318
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,958
Jin, the water's
getting cold!

319
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,416
Don't be so stingy with
the heat out there!

320
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,291
Boy, you certainly are a little
princess, aren't you.

321
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,666
Toa.

322
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,375
Jin. Let's talk.

323
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,500
You don't have
to say anything.

324
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,208
Jin.

325
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,083
I've enjoyed every moment.

326
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,208
Yes.

327
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,916
I'll hold on to this
moment forever.

328
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,833
Clown, huh? Right.

329
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,458
Thanatos.

330
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,625
We've worked this
whole year through.

331
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,125
I wish we got bonuses.

332
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,208
I know a bonus would be nice.

333
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,833
Hey, doesn't it still feel like
it's only been one week?

334
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,166
My pay went up $100 per hour!

335
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,666
You're working here part-time?

336
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,833
Huh?

337
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,333
Aren't you getting
paid in space food?

338
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,916
Free food?

339
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,166
Oh, right, they said if we do
the preview, we'd get a bonus.

340
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,666
On the next Dragonaut,
father-daughter discord!

341
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,625
Hey, stop fighting for it!
