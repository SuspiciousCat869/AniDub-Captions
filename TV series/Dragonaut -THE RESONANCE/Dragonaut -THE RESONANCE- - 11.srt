1
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,125
Why is it that
women lose the ability

2
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,666
to make a simple decision every
time they go out shopping?

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't start.

4
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,541
The only reason I'm
here in the first place

5
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,708
is because you said
I should wear perfume.

6
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,166
Don't get technical.

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,208
We've been doing
this for three hours.

8
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,791
At this rate,
our entire date

9
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,000
will consist of me
watching you smell stuff.

10
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,583
Hey, I can't help it.

11
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,958
I've never had to
wear perfume before.

12
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,500
I don't even know which
one of these I should get.

13
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,250
Why don't you try this one?

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,291
Wow. That's great.

15
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,958
I know, right?

16
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,083
I think your boyfriend will
like this one too, Dr. Kitajima.

17
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,666
Wait. You're the...

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,541
Yup! My name is Nanami Hoshi
and I've been assigned

19
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,750
to be your graduate
student assistant, Doctor.

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,625
I'm really
looking forward to this.

21
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,125
What's going on?

22
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,875
I don't understand
why you're doing this?

23
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,666
Tell me why?

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,125
Shut your mouth.

25
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,833
This is Nanami, come in.

26
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,541
I've taken control
of their submarine.

27
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,708
We're right on schedule.

28
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,958
[GARNET] Very good. We'll
retrieve the Album shortly.

29
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,666
Roger.

30
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,208
That gun.
It's Gillard issue right?

31
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,416
We'll be taking
the Album along with us.

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,333
Nanami...

33
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,250
Tell me why.

34
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,000
This is stupid!

35
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,666
What reason did they give
for us to sit and do nothing?

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,375
I thought Akira and
Machina were our friends.

37
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,375
Take it easy, Sieglinde.

38
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,750
The commander says
he has some sort of plan.

39
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,708
We just have to
follow his orders.

40
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,583
I shouldn't have
said that you were the one

41
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,333
who gave me clearance but,
there was no other way.

42
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,208
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,958
Gio's too important for me
to give him up without a fight.

44
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,000
It seems only
the young are allowed

45
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,375
to get away with
behaving so foolishly.

46
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,000
You are off the hook for now.

47
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,208
But I am ordering you not
to act on your own again.

48
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,666
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,208
You have my word.

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:34,208
Of course, if you succeed well,
then no harm done.

51
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,833
The order stands.

52
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,916
We are to remain at
our current status. Understood?

53
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
[AKIRA]
Well? See anything?

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,291
[MACHINA] Yes.

55
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,500
The special forces unit
has sealed off the bridge.

56
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,083
But, I don't see Raina
and the others with them.

57
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,666
That means
they're just trying

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,958
to keep an eye on
us, nothing more.

59
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,583
But why?

60
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,833
Well...

61
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,208
If they really
meant to catch us,

62
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,916
Raina and the others
would be coming after us,

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,750
not just
the special forces.

64
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,625
That makes sense.

65
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,041
Well, there's no point

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,083
in us hanging around
here anymore, right?

67
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,083
I think I know
a place where we can go.

68
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,458
[JIN] Really?

69
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,458
Yep, it's just a big
old haunted house.

70
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,625
[JIN gasps]

71
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,541
It is?

72
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,125
[AKIRA laughing]
I'm only teasing.

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,916
When they built
up the new city

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,041
nobody wanted to stay
in this area anymore.

75
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,666
Now all these houses
are completely empty.

76
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,708
All right, the lights are on!

77
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,625
The water seems
to be running, too.

78
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,041
[AKIRA gasps]

79
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,916
Know what that means?

80
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,500
Ah, feels good.

81
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,625
[AKIRA sighs]
That was refreshing.

82
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,500
[JIN gasps in embarassment]

83
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,375
Sorry!

84
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,875
I forgot that you're a guy.

85
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,583
So, what should we do now?

86
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:36,250
There's no going back for me
and Machina, that's for sure.

87
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,833
[JIN] The only
thing I want is Toa.

88
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,541
There's nothing
else for me.

89
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,541
Yeah, I guess there's not
much else for you, is there?

90
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,416
There's one more thing.

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,083
Could you put
your panties back on?

92
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,625
Oh yeah, right, sorry.

93
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,083
Time to go, Doctor.

94
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,416
The Album!

95

Stupid girl.

This is Kitajima!

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,083
Maybe there.

[OPERATOR A]
Detached from submarine.

Agathion 2, all clear.

[GARNET] How is
the Album doing?

106
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,416
She's still sleeping.

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,541
I see.

108
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,708
Why did you decide to
let those people all live?

109
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
You didn't order
me to kill them.

110
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,583
[GARNET chuckles]

111

Next time I'll have to be sure
not to forget that part.

are planning to isolate us here?

Where am I?

What do you mean
the Album has been taken?

Yes.

126
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,458
We just received an emergency
message from Dr. Kitajima.

127
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,541
Nanami Hoshi was a spy
for the Gillard Army.

128
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,208
There's more Commander.

129
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,958
Our radar has picked
up an unknown ship

130
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,125
taking off from the sea near
Shin-Ogasawara Terminal City.

I don't think
there can be any doubt

132

that it was a Gillard spaceship,
with the Album aboard.

good when we do it for real.

Don't worry, Itsuki.

145
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,500
Right. We should get
to the briefing room.

146

This is the Type X warhead also
code named as the Dragon Slayer.

147
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,875
Now, pay attention
to its effectiveness.

148
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,250
This missile has quite a nasty
kick to it when launched,

149
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,291
and even with
your Dragon's abilities,

150
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,208
it will be difficult to
maintain attitude control.

151
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,666
Even though this missile
can be overwhelming,

152
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,750
you must strike the exact
center of the target core

153
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,708
or it is
completely worthless.

154
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,208
We have no idea how an unknown

155
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,500
life form like
Thanatos will react.

156
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,916
We have to assume that we will
only get one shot at this.

157
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,958
Only one chance. Remember that.
