00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,333
[MARTINA] Laura!
Don't go too far.

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,916
Promise me you'll
finally take some time off?

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,458
[SAKAKI] I promise.

4
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,833
I'll see you the
day after tomorrow.

5
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,458
Just wait for me there. Okay?
[LAURA giggles]

00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,208

00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,250
[crowd gasps]

8
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,583
[SAKAKI yelling in agony]
Laura! Martina!

9
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,000
[JIN] Ai.

10
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,916
[TOA] I'm the one who
collided with the shuttle

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,250
I'm the one you
should be blaming.

12
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,083
I killed your family!

13
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,250
No... It can't be.

14
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,916
Please, tell me
that isn't true.

15
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
What the?

16
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,416
Gio!

17
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,458
[RAINA] I'm afraid
playtime is over.

18
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,333
[KAZUKI] Commander Raina.

19
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,125
Don't try anything foolish.

20
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,375
Don't you see this is
about more than just you?

21
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,208
You're not allowed
to hurt him!

22
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,041
That was my only condition for
surrendering myself to you.

23
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,875
Surrender?

24
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,250
Wait a minute,
you mean you weren't captured?

25
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,000
There's something important
that I really have to do.

26
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,291
So for now, just do
exactly what they tell you.

27
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,750
Toa.

28
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,083
Alright, I need you
to explain all this.

29
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,833
Tell me why you
took the Album out.

30
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,583
Well you see...

31
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,583
It was something I...

32
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,041
It was a special tactic!

33
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
A tactic?

34
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,041
It was a secret order
from Captain Sakaki.

35
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm sorry sir.

36
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,916
I assumed you knew the plan.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,583
It was just a trap
for Jin and Gio.

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,750
You were acting under
Sakaki's orders?

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:33,500
Yes sir. I'm surprised
you didn't know.

40
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,500
All right then,
I see no problems here.

41
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,416
You can go now.

42
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,666
If you'll excuse me, sir.

43
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,666
[OPERATOR 1 (M)]
Releasing security locks.

44
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,750
The data is all here.

45
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,458
You now have
everything you need

46
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,125
to manufacture
the Resonance Formula.

47
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,041
Gio is no longer of
any concern to you.

48
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,083
[GARNET] This will be a
fine consolation prize.

49
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
That is.

50
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,208
If the data is genuine.

51
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,166
[OPERATOR 1 (M)]
Wait. What the...?

52
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,416
You've really out done
yourselves this time.

53
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,541
We have the Album, Gio,
and Jin Kamishina with us.

54
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,833
We departed without incident
at 20:30, lunar time.

55
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,958
Outstanding work.

56
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,250
Kazuki Tachibana and
Widow are also with us.

57
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,958
I see.

58
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,375
They deserve the credit
for this mission.

59
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,958
The capture of the Album and
the others was the result

60
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,541
of their perfect execution
of your special orders.

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,125
What do you mean
special orders?

62
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,500
Did Kazuki tell you that?

63
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,041
Yes.

64
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:35,041
He told me that his plan of
action came straight from you.

65
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,833
Tell him... he did well.

66
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,625
I intended to tell you
about this plan of mine.

67
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,875
I failed to do so. I apologize.

68
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:50,166
Please, there's no reason
for you to apologize.

69
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,750
Our ETA is a little over
eight hours from now.

70
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,125
I'll give you a detailed
report upon our arrival.

71
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,750
That's all for now.
Over and out.

72
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,458
Saki.

73
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,875
[SAKI] Yes?

74
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,250
Display all of Kazuki
Tachibana's personal data.

75
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,750
Yes sir.

76
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,375
[NANAMI] Hello Doctor.

77
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,458
[KITAJIMA] I'm leaving for the
day, and I'll be out of touch.

78
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,208
That means you're in charge.

79
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,375
Somebody's got a date tonight.

80
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,791
That's a lovely scent
you're wearing.

81
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,583
Oh. Thank you Nanami.

82
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,333
Well, off I go.

83
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,083
Good luck with everything!

84
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,625
To the future of the D Project.

85
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,958
How delicious.

86
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,041
[NOZAKI] You seem to
be in a good mood.

87
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,416
Yes and you should be
happy too, professor.

88
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,833
Why should I be?

89
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,333
It's what we've always wanted.

90
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,000
We finally got our hands
on a live test subject.

91
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,625
Yeah, we sure did.

92
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,833
So now you've got

93
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,041
even more precious
research material, right?

94
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,041
Our future depends
on this research.

95
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,666
This is the opportunity that all
of humanity has been hoping for.

96
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,000
All of humanity?

97
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,916
Right.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's not selfish at all.

99
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,208
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,500
You're so giddy, I
couldn't help myself.

101
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,583
Please forgive me.

102
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,291
You must know how
important this is.

103
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,291
To be able to
analyze the biology

104
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,375
of a live original dragon.

105
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,875
That could give us an advantage;

106
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:34,625
it could even mean
victory for us.

107
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,708
It could mean victory, could.

108
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,083
[AKIRA yawns] Everywhere I
look there's nothing but stars.

109
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
[SIEGLINDE] Stay sharp Akira.

110
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,583
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,333
What was that?

112
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,083
We have multiple heat
sources at six o'clock guys!

113
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
They're here.

114
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,250
The Gillard Army.

115
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,000
What are they planning?

116
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
If you honestly thought

117
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,375
I wouldn't retaliate
after being lied to,

118
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,125
then you still
have a lot to learn.

119
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,875
You cross me. You die.

120
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,916
Incoming missiles!

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,583
Evade!

122
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,708
Dammit!

123
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,750
They've really done
it now haven't they?

124
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,333
Let's get to it Machina!

125
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,500
Hold on!

126
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,250
I'll get confirmation
from headquarters.

127
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,083
Don't take any action against
them until we know our order.

128
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,291
Sure enough.

129
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,541
A warrior like that won't
just let us walk out of here.

130
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,208
[RYOKO] I don't understand!

131
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,708
The Gillard Army is attacking!

132
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,958
[MEGUMI] Uh sir.

133
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,875
They're not responding
to our communiqué.

134
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,291
Commander.

135
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,291
We're getting a secure
transmission from ISDA!

136
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,625
Sakaki!

137
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,541
What the hell is
going on out there?!

138
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
Attack immediately!

139
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
I mean, I want a full report.

140
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,041
That was nasty.

141
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,166
Amadeus! The shuttle!

142
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,375
[AMADEUS roars]

143
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,750
[SIEGLINDE screams]

144
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,750
No, Sieglinde!

145
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,000
Amadeus has been hit!

146
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,708
They'll all be
killed at this rate!

147
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,875
Wait! Do not
attack them yet!

148
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,208
I'm contacting the
government right now!

149
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:16,875
Gillard Army please
come in! This is ISDA, over!

150
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,750
Permission granted!

151
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,375
No! Sakaki!

152
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,583
All right Lindworm Unit!

153
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,250
Commence the attack!

154
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,791
Roger that.

155
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,583
Let's go Howlingstar.

156
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,708
[HOWLINGSTAR roars]

157
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,041
Well it's about time!

158
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,791
Let's go Machina!

159
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
[MACHINA roars]

160
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,000
Are you okay Amadeus?

161
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
[AMADEUS roars]

162
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,208
Howlingstar go!

163
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,708
Machina!

164
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,541
Let's do this Amadeus!

165
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,458
Hey! Not so fast!

166
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,791
[RAINA]
That's strange.

167
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,916
They didn't put up
much of a fight.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,791
[RAINA gasps]
This was a diversion!

169
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,916
They were just luring us
away from the shuttle!

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,833
There's no way we can make
it back to save them.

171
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,500
[growls and roars]

172
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,375
[GARNET laughs]

173
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,291
Hang on!

174
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,625
It's time to go, Jin.

175
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,958
We've got to protect Toa.

176
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,250
Okay.

177
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,791
Break through the
line no matter what!

178
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,291
But there are
so many of them!

179
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,750
It would be different if they
were just in front of us.

180
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,625
Machina!

181
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,166
The main cannon.

182
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,500
Prepare to fire it.

183
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
Ma'am, Our drones have
completely surrounded the enemy.

184
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,125
They'll be in the line of fire.

185
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:17,166
No matter.

186
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
[GARNET smirks] 

187
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,416
Fire!

188
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,666
[HABARAGI]
How do you do. Raina? 

189
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,541
It's you.

190
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
Hey, is that Otohime?

191
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,500
The Captain of the Vritra Unit.

192
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:02,000
Captain Itsuki Habaragi.

193
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:08,000
[HABARAGI] It's been quite some
time, hasn't it Mr. Cromwell.

194
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:12,833
I had hoped our next meeting
would be more elegant than this.

195
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,416
[HABARAGI]
We don't even have time

196
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,458
to exchange proper
greetings now do we?

197
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,500
It sure looks that way.

198
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,250
The boy does have
luck on his side.

199
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Status report.

200
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,875
Ma'am!

201
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,291
The Agathions will reach
the cargo hold momentarily.

202
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,791
The enemy is here!

203
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,166
The Album's life is in danger!

204
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
Gio.

205
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,416
It was her, Toa.

206
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,333
She killed my family.

207
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,208
Snap out of it!

208
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,708
It's like you told me.

209
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,708
No matter what, you'd do
anything to protect Toa.

210
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,666
Can't you see that
now is the time!

211
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,916
Oh Sis.

212
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,500
Toa.

213
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,291
Who are you?

214
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,166
My name's Toa.

215
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,833
I see.

216
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,333
Let's go, Gio!

217
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,541
We have to protect Toa!

218
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,833
That's Gio!

219
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,083
[OPERATOR 3 (F)] We've lost
control of Agathion B.

220
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,708
Gio took out that
Agathion in one blow.

221
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,000
Is it Kazuki Tachibana
aboard him?

222
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,458
Sir, no it isn't.

223
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,458
It's Jin Kamishina.

224
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,458
What is he doing there?

225
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,208
It's that kid again.

226
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,958
Jin Kamishina.

227
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,916
All right Gio, we gotta get
that thing off the shuttle!

228
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,166
[OPERATOR 3 (F)] The Agathions
have been defeated.

229
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,875
There are no survivors.

230
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,625
All personnel
retreat immediately!

231
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,666
The Gillard Army has
begun retreating!

232
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,500
They did it!
Thank goodness!

233
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,541
[HABARAGI] It looks like we'll
live to fight another day.

234
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,041
We owe you.

235
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,125
I'll have to find a way to
thank you some other time.

236
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,583
[HABARAGI] I look
forward to it, Raina.

237
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,458
[HABARAGI] Now if
you'll excuse me.

238
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,333
Listen up everyone!

239
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,833
During all of the fighting

240
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,041
the shuttle's re-entry angle
began to stray dramatically.

241
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,166
Can't you correct
that from here?

242
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,583
I'm afraid not!

243
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,416
Attitude control isn't
responding!

244
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,041
Oh no!

245
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
Captain Cromwell.

246
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,791
Come in, Captain Cromwell!

247
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,500
The shuttle is off course!

248
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,375
Can you correct the ship's
course manually?

249
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,291
There's no way we can
catch up to it.

250
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,083
There's got to be something
we can do to help them out.

251
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,916
Unless we figure something out.

252
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,583
The shuttle will burn up as soon
as it enters the atmosphere.

253
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,916
The shuttle is entering
the upper atmosphere!

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,416
Fuselage surface temperature is
about to reach critical level!

255
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,083
Is that...?

256
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,166
Gio!

257
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,583
C'mon! You've got
to go even faster!

258
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,541
What are they going to do?

259
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,041
Oh no.

260
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,708
They're planning on being
a shield for the shuttle.

261
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,958
The ship's hull is now in an
unstable thermo-plasmic state.

262
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,875
Two minutes until we can
reacquire the image.

263
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,375
C'mon!

264
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,625
Don't give up now, Gio!

265
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,583
Stay strong Gio!

266
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,958
You can do it!

267
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,458
You and I.

268
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,583
We must protect Toa!

269
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,333
Incredible.

270
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,166
How did they ever come
up with that idea?

271
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,833
Re-aquiring image.

272
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,958
It's safe!
The shuttle is safe!

273
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,291
They made it!

274
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,833
Jin!

275
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,291
You never quit do you?

276
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,833
Welcome to ISDA.

277
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,041
Album, there are
a number of questions

278
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,541
that you can help us answer.

279
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,583
But first I want
you to see this.

280
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,750
[TOA gasps]

281
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,083
This thing is one of you.

282
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,125
[TOA whimpers]

283
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,791
Let me out!

284
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,791
Let me out of here!

285
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,875
Let me see Toa!

286
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,666
Toa!

287
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,958
Let me.

288
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,791
See her.

289
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,166
Saki here.

290
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,083
Ryoko here.

291
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,083
Megumi here

292
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,416
She's talking in her sleep.

293
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,541
How sneaky.

294
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,125
Sometimes she even
sleeps at work.

295
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,583
You mean she takes naps?

296
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,666
No, I mean she's asleep
but still working.

297
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,833
It's scary.

298
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,166
She could be gifted
in a certain sense.

299
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,541
It's okay, Commander
Sakaki sleeps too.

300
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,458
You're kidding!

301
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,500
Yep!

302
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,416
I am kidding!

303
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Oww!

304
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,083
Ouch.

305
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,333
Next time, lots of people
go different places.

306
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:27,125
Amazing, she's doing the
preview while sleeping.
