00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,125
On the 9th of this month,
ISDA Flight 029

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,833
took off from Sorajima
International Spaceport

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,833
and exploded in midair
shortly after takeoff.

4
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,083
48 passengers
and crew were killed.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,333
Miraculously, there
was a single passenger,

6
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,083
Jin Kamishina,
who escaped with his life.

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,583
The government's investigation
recovered shuttle fragments,

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,291
which may prove
crucial in determining

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,833
the cause of the crash.

10
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,208
It's here. The Atrum.

11

12
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,791
Where am I?

13
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,958
This is goodbye, Jin.

14
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,958
Don't leave me come back!

15
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,625
Toa!

16
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,166
Is that?

17
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,625
Gio, let's go.

18
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,041
Gio.

19
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:40,250
Spirytus never said much,
but we got along well.

20
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,958
Makes no sense.

21
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,500
It's like he was
different somehow.

22
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,791
He was like a brother
and I killed him.

23
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,916
It's not your fault, Howl.

24
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was an order.

25
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:59,083
You only did what any one
of us would have done.

26
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,916
A Master's command
cannot be contradicted.

27
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,625
That is the way
it will always be

28
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,375
beginning the moment
Resonance takes place.

29
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,791
I could never give
the order to kill someone.

30
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,333
That's enough.

31
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,291
How did it end up
like this anyway?

32
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,791
Why would Spirytus
do all those things?

33
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,208
Was it because of Amagi?

34
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,875
The ISDA's investigation
is looking into that right now.

35
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,541
It's the only thing we can do.

36
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,625
Howlingstar, I'm so sorry.

37
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,541
Kamishina and the Dragon Gio.

38
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,333
We need to find
and capture the two of them

39
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,750
as soon as we possibly can.

40
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,625
Before matters become any worse.

41
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:52,083
Gio... why go with him?

42
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,375
Why Gio? Why'd you go?

43
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,541
Now, are you certain of this?

44
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,375
It's not me saying it.

45
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,500
See, like it or not, one of
the survivors came around.

46
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,291
I showed him a picture of
Spirytus and he said it was him.

47
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,333
Why would a Communicator
commit mass murder?

48
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,916
It shouldn't be.
How could this happen?

49
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Continue your investigation.

50
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,458
Got it.

51
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,416
The Dragonauts are
spending all this time

52
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,250
searching for
Jin Kamishina and Gio.

53
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,625
I only wish they'd try
looking for the Album, as well.

54
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,750
Jin Kamishina is
the bait to catch her.

55
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,458
Whatever that's
worth at this point.

56
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,000
Have you heard
anything about Spirytus?

57
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,708
Mister Kiril believes the press

58
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
must not find out
anything about this.

59
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,708
He says the success of
the project depends on it.

60
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,541
Very well.

61
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,500
Then I guess there is only
one path left for us to choose.

62
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,166
There's no way we can go public

63
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,791
with the truth
about the D-project.

64
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,583
Telling mankind that we face

65
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,375
a crisis of
extraterrestrial proportions.

66
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,958
Would only serve to make
the populous more anxious.

67
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,208
After last night,
I'm not sure there's much more

68
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,125
we could do
to shake them up.

69
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,500
The government has to maintain

70
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,375
a certain level of
plausible deniability.

71
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,083
We cannot appear
to have sanctioned

72
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,833
this covert dragon project.

73
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,833
It's a little late for that.

74
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,583
Who knows how many
people have already

75
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,416
seen Dragonauts
riding their dragons.

76
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,125
There is no way
for us to deny it.

77
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,375
Yes, but...

78
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,500
Sakaki, why don't you
tell us what you think?

79
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,916
I'd like to hear your
thoughts on this matter.

80
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,791
If we need to
conceal his identity.

81
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,583
The perpetrator connected
to this string of murders.

82
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,333
If we're forced to keep
this incident secret.

83
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,333
Then I think it's time we
go public with the D Project.

84
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,833
I don't see what
choice we have.

85
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,500
I agree.

86
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,791
So nice clothes.

87
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,875
Humans wear this sort
of thing, don't they?

88
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,208
Gio, what are you to Toa?

89
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,375
I was born to be
the protector of Toa.

90
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,000
She needs protection?

91
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,041
Tell me what you are to Toa.

92
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,083
Me? Well...

93
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,416
What am I to Toa?

94
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:42,291
Wait, that singing.

95
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,208
It's Toa.

96
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,875
It's her, I'm certain.

97
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,791
Where? I don't hear anything.

98
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,458
I think she's singing to me.

99

The moon.

100
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Toa's on the moon.

I want you to know I'd never
tell you to kill anyone, either.

00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,500

Attention.

We've captured Jin Kamishina

00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,750
then this is over,
and I will leave you behind.

167
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,833
Yeah, I figured that.

168
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,083
We must leave.

169
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,291
No, hold on a minute.

170
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,166
I can't just fly off into
space like this, alright.

171
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,541
We have to get something first.

172
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,500
[alarm beeping]

173
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,041
C'mon open up.

174
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,083
Yes.

175
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,958
Freeze!

176
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,208
I wouldn't do that,
Jin Kamishina.

177
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,041
No you don't.

178
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay, now why don't
we try doing this again.

179
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,375
I have a few more
questions I'd like to ask you.

180
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,666
Please, let me go.

181
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,500
You're not even a master
so how did you ride a dragon?

182
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,750
How is it you
were able to ride Gio?

183
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,875
You haven't
undergone a resonance.

184
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,708
What are you talking about?

185
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,500
What does that even mean?

186
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,583
No good!
I'm not buying it. Talk!

187
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,958
Masters? Resonance? What?

188
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,125
I don't understand
what you're talking about?

189
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,708
I told you, don't play dumb!

190
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,083
I'm not playing dumb!

191
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,333
You're not making
any sense to me.

192
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,416
What is this place?

193
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,666
What is going on here!

194
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,166
I want to know right now!

195
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,833
So start talking!

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,375
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

197
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,583
But why is he with Gio, then?

198
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,875
I have to go and find her.

199
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,500
I've got to learn the truth.

200
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,666
Toa's the only one who knows.

201
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,958
No!

202
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,416
You're mine.

203
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,000
You have been through Resonance
with Kazuki.

204
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,416
Why are you refusing
to comply with his directives?

205
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,791
That's who I am!

206
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,958
I take orders from no one!

207
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,750
How is that possible?

208
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,708
Who knows?

209
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
You are very interesting.

210
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,416
But I'm not interested in you!

211
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,791
Machina!

212
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,791
[JIN] I have to go and find her.

213
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,416
I've got to learn the truth.

214
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,958
Toa's the only one who knows.

215
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,708
You don't have to go after him.

216
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,500
I want to see.

217
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
They might be able to change it.

218
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,958
Change?

219
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,375
The Dragon-human relationship.

220
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:50,458
I'm picking up G-10's
Actualization reading.

221
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,750
It's over the sea
near Shinogasawara.

222
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,416
Currently at Point Alpha-12,

223
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,583
rising at 2 kilometers
per second.

224
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,708
So that's Gio, huh?

225
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,333
G-10 is leaving
the stratosphere.

226
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,250
Radar signature fading.

227
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,000
G-10 lost.

228
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,333
Nowhere to hide.

229
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,375
You're going to the moon.

230
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,083
Prepare my transport ship.

231
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
I'm going after him.

232
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,708
That coward, he's taken my Gio.

233
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,333
I'll get him back, I swear!

234
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,833
Well, well, well...

235
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,000
if it isn't the Dragonaut
rookie without a dragon.

236
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,458
Are you sure you
can risk being here?

237
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,791
You never know when they
might order you to deploy.

238
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,291
Get off!

239
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,083
But that's kinda tough to
do without a dragon, right?

240
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,041
It's blue up there especially
the view of the earth.

241
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:09,958
You could say that
it changed my life.

242
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,083
There it is Earth.

243
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,958
♪ closing song ♪

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,541
Ready, set.

245
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:05,375
We're your ISDA operators,
Saki, Ryoko, Megumi.

246
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,833
The good part got all messed up!

247
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,500
Ryoko, you're one
who said we should all

248
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,583
say them together so
there wouldn't be any arguing.

249
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,333
Well, you agreed to it,
didn't you?

250
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,541
Don't argue about it.

251
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,958
Next time, we'll do it better.

252
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,166
Next time?

253
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,333
We have to do the preview!

254
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,333
Right!

255
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,250
Okay then, I'll do it!

256
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,458
Let's see.

257
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,291
Next time, all sorts
of people will attack!

258
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,083
Aw, I thought it was my turn!

259
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,166
How rude!
