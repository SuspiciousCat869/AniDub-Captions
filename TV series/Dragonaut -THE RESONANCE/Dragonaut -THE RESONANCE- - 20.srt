It's dark and hard to walk!

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,958
Ugh!

3
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,000
Why are we even
doing this anyway?

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,791
It's not gonna take them
very long to find that car.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,666
I'd like to avoid
any unnecessary danger.

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,708
You seem to have
gotten used to this.

7
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,916
The sea is on the other
side of this ridge.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,750
Hang with us kid.

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,708
Well come on then,
let's keep it moving.

10
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,083
This is disgusting!

11
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,500
I can't help but wonder.

12
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,125
What do you think the ISDA

13
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,833
is going to do with
all of the Dragons?

14
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,708
I don't know, but think,

15
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,666
if they are able to
give life to a dragon.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,666
We have to assume
they have the power

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,000
to take that
life away, as well.

18
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,958
The dragons are not safe.

19
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,375
No... wait.

20
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,291
I still...

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,541
[JIN] Why did things
have to be like this.

23
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,458
So you still haven't
found out where they went?

24
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,625
The search party is
investigating a lead right now.

25
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,916
They should be
contacting me shortly.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,916
They just keep running away.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,208
I'm giving the two of
you a different assignment.

28

A new mission? Go ahead.

29
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,875
It's an operating
test with the Aegis.

30
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,333
Aegis?

31
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,083
Aegis huh?

32
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,708
Interesting.

33
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
Understood, sir!

34
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,208
We will begin
our mission at once!

How long are they going to
keep us locked up in this place?

38
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,166
Hey, we're
getting bored in here!

39
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,083
You need to calm
down, Howlingstar.

40

I could break the walls
if I could Actualize!

[AMADEUS] Given the powerful
CSS field around us,

42
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,166
I doubt you will be
able to accomplish that.

43
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,625
I can understand how you feel.

44

While we're trapped
here in this prison cell,

45
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,041
Thanatos is moving closer
and closer to the Earth.

46
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,833
But that's not
the ISDA's priority.

47
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,583
It's their image,
they need to hunt dragons

48
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,958
to gain support
from the general public.

49
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,500
The Dragonauts used to
be treated like heroes.

50
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,583
Now we get
treated like criminals.

51
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,125
It's up to them.

52

They're the only ones left.

No we can't.

If the patrol boats see us
this will all be for nothing.

It's good to see you all again.

I don't understand.

We thought you could
use some reinforcements.

66
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,500
You can't attack
Tartarus on your own.

67

We haven't given up
hope that humans

68
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,375
and dragons can still co-exist.

That's why we're
here helping you.

70
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,375
We have to prevent the ISDA

71
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,500
from doing anymore harm,
and rescue the dragons.

72

Right!

74

Tell me, what happened to Gio?

Don't know,
he's gone missing.

He's gone missing?

I don't get it, why would he
wander away from us like that?

78
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,250
Well worrying about it isn't
going to help us solve anything.

79
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,791
If it comes down to it,
I'll think of something.

thing moving faster.

Okay.

89
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,250
My business only
concerns the dragons.

Hey!

91
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,125
I want to know what
you're going to do with them.

92
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,875
Then ask the commander,

93
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,375
I cannot divulge
that information to you.

95
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,250

approaching Tartarus

in the next few moments.

Yes we are.

Let's get started.

100

Alright, we're flooding
the container.

101

You know,
it's lucky you guys

102
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,291
had this
control gear with you.

103
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,041
Not really,
I brought it on purpose.

104
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,625
In case I needed to wear it.

105
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,583
You were planning to use it?

106
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,291
You don't think I could?

107
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,916
No of course not.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,958
Have you even had
any training at all?

Well, no.

You couldn't
operate the controls.

getting in the way.

whatever I can

120

in my real form, okay?

I give myself to
you completely, Jin.

123

To be honest with you,
I'm pretty scared.

126
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,375
Although, as long
as I have you with me.

127
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,708
I know things
will be all right.

Yes Jin.

00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,375
Are we really doing this?

131
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,333
I think we need
something to occupy

132
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,000
our time
until we find Jin.

133
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,416
I know.

134
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,375
But why is it necessary
to use them in the Aegis test?

135
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,833
Don't tell me
you've decided

136
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,333
now is a good time
to develop a conscience.

137
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,583
That's not what I meant.

138
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,041
It doesn't matter.

139
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,333

going to hell anyway.

by a CSS field.

too close to that thing Jin.

Sir communications with
Tartarus have been cut off.

Isn't it dangerous to go there?

155

The attack is likely
a diversion. We'll be fine.

into this stuff, Yonamine.

[KAZUKI laughing maniacally]

There's no way I can die
until after I've killed you!

Every time I can
feel this scar aching.

I think back to that cold,
dark hell where I felt nothing!

You'll get to see
this place too Jin.

you just get tired of Gio?

And now you've
moved on to Toa?

200

You gonna dump
her like you did Gio?

[KAZUKI] 
What's the matter Jin?

You're gonna die
if you don't fight back.

Or maybe you don't like
the idea of Toa killing anybody.

You're not taking
me seriously, Jin.

You don't understand

210
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,833
that I'm not out here
fighting to hurt anybody!

211

I'm only trying to preserve the
bond between humans and dragons!

I'll explain as we go.

Come on!

220
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,833
Where's Amadeus?

221
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,583
Where did Amadeus go?

222
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,125
They took him away.

223
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,666
Taken where?

224
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,125
The lower level.

225
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,500
That means...
they must be planning

226
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,875
to use the Aegis on them.

227
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,958
What's that?

228
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,250
It's an ultra high
output directional CSS field.

229
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,583
We developed
it with the hope

230
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,791
it would be strong enough
to immobilize Thanatos.

231
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,750
You mean they were
finally able to complete it?

232
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,500
A live dragon wouldn't stand
a chance against the Aegis.

233
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,541
They weren't meant to.

234
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,875
I suppose the team
we used to know

235
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,208
as the Dragonauts
doesn't exist any longer.

236
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,625
Let's get moving.

237
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,125
We're going to rescue them.

238

a little bigger than the last.

think they want with us?

feeling about this.

any of my commands!

are just past it!

249
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,458
I may have figured out
a way to save them.

00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,583
All of the power on Tartarus

251
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,958
is supplied by a single
underground reactor.

252
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,708
If we can find a way
to take out that reactor,

253
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,166

Good point.

And the CSS
field surrounding

256

the island would
be gone as well.

And then if
that happens Amadeus

258
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,750
and the others will be
able to escape on their own!

00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,833
[LAURA] Here it comes.

333
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,500
Get the hell away from me!

334
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,166
Gio.

335
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,916
You came back for us!

336
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,541
Gio...

337
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,958
What are you?

338
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,583
Alright, nobody's around.

339
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,541
Now to do the preview
while I can.

340
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,875
No you don't Kiril!

341
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,625
Sakaki, when did you get here?

342
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,291
Hey now, don't forget about me.

343
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,416
Professor Nozaki,
you're here too?

344
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,791
Please let me do this.

345
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,375
I've always wanted it.

346
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh no you don't.

347
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,166
Next time on Dragonaut.

348
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,833
It will return.

349
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,166
Why are you trying to
take our jobs away from us?

350
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,625
Saki where are your clothes?

351
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,166
Eh, hehe.
