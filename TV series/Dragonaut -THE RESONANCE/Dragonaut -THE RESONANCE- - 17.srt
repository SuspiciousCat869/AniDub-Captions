1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,208
They were out of
control, is that right?

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,666
Yes sir.

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,000
When a Dragon's Master dies,
the Dragon cannot maintain

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,916
its human-like
Communicator form.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
If this happens its natural
ferocity takes over

6
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,958
and it becomes
impossible to control.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,583
The fact of the
matter is we need Dragons;

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,375
but we need
them to be obedient

9
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,208
so that we may
reliably control them

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,041
in order to achieve our goals.

11
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,416
It is my understanding

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,875
that that's what
the Resonance is for,

13
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,708
a formula that allows
humans and dragons

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,750
to conduct communication.

15
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,625
Continue with
your investigation.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,708
Well then,
I'd better get back to it.

17
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,458
[ASIM laughing]

18
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,500
Do it! Yes!

19
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,250
Not good.

20
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,000
Machina!

21
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,750
[MACHINA screams in rage]

22
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,750
Watch out!

23
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,750
Her back!

24
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,958
Toa! What's the matter?
Are you all right?

25
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,166
Machina! Please, stop!

26
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,083
Machina!

27
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,458
Machina, why are
you doing this to us?

28
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,708
Gio you must all leave.

29
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,416
Run away.

30
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,041
What's happening to you?

31
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,166
Akira's gone so
the Resonance is coming undone.

32
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,583
Please just go!

33
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,625
What?

34
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
Run away.

35
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,375
Save yourselves.

36
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,208
I can't control what
I'm about to become.

37
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,916
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,166
It can't be stopped.

39
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,666
You wouldn't understand.

40
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,791
I'm not free like you are.

41
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,208
Machina please.

42
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,416
It's coming back.

43
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,458
[MACHINA screams in agony]

44
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,250
[HOWLINGSTAR gasping]

45
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,208
What is it?
What's wrong Howlingstar?

46
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,291
[HOWLINGSTAR gasping]

47
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,250
It... It feels just like.

48
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,291
Machina!

49
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,875
Raina!

50
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,666
Please let me go to her.

51
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
I'm begging you to give
me your permission.

52
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,333
Something terrible has
happened on Mars hasn't it?

53
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,041
Just a moment Sieglinde.

54
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,166
Please don't
try to stop us.

55
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,875
Try to stop you?

56
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,791
Now why would I do that?

57
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,458
Raina.

58
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,208
Actualization readings
at hatch number six!

59
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,666
What? Who is it?

60
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,625
It's Howlingstar and Amadeus!

61
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,666
They're rapidly accelerating
away from the moon base.

62
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,625
Open up a com line immediately!

63
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,083
They're offline sir!

64
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,958
They're both refusing all hails.

65
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,291
Where do they
think they're going?

66
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,875
I just hope we don't get
there too late to help them.

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,583
Wait! Stop right there!

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,458
This is trespassing!

69
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,833
This had better be good.

70
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,583
You're a busy man so
I'll get right to point.

71
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,458
We'd like you to
remove Prince Asim

72
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,250
as the officer in charge
of your nation's military

73
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,791
as soon as possible.

74
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,500
Why would I do that?

75
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,333
It has come to our
attention that your noble son

76
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,166
has been playing with fire.

77
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,791
Only the flame he toys with

78
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,916
could very well
scorch all of humanity.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,666
How dare you
march into my palace

80
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,041
and give me an order
in my own kingdom!

81
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
Forgive me your Highness.

82
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,708
We would never presume
to give you and order.

83
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,750
We're merely
making a request.

84
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,791
However, it would be in the
best interest of your nation

85
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,541
to comply as the entire
world may turn against you.

86
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:54,583
It appears to me that we
have reached an understanding.

87
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,333
Much appreciated. Good day.

88
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,875
Machina,
why are you doing this?

89
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,333
She's out of control!

90
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,375
Don't tell me that
you didn't know about this Jin.

91
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,958
A Dragon whose Master dies

92
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,625
is released from
humanity's oppression

93
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,333
and their true
nature is revealed.

94
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,875
When the human factor falls
away they become a pure Dragon.

96
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,291
Is it not the most incredible
thing you've ever witnessed?

97
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,625
You bastard!

98
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
Is that why you murdered Akira?

99
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,833
You're so naïve.

100
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,291
If only you could
see how disgusting it is

101
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,875
when Dragons are
contaminated by humans.

102
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,250
Contaminated?

103
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
That's right!

104
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,416
I must confess, the love
between you and the Album

105
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,916
is indeed staggering.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,250
However, the truth
is that the Album

107
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,291
has merely been
defiled by your filth.

108
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,083
Now then, Album.

109
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,541
I intend to liberate you
from this wretched creature.

110
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,791
Leave him alone!

111
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,166
I have not been bound to Jin!

112
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,166
Oh is that right?

113
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,083
Then why do you wear such a
pained expression on your face?

114
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,916
You're in pain
because you're a slave to Jin.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,958
I can release your heart
from that bondage!

116
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,416
Garnet!

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,416
Yes, Your Highness.

118
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,708
Get her!

119
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,958
Machina!

120
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,208
Over there!

121
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,708
He has an army.

122
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,500
The other side too!

123
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,333
Okay, Gio. Let's go.

124
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,500
Yeah.

125
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,958
I want to fight as well.

126
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,708
No Toa, let us handle
the fighting right now.

127
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,291
But.

128
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,875
Please try to understand it is
my sole purpose to protect you.

129
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,041
He's right.

130
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,166
You really should
let us deal with this.

131
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,833
Please. Be careful

132
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,416
Akira, Machina. Sit tight.

133
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,958
We'll be right back for you.

134
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,583
You will bow before me,
you insects! Bow!

135
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,375
All Agathion vitals are
within permissible levels

136
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,583
and there are no brain
stem core irregularities.

137

Releasing safeties
on all equipment.

138
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,166
All units ready for combat.

139
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Attack!

140
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,375
[ASIM laughing]

141
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,750
Not bad, are you?

142
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,375
How does this amuse you?

143
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,333
What reason could you have to
cause so many casualties?

144
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,666
[ASIM] I could've sworn I
already told you this.

145
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,375
I just love beautiful things!

146
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,083
What's the matter?

147
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you too much of a coward
to come over here

148
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,458
and fight me yourself?

149
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
Oh, I'm so scared!

150
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,333
Leave your shackles behind
and come back to me.

151
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,083
Free yourself from the
prison of his enslavement.

152
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,208
I will accept you as you are!

153
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,083
No! You don't know
Toa like I do.

154
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,166
Perhaps I should just tell
her that I like her,

155
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,250
or better yet that I love
her just like you did!

156
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,708
Oh yes! Darling!

157
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,916
I love you!

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,083
I love you!

159
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,666
I love you madly my dear!

160
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,708
You've lost your mind!

161
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,458
Seems to me like you are
the ones who are insane.

162
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,000
The Resonance has worked
you up into a frenzy

163
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,041
with the pitiable illusion that

164
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,083
you're actually in love
with each other!

165
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,375
You're wrong!

166
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,875
Am I?

167
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,125
Then tell me why you cling so
pathetically to the Album?

168
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,625
Because I'm in love with her!

169
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,000
I love her with all of my heart!

170
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,208
Do you love her because she made
you forget your loneliness?

171
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,541
I don't think so!

172
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,500
You love her because she
said she loves you

173
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,000
and you fell for it!

174
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,958
You made a terrible mistake!

175
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,333
How could you be so stupid!

176
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,625
Do you even know
what love is? Do you?

177
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,166
Enough! Shut your mouth!

178
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,708
Shut your mouth!

179
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,750
What could common scum like you
know about a noble like me?

180
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,916
What an agonizing life
you must've led.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,916
No one ever said
they loved you

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,708
so you were
consumed by loneliness

183
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,291
until it warped you
into what you are now.

184
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,708
Silence!

185
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,458
You insolent pest!

186
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,000
Someone to say
they love me, huh?

187
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,708
I don't need that.

188
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,958
How pathetic!

189
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,750
[GIO and GARNET growling]

190
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,958
Why you...

191
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,500
Okay Agathions, I want
you to rip them apart!

192
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,750
Your Majesty, we've sustained
far too much damage,

193
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,750
I recommend an
immediate retreat.

194
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,791
Don't tell me what to do!

195
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,750
Agathion control has
been reconnected.

196
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,958
[ASIM laughing]

197
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,958
That's better.

198
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,291
How could he?

199
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,583
He killed his own troops.

200
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,958
I'll do whatever I
please to my things.

201
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,875
It's no business of yours.

202
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,750
I've had enough of this
nonsense about love

203
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,625
between Dragons and humans,
you ignorant deluded fools.

204
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,416
Kill!

205
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,250
Hang in there Toa, kay?

206
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,291
This'll all be over soon.

207
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,250
Akira.

208
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,166
My my.

209
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,041
You're looking a little worse
for the wear, Jin Kamishina.

210
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,958
Die!

211
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,541
Machina!

212
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,625
You just don't know when to
lay down and die do you.

213
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,125
Machina!

214
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,333
Album!

215
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,708
I can tell that your death will
be so incredibly gorgeous.

216
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,791
If I can't have you,
then no one will!

217
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,041
Toa!

218
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,083
[ASIM]
Now die!

219
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,000
What is this? What's going on?

220
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,708
Wait.

221
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,208
Why are you running away?

222
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,833
The fight was just
getting started!

223
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
Synapse intrusion?

224
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,541
Why won't you do as I say?

225
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,250
What the..

226
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,375
That's impossible, the Agathions

227
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,166
don't feel
anything let alone fear!

228
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,250
Gio.

229
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,500
What are you about to do?

230
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,708
It isn't real!

231
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,125
You speak of the bond of
true love between

232
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,708
a human and a dragon?

233
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,916
Such a thing could never exist.

234
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,500
It's so beautiful.

235
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,125
Asim.

236
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,333
Hold on!

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,208
Wait a minute.

238
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
Gio, what are you doing?

239
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,250
Stop it!

240
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,583
Toa!

241
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,458
What is happening down there?

242
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,833
There's a high-energy
reading centered around

243
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,125
the northwest section
of the Tharsis plateau.

244
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,625
The EM signature is... Gio's.

245
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,916
[RAINA] 
What?

246
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,708
It's growing exponentially
in size and power!

247
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,708
A distress signal?

248
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,666
Let's go!

249
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,333
It's Raina and Howlingstar!

250
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,500
What happened to
Akira and Machina?

251
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,125
[JIN] They didn't make it.

252
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,958
No.

253
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,000
[SIEGLINDE] Let's take
refuge outside the atmosphere.

254
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,583
[GIO roars]

255
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,000
Gio, no.

256
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,166
At long last we have a glimpse
at the true power of the Dragon.

257
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,250
Our greatest fear has come true.

258
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,833
All this time we had no idea
what we were dealing with.

259
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,500
I know that fate
brought us together.

260
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,833
But why...

261
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Mars is burned over?

262
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,000
Traversing space,
destroying entire planets.

263
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,791
Is that the true nature
of these creatures?

264
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,333
It's too risky to keep these
abominations on Earth.

265
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,541
They are not entirely
under our control.

266
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,208
I suppose it's too late now.

267
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,000
There's only one way
to beat a Dragon.

268
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,750
And that's with another Dragon.

269
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,666
What are you drinking Megumi?

270
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,416
Oh Ryoko, this is all
the rage these days.

271
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,208
I'm on the "Melons Diet".
Hold on.

272
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,666
Where are you getting your info?

273
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,250
From this magazine.

274
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,083
This is from like a year ago!

275
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,291
Wow!

276
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,833
The year sure went by fast huh?

277
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,875
Yeah.

278
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,416
You know what they say,
time flies.

279
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,875
I'm not really sure I like
that flying time business.

280
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,583
Let's do the preview!

281
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,250
Next time, a new development
and a change of mind!
