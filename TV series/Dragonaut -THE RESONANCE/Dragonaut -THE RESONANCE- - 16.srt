Okay. Um...

138
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,416
So I happened
to notice something earlier.

139
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
Well you know.

140
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,541
When you were
healing Gio,

141
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,750
parts of your back
were glowing bright red.

142
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,541
What exactly was that?

143
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,458
Those marks
looked really painful.

144
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,958
Oh that was
nothing Akira I promise.

145
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,666
It looks much
worse than it really is.

146
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,125
That's just what happens
every time I use that ability.

147
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,416
What you saw
were the stigmata.

148

The scars that mark her time.

149
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,625
Stigmata? What is that?

150
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,750
The end of your life

151
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,416
is approaching
quickly, isn't it Toa?

152
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,750
We Dragons have
extremely long lives

153
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,333
when compared to
the lifespan of a human.

154
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,333
But we are by
no means immortal.

155
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,791
When an individual's life
is finally coming to an end.

156
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,750
The stigmata will begin
to appear on the Dragon's body

157
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,666
and as death draws closer
the glow becomes brighter.

158
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,916
Oh my gosh.

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
Does Jin know
about any of this?

160
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,458
He doesn't.
Please don't tell him anything.

161
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,000
Why not? This is
kind of important!

162
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,416
It's okay.

163
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,041
I knew this would
happen from the beginning.

164
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,916
We Original Dragons are all
essentially living probes

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,541
that are a small part

166
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,083
of the greater entity
known as Thanatos.

167
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,083
When we succeed in our mission
of retrieving our kind

168
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,166
from the planet earth our
lives are destined to end.

169
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,208
That is our inescapable fate.

170
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,166
I can remember the exact
moment when I first saw Machina.

171
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,250
I was absolutely terrified.

172
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,041
Machina.

173
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,625
Akira. It's nice to meet you.

174
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,916
The instant I saw her
I thought she was beautiful.

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,541
She was my ideal.

176
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,125
She was everything
I thought a woman should be.

177
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,125
She was my exact opposite,
in every way.

178
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,208
Beautiful and sweet,
graceful and warm-hearted.

179
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,083
Her speech and movement
were so perfectly feminine.

180
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,375
And her body, well.

181
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,291
It's perfect.

182
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,250
She has everything
that I don't.

183
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,416
That's why at first I
was so afraid of Machina.

184
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,333
Oh Akira.

185
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,875
You see.

186
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
That was just the beginning.

187
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,333
We started to warm up
to each other right away.

188
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,250
It was just like
we were old friends.

189
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,875
It wasn't long
before I knew I loved her.

190
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,875
Despite the fact
that I could feel

191
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,250
this overwhelming love
in my heart for Machina.

192
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,583
A voice inside kept
telling me that it was wrong.

193
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,125
That you can't love a Dragon.

194
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,291
There was a conflict
raging inside of me.

195
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,208
Is it wrong for me to
feel this way about her?

196
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:12,458
And then,
I encountered Jin Kamishina.

197
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,666
I have to go and find her,
I've got to learn the truth.

198
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,000
Toa's the only one who knows.

199
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,500
He said that he was
going to see you

200
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,791
like it was a matter of course.

201
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,625
Like that was the only course
of action he could take.

202
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,375
I want to see.

203
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,291
They might be
able to change it.

204
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,166
Change?

205
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,750
The Dragon-human relationship.

206
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,541
I thought if I came with him.

207
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,250
That maybe I could see a new
way for us to live together.

208
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,458
When I saw the two
of you with each other

209
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
I knew the love in
my heart was real.

210
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,666
I had to come for you.

211
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,291
Thank you Jin.

212
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,875
It took me long enough
to learn this lesson,

213
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,208
but I'm grateful
that I finally did.

214
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,333
If two hearts share
the same beautiful feeling

215
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,916
then it doesn't really matter
if you're a dragon or a human.

216
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,583
I too learned something very
important from all of this.

217
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,541
Toa, you once told me
that everything was fate.

218
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,000
You said destiny
can't be changed.

219
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:31,000
But you also told me
in no uncertain terms

220
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,041
that your fate is something
that can be changed.

221
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,083
You and Jin have proven that
fact beyond a shadow of a doubt.

222
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,666
So you and Jin should
make the fate that you want.

223
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,458
Don't ever settle
for anything less.

224
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,875
Akira and Machina.

225
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,958
[JIN] Oh, I see you
guys are already out.

226
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,916
Are you feeling okay Toa?

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,666
[GIO] We should hurry up
and get out of here.

228
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,708
[JIN] Yeah this is
the Gillard's home base.

229
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,500
There's no telling
what might happen

230
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,041
if we stay here any longer.

231
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,666
Hold up!

232
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,166
Take a look around!

233
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,625
Doesn't all of this look like
some sort of church altar?

234
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,666
Look!

235
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,416
Now that you mention it,
I guess it does.

236
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,583
Jin, I think we should
hold a wedding.

237
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,500
But, for who?

238
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,250
The two of you!

239
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,833
The two of us?

240
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,708
You got it.

241
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,791
That's you. And you.

242
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,541
Together forever and ever!

243
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,750
C'mon, this isn't the time
to be joking around, Akira.

244
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,583
He's right we should
hurry up and leave.

245
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,166
I'm not joking around.

246
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,041
I'm being totally serious.

247
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,291
But why at a time like this?

248
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,958
Now is when we need it most.

249
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,583
You're so sweet.

250
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
But, what about?

251
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,041
You're better off not
sweating the small stuff.

252
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,541
You ready to be a man?

253
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,041
Jin, don't you want... me?

254
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,500
Of course I want you!

255
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,333
I'd love to be your
husband. Soon for sure!

256
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,250
But does it have to be now?

257
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
[JIN] I mean it's a little
soon don't you think?

258
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,333
You don't get married
running from a madman.

259
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,500
They want a wedding.
What is that?

260
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,250
A magic ritual
that changes fate.

261
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,291
Changes fate?

262
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,833
All right! You've got
more than enough witnesses.

263
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,791
Let's do this you two!

264
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,916
Jin.

265
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,125
Oh, Akira.

266
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
Thank you for this.

267
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,833
No prob.

268
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,166
Okay we're not done here yet.

269
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,916
You put on the ring next.

270

[ASIM clapping]

271
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,166
[ASIM] Enough with these
childish charades.

272
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,708
I wish you
wouldn't mock me so.

[AKIRA] Oof!
[EVERYONE gasps]

278
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,291
Akira. No!

Akira, my love!

280

Akira!

Please, Akira stay with me!

I didn't even
get a chance to see...

What will become of you.

287
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,333
Now both of you...

00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,750
must create a new

Machina!

303
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,333
Saki, Ryoko,
what's this button for?

304
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,291
Button?

305
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,500
What's that doing there?

306
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,125
It has "don't push"
written on it.

307
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,291
It also has "danger"
in big letters.

308
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,166
If it says "don't push" it's
telling us to push it, right?

309
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,458
Look I know how you feel
but you can't push it okay?

310
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,291
Oooh!

311
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,583
But I wanna push it so bad!

312
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,791
Let me handle this!

313
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,875
I'll push it!

314
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:17,875
Things don't look
good around here.

315
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
I know! Both of you!

316
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,583
The preview!

317
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,916
Right! Next time.

The Gillard story finally
reaches it's conclusion!

319
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,250
Now I can push it!
