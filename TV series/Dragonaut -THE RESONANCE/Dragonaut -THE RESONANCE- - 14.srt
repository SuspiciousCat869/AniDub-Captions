[CONTROL TOWER] ISDA Flight 018,
you are cleared to land.

[WALLA: AIRPORT]

00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,666
Kamishina?

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,625
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,791
Go ahead.

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,958
You were the first pilot
to successfully land on Mars.

10
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,750
Why are you piloting
a routine route

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,958
between Earth and the moon?

12
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey this is an important job
and somebody's got to do it.

13
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,333
Yes, but as skilled as you
are, you could be carrying out

14
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,750
important exploration
missions deeper into space

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,375
for the good of mankind.

16
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,625
I have something to guard.

17
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,916
Something to guard, I see.

00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,750
Eiji.

19
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,166
Have you heard of a program
called the D Project?

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,166
Or the Dragonauts?

21
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,083
[REPORTER A (M)] You have
to give us some kind of answer!

22
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,166
[REPORTER B (M)] Can we
expect any further evacuations

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,708
and where will
the refugees go?

24
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,333
Mr. Kiril what is your
reaction to today's tragedy?

25
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,875
What is the ISDA doing to bring
the situation under control?

26
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,750
What's going on
with the D Project?

27
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,500
The D-Project will be used

28
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,083
as part of an
appropriate retaliation.

29
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,583
Does that mean
you've declared war

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,625
against the
extra-terrestrial life form?

31
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,458
How do we know the Earth will
be safe from another attack?

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,916
Turn it off,
I've seen enough of this.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,916
Yes sir.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,125
That guy doesn't know

35
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,666
when not to talk
about something, does he?

36
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,000
Retaliation should never be
spoken of in such simple terms.

37
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,250
Mr. Kiril will be arriving in
approximately five minutes sir.

Come on Gio, wake up!

Let me get
straight to the point.

57
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,541
I want to know what you're
planning to do next Jin.

58
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,625
I'm going to Mars
to bring back Toa.

59
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,625
There's no hesitation at all.

60
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,583
And what about
after you do that?

61
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,250
Are you two going to
keep running from danger?

62
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,000
She's important to our research.

63
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,708
Especially, considering
her knowledge of Thanatos.

64
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,708
We can't ignore that any longer.

65
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,333
What are you
trying to say to me?

66
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,500
I feel I'm in
an awkward position.

67
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,708
It seems wrong to
put you in harm's way

68
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,208
more than we already have.

69
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,250
Ugh! This is painful.

70
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,666
What he's trying to ask is
if you'll become one of us Jin.

71
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,041
That's been the whole
idea from the start of this.

72
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,541
Yeah?

73
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,083
To put it succinctly yes.

74
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,708
Jin Kamishina,
I'm officially asking you.

75
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:09,041
Will you serve
with us as a Dragonaut?

76
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,625
I can't, I have to save Toa.

77
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,958
And, besides, being a Dragonaut

78
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,166
means defending
the Earth against Thanatos

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,833
and I can't do that.

80
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,666
Remember that you've
already defended the Earth

81
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
once against the Ostrum.

82
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,000
That wasn't
because of my abilities.

83
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,458
It was because of Gio.

84
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,208
You must believe in yourself.

85
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,541
You are special.

86
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,208
I know it must
seem like we Dragons

87
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,750
have incredible super powers

88
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,041
but we can't just do
these things on our own.

89
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,833
We need masters who are capable
of bringing those powers out.

90
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,500
But that's enough about that.

91
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,916
All of the doubts
you're having now

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,083
will disappear once
you see how beautiful

93
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,708
the view of Earth
is from outer space.

94
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,708
Dad said that.

95
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,833
You don't have to give
us an answer right away.

96
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,958
But I want you to consider it.

97
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:05,583
I have a question, why did
you become a Dragonaut, Raina?

98
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,250
I wanted to test myself.

99
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,875
Test my potential.

100
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,541
That truly was
an unfortunate accident.

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,333
The Atrum.

102
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,625
And then.

103
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,208
I met you, Yuri.

104
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,833
So then, what happened
that day was a Resonance?

105
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,291
Despite it being an accident,

106
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,750
the crime of killing all those
people weighed heavily on me.

107
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,333
I couldn't continue my mission

108
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,958
to bring the earth-born
dragons back to Thanatos,

109
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,541
without atoning somehow.

110
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,416
So I cut all communications
with Thanatos,

111
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,583
and chose to live
amongst the humans

112
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,333
hoping I could help.

113
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,041
You wouldn't
happen to be thinking

114
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,791
about getting
revenge, would you?

115
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,333
I'm not.

116
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:45,625
When I was fighting Ostrum,
he said humans change us.

117
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:50,166
It seems Thanatos
doesn't want that happening.

118
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,708
But, I'm different.

119
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,541
I have a new goal.

120
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,458
I will do everything
in my power to ensure

121
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,125
that all of the
remaining eggs hatch safely.

122
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,791
Even if that means
I have to go against

123
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,208
the wishes of the being
that gave me my life.

124
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,041
I have to because
you have changed me.

125
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,166
Professor Nozaki...

126
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,625
[MACHINA] What do
we do now Akira?

127
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,000
Jin and Gio...

128
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,041
They've been captured
by the ISDA again.

129
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, I know.

130
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,541
So what do we do?

131
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey ease up.

132
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,166
I'm trying to think.

133
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,833
Well, if it isn't the traitors.

134
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,625
Sieglinde!

135
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,041
Due to the Ostrum's attack,

136
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,750
the implementation
of the D-Project

137
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,000
has been hastened
from its original plan.

138
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,666
The Avenir is set
to launch shortly.

139
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,166
I guess it's finally time.

140
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,041
You're coming back to
the base with us, aren't you?

141
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,166
You are going to
fight with us, right?

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
What's the matter?

143
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,208
I can't, I've already made the
decision to go with Jin and Gio.

144
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,000
I have to see with
my own eyes what is

145
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,291
possible for a
human and a dragon.

146
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,708
What are you talking about?

147
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,541
You don't need
them to show you that.

148
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,333
Amadeus and I
can do it for you.

149
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,916
Hey, here's an idea.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,875
Why don't you come too?

151
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,166
You and Jin together.

152
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,375
You want me and Jin
to come together?

153
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
No, I won't do it.

154
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,333
I'm not going to abandon
my friends like that.

155
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,250
Okay, I understand.

156
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,000
Avenir will be
launching in two hours.

157
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,083
All personnel boarding the ship
please take your positions.

158
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,666
I repeat.

159
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,458
Avenir will be
launching in two hours.

160
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,583
Professor, it's time to leave.

161
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,166
No I won't be
joining you, Kitajima.

162
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,916
As I told you.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,833
I need to stay
here at the lab

164
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,375
so I can keep watch
over the little ones.

165
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,791
You take care of yourself.

166
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, are you
coming with us or not?

167
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:18,916
No you don't get a choice,
you have to you coward!

168
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:23,500
I'm sorry, but this is goodbye.

169
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,250
Are you stupid?

170
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,333
What has gotten into you?

171
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,458
You're terrible!

172
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,416
Disgusting!

173
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,166
Jin, Kazuki.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,708
Now, Akira is going away

175
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,791
and leaving me behind
just like they did.

176
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,750
Young Miss.

177
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,958
We must leave now.

178
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,750
Initiating catapult
setting final sequence.

179
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,916
Commence check on all systems.

180
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,458
Linear rail, all
clusters are ready to go.

181
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,541
Now bringing
electrical systems online.

182
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,708
Weather conditions
are acceptable for launch.

183
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,583
Catapult position.
Initiate move.

184
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,833
Avenir holding
in start position.

185
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,833
All passengers
fasten safety harnesses

186
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,333
and prepare
for acceleration.

187
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,750
Repeat, all passengers
fasten safety harnesses

188
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,375
and prepare for acceleration.

189
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,625
So, Jin and Gio ended
up going after all huh?

190
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,500
I have a question.

191
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:18,250
Why did you become
a Dragonaut Raina?

192
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,208
Have you heard of a program
called the D Project?

193
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,625
Or the Dragonauts?

194
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,250
As a matter of fact,
I'm the one who recommended

195
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,458
you for the D Project.

196
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
You mean that
you recommended me?

197
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,708
Yes.

198
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,083
An old classmate of
mine's on the project staff.

199
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,666
He asked me if
I knew anybody

200
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,500
who had the skills to
handle the rigors of the job.

201
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,708
You're too kind.

202
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,333
Although I don't
understand why you didn't

203
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,041
just offer to
do it yourself.

204
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,833
You're already
a far better astronaut

205
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,333
than I might ever become.

206
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,166
I have a family
to care for now,

207
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,250
so I can't go off
on reckless adventures

208
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,083
like you can Raina,
you're still so young.

209
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
Why don't you test yourself?

210
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,625
Your potential.

211
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,375
Potential?

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,958
You overestimate me.

213
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,750
You still have so many
possibilities at your age.

214
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,375
Don't be so afraid.

215
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,000
If you make a mistake
you can always turn back.

216
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,833
Keep trying until
you get it right.

217
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,416
The most important thing is
that you believe in yourself.

218
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,208
Test my potential
and believe in myself.

219
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,583
Now see I think
you've finally got it.

220
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,166
Now you're acting like a man.

221
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,208
[KAMISHINA laughing]

222
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,250
Kamishina,
keep an eye on me.

223
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,333
I believe in who
I am and what I can do.

224
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,791
I promise, I won't let you down.

225
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,583
The countdown
will begin momentarily.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,291
Begin the launch
countdown now!

227
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,791
Sir!

228
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,875
Avenir, 300 seconds
until taxi.

229
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,541
The Avenir.

230
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,958
It will take off shortly.

231
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,708
I've been looking for you.

232
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,750
Jin!

233
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,291
Gio, shouldn't
you be in bed resting?

234
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,083
There will be
time to rest later,

235
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,416
our concentration
should be on rescuing Toa.

236
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,125
Gio and I are going
to Mars right now.

237
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,666
So do you guys have a plan?

238
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,250
Not yet.

239
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,583
I'm not even sure she's still
there since her song stopped.

240
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,083
But, Mars is her
last known location

241
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,833
and we don't
have any other leads

242
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,666
so that's where
we'll start looking.

243
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,333
We'd like you two to help.

244
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,875
Are you kidding of
course we'll help,

245
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,125
we'll follow
you guys anywhere.

246
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,041
Two dragons are ascending!

247
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,833
It's Gio and Machina!

248
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,250
Let them be.

249
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,500
Maintain your focus
on the Avenir's launch!

250
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,333
I think he's mad at me.

251
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,958
60 seconds until taxi.

252
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,375
What now Ryoko?

253
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,166
He's gonna yell at you again.

254
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,708
It's Widow, she's flying
in at a high rate of speed.

255
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,333
It can't be.

256
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,083
We thought she was missing!

257
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
[alarm beeping]

258
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,125
[KAZUKI laughing maniacally]

259
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
Jin!

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,250
Kazuki!

261
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,625
I've waited so long for this!

262
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,708
I'm finally going to kill you!

263
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,208
You okay, Jin?

264
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,250
Machina, we have to help him.

265
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,291
Move now!

266
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,958
30 seconds until taxi.

267
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,000
Wait! If we take off now, we
might collide with the dragons!

268
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,625
If we don't
leave this instance

269
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,666
there won't be enough
power to reset the catapult

270
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,291
for another
launch attempt.

271
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,041
We are now at
20 seconds until taxi sir.

272
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,291
The Avenir will
launch as planned!

273
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,333
10 seconds until taxi.

274
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:22,750
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

275
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,625
The catapult's hit!

276
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,833
We have to stop!

277
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,583
There's not enough time!

278
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,625
It's falling!

279
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,833
Oh, Jin, that
was all your fault.

280
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
That's what you
get for not dying!

281
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,875
Hold him, Widow.

282
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,833
Our trajectory angle
won't be high enough!

283
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,458
No hold on a second!

284
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,000
Machina's pushing
the girders back up!

285
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,833
Hang in there, Machina!

286
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,000
Just a little more!

287
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,333
The catapult position is
within a tolerable angle!

288
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,041
This could work!

289
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,458
Machina.

290
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,333
Here they come.

291
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, it worked!

292
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,250
That's too bad.

293
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,166
Now, there won't be
anyone to die with you.

294
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,250
But if you think I'm gonna
let you get away this time, Jin.

295
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,875
You should think again!

296
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,791
It's time you die!

297
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,666
Stop this! Kazuki!

298
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,958
I'm gonna make you pay
for what you did to me!

299
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,000
How does it feel?

300
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,416
Now to finish you!

301
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,166
Say goodbye!

302
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,875
Stay out of this!

303
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,250
No!

304
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,083
Kazuki!

305
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,708
We've achieved parking orbit.

306
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,916
Course shift toward
the moon in 80 seconds.

307
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,000
Prepare for acceleration.

308
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,541
Kazuki.

309
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,458
Let's go.

310
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,375
Yeah.

311
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,333
A new bond between
humans and dragons.

312
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,500
I hope that you find it.

313
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,541
We will Howlingstar, thanks.

314
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,000
We wish you good luck
on your journey, ma'am.

315
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,041
Take care, Sieglinde.

316
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,541
Jin.

317
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,083
Yes.

318
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,541
Always believe in yourself.

319
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,416
That is acting like a man.

320
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,875
Well.

321
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,291
At least that's
what your father told me.

322
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,916
As soon as we rescue Toa,
I'll come back I promise.

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,333
Good. We'll be waiting for you.

324
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,833
We're off!

325
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,833
I'm not alone anymore.

326
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,708
It's Toa who is alone.

327
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,500
Hang on Toa.

328
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,875
I'm coming to save you.

329
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,708
Okay Gio.

330
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,541
Let's go to Mars!

331
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,791
[THANATOS growls]

332
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,500
Hey guys, let's play shiratori,
the word linking game!

333
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,875
That came out of nowhere, huh?

334
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,166
I've been into it lately.

335
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,291
Okay, I'll start.

336
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,166
"Electric"

337
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,791
How about "Crisis"

338
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,125
"Scallop"!

339
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,250
Wait, who's that?

340
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,916
"Scallop"!

341
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,583
Preview "U".

342
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,041
Um, okay.

343
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,416
If they save the princess
do they save the "Universe"?

344
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,458
Ah! Saki loses the game!
