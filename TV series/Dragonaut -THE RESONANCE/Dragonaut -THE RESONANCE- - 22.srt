I just saw Itsuki and
Raina down at the beach.

37
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,125
[ITSUKI] 
Thanatos' successor.

38
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,791
I wonder what exactly
that's supposed to mean.

39
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,833
[RAINA] Howlingstar and
the others don't know, either,

40
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,000
which makes this whole
thing extremely interesting.

41
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,916
I would say
that Gio could be

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,583
in direct contact
with Thanatos' mind,

43
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,666
but that's nothing more
than an educated guess.

44
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,333
Do you think that
could be why

45
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,291
Gio's attitude
changed so suddenly?

46
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,083
Perhaps.

47
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,291
I know he lived peacefully with
Jin and Toa for about a year.

48
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,333
I honestly can't
think of any other reason.

49
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,083
The man's probably
a whole different Gio

50
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,791
from the one we knew.

51
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
I'll bet by now
he has transformed

52
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,250
into the something
we don't know.

53
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,541
Something that
can execute

54
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,833
the will of Thanatos,
without debate.

55
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,083
It's almost like he's
an animal in the wild.

All caught up in the concept
of "survival of the fittest."

I don't think that's
exactly what's happened.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,583
I'd say this is more a case
of thinning the herd.

59
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,333
That's a terrible
expression.

60
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,291
And it also implies
that your opinion

61
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,375
is that in order to maintain
the species it's only allowing

62
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,833
the most superior
specimens to remain alive.

Who can tell?

more about that hermit crab

And the Dragons
aren't that much different.

67
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,375
All mankind ever thought
about was how to exploit them

68

and use them as weapons
against each other.

they want in the first place.

about what they might be, so.

I believe if we introduce it

00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,041
You're not!

162
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,541
What an awful thing to say!

163
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,500
Please, I ask you not to
judge the actions of Thanatos

164
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,291
with your anthropocentric
values, Kitajima.

165
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,291
Oh, Professor.

166
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,583
Thanatos is a being that
transcends human understanding.

167
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,375
Its emotions and
will are on a plane so

168
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,916
different from humanity,

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,458
that the species itself may
never be able to comprehend it.

170
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,708
[YONAMINE] 
Right.

171
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,375
So we're not grown
up enough to say

172
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,750
"Oh, whatever,"
accept it and move on."

173
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,333
I hate to tell you this but
humans aren't like Dragons.

174
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,958
Toa's life will be coming
to an end very soon.

175
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:29,000
Your life does not
have to end so soon.

176
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,000
As the successor to Thanatos,

177
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,333
I now have the
power to save you.

178
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,791
Toa!

179
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,125
What can I do?

180
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,916
Please, tell me, what can I do?

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,208
Toa.

182
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,000
I need both of you
to get up right now!

183
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,875
What's going on?

184
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,250
Commander Sakaki?

185
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,500
[RAINA] So you
knew it was the Raum

186
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,125
that had taken
the form of your daughter,

187
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,708
who has been
deceased for years now.

188
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,625
But you kept on hiding her.

189
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,291
You kept the whole thing
a secret from everyone,

190
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166
and went on playing
the Dragonauts' commander

191
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,166
like nothing at all
was out of the ordinary.

192
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to tell
me why you did this.

193
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,166
I mean, to have
the Raum close at hand,

194
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,083
taking the place
of your daughter,

195
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,500
I can certainly
understand the feelings.

196
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
No, that thing is not Laura!

197
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,833
She is a counterfeit,
created by my mind.

198
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,583
And I swear, I am not about
to let Laura be a Dragon!

199
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,500
That Dragon killed Laura
and stole her form.

200
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,833
I simply wasn't
going to stand for that.

201
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,416
I'm okay.

202
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
So you were plotting
revenge against Thanatos.

203
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,500
You were going to
use the Dragonauts

204
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,541
as your instrument
of annihilation.

205
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,875
The signal from
Deep Eye has been lost!

206
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,583
Ryoko, what's the cause?

207
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,000
Analyzing now.

208
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,416
But just before we were cut off,

209
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,125
we recorded a massive
energy emission from Thanatos.

210
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,875
This pattern I'm seeing,
it looks like a Doppler shift.

211
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,291
You mean, Thanatos
has moved its position?

212
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,916
Well, where is it right now?

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,375
I can't find it.

214
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,916
Reading the instruments,
it actually looks to be

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,333
over an hour since
Deep Eye stopped functioning.

216
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,166
So Thanatos just vanished?

217
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,625
This is just great.

218
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,541
What if it's
headed toward earth?

219
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,875
For crying out loud,

220
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,958
that terrible sound is
echoing right through my head.

221
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,291
Captain!

222
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,416
Ryoko, I want you to
connect us to the deep space

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,083
whole-sky scanning
system as soon as possible.

224
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,333
Confirm Thanatos' position!

225
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,833
Yes, sir.

226
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,250
Saki, I need you to patch us
through to ISDA headquarters

227
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,041
top level priority clearance.

228
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,583
I'll get right on that.

229
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,041
Megumi.

230
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
Sir!

231
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,666
I want a black coffee.

232
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,583
I want it hot, I want
it tall, and I want it now.

233
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:45,166
Huh?

234
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,208
Yes, sir.

235
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,625
[SIEGLINDE[ It was only
after Gio went out of control

236
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,958
and leveled Mars that you
reversed yourself.

237
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,750
And then you tried
to capture the Dragonauts.

238
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,791
You became fearful
of the Dragons,

239
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,833
of the power they possess.

240
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,125
As a Dragon Laura possesses
these abilities as well.ß

241
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,125
Worst of all, she does whatever
you tell her to do.

242
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,833
So you decided to have

243
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,500
the Exford Force
set up just for her.

244
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,708
She couldn't have
been a more perfect tool

245
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,916
for hunting the
bunch of you down.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,958
What a tiny, littlÎe man.

247
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,333
Right now,
the ISDA is implanting

248
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,833
an anti-Thanatos
factor in her body.

249
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,625
When they're finished with that,

250
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
their plan is to stuff her
inside a missile warhead.

251
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,875
It's kind of ironic
isn't it?

252
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,166
The one thing that
can defeat Thanatos

253
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,291
has been right next to me

254
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,666
this entire time
and I never had a clue.

255
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,333
Are you saying that
Laura knew all of this,

256
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,458
everything you've done,

257
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,708
and she was letting
herself be used?

258
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,291
That's right.

259
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,458
I don't want you
to worry too much.

260
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,500
Everything'll be just fine.

261
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,958
We're not alone.

262
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,041
You see our pain connects us.

263
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,458
She was absolutely desperate
to be of some use to you.

264
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,791
Any at all.

265
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,666
Look, I already told you,
she was merely a tool.

266
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,666
Don't you understand yet?

267
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,625
You lost your family
in that accident.

268
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,416
Surely you see.

269
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,375
Are you finally happy now?

270
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,125
What?

271
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,125
You're making the Dragon
that killed your daughter

272
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,833
suffer while it carries out
your revenge against Thanatos.

273
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,458
Isn't that what
you've always been after?

274
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,583
Absolutely, what else
is there for me anymore?

275
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,916
In that case.

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,291
In that case,
why do you sit

277
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,791
there looking so
bitter and lost?

278
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,458
When I found Toa, I finally felt
the sense that I had been saved,

279
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,458
which is exactly how you should
have felt when you found Laura.

280
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,125
Don't be such an idiot!

281
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,333
You don't know.

282
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,500
Run, Dad!

283
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,333
You need to get
away from here daddy.

284
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,458
I did try.

285
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,625
It was true for us, too,
Commander.

286
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,541
Howlingstar is my only partner.

287
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,583
Otohime is like another me.

288
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,000
Amadeus is a dear family member.

289
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,291
We want someone to turn to us.

290
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,416
We want to be needed.

291
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Nobody can stand being alone.

292
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,666
In the end isn't that
what Resonance is all about?

293
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,416
It's Gio.

294
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,000
Dragon chosen to
be the successor.

295
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,625
Have you come here
to follow your destiny

296
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,291
and consign everyone
else to oblivion?

297
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,083
Its destiny?

298
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes.

299
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,541
It's a trial, given to the one
who would succeed Thanatos.

300
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,041
Herd-thinning?

301
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,083
Yeah, that's pretty narrow
thinking, considering

302
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,666
his presence. Professor!

303
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,291
You alright?

304
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,833
Gio's power has
increased dramatically.

305
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:19,041
Thanatos has shared some of
its power directly with him.

306
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,000
Both of you, get out of here.

307
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,958
Gio is only after the eggs.

308
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,583
There's no reason for you to get
caught in the middle of this.

309
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
We can't.

310
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,583
Yeah, there's no chance
we'll make it, Professor.

311
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:43,916
What was that?

312
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,416
Stop it, Gio! Now!

313
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,583
Let's go!

314
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,833
Actualize!

315
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,958
I'm coming for you Jin!

316
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,083
It's not working!

317
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,250
I can't believe this is the
power of Thanatos' successor.

318
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,333
Gio!

319
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,583
Gio, listen, you have
to stop this, already!

320
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,666
There's no reason why
any of us have to fight!

321
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,291
We can figure
out something else!

322
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,583
Yeah, like you fighting me!

323
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,791
Jin!

324
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,958
Kazuki, wait!

325
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,250
You can't think that this is

326
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,625
the right time
for me to fight you!

327
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,208
Take him down.

328
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,583
If it weren't for you
this wouldn't be happening!

329
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,166
Toa!

330
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,666
Toa, get up! Toa!

331
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,791
If you hadn't gone through
Resonance with Jin.

332
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,583
Then Kazuki would
not have had to suffer.

333
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,416
Stop it!

334
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,625
Out of my way.

335
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,791
Jin!

336
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,500
Toa!

337
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,583
I want you to stand
there and watch

338
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,166
while I destroy all of them.

339
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,333
No, stop!

340
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,291
All those who
have hurt Kazuki.

341
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,916
Gio.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,166
Look.

343
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,125
What is that?

344
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,625
I'm detecting an unusual
mass in the Moon's orbit!

345
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,208
Yeah, but what is it?

346
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,500
We're too late.

347
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,541
Is that Thanatos?

348
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,125
It couldn't be.

349
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,833
Not this suddenly.

350
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,458
It's finally come, has it?

351
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,458
Thanatos is here.

352
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,458
Jin, give Toa to me.

353
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,083
You must trust me;

354
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,166
it is the only way
that she can be saved.

355
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,583
Gio.

356
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,291
This is a bulletin from ISDA.

357
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,875
As a result of the huge blow

358
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,666
to specialty
industries caused

359
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,666
by the large-scale
destruction in Akihabara,

360
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,666
it is doubtful that
a certain upcoming manga

361
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,416
festival will be held.

362
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,625
What?

363
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,166
Then, no one will
read my manuscript.

364
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,208
Huh?

365
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,375
What manuscript?

366
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,833
Never, mind, it's nothing.

367
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,375
I guess I won't
go the second day.

368
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,833
What second day?

369
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,041
Next time, I'll just go to
the amusement park instead!

370
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,125
Ah, you tricked us!
