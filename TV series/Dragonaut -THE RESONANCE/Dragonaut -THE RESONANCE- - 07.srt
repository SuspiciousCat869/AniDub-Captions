1
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:27,708
[SIEGLINDE] I had my graduation
today, you would have loved it.

2
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,875
Look here, I did it.

3
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,625
Oh Amadeus.

4
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,041
[SAKI] I'm receiving
reports that the Album

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,416
has been sighted in
Sector One of Lunar City.

6
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,708
That was their last
known trajectory.

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,333
[SAKAKI] Sector One
of Lunar City.

8
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:38,000
That's the singular recreational
area on the whole lunar base.

9
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,125
In the original
colonization plan,

10
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,125
this site was to supply
the energy for life support.

11
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,958
Five years ago they built
a city underneath it.

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,625
Their ingenuity helped them
figure out how to utilize

13
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,541
the waste ventilation
to heat water.

14
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,500
This warm water was
intrinsic to their purpose.

15
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,125
Their ultimate goal
was a designated system.

16
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,083
[MEGUMI] They built
a Hot Springs, right?

17
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,416
It's like, a spa resort.

18
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,375
[RYOKO] Hot springs,
they're nice.

19
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
I want to go there!

20
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,958
Let's go there
together next vacation.

21
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,916
We can go shopping
for swimsuits!

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,458
Just us girls?

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,875
That's kinda boring.

24
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,041
Whatever.

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,583
Who do you have
to show off for?

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,958
Now, now you're both pretty.

27
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,958
[GIRL laughing]

28
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,625
Here! Try to catch it.

29
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,250
[MAN A]
You throw like a girl.

30
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
[GIRL] So do you.

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,208
[JIN] Is this you
guys', first time?

32
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,791
[TOA] What?

33
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,750
You know... to a
hot springs resort.

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,375
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,000
[GIO] That should
be obvious since

36
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,375
I have only recently been born.

37
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,833
[SHELLY] Toa, I hope
things are going well.

38
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,583
Here you go.

39
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,458
A spa resort?

40
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,375
With indoor hot springs.

41
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,583
Go get in there
before you catch a cold.

42
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,791
A love triangle,

43
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,625
with a beautiful girl
in the middle of it.

44
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,083
Oh well, this
should be interesting.

45
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,375
Jin, have you ever
read The Little Mermaid?

46
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,750
What's that?

47
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,625
In order to see the Prince,
whom she's in love with,

48
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
the Little Mermaid
makes a bargain with a witch

49
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,458
who transforms her into
a fully human girl.

50
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,125
But in return, she relinquishes
the ability to use her voice.

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,875
I have no idea what
you're talking about Toa.

52
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,083
There's more,
when the little mermaid

53
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,916
isn't able to
marry the prince

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,541
she cries until
she becomes sea foam.

55
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,375
And then she disappears,
back into the ocean.

56
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,666
It's just like us.

57
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,625
That's only a story.

58
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,250
It makes no difference to me,
dragon or a human.

59
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,916
Toa, you were the first one

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,291
to help me realize that
I wasn't alone anymore.

61
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,166
Jin.

62
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,041
Hey, Gio?

63
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,666
[GIO thinking] I came all
this way to protect Toa,

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,291
but I have no idea why.

65
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,208
Does it really do any good
to protect the album?

66
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,000
Think about it.

67
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,541
Once she gets back together
with that Jin Kamishina guy

68
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,875
she won't have any
time for you.

69
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,375
You're wrong about her.

70
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,208
What is this connection
I have to Toa

71
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,083
that makes me feel as if
I have to protect her?

72
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,416
What am I to Toa?

73
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,458
[RAINA] We have to make sure

74
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,041
that the Album
doesn't notice us.

75
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,875
When we go in, we'll have
to go in lightly and quickly.

76
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,791
Nothing we do
should in any way

77
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,916
jeopardize the
civilian population.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,375
Understand?

79
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,916
Well, get to it.

80
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
[AMADEUS] Where is
Mr. Cromwell going?

81
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
[HOWLINGSTAR]
Who knows?

82
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
Probably busy
with another mission.

83
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
You're pathetic.

84
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean why would you let
Jin get away like that?

85
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,708
[AKIRA] Hey, don't
be so hard on me.

86
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,000
I just let my guard down,
that's all.

87
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,666
Worst mistake of my life.

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,208
You totally faked it.

89
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,666
Wha--?

90
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,291
If Jin was sitting in
the passenger seat,

91
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,125
and hit you with his cuffs,

92
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,791
you'd have a bruise
on your left side.

93
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,583
If the drivers seat
were on the other side,

94
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,125
or Jin was left-handed,
that would be another story,

95
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,125
but unfortunately,
the case is closed.

96
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
Which means, Miss Akira,
being right-handed

97
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,541
you obviously gave
yourself that bruise.

98
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,666
You let Jin get away on purpose.

99
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah that's it!

100

You're so smart!

This is no joke!

102
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,500
I don't know what
you were doing,

103
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,166
but don't think
I'm going to let you

104
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,625
treat your friends like that!

105
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,708
If this happens again
I won't be so friendly.

106

doing whatever they want.

What do we do now, Akira?

00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,833
Let them go and
hope no one sees.

finally found you.

you'll escape from us this time.

Don't try to fight us.
