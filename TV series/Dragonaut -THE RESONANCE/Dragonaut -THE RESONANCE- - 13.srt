00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,333
Incredible!

2
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,625
The asteroid was blown
away by a single blast.

3
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,125
The demonstration
you have just witnessed

4
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,625
is the power of the Gillard
Army's new Type-X warhead.

5
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:51,041
Not even Thanatos should be
able to withstand one of those.

6
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,500
Yes.

7
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,541
But the Type-X needs a new
shuttle capable of launching

8
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,666
a direct attack on Thanatos
and delivering the payload.

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,833
Only then can
the D Project be realized.

10
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,958
Well since it
seems to be so crucial

11
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,000
how much progress have
you made on this new shuttle?

12
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,333
Unfortunately the
development of the shuttle

13
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,000
is not included in our contract.

14
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,541
That part belongs to the ISDA.

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,416
As of now we have
failed to deliver

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,083
a unit that
functions properly.

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,333
Come again.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,333
Are you telling us
there is a weapon ready

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,000
for use against Thanatos

20
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,375
but we have no means
of getting it there?

21
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,375
We have other options.

22
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,833
Ridiculous!

23
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,416
Do you have any idea
how long it would take

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,916
to reach Pluto using
existing shuttle technology?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
It would be possible to reach

26
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,666
sub-light speed
if we sent dragons.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,958
Impossible!

28
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,541
Dragons, are you serious?

29
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,291
Our best option
is to attack Thanatos

30
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,541
directly with
earth-born dragons.

31
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,666
That's the new
directive of the D Project.

32
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,791
Come on.

33
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,583
Where did you go Toa?

34
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,583
Toa!

35
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,375
The Ostrum and the Atrum
have engaged over the base.

36
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
Have we been able to
reestablish communications

37
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,166
with the Lindworm Unit?

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
Not yet sir.

39
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,666
We're working
on that as we speak.

[HOWLINGSTAR grimaces in pain]

41

Howlingstar can you get up?

42
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,916
Machina, wake up. Are you okay?

[ATRUM and OSTRUM growling]

44

Who's the other dragon?

45
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,083
Isn't Ostrum enough
to deal with already?

46
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,750
That is the Atrum.

47
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,583
The third Original dragon
I've been searching for.

48
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,166
No way. That's the Atrum?

49
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,916
May I interpret
what you're saying to mean

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,833
the third and fourth Originals

51
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,458
are fighting
each other above us?

52
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,208
But why did they
come from the base?

53
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:01,750
Because... the Atrum...

54
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,500
Is really Nozaki.

55
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,541
[EVERYONE gasps in surprise]

56

The Atrum

57

Is Professor Nozaki.

58
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,458
I know the real
reason you were sent

59
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,250
to Earth by Thanatos, Ostrum.

60
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,916
Thanatos.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,708
So that must be
the name the people

62
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,541
of this planet
have given our mother.

63
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,916
You're here to kill the dragons
born on Earth, aren't you?

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,750
You have
become too involved

65
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,958
with the creatures
of this world.

66
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,625
Dragons are not meant
to be raised by humans.

67
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,208
Mother is quite
displeased with this.

68
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,916
I won't let you lay
a finger on my children.

69

Defying me is the same
as defying Mother!

70
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,791
You've changed since you've
been here with the humans.

71
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,458
If you've truly
undergone Resonance

72
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,291
you'll understand soon enough.

73
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,083
I will never change!

I only exist like
this because of you.

76

That's why I want
to stay this way forever.

77
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,500
I never want to go back
to my original form.

78
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,166
Your Highness, the neo-original
sent by Thanatos

79
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,416
has destroyed
Shin-Ogasawara Terminal City.

80
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
The Dragonaut's base at ISDA

81
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:29,291
seems to have
been destroyed as well.

82
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,791
Did you hear that?

83
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,708
It would appear
your friend is having

84
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,250
a bit of fun
ravaging the Earth.

85
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,541
I have to do something.

86
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,416
I'll reveal
my true form to you.

87
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,416
But please,
turn that sound off.

88
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,083
Oh I see, apparently
I acted carelessly

89
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,500
when I imprisoned you.

90
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,916
Having the CSS active
prevents you from actualizing

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,375
into your true form,
doesn't it?

92
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,041
But if I turned it off you
would likely use your powers

93

to escape at
your first opportunity.

94

do better than that.

to do before you're mine.

think it's doing?

You still have a binding

No, this isn't

00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,708
Now, Mother has abandoned

166
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,666
the earth-born dragons,
along with mankind.

167
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,541
No! There's still
time to save them.

168
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,750
If I can get my
voice to reach my Mother

169
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,541
then we might be able to--

170
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,708
I don't care
about any of that!

171
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,000
I only want to know
if you can save the Earth.

172
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,333
Can you stop the other dragon?

173
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,625
I'm not sure if I can.

174
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,791
But I have to protect Jin.

175
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,833
Because he's the one I love.

176
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,583
I have to.

177
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,916
The one you love.

178
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,166
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

179
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,416
Please save Dr. Kitajima

180
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,000
It's off! Thank you!

You were undercover
at ISDA for so long

184
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,208
you got attached
to them didn't you?

185
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,166
Doesn't matter.

186
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
I would have killed you
before much longer anyway.

Doc...tor.

How could you?

[TOA screaming in agony]

190
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,000
[TOA's song playing]
It's Toa!

191
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,750
That's Toa's song. I know it.

192
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,875
That's gotta be her!

193
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,250
[JIN]
I found Toa!

194
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,333
You found her?

195
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,375
Jin tell us where she is!

196
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,708
She's on Mars!

197
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,791
Now you're
going to quiet down

198
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,458
and behave like the good
little caged bird you are.

199
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,458
I can't hear it anymore.

You need to get to Mars.

But this guy's still going.

204
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,250
I can handle a lot more
than you would think.

205
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,250
I'll make sure he gets
the beat down he deserves.

[JIN]
Akira.

[RAINA]
You can't go.

208
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,958
Personal missions during
an operation are unacceptable.

209
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,166
Standard ISDA policy.

210
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,791
But those rules
wouldn't apply to you

211
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,125
since you're not an
official Dragonaut are you?

212
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,791
Thank you, Raina.

213
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,708
Just go already.

214
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,708
We can take care
of Ostrum on our own.

215
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,583
We don't need you to help.

Stupid boy.
[SIEGLINDE yells in pain]

The Lindworm Unit

Message from the Gillard Army.

It'll take another hour
to deploy the Agathions!

They seem content to stand
by and watch us fall.

Commander Sakaki,
what should we do?

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,958
There's still a way!

Yuya!

Sir, Otohime has
an active Type-X warhead!

You're kidding.

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,083
She can't use
that thing on Earth.

236
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,875
It'll destroy the
whole Asian contenent!

237
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:09,166
I know that! I'm taking him into
space and blowing us both up!

238
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,791
I have them.
