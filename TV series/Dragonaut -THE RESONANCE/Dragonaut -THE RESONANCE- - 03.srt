1
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,791
[heart beating]

2
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,833
What is that thing?

3
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,041
[gasps]

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,291
[TOA] I won't let
it touch you Jin!

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,208
[JIN] Toa.

6
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,666
Toa, tell me who you really are.

7
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,916
[TOA] Please, close your eyes.

8
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,083
Toa.

9
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,416
[YONAMINE] Dammit.
Looks like I'm late.

10
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,500
Is that?

11
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,083
[SAKI] A new Dragon
has actualized

12
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,916
at the observation deck
by Shin-ogasawara Bridge!

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,375
[RYOKO]
Commander it's here, the Album.

14
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,958
[beeping]

15
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,416
[MEGUMI] Incoming call
from Mister Kiril.

16
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,291
Putting it on screen.

17
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,708
[KIRIL] Just what is going on
out there Commander Sakaki?

18
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,625
Can you explain to me why

19
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,875
both our Dragon and
the Album are running wild?

20
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,750
[SAKAKI]
We're looking into it sir.

21
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,875
We'll keep you informed
as the situation develops.

22
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,000
[growls]

23
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
[NANAMI] Hold on a minute
where are you going?

24
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,250
[KITAJIMA] Where do you think?

25
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,208
I have to go see this in person.

26
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,458
But Ma'am!

27
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,416
Transmission from Mister Kiril.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,458
[GARNET] Put him through.

29
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,500
You're aware of
the situation right?

30
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,875
I want immediate deployment
of the Gillard forces.

31
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,000
My team is now on route.

32
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,458
We shall arrive soon.

33
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,000
Very well.

34
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,041
I want to see as little
collateral damage as possible.

35
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,000
Kiril out.

36
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,041
[smirking]
Don't worry. All is well.

37
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,291
[SIEGLAND] That's the Album?

38
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,833
[RAINA] So that's
a type three original huh?

39
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,583
[AKIRA] Spirytus seems
to be calming down.

40
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,583
[HOWLINGSTAR] I think the album
is communicating with him.

41
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,791
The Gillard forces?

42
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,916
Target is in sight.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,875
Now commencing
attack sequence Bravo.

44
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
[roars in pain]

45
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,416
Idiot.

46
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,875
Wait!

47
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,416
What for?
We have to stop Spirytus!

48
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,958
No orders have been given yet.

49
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,541
It's not real.

50
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,791
Can't be.

51
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Run kid!

52
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,958
It just saved him. But why Jin?

53
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,125
Toa.

54
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,250
Stop it.

55
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,625
Stop it.

56
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,000
[Yells]
Stop it!

57
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,250
All the Gillard
forces helicopters

58
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,708
have been taken down.

59
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
The Album and Spirytus
are currently headed north.

60
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,416
Soon they'll pass
over the mainland.

61
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,041
What do we do sir?

62
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,416
It's your move ISDA.

63
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,875
[chuckles]

64
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
What's your decision
Mister Kiril?

65
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,208
Our greatest work;
the D Project.

66
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,000
Actualization is authorized.

67
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,541
That's the Album.

68
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,416
Actualization approved!

69
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,708
Lindworm Unit,
actualization approved!

70
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,166
Spirytus.

71
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,333
What on earth has come over you?

72
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,041
We have no choice.

73
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,375
We simply cannot let him
continue on like this.

74
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,708
I'm afraid not...

75
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,291
What can we do?

76
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,375
Howlingstar.

77
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,458
Let's go.

78
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,750
Actualize!

79
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,916
What the...?

80
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,833
No way.

81
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,083
A dragon, but how?

82
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,500
Now, Howlingstar. Take off!

83
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,666
Machina, let's do this!

84
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,291
Let's go Amadeus!

85
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,000
[panting]

86
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,916
This can't be.

87
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,291
He's riding.

88
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,208
On a dragon.

89
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,416
Our objective is to bring

90
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,208
the two rogue dragons
back under control.

91
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,291
Got it?

92
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,750
Roger.

93
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,583
Yeah got it.

94
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,458
We have an urgent
transmission from Dr. Kitajima.

95
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,208
On screen.

96
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,541
What happened?

97
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,916
We had an agreement Commander.

98
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,041
If you were to discover
either an Album or an Atrum

99
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,291
you were to secure
them without harming them.

100
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,875
I realize that Doctor.

101
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,375
But under the circumstances,

102
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
do you really
think that's possible?

103
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
I believe it's
your responsibility

104
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,000
to make it possible.

105
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,208
Doctor are you telling me that
your research is more important

106
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,375
than the safety of those people.

107
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,875
If your actions
result in her death

108
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,250
I promise I will
not let this slide.

109
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,833
I'll report you
to your superiors

110
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,541
and demand a severe punishment.

111
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,791
The safety of the people?

112
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,166
Aren't you the one who wanted
to use Dragons in combat?

113
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,833
What?

114
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,666
G-10!

115
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Uh, Commander. It's Gio!

116
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,708
What?

117
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,833
[GIO] She is calling.

118
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,125
I got ya!

119
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
[beeping]

120
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,083
Amadeus!

121
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,833
Okay. Calm down.

122
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,833
[KAZUKI] Jin!

123
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,250
Kazuki!

124
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,500
Please!

125
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,458
Tell them to stop doing this!

126
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,500
You're supposed to
be a Dragonaut right?

127
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,666
But Jin.

128
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,208
She's up there.

129
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,250
Don't you see?

130
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,083
That's Toa!

131
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,041
Oh man.

132
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,625
--Toa.
--Toa.

133
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,666
Gio!

134
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,458
He-Hey! Hold on!

135
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,583
When did you hatch?

136
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,875
She is calling.

137
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,291
--Toa!
--What the...?

138
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,958
Wait! Jin!

139
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,750
[grimacing]

140
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,708
No Jin!

141
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,041
They're gone.

142
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,291
How could he?

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,750
Gio belongs to me.

144
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,125
[screams] Jin!

145
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,041
What's that?

146
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,250
[beeping]
Raina.

147
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,666
Be on the look out for Gio,

148
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,833
he's escaped from the base
and he's headed your way.

149
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,458
I've just sighted him.
So that's Gio.

150
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,416
What's wrong?

151
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,416
Jin Kamishina is on Gio's back.

152
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,708
What?

153
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,333
It seems they're
pursuing the Album.

154
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,166
Dispatch Spirytus immediately.

155
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,958
The Lintverm Unit's
highest priorities

156
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,500
are to secure
the Album and Jin Kamishina.

157
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,375
Copy.

158
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,666
You heard him. Let's get to it.

159
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,958
I don't understand.

160
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,208
What does he mean
by 'dispatch' Spirytus?

161
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,791
Is he telling us?

162
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,125
Our orders are absolute.

163
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,000
Kill Spirytus.

164
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,166
Kill him?

165
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,708
Is there a problem Howlingstar?

166
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,541
That's an order.

167
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,000
Kill Spirytus.

168
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,125
Disgusting.

169
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,958
Toa! Wait!

170
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,375
Don't you see! It's me, Jin!

171
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,625
I know you recognize me.

172
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,875
Please come back, Toa!

173
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,208
Toa.

00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,000
Toa!

175
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,666
I'm so very sorry Jin.

176
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,708
Now that you've seen what
kind of monster I really am,

177
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,041
I couldn't possibly
stay with you.

178
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,500
What are you
talking about Toa?

179
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,708
This is goodbye, Jin.

180
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,250
Don't leave me come back!

181
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,375
Toa.

182
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,625
My sole purpose for
existing is to protect you.

183
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,333
Gio. Let's go.

184
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,791
Don't go.

Toa!

186
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,208
No stop!

187
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,583
See, you're not alone anymore.

188
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,000
You have me now Jin.

189
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,041
Liar.

190
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,541
They're gone.

191
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,250
Both of them, Gio and the Album.

192
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,500
Understood.

193
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,500
Return to base for now.

[LAURA] Hi, welcome home.

As you can see, the damage
was quite extensive.

The only information we
have on this bizarre story

197
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,583
is based on unverified
eyewitness accounts.

198
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,458
Local residents have all stated

199
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,958
that monsters appeared
and some sort of batt--

200
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,875
We have a follow up report
on last night's events.

201
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,083
Apparently, the creatures
that the witnesses saw

202
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,541
all have some
connection to the ISDA.

This is ISDA operator Megumi

206
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,125
telling the world
that Ryoko and I did it!

207
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,458
We sure did Megumi!

208
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,708
How did it feel?

209
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,416
I was so nervous!
Dad! Mom! I did it!

210
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,666
It was nerve racking,

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,000
but at long last we made
our appearance in an episode!

That makes all three of us!

Um, don't we have to do
the preview of the next episode?

Ah!

215
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,125
Is it that late already?

Next time they go out

That's it?
