I guess you're really
transferring out of here.

I understand, just be
sure you write to me, Jin.

--You can't come through here.

[SHELLY] Please, Sir!

You have to let me in there!

No I don't! Stand back!

A friend of mine is
still trapped inside!

11

[SIEGLINDE] I'll let
you get away this time.

12

made me remember my dog.

You just let them go,
didn't you?

You didn't even
try to stop them.

[JIN] I'm going back
to Earth with Toa.

That way no one'll
be able to find us

I want you to
come with me, Toa.

come along with us.

30
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,708
Because, you
should live with us.

31

Are you sure? I'd probably
just get in your way.

What are you talking about?

33
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,791
Just something
Howlingstar said.

34
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,458
That's ridiculous.

How could you ever
be in the way Gio?

36
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,041
I want you to live with us.

37
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,291
Just the three of us?

38

Of course. You, me, and Toa.
The three of us.

Yes, I understand.

It's my duty.

No, I haven't
forgotten my mission.

I'll bring everyone back.

I won't fail you.

You made me so happy when you
said we would live together.

There's nothing I want more.

I truly wish I could
be with you, Jin.

But... I can't.

There is something really
important that I have to do.

And I can't.

Where is she?

You have to try
to calm down, okay?

Do you mean the Album?

I can't stand here

It's all about you, isn't it?

You have the nerve
to steal Gio from me

and then ask for my help?

79
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,125
Gio was mine!

And then, you stole him!

There's only one

because of something
the Gillard Army did?

Yes.

They're trying to break up
your monopoly on Communicators.

They announce the
existence of Dragons

and lay out the
earth's destruction.

00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,541
You'll have to face
the consequences

165
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,083
after coming here
without authorization.

166
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,416
No authorization?

167
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,250
But you came here with Widow.

168
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,041
No, Widow. You didn't
actualize, did you?

169
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,083
We're scheduled
to take off at 20:30.

170
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,458
I want every one
of you to be back

171
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,041
at your posts
before then, okay?

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,375
I can't fathom why
you'd cut your hair that way

173
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,833
What the hell
were you thinking?

174
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,875
You could have.

175
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,458
Akira dear.

176
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,083
Why don't we go
get some dinner now?

177
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,500
You're right.

178
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,500
I think dinner is
a good idea, coming?

179
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,250
No, I'm not.

180
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,041
Hate her.

181
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,458
You're being immature, Akira.

182
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,541
Damn!

183
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,708
I need to know what's going on.

184
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,708
She said she wanted to
go back to Earth with me.

185
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,208
Where is she?

186
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,000
Something must
have happened to her.

187
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,291
You're right.

188
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,333
The Album. Toa.

189
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,166
She's been
captured by the ISDA.

190
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
Tell me when this happened.

191
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,833
Are you asking
me to betray ISDA?

192
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,791
What gives you the right?

193
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,875
Kazuki listen, I
am willing to do

194
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,416
whatever it takes
to get her back.

195
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,250
They've already
loaded her in the shuttle

196
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,208
and it's scheduled to return
to Earth within the hour.

197
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,375
Once that happens,
there's nothing you can do.

198
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,875
You'll never be
allowed see her again.

199
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm sure ISDA's research team

200
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,291
is going to make
effective use of her.

201
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,416
As their new lab rat.

202
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,166
No!

203
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,875
This one's under my protection.

204
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,375
Gio, back off.

205
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,833
Please, you have to help me.

206
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,583
Well?

207
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,375
Tell me, how does it feel

208
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,833
to have something
important taken from you?

209
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,750
Now you get to see
what I had to go through

210
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,333
when you took
Gio away from me!

211
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,458
I told you.

212
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,125
I do not belong to any man.

213
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,250
Gio.

214
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,166
It's all the same to me.

215
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,458
You'll just have
to deal with it.

216
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,250
Once I bring Toa here.

217
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,750
You give Gio to me.

218
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,708
Well, you don't
have a lot of time

219
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,250
before that shuttle takes off.

220
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,166
Will it be yes or no?

221
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,333
Decide quickly or
it will be too late.

222
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,041
You can save Toa or keep Gio.

223
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,000
You can only have one.

224
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,541
We have a deal then.

225
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:12,833
Why don't you take a nap?

226
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,541
There's someone
waiting for you.

227
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,708
[FEMALE STAFF A]
The Album's escaped!

228
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,875
Widow?

229
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,625
[FEMALE STAFF A]
The Album has been taken!

230
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,791
Just where are you taking me?

231
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,458
I am taking you
to Jin Kamishina.

232
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,416
Let me go! Let me go!

233
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,916
What's the matter?

234
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,416
I would have thought you'd
be excited to see him again.

235
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,041
I want to see him.

236
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
But I just can't!

237
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,458
I can't see him anymore!

238
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:12,375
If you want to be with him
then don't stop yourself.

239
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,541
I'm really sorry.

240
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,125
So are you angry with me?

241
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,708
Agreeing with him was the
only way I saw to rescue Toa!

242
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,250
You would have made
the exact same choice I made.

243
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,541
Then tell me something.

244
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,958
When the time comes do you
think you can protect Toa?

245
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:48,500
I will protect her!

246
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:54,000
I see.

247
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,583
Then it looks like
I really am in the way.

248
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,958
It's me.

249
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,875
Here she is.

250
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,208
Toa it's me!

251
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,375
What's wrong?

252
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,916
Now just as we agreed
give Gio back to me.

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,541
Yeah.

254
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,541
Go on.

255
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
What's wrong?

256
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,125
You should go wait
over there with Jin now.

257
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,083
He'll be sure to protect you.

258
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,458
I can't.

259
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,083
Toa!

260
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,541
I'm sorry, I won't!

261
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,958
What are you saying, Toa?!

262
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,708
Come on.

263
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,958
Everything's fine.

264
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,500
I won't go with you!

265
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,291
We will never be
with each other Jin.

266
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,916
But why can't we?

267
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,083
You told me that we could
go back to Earth together.

268
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,916
This is from.

269
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,875
Ai.

270
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,125
I'm the one who
collided with the shuttle.

271
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,416
I'm the one you
should be blaming.

272
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,916
I killed your family!

273
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,541
[SAKI] This is
ISDA operator, Saki.

274
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,458
[RYOKO] And Ryoko.

275
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,500
[MEGUMI] And Megumi.

276
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,583
On the next
episode of Dragonaut.

277
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,166
Too early, too early!

278
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,375
But we're always
squeezing it in.

279
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,208
No, no, haste
makes waste, you know?

280
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,666
But she gets lost
even with a map.

281
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,541
She didn't come
back to the dorm

282
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,583
for six whole hours
the other day.

283
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,125
Speaking of coming home,

284
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,875
I wonder if everyone'll be
coming back from the moon soon.

285
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,375
They used to say a vacation
wasn't over till you got home.

286
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,291
That's right.

287
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,083
You let your guard
down on the way home.

288
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,500
In other words, next time:

289
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,541
going away is fine,
but coming back is scary!
