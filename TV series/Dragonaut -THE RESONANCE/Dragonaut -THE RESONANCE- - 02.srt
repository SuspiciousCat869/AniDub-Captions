[AMADEUS] I'm sorry young man.

00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,958
How'd he do that? And why?

22

Let me outta this

00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,291
We have business with you.

27
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,541
Business? What are
you talking about?

28
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,958
Let me out now and
I might not report you!

29
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,833

[KITAJIMA] Gio?

[NANAMI] Yeah, you're
not gonna believe

what this guy did,
it's too funny.

38
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,958
This doofus misread
the code number G-10

39
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,583
and thought it said Gio.

40
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,666
So now he's decided
Gio is its name.

41
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,375
Gio.

42

Hmm.

00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,791
It's not half bad.

I'm some kind of prisoner.

46
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,500
Do you have something to say
about the accident or not?

47
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,541
[SAKAKI] Your father
was not responsible

48
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,458
for the shuttle accident
that killed your family.

49
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,375
20 years ago Pluto was destroyed

50
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,916
by a free roaming
celestial body called Thanatos.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,666
Right, but we were
told that Thanatos

52
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,333
wouldn't collide with the earth.

53
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,041
Currently it is holding
position in Pluto's old orbit.

54
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,000
However...

55
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,500
Eventually Thanatos
will collide with Earth.

56
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,875
We have already
started seeing the signs.

57
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,625
The shuttle accident wasn't
the result of pilot error.

58
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:12,666
It was caused... by this...

59
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,125
What is it?

60
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,416
An extraterrestrial
life form from Thanatos.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,875
The ISDA calls them dragons.

62
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,541
You're serious. But I don't
understand how this--

63
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,583
Unfortunately
this being collided

64
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,750
with the shuttle
your family was aboard.

65
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,708
What is all this?
Extraterrestrial life forms?

66
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,000
Dragons?

67
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:38,208
What about the truth
concerning the accident?

68
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,750
Why didn't you tell
everyone that the accident

69
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,291
was caused by an
extraterrestrial from Thanatos!

70
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,833
Since that day my father

71
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,750
has been talked about
like some kind of murderer!

72
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,916
Do the right thing and tell
the public what happened!

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,916
I'm afraid we can't do that.

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,500
Who are you?

75
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,833
I'm the chief of the Lindworm
Unit. My name is Raina Cromwell

76
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,708
Now listen Jin.

77
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,666
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling

78
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,916
but try to think
about the big picture.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,791
What if we told them the truth?

80
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,208
That the accident
was caused by aliens.

81
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958
There would be consequences.

82
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,208
So what!

83
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,500
The Dragonauts may
be the only chance

84
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,125
humanity has against
an onslaught from Thanatos.

85
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,416
If you want revenge
for your family.

86
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,708
Then become a Dragonaut!

87
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,125
Revenge means nothing to me.

88
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:39,791
Just prove my father
was innocent.

89
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,333
And then we can talk!

90
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,500
Where do you think you're going?

91
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,208
I am going home, now.

92
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,166
Funny I didn't know
you had a home to go to.

93
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,666
Sorry I'm late!
Please forgive me.

94
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,291
Kazuki?

95
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,208
Jin.

96
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,916
[SAKI]
You'll be staying

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,750
at the ISDA facility
for a little while.

98
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,333
We've already
contacted your family

99
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,375
so you don't need to
be concerned about that.

100
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,625
It's okay.

101
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,125
Trust me, I'm not all
that worried about it.

102
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,375
Oh? I see. That's good.

103
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,625
It's great to see you,

104
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,125
it's gonna be be just
like old times. Right?

105
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,583
After the shuttle accident.

106
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,750
You dropped out of
the astronaut training academy

107
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,083
and I started to believe

108
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,291
that you and I would
never see each other again.

109
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,083
Think back, Jin.

110
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,250
Do you remember the promise
we made that night?

111
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,583
Up on the hill.

112
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,583
[YOUNG KAZUKI]
One of these days.

113
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,250
We should go into
outer space together. 'Kay?

114
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,833
[YOUNG JIN] Sure.

115
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,583
That sounds like a great idea.

116
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,833
Do you promise me?

117
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,541
Yeah.

118
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,625
Someday, for sure.

119
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,000
More than
anything else we wanted

120
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,791
to go into space together.

121
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,125
I don't understand
what's happened to you.

122
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,416
Why won't you join us, Jin?

123
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,625
C'mon! Be a Dragonaut with me!

124
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,291
Did you know?

125
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,333
About what happened
with the shuttle accident.

126
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,375
That it wasn't
my father's fault.

127
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,250
Well yeah. I guess I did.

128
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,166
But not until
I became a Dragonaut.

129
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,208
Before then I didn't
know anything about it.

130
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,833
Yeah, whatever.

131
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,166
Jin.

132
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,041
Did you mean what you said?

133
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,625
About making Jin Kamishina
a Dragonaut?

134
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,875
Is there a problem with that?

135
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,916
No, but...

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,458
If he had the Album
you would welcome him.

137
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,458
Is that what Dr. Kitajima said?

138
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,958
She didn't have to.

139
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,458
We are relatively
certain that Jin

140
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,000
will have contact
with the Album again.

141
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,000
When that happens,
use every available resource

142
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,791
to capture her.
Is that clear?

143
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,458
Crystal clear, sir.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,166
The shuttle accident wasn't
the result of pilot error.

145
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,375
It was caused by this.

146
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,666
If you want revenge
for your family.

147
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,208
Then become a Dragonaut!

148
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,708
I can't believe
those selfish bastards.

149
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,958
I don't need them.

150
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,416
They can all go to hell.

151
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,708
Leave me alone!

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have to go.

153
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,958
To Toa.

154
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,666
Toa.

155
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,125
Jin.

156
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,000
You're here.

157
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,250
Um, about yesterday.

158
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,750
I don't remember
exactly what happened.

159
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,750
There is one thing...
I do remember falling.

160
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,791
You don't need
to worry about that.

161
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,250
The important thing about
yesterday is that I met you.

162
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
Contact with
the Album is confirmed.

163
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,125
Roger that.

164
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,875
Please continue
the surveillance.

165
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,708
You won't get away again.

166
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,625
Is something the matter?

167
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,083
Hey Toa? Have you ever
traveled to outer space?

168
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,625
Have you ever seen
the Earth from way out there?

169
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes I have.

170
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,541
So what did it look like?

171
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,375
Well, I thought it
was a very pretty planet.

172
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,916
But, did it change your life?

173
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,833
You know, I think it did.

174
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,125
That was mean!

175
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,750
Currently the Album is out
of ISDA's observation network,

176
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,958
and is fleeing
with Jin Kamishina

177
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,916
through the mountains
northwest of the lighthouse.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,625
All Lindworm Unit members,
link with your Communicators,

179
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,875
then, you are to
locate and secure

180
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,000
the two of them as
quickly as possible.

181
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,875
Also, in the event
that the targets

182
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,833
don't cooperate with you.

183
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,625
You may use force.

184
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,791
That is all.

185
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,750
I will now brief
you on your stations.

186
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,458
Akira, go with
the special forces

187
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,125
and cut off the
target's path of retreat.

188
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,666
[KAZUKI] Jin... why?

189
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,041
Amagi, you and Kazuki
take the islands west exit.

190
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,375
I'll close the net
at the north exit.

191
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,791
Now, as far as actualizing.

192
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,583
[HOWLINGSTAR] Now!

193
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,666
What is this?

194
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,041
Here.

195
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,625
Thank you, Jin.

196
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
All that running
sure made me thirsty.

197
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:56,375
Hey, Toa. What on
earth came over you?

198
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,875
Please. Promise me you
won't go near ISDA anymore.

199
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,166
What's going on here?
Who're you?

200
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,416
[AKIRA] Hey! Over here!

201
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,416
Do as I say, nice and easy,
and nobody gets hurt.

202
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,250
All right then.

203
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,708
Would the two of you mind
coming along with me?

204
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,291
What the hell
are you talking about?

205
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,000
What do you guys want from us?

206
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,416
Machina!

207
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,791
[MACHINA] Now I've got you.

208
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,333
Toa.

209
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,041
I promise that
I'll come back for you.

210
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,875
After her Machina!

211
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,458
Toa.

212
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,875
Whoa there!

213
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,583
That's far enough.

214
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,791
The Album.

215
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,708
Toa!

216
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,291
Jin!

217
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,916
Kazuki.

218
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,791
Why are you running away Jin?

219
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,708
You promised me long ago
we'd go into space together.

220
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,125
So why?

221
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
Kazuki. You don't.

222
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,666
Stay where you are!

223
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,458
Don't move.

224
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,458
Are you going to shoot me?

225
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,458
I don't want to shoot.

226
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,833
We're best friends.

227
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,583
Just come back with me.

228
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,958
We can talk about
all of this at ISDA.

229
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,375
Please Jin!

230
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,625
You say you're
my friend... my friend!

231
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,041
Then, you hunt me down,
ambush me,

232
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,208
and threaten me with a gun?

233
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,958
Friends don't do that!

234
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,916
Please Jin.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,833
I truly am.
All alone in the world.

236
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,041
Your arm. Are you okay?

237
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,333
I'm fine.

238
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,250
See.

239
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,833
You're not alone anymore.

240
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,333
You have me now, Jin.

241
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,458
You won't get away!

242
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,083
Jin!

243
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,833
Amagi... what're you?

244
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,333
How could you?

245
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,000
[AMAGI] I did it.

246
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,416
I just shot another person.

247
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,875
Abnormality
detected in Spirytus!

248
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,041
The comm link with his master
is starting to fade rapidly.

249
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,916
If this keeps up
his communicator

250
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,333
can't be maintained!

251
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,083
This is impossible!

252
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,375
[YONAMINE] Where's Amagi?

253
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,125
More! Kill them!

254
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,458
I want to kill more people!

255
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,458
His resonance connect is.

256
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:22,083
Why?

257
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,208
Why would you do
something like this!

258
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,625
Amagi!

259
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,625
[AMAGI] Yes! Yes! Yes!

260
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,250
Destroy everything Spirytus!

261
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,083
Amagi!

262
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,416
What are you doing Amagi?

263
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,875
Get him back to
a Communicator now!

264
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,500
Amagi! Amagi has
been eaten by Spirytus!

265
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,875
He was what?

266
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,583
Disgusting.

267
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,958
What?

268
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,208
This can't be right.

269
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,375
Why are you actualizing here?

270
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,958
This is bad.

271
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,541
Now with his Master gone.

272
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,458
His Resonance Connect
will not function.

273
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,666
That's right,
and when that happens.

274
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,666
We won't have any way
to control the dragon.

275
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,291
Impossible!

276
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
This cannot be happening!

277
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,958
Spirytus will reach the
observation park any second now.

278
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,541
Massive casualties are expected!

279
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,666
Hey. Over there. Look.

280
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,083
What is it?

281
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,916
It doesn't look good.

282
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,958
It's burning!

283
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,166
Whoa. What's that?

284
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,125
My god.

285
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,208
That thing.

286
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,625
I see now. It's a dragon.

287
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,416
I won't let it touch you Jin!

288
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,000
Toa.

289
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,791
[JIN] Toa. Who are you really?

290
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,083
Please. Close your eyes.

291
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,250
Toa.

292
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,416
[Girl singing in Japanese]

293
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,000
Excellent work everyone.

294
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,125
This is ISDA operator Saki.

295
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,291
Today is a tremendously
auspicious day.

296
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:10,208
What?

297
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,916
[RYOKO] This is
the second time Megumi.

298
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,250
[MEGUMI] She just wants
to hog all the attention.

299
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,291
You two are both here right?

300
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,541
Just being here isn't enough.

301
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,083
Yeah, we don't get
to say anything!

302
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,750
We've still got a long way
to go so just bear with it.

303
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,625
The preview time is
running out, again!

304
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,666
Next time, there's a monster
battle and some other stuff!
