1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,875
Here it comes.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,708
It's you.

3
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,000
You came back
here to help us.

4
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,666
Gio why?

5
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,791
[TOA] Gio.

6
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,000
What in the world
happened here?

7
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,333
[JIN] Why?

8
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,916
I don't understand it.

9
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,166
[GIO roars]

10
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,833
Gio stop it!

11
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,583
It's like you don't remember
that we're your friends!

12
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
What's that over there?

13
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
[PILOT] It looks like a couple
of dragons are fighting.

14
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,041
Why are you doing
this to us, Gio?

15
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,375
Toa!

16
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,208
Gio!

17
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,875
I want some answers.

18
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,708
Why are you acting this way?

19
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,083
Tell me.

20
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,458
I thought you
wanted to protect Toa!

21
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,291
Trying to save Toa
would be futile.

22
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,166
What do you mean "save her"?

23
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,958
Toa's life will be coming
to an end very soon.

24
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,750
Wait. She's dying?

25
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,083
Is that what you're telling me?

26
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,666
Toa!

27
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,458
Time to go.

28
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,041
You need to come with me, Toa.

29
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,958
But Gio.

30
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
We should leave immediately.

31
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,416
Hold on!
She's not going anywhere!

32
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,291
Move.

33
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,583
Just go! Now!

34
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,875
Don't you ever come
near either one of us again!

35
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,791
You've hurt everyone here,
and I swore I would protect her.

36
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:56,583
I would never let
someone like you take her away.

37
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,375
Don't do it.

38
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,625
Please just stop,

39
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,791
I'm begging you
to spare his life.

40
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,041
Toa, I am the only
one who can save you.

41
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:22,708
Your life does
not have to end so soon.

42
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,458
As the successor to Thanatos

43
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,666
I now have
the power to save you.

44
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,041
[JIN and TOA gasp]

45
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,125
[JIN] 
Successor to Thanatos?

46
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,416
What are you talking about Gio?

47
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,166
What is this?

48
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,000
We promised.

49
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
We promised we would
all live together.

50
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,541
And both of us would work
as a team to protect Toa.

51
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,833
What happened to that dream?

52
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,625
There is no longer a place
for me in that dream.

53
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,083
What the...?

54
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,625
What is that thing?

55
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,083
That's...

56
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,541
[PILOT] Commander! Over there!

57
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,541
What? What's going on?

58
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,208
Take us in closer.

59
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,666
You saved me from being
killed by that Dragon.

60
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,500
Let us leave this
place together, Toa.

61
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,833
I can't.

62
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,958
Gio.

63
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,041
Come back and stay with us.

64
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,000
As I have already said,

65
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,666
I can't return to the life
the three of us once shared.

66
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,708
I'll come back soon.

67
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,291
Don't forget
what I told you, Jin.

68
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,958
Jin.

69
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,458
What did Gio say to you?

70
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:26,541
Toa's life will be
coming to an end very soon.

71
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,083
Nothing.

72
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,125
Look over there.

73
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,625
It's okay Jin. She's helpless.

74
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:52,416
As injured as she is,
she can't cause any harm.

75
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,458
She is known
to us as the Raum.

76
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,875
The last Original dragon
that came here from Thanatos.

77
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,541
That's right. It's me, Toa.

78
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,250
I'm over here, Father.

79
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,875
What are you doing here?

80
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,625
Stay back!

81
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,250
Hold on a minute.

82
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,291
She called you... Father.

83
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,416
Jin!

84
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,250
Right.

85
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,125
You don't have to worry.

86
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,875
I haven't ordered any action

87
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,083
to be taken
against either of you.

88
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,500
Commander.

89
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,208
We both know
that your daughter

90
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,583
was involved in
the shuttle accident.

91
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,625
What are you doing?

92
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,416
Why are you chasing
around a Dragon

93
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,458
that's taken the form
of your daughter?

94
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,500
That thing over there
is not my daughter.

95
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,958
It's simply a tool.

96
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
Simpy a tool?

97
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,416
The relationship
between dragons

98
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,291
and humans isn't like that!

99
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,333
Get up.

100
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,625
If you're done lying
around we should go.

101
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,208
Right.

102
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,708
What the hell was Gio thinking?

103
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,958
Where did those two go?

104
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,041
You don't suppose
Gio got them?

105
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,666
Would you stop
spouting that nonsense?

106
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,500
I think it's in our best
interest to get away from here.

107
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,375
It's very possible
that Jin and Toa

108
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,833
have already fled
the island and found safety.

109
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,583
If those two
are still alive

110
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,625
they're probably headed
to the rendezvous point.

111
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,416
The whole reason we have

112
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,291
a rendezvous point
is for times like this.

113
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,208
Well then in that case let's
get out of here on the double!

114
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,791
[GIO flashback] Toa's life will
be coming to an end very soon.

115
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,958
That should hold her
for a little bit longer.

116
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,125
But it's critical
that she gets

117
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,916
medical care
as soon as possible.

118
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:59,375
How can you be so
cold during all of this?

119
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,875
This little girl is your
partner, can't you feel that?

120
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,875
You're being foolish.

121
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,125
Directing emotions
towards a Dragon.

122
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,333
Foolish?

123
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,458
Do you feel nothing

124
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,125
for a little girl on
the edge of death?

125
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,333
Take her back to base.

126
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,375
Whatever happens, happens.

127
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,416
Good.

128
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,583
I'm headed that way now.

129
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,333
Hey! Wait!

130
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,666
Commander Sakaki!

131
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,250
How are you feeling?

132
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,750
It's happening to you also.

133
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,541
I don't want you
to worry too much.

134
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,791
Everything'll be just fine.

135
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
We're not alone.

136
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,125
You see our pain connects us.

137
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,666
They're here.

138
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,125
Commander.

139
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,708
Now leave.

140
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,291
I'll let you go this time.

141
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,166
Uh.

142
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,166
What is it?

143
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,708
With all the technology at ISDA.

144
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,625
Do you think it might
be possible for the scientists

145
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:30,041
on your staff to save
the injured dragon's life?

146
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,833
Why would you ask
something like that?

147
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,125
I'm worried.

148
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,208
Do you think she'll
be all right?

149
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:52,291
She's a lot more
fatigued than she looks.

150
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,041
Yeah but...
how do you know?

151
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,166
Well both of us
are Dragons.

152
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,458
So then you can sense
things about each other,

153
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,208
Like when one
of you is injured.

154
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,750
Or when you're going to die.

155
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,666
Jin.

156
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
We should go now.

157
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,833
The others are waiting.

158
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,458
Are you there, Dad?

159
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,041
I'm right here sweetheart.

160
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,875
Ridiculous.

161
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,291
That is a Dragon,
not my daughter.

162
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,000
What's the meaning of this?

163
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,416
[SOLDIER A] Commander Sakaki.

164
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,958
We have orders
from headquarters

165
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
to take you and the
anti-Thanatos Factor

166
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,666
compatible specimen
into custody immediately!

167
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,458
You need to get away.

168
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:56,208
You need to get away
from here, daddy.

169
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,041
Laura!

170
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,083
[SOLDIER A] Commander
Sakaki has escaped!

171
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,958
[SOLDIER B] Notify
the search craft!

172
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,000
[SIEGLINDE] Thought you'd
take your time huh?

173
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,375
Well waiting for you
was exhausting.

174
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,958
Sorry for being late.

175
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,958
I hope you weren't
worried about us.

176
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,583
Are either of you hurt?

177
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
Oh no, we're fine.

178
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,458
Right Jin?

179
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,833
Yeah.

180
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,916
So, what happened out there?

181
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,750
It was nothing really.

182
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,625
Could somebody tell me what
that bastard Gio is thinking?

183
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,500
No one knows that!

184
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,041
Now keep your
voice down would you!

185
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,833
Why would Gio
change so suddenly?

186
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,833
Jin.

187
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,250
Do you know
something we don't?

188
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,750
It's about Gio.

189
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,625
He told us that he had
become Thanatos' successor.

190
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,791
What exactly did he say?

191
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,666
Thanatos' successor?

192
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,333
But I thought
Thanatos' only goal

193
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,875
was to exterminate all
'contaminated' Dragons

194
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
that had gone through
Resonance with humans?

195
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,208
Are you sure
that's what he said Jin?

196
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,250
Yes and I don't think
he was lying about it.

197
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,625
That wouldn't
make any sense.

198
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,291
Damn that, Gio!

199
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,208
The only reason he's doing
all this is to save himself!

200
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,625
That's a lie!

201
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,333
Gio would never
do something like that!

202
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,291
Is there another reason
to explain why he attacked us?

203
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,625
No. I don't know.

204
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,958
In any case, if he attacks,
we have to defend ourselves.

205
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,791
Are we all agreed?

206
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,166
I've got to go for
a walk and clear my head.

207
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:11,083
Toa's life will be
coming to an end very soon.

208
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,500
Toa, I am the only
one who can save you.

209
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,750
How can you
be so sure of that?

210
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,708
I'm so sorry.

211
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,083
But I just don't
know what to do.

212
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:34,250
I don't want to leave you Jin
but I can't control my death.

213
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,916
What do you mean?

214
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,041
What do you mean?

215
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,125
You're hiding something.

216
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,250
I can feel it.

217
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,458
You've been acting
really weird lately.

218
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,208
Gio and Jin have been too.

219
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,000
What happened to
those three people

220
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,875
who were so happy
in their tiny little house?

221
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,541
I'm so sorry Sieglinde,
but I...

222
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,166
I'm going to die soon.

223
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,791
My time in this life
is nearing it's end.

224
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,708
Gio knew this
and wanted to save me.

225
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,291
So he made the
journey to Thanatos.

226
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,083
He was hoping to find me
a reprieve from my death.

227
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,666
You see Thanatos has
the power to extend my life.

228
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,833
What about Jin?

229
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,916
Does he know any of this?

230
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,250
I'm not sure.

231
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
Gio may have already
told him everything.

232
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,166
Oh no.

233
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,458
Why didn't you let
him know about this?

234
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,125
I don't know.

235
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,500
I just couldn't say it.

236
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,000
I guess I thought it would

237
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
shatter the peaceful
lives we'd finally found.

238
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,500
After all of the
struggling and fighting

239
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,291
we had a chance at a life

240
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,916
where the three
of us could be happy.

241
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,416
It isn't fair!

242
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,333
Why does it have
to be like this?

243
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,291
Oh Sieglinde.

244
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,750
I know I haven't
always been kind.

245
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,250
But I was just envious
of what the three of you had.

246
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,625
It's so unfair that
something so beautiful

247
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,333
will be lost forever.

248
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,791
Why?

249
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,166
Why does it
have to be this way?

250
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,208
[SIEGLINDE crying]

251
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,041
[TOA} I have to do something.

252
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,125
[JIN] I have to do something.

253
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,583
[TOA] But now the question is,
what can I do?

254
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,000
[JIN] But what?
What can I do?

255
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,208
I suppose I have no choice.

256
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,583
This will do.

257
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,916
This will have to do
if it will save Toa.

258
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,791
Hey Ryoko! Saki!

259
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,375
Come take a look at these!

260
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,541
Wha...?

261
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,041
These are the scripts

262
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,458
for the rest of
the Dragonaut episodes huh?

263
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,083
To think it's gonna
take this turn later.

264
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,041
Yeah!

265
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,208
Isn't that incredible?

266
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,333
Who'd have thought
that beep would beep?

267
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,666
It's shocking really.

268
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,166
It really is
more than I imagined.

269
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,208
I mean, beep and beep!

270
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,250
We could base
the preview on this.

271
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,208
Okay, next time beep beeps!

272
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:27,208
You don't have to
say beep there.
