1
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,291
Those imbeciles.

2
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,708
If the Type-X didn't have
any effect on that thing,

3
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,958
what do they think conventional
weapons can do to it?

4
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,125
Thanatos will be disappearing
behind Earth relatively soon.

5
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,541
Sieglinde, are you done yet?

6
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,375
Just a little bit longer.

7
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:53,000
Man, they may have a pretty
simple defense system,

8
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,375
but their numbers alone
are making it tough enough!

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,875
You have to hurry.

10
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,500
You don't have to tell me.

11
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,958
I'm getting irritated
looking at this program...

12
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,375
It just reeks of unoriginality.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,416
I'm going to re-write
the whole damn thing later,

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,125
you can be sure of that.

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,458
Final deceleration complete.

16
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,291
Are you sure about this, Jin?

17
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,541
Yeah, thanks again.

18
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,375
You know, I was the winner of
our little skirmish after all.

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,666
Kazuki.

20
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,583
Jin, you're coming back.

21
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,875
I can't.

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,791
I have no idea
what's going on in there,

23
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,458
or what's will
happen from this point on,

24
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,125
but you're willing
to risk your life.

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,916
You want to know
what's happened to Toa,

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,375
and you'll stop at nothing
for even a moment with her.

27
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,333
But, you are coming back to us.

28
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,333
For everyone's sake
you have to come back.

29
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Yeah, I am coming back to Earth.

30
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,500
With Toa beside me!

31
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,333
You can't stop me!

32
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,541
The Aegis system, is
completely under my control.

33
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,000
You have done
an excellent job, Young Miss.

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,875
Okay, shall we get started?

35
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,166
Reflector array angle
adjustment complete.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,166
Aegis operation confirmed.

37
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,500
Understood, 120 seconds until
Thanatos enters firing range.

38
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,083
Tracking system contact.

39
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,916
Power charge and "oscillation
pulse rate input" complete.

40
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,750
Mirror error correction 0.03!

41
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,208
Error correction 0.03.

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,291
Engaging Aegis.

43
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,000
CSS Fresnel lenses,
power boosters,

44
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:32,166
choking field,
all systems, go!

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,666
The Avenir is
successfully charging

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,833
the CSS waves as we speak.

47
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
What is our output?

48
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,833
We are currently passing
80% and rising steadily.

49
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,375
Stop, we don't
need that much power.

50
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,500
Huh?

51
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,708
Drop the output to 27% okay?

52
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,333
Come on.

53
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Quit your whining, we just
want to communicate with it.

54
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,208
Attacking Thanatos
is not our purpose here.

55
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,291
Fine.

56
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,500
Do you really
think the Aegis

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,000
can be used as
a communication tool?

58
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,750
Will Thanatos
not strike back?

59
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,041
[RAINA] You are aware,
sir, that CSS waves

60
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,958
are distinguished by
a Dragon's sensory organs?

61
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,583
The Aegis is a powerful weapon.

62
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,541
Vibrations in the air can be
explosive if they are powerful

63
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,458
but if they are smaller,
they become mere sounds.

64
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,125
It might seem a little brash,

65
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,000
but unless we do something,

66
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,166
even as risky as this is,
that ugly thing won't listen.

67
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,416
I see, but is
there any proof

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,666
at all that our words
will get through to it?

69
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,583
There isn't any proof.

70
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,291
However, there is a Dragon.

71
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,625
He's in there and has gone
through Resonance with a human.

72
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,041
Gio.

73
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,666
60 seconds until Thanatos
appears from behind the Earth.

74
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,833
All systems are go.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:05,125
10 more seconds,
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

76
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,291
Commence irradiation!

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,333
You must answer us.

78
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:39,041
Please, listen, Thanatos,
you have to hear us out.

79
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,250
What is this?

80
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,833
Where are we?

81
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,541
Are we on Earth?

82
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,083
I get it, this is...

83
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,666
[SIEGLINDE] Where the
heck are we anyway?

84
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,375
Is that...?

85
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,541
So this is what
the afterlife looks like.

86
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,750
Please, don't even say
anything scary like that!

87
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,833
No, I don't even
have a boyfriend yet;

88
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,125
I don't want to die!

89
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,708
You need to keep quiet.

90
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,333
Hey!

91
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,708
Little man!

92
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,458
What are all of you doing here?

93
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,875
Hey guys I was just about
to ask you the same thing,

94
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,458
what are you two doing here?

95
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,041
Indeed, after all.

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,500
You are aware this is...

97
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,458
The inside of Thanatos.

98
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,125
Right?

99
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,750
That is correct.

100
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,458
Akira!

101
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,666
Machina!

102
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,208
You're both alive!

103
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,208
What an interesting
device you've created.

104
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,458
Who could've imagined that CSS
could be used in such a manner?

105
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,458
When humans get
backed up against a wall,

106
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,750
you never have a clue
what they're capable of.

107
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,208
What the hell are
you two talking about?

108
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,333
Sieglinde, they
aren't Akira and Machina.

109
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,416
I am afraid Mr. Cromwell
is right, Young Miss.

110
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,708
Raina, I guess
the plan worked.

111
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,458
Don't ya think?

112
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,708
So it seems.

113
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you sure?

114
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,666
So, then, those two
are actually Thanatos?

115
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,166
Uh, I wouldn't
put it that way.

116
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,166
Thanatos is a boundless
aggregate of consciousness.

117
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,625
And we are nothing more
than a small portion of it.

118
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,333
Yes, we are tiny
beings floating along

119
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,291
on a vast sea of
consciousness, but still...

120
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,208
The time is near when
we will dissolve into the sea.

121
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,833
Yes, very soon, now.

122
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,541
You wanted to talk to
us, didn't you, Raina?

123
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,083
Let's hear it.

124
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,958
After all that is the reason
why we brought you here.

125
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:55,458
Yes, of course,
well, Thanatos we ask you

126
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,291
to please cease any further
interference with the Earth.

127
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,708
Why's that?

128
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,166
Why's that you ask?

129
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Because when that massive
creature gets close enough.

130
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,625
Please, Young Miss.

131
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,500
It's going to have a
devastating effect on the Earth!

132
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,250
All of us fought together
side by side, didn't we?

133
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,166
How can you say that now?

134
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,041
The Dragonauts, yes, I do
indeed have memories of that.

135
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,041
But we are no
longer your allies,

136
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:21,416
those ties serve
no purpose for us.

137
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,916
That's alright, you don't
have to call us your allies.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,958
But could it
still be possible

139
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,708
to negotiate with us
on friendly terms?

140
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,333
If Thanatos' goal is to recover
the remaining Dragon eggs,

141
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,333
we will no doubt assist you.

142
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,708
So, please.

143
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,416
Raina, it doesn't matter
what happens to them.

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,416
Contaminated eggs
don't concern us.

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,750
Contaminated?

146
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,458
You say that like humanity

147
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,958
is some sort of
disgusting infection!

148
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,583
Resonance with
the human race is a mistake.

149
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,500
They steal from and hurt
others of their own kind.

150
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,791
Humans truly are
an incredibly foolish species.

151
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,916
We want nothing
to do with any Dragon

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that has gone through
Resonance with them.

153
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,291
Why you!

154
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,333
It is no use, Howlingstar.

155
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,208
Mother has come
to the conclusion

156
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,083
that Dragons should no longer
be contaminated by humans.

157
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,250
Therefore, it has
decided to eliminate humans,

158
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,666
the source of
the contamination.

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,833
That's an arbitrary
thing to say.

160
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,625
You came without asking,

161
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,541
and now you're going
to destroy humanity

162
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,250
because we
contaminate Dragons?

163
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,833
How tyrannical.

164
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,583
Which of us is arbitrary?

165
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,000
You believe that
the Earth belongs to mankind

166
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,916
without any
doubt in your mind.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,958
How is it that you
don't realize that thinking

168
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,458
is what is
contaminating the Dragons?

169
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,916
It's too bad, Raina.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,541
Wait, Thanatos!

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,833
Kazuki, Raina, Sieglinde.

172
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,166
Where is everyone?

173
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,208
Jin.

174
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,000
Come with me.

175
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,750
We're on the Avenir.

176
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:04,166
Where's Jin?
Jin's not here!

177
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Is he still inside Thanatos?

178
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,666
[alarm beeping]

179
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,583
Thanatos' orbit has been altered

180
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,041
and at this rate
it will collide with Earth!

181
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,875
Toa.

182
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,583
Jin!

183
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,541
Toa.

184
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,000
Please, answer me!

185
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,541
Toa!

186
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,625
I'm right here, Jin!

187
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,875
No.

188
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,625
What's going on here, Gio?

189
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,125
I thought you said that
Toa was supposed to live!

190
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Yes, and I kept my word.

191
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,166
You mean she's alive?

192
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,541
That's right, now that
I've brought her here.

193
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,166
She has become
one with Thanatos,

194
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,291
and in doing so
will live on forever.

195
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:17,333
You can't mean... this
is what you call living?

196
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,125
I'm sorry, Toa, I didn't
know this was going to happen.

197
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
You said you
wanted to be with me

198
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,416
'til the end,
and I just let you go.

199
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,125
Jin...

200
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,666
[TOA gasps]

201
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,583
No!

202
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,416
Gio!

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,875
I'm going to release
your consciousness

204
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,750
from the imprisonment
of your fragile body, Jin.

205
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
Are you crazy?

206
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,041
Just merge
with Thanatos, Jin.

207
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,041
By doing so,
you can be released

208
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,041
from mortality,
time and space.

209
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,041
You'll dissolve
into Toa and become one.

210
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,916
You can spend
eternity together.

211
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,750
Can Thanatos be serious

212
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,958
about eradicating
mankind from the Earth?

213
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,458
We're done for.

214
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,000
It's over.

215
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,500
[KAZUKI] Not yet!

216
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,958
Don't forget about Jin!

217
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,625
I'm sure he's
with Gio as we speak!

218
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,541
Jin will do something!

219
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,916
Something that all
of us couldn't do!

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,458
What would he do
that none of us could?

221
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,458
I don't have a clue.

222
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:27,750
But, if we give up,
it's over.

223
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,750
I don't want to
have any regrets.

224
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,541
So right now
I'm going to do

225
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,208
what I can to the
best of my ability!

226
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on, Jin.

227
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,916
[GIO yelling in rage]

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,958
[JIN panting]

229
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,375
Jin!

230
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
Do not be afraid.

231
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,750
[JIN] It's not
that I'm afraid!

232
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,833
Merging with Thanatos
would change me wouldn't it?

233
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,958
I would cease to be the Jin
that everyone knows, right?

234
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,750
And Toa wouldn't be
Toa anymore, would she?

235
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:07,750
That isn't what
Toa and I want!

236
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,166
Don't you remember?

237
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
When you, me, and Toa
all lived together?

238
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,375
At first it was just to hide,

239
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,416
but it quickly
became something more.

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,916
We all had a good time together,
don't you think so?

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,333
Yes.

242
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,416
That's because
the three of us

243
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
were completely
different people!

244
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,666
I said that your cooking
needed more seasoning,

245
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,541
but when Toa tried it she
said it was too salty, right?

246
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,958
Yes that is correct.

247
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,541
Different people can sense

248
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,875
the same thing in
completely different ways.

249
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,875
Because they feel!

250
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,291
They feel
the breeze on their skin,

251
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,833
smell the aromas
of the season,

252
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,083
get sweaty when they work.

253
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,125
That's what it is
to be alive, right?

254
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,875
I know,
I remember, but, Jin.

255
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,041
This is the only way
to extend Toa's life.

256
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,833
You're wrong, Gio!

257
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,375
This isn't what
Jin and I want at all!

258
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,166
Are you saying you wouldn't
be happy to have eternal life?

259
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,541
Yes, I wouldn't.

260
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,791
I just want to be with Jin,

261
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,000
even if only for
a fleeting moment.

262
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
But you can be with him.

263
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,416
In just the same way we are.

264
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,541
We are together forever
without the fear of death.

265
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,291
Wouldn't you like
to be in that same state?

266
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,041
I just don't think
you understand me.

267
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,875
Listen, I don't fear death.

268
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,291
It's part of me,

269
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,375
if I hadn't come to earth

270
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,208
and gone through
Resonance with Jin,

271
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,875
none of this
would be clear to me.

272
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,458
But now I know it's
the brevity of life

273
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,166
that teaches us to make
the most out of the time we have

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,833
with the people that we love.

275
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,916
Are you saying that you
think death is wonderful?

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,375
No.

277
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,708
No, I think
living is wonderful.

278
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,958
Huh.

279
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,500
But that man out there

280
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,166
doesn't really seem to share
your opinion about living.

281
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,583
Toa, or should I say the Album,
like the Atrum and the Raum,

282
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,750
are Dragons that were
created to check on the eggs.

283
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,166
Check on the eggs?

284
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,208
Precisely, once their
purpose was accomplished

285
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,208
they were to return to Thanatos

286
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,750
without going through
Resonance with anyone.

287
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,416
However...

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,458
The shuttle accident happened.

289
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,541
Yes, and then all three
of them unfortunately

290
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,208
went through
Resonance with humans.

291
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,916
So then Thanatos is angry
about them doing that.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,250
Angry?

293
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,541
Am I wrong?

294
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,625
To Thanatos,
Toa and the others

295
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,375
are merely hairs that have
fallen from its head.

296
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,750
It doesn't matter to Thanatos
whether or not Toa dies.

297
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,291
And that is why Gio
came to appeal to Mother.

298
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,708
To allow you to
merge once again

299
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,875
in exchange for him
becoming the successor.

300
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,666
But then... Gio would be.

301
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
Ah, but he knew.

302
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,916
He knew better than anyone.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,666
Jin, you must
merge with Thanatos.

304
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,833
By doing so, you can spend
eternity together with Toa.

305
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,583
No!

306
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,375
I think I finally understand,
just how Toa feels.

307
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,041
I want to be with her.

308
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,791
Even if it's
only for a moment!

309
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,250
To live together...

310
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,583
forever...

311
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,875
Toa...

312
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,750
I love you.

313
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,125
Jin, I feel
the exact same way.

314
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,291
It's futile.

315
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,250
The merging of consciousness

316
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,541
between you and Thanatos
has already begun.

317
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,958
Oh no, wait!

318
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,875
Mother!

319
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,125
Not to worry, Jin will
merge with her soon, too.

320
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
I'm not ready.

321
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,125
Please, stop!

322
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,541
Toa...

323
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,125
Cause Jin...

324
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,375
And I...

325
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,250
And I...

326
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,916
Want to be together!

327
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,375
Please forgive me, Toa.

328
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,000
Mm-hm.

329
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,000
I won't let you go again.

330
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,833
I promise to stay with
you right up until the end.

331
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,416
Good.

332
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Mother, I'm going to return
to Earth, to be with Jin!

333
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,125
The two of us are staying
together until our final moment!

334
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:37,000
How fascinating.

335
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,583
One who was born from
a piece of Mother,

336
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,125
now says something that
Mother cannot comprehend.

337
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,708
And all as a result of her
Resonance with a human being.

338
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,500
So then Mother has
decided to reconsider.

339
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,625
It's no longer going
to destroy humanity.

340
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
Great!

341
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,208
Mother has determined
that humans are creatures

342
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,208
that are indeed
worth merging with.

343
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,333
Therefore, Mother
has decided to merge

344
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,375
and become one with
the entire human race.

345
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,291
What's happening?

346
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,916
Thanatos is
beginning to wake up.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,583
This area will collapse
in on us in just a moment.

348
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,458
Both of you need to escape.

349
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,958
Gio.

350
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,250
Aren't you going to
be together until the end?

351
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,666
If that's true then you
have no time to hesitate.

352
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,166
Gio, you can't!

353
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,041
What you're doing for us.

354
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,625
It's okay, Toa.

355
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,291
But, I...

356
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,000
Come on, let's go.

357
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,333
I'm reading
irregularities in Thanatos.

358
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,125
What the hell?

359
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,958
I don't believe it!

360
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,166
A Dragon!

361
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,958
Sir, multiple objects have
been released from Thanatos.

362
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,333
They're Ostrums!

363
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,708
What the?

364
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,541
There are too many
of them to count!

365
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,583
Let's get
out there Raina!

366
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,208
This is a fitting stage

367
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,208
for one last battle
to the death, isn't it?

368
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,041
Well?

369
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,291
But if we launch an attack,

370
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,500
the Avenir will become
an easy target for them.

371
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,416
Please, go, Captain!

372
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,750
Kazuki?

373
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,750
You can go,
I'll defend the Avenir.

374
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,958
Alright, then.

375
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,583
You have grown
so much, Kazuki.

376
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,500
I'm sure you're glad.

377
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,000
That you met Widow.

378
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
Yeah.

379
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,250
We have
a special news bulletin.

380
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,958
A change has just
appeared in Thanatos,

381
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
which has remained
stationary in the Moon's orbit.

382
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,833
Thanatos has apparently
undergone a transformation

383
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,125
and has released
an unknown number of Dragons.

384
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,458
UN forces have declared
a state of emergency,

385
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,541
and recommend
everyone take shelter.

386
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,458
You are leaving,
aren't you?

387
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,458
Yes I am.

388
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,458
I'm not going to stop you.

389
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,541
You've already made up
your mind to do this.

390
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,833
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,625
Wasn't that mean,
Professor Nozaki?

392
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,333
Now, we don't have
a chance of winning, do we?

393
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,375
Just a minute, Gio!

394
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,791
There's still something
that needs to be taken care of.

395
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,541
What do you mean Jin?

396
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,333
I need to go back,
so I can talk to Thanatos again.

397
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,458
Toa, will you come
too and back me up?

398
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,916
Thinking back,
it's been a long michinori.

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,458
It seems short,
yet also long,

400
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,750
but it really
was pretty short, huh?

401
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,875
Speaking of michinori,
nori sure is delicious, huh?

402
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,583
Yeah, yeah, you can't
get by without seaweed.

403
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,500
Are you sure this is
the note we should go out on?

404
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,083
You've got to have enthusiasm,

405
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,625
or you can't win
the final conflict!

406
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,583
Hell yeah, let's use this
momentum and win this thing!

407
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,291
Next time, the denouement!
