1
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,625
You're saying our forces
should infiltrate

2
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,916
the ISDA's military division?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,625
Yes sir, I believe such
a strategy would demonstrate

4
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,875
to the entire world
the true power of the Gillard.

5
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:44,458
Well in that case,
we should begin to move forward

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,916
with this
operation immediately.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,875
Very well your majesty.

8
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,875
Of course we'll need
someone to head it up.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,208
I think that Prince Rasina would
be well-suited to the task.

10
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,625
Yes, I believe you're right.

For the record, you owe
me big-time for that one.

And I intend to
pay you back in full.

Those guys just keep coming!

Don't worry Toa,
I'm coming to save you.

18
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:36,125
I don't care what obstacles
those bastards put in my way.

On my mark dispatch
the Agathion squadron!

22
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,791
I'm sure there's
no need for all that.

23
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,875
Your Majesty,
we have to act immediately!

24
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,958
If we don't destroy
the Dragonauts now,

25
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,375
nothing will stop
them from coming here

26

to take back the Album!

27
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,125
Perhaps we should
simply invite them in.

28
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,208
Don't you think that idea
sounds far more entertaining?

29
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,375
Your Highness, this may
be our only opportunity to--

30

That's an order, Major.

Hey. What gives huh?

34
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,416
Here I thought we were finally
making a charge at Thanatos

35
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,666
and now we're taking a break?

36
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
That doesn't
seem right does it?

37
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,833
We'll leave soon enough.

38
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,291
Take it easy, Howlingstar.

39
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,250
Why can't we go right now?

40
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,666
I've really got the itch
to fight in a good battle.

41
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,375
That's just what
I'm counting on.

42
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,458
Yeah!

[SIEGLINDE]
Hey.

44
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,125
How much longer do think
we'll be here on the moon?

45
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,708
We'll be here as
long as it takes

46
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,916
to complete the Avenir's final
inspection and load the Type-X.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,583
Oh.

48
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,416
As a result of
the Ostrum's attack,

49
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,291
the threat posed by Thanatos

50
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,500
has suddenly become much more
tangible to the general public.

51
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,708
All the major highways

52
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,000

gridlocked with people

trying to reach the spaceport
so they can leave Earth.

54
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,208
And we've received
multiple reports of rioting.

55
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,375
Was there really nothing
that could've been done

56

about the destruction
of Shinogasawara City

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,875
by just one of
the Original Dragons?

58
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,416
You should know
that many are holding

59
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
the ISDA
responsible for this.

60
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,916
Now then Mr. Kiril.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,166
How do you explain your
agency's failure in this matter?

62
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,208
Hold on a minute,
my agencies shortcomings?

63
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,416
If the Gillard Force
hadn't ignored our request

64
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,708
for assistance
this whole ordeal--

65
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,666
Are you saying we're responsible
for the city's destruction?

66
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,541
Are you saying that you aren't?

67
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,875
You'd blame someone else for the
consequences of your actions.

68
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,000
That is among the
most dishonorable things

69
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,416
a man can do.

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,791
You and your brainless
cronies allowed this to happen!

71
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,583
How dare you let us
take the fall for it!

72
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,041
Are you so blind
that you can't see

73
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,583
how much we have to tolerate
from the Gillard Army!

74
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,291
Mister Kiril watch your temper!

75
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,041
Keep in mind that
you are addressing

76
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,375
the sovereign of a nation.

77
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,666
Infighting among D Project
members is also to blame.

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,375
That being said, it's
important to maintain unity

79
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,333
both between and
within our organizations.

80
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,625
An excellent point.

81
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,000
On our end, the conflict
with ISDA was the result

82
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,500
of Asim and his officers
acting on their own.

83
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,125
We're having
trouble controlling him.

84
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,166
You can't control Prince Asim?

85
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,250
But doesn't he command
your entire military branch?

86
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,250
He most certainly does not.

87
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,083
I can assure you
that authority on all matters

88
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
ultimately rests with me.

89
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,375
I promise you that
from this moment on

90
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,458
the Gillard army
will support the ISDA

91
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,208
with every resource available.

92
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,666
Sure.

93
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,625
It isn't just us.

94
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,791
They've been divided as well.

95
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,250
How are you feeling
today, my dear?

96
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,833
The look in your eyes
is as precious as ever.

97
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:47,000
So full of sorrow.

98
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,833
From what I can tell
the ISDA is about to launch

99
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,250
an attack on your kind.

100
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,500
This'll be good.

101
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,375
An attack?

102
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,166
You can't let them go!

103
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,916
If they attack Thanatos,
there will be no turning back!

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,375
Please!

105
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
Let me out of here
so I can stop this!

106
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,083
Not a chance.

107
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,666
Why would I
release my property?

108
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,083
If I don't do something
Earth is going to be wiped out!

109
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,083
Wouldn't that
be entertaining?

110
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,916
It's not every day
that you get front row seats

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,416
to watch the death
of an entire planet.

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,416
Entertaining?

113
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,958
Earth is your home
world, isn't it?

114
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,791
How can you be so
callous about this?

115
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,583
Let's talk about you.

116
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,750
Why are you so
worried about earth?

117
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,083
You're a Dragon after all.

118
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,500
Well...

119
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,041
I couldn't care less
if humanity lives or dies,

120
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,750
so it makes absolutely
no difference to me

121
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,166
if the earth is destroyed.

122
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,666
What?

123
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,083
Human beings are only capable
of thinking of themselves,

124
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,833
mankind is nothing more

125
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,791
than a group of
loathsome, foolish apes.

126
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,750
How can you say
something like that?

127
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,375
Aren't you a human being?

128
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,041
Yes, very observant of you;
but I am a chosen human.

129
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,666
A being that stands alone at
the very peak of all humanity.

130
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,875
All life everywhere
is completely equal.

131
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,125
There are no lives of
greater or lesser importance.

132
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,083
And in my heart of hearts

133
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,291
I know that humans
aren't the foolish,

134
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,875
self-centered creatures
you think that they are.

135
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,416
Wow.

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,958
A Dragon,
speaking up for humans.

137
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,916
It's true that
sometimes people

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,666
let their worst
instincts dominate them,

139
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,125
but that doesn't mean
that all humans are all bad.

140
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,125
I have felt, in
the depths of my soul,

141
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,000
the pure love that
humans are capable of!

142
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,708
Love, huh?

143
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,833
Even in the most
difficult situations,

144
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,041
when they must protect
someone they care for,

145
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,125
they'll sacrifice themselves
without hesitation.

146
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,875
Love can redeem them.

147
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,333
And sometimes it gives
rise to unimaginable power.

148
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,958
Of course.

149
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,875
But it also drives good
people to do bad things.

150
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,291
Therefore even love is
tainted by man's ugly nature.

151
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,291
It does have an ugly side.

152
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,250
But it has beauty too.

153
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,208
Love must have both sides.

154
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,791
It's all a part of what
it means to be a human.

155
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,708
Sometimes it gives
rise to great power?

156
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,791
When you said that
you weren't talking

157
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,875
about Jin Kamishina
by any chance?

158
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,000
How do you know about Jin?

159
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,958
I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

160
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,250
He will be here very soon.

161
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,250
No, that's impossible.

162
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,000
There's no way that
Jin could know I'm here.

163
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,708
Your Highness.

164
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,791
The boy is almost here.

165
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,666
Are you ready?

166
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,166
Everything is in place.

167
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,500
Looks like he'll
be landing shortly.

168
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,250
Jin is actually coming here?

169
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,000
You told me that love
gives rise to great power.

170
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,250
Well I think that now
would be a perfect opportunity

171
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:46,916
to prove that
to your prince.

172
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,458
I'm picking up a guidance
signal coming from Mars.

173
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,666
This feels like some
sort of Gillard trap.

174
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, that's exactly
what it feels like.

175
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,416
Whadaya think?

176
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,791
Should we turn around.

177
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,208
We're going in.

178
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,458
There's no way I'm turning back.

179
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,708
I was hopin' you'd say that.

180
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,125
Man! I'm so bored.

181
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,833
How long are we
gonna sit around like this?

182
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,291
I want to attack!

183
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,291
Howlingstar,
you've got to be patient.

184
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:42,125
But I'm starting to soften up.

185
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,666
I wonder.

186
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,708
Are those two
safely together yet?

187
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
Targets will be in
firing range momentarily.

188
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,916
They don't stand a chance.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,833
They'll be space
dust after this.

190
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,166
The targets are now
within firing range.

191
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,458
Fire!

192
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,583
I guess they must've heard
about how much I like fireworks!

193
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,875
All right Gio.

194
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,125
Let's go!

195
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,583
Blocks 3 and 4
have been disabled!

196
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,791
Blocks 7 and 8 have
been disabled as well!

197
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,375
I want the Agathions sent now.

198
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,791
Jin! Incoming!

199
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
We're going
through them, alright?

200
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,583
Akira! That's how
we're doing this!

201
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,333
Alright!

202
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,375
Don't let them near the dome!

203
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,416
[alarm beeping]

204
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:09,958
Akira!

205
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,625
[alarm beeping]

206
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,666
We'll be fine! Just go!

207
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,458
I know you will.

208
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,333
That's right.

209
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,625
Just keep going, Jin!

210
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,666
Guess it's now or never Machina.

211
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,083
Bravo, I'm impressed.

212
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,625
[TOA] Gio...

213
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,500
[ASIM smirks]

214
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,125
Activating emergency bulwarks!

215
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,208
The main lobby is damaged
and we've spotted two intruders!

216
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,125
Toa! I need your help now!

217
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,208
You've got to tell
me where you are!

218
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm here!

219
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,083
Oh, I don't believe I've
ever seen that expression.

220
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,750
I must say. That is fascinating.

221
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,750
I can't wait to see what kind
of expression you show me next.

222
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,833
I wait with bated breath.

223
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,958
[GIO screams in agony]

224
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,583
CSS!

225
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,875
Gio!

226
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,208
[ASIM laughs evily]

227
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,666
Well hello there,
and welcome to my castle.

228
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,291
My name is Asim.

229
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm the one in
charge around here.

230
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,875
Where is Toa?

231
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,625
The captive princess is
at the tippy-top of the tower.

232
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,500
If you want her back
you have no choice

233
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,791
but to come up here
and get her.

234
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,083
I sincerely hope
you make it in one piece.

235
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,125
[ASIM laughs maniacally]

236
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:34,041
[GIO roars]

237
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,958
Gio! Are you okay?

238
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,958
Yeah, I think I'll be alright.

239
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,666
[JIN gasping for breath]

240
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,541
Jin!

241
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,666
Oh. Look at that oaf.

242
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,250
Can't you see
how foolish he looks?

243
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,291
No Asim. You're the fool.

244
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,875
[TOA] You think
you're above it all,

245
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,666
yet you take pleasure
in causing people

246
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,291
pain and suffering?

247
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,625
You are the most
despicable creature of all.

248
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:28,083
[ASIM] Aw. You can make an
angry face too. How beautiful.

249
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,625
[GIO] Go on Jin!

250
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,416
Toa!

251
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,833
[JIN yelling]

252
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,791
Jin no!

253
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,000
[GIO]
Get out of our way!

254
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,666
Gio!

255
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,625
You, caught me.

256
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,666
Hang on.

257
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,833
Please! Make this stop!

258
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,500
When it comes
to Jin Kamishina,

259
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:39,583
you really do show a wide
variety of expressions!

260
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,083
Almost as though
you were a person.

261
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,041
Toa!

262
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,000
Toa!

263
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,458
Jin!

264
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,583
I'm impressed
you made it this far.

265
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,791
The power of love.

266
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,666
Apparently it's not
completely untrue.

267
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,875
I want you to let
her out, right now!

268
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,250
Let her out yourself.

269
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:31,666
Jin!

270
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,416
You coward!

271
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,833
Stay away from His Majesty!

272
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,541
Outta my way!

273
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,833
Toa.

274
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,791
The power of true love
doesn't seem very powerful.

275
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,208
Asim! Please stop!

276
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,625
That's more like it.

277
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,750
Jin!

278
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,375
Isn't this just incredible?

279
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,291
Who could have possibly guessed
that the power of your love

280
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,541
would keep me so
thoroughly entertained?

281
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:20,208
Oh goodness.

282
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,375
It appears the brave lover
has lost consciousness.

283
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,458
Let her go.
Let her go right now.

284
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,416
Filthy dog.

285
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,958
Stop it now!

286
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,541
That isn't possible!

287
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,375
How is she breaking
reinforced glass in a CSS field?

288
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,291
Hang on I'm coming your Majesty!

289
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,000
Toa.

290
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,666
Jin.

291
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,625
You're here.

292
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,416
I had to come for you.

293
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,458
Thank you, Jin.

294
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,166
You did it.

295
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,875
[ASIM laughing]
The power of love, huh?

296
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,041
Fascinating. Truly fascinating!

297
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,083
Ryoko here.

298
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,791
Have you guys ever
found a stray kitten?

299
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,750
'Cause I just
found one myself.

300
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,791
Saki here.

301
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,250
I just found a stray puppy!

302
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,583
Oh yeah?

303
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,708
Both of you are such pushovers,
I found this guy.

304
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,500
Whoa, is that a giant crocodile?

305
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,000
Megumi, where did you find it?

306
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,875
He chased me here! Help!

307
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,375
Gah! Don't come over here!

308
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,500
Wait!

309
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,208
Do the preview
before you run away!

310
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,458
Huh?

311
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,083
Next time, who'd
have thought that such a thing

312
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,583
would be in such a place?

313
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,666
Run!
