1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,666
Toa is coming with me.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,000
It is the only way to rescue her
from the fate thrust upon her.

3
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,875
But, Gio.

4
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,666
There is no more time.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,583
You cannot save Toa.

6
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,583
If Toa goes back to Thanatos,
will she be able to live longer?

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,750
Yes.

8
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:39,708
Will she--?

9
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,958
However...

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,541
Toa will never come
back to this planet.

11
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,875
We'll return to Thanatos.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,708
And then we'll travel back
into space once again.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,666
She'll never
be coming back?

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,500
I grant the two of you
one last day.

15
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,583
The approach of Thanatos
is causing many changes.

16
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,500
Strange phenomena are
occurring all over Earth.

17
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,666
In response, the UN crisis
management administration

18
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,125
has declared a special
state of emergency.

19
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,833
This morning they
requested the ISDA

20
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,791
and Gillard space force
to launch an attack.

21
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,958
Dragon Slayer arming complete.

22
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,708
Excellent, all ships,
prepare to attack.

23
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,625
Attack sir?

24
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,000
But sir, we're
supposed to be

25
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,333
in a joint operation
with the Avenir.

26
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,750
You expect me to wait around
for those stupid cowards?

27
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,416
Thanatos, we're
going to destroy you.

28
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,166
Fire!

29
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,750
Results incoming, damage
from first attack is minimal,

30
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,333
the target remains sir.

31
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,291
That's impossible.

32
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,625
Roughly 28% of the fleet
has been destroyed by Thanatos!

33
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,458
They are going
to continue the attack.

34
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,833
Idiots.

35
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,458
They jumped the gun.

36
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,708
The operation is a failure.

37
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,666
Please, remain calm!

38
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,041
The fallout shelters outside of
Tokyo can accommodate everyone!

39
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,125
We're receiving reports
that the Gillard Army,

40
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,583
having carried out
its attack, took heavy damage,

41
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,458
and the situation grows
more serious by the minute.

42
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,416
Toa.

43
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,291
Is she doing alright?

44
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,458
Yeah, she's
resting at the moment.

45
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,291
Good.

46
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,750
Here, I brought some medicine.

47
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,041
Oh, uh, thanks Sigelinde.

48
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,875
It's medicine that's supposed
to be for humans, though.

49
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,083
Please be sure to read
the instructions carefully

50
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,958
before giving any to her.

51
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,208
Hey, wait!

52
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,333
Hold on!

53
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,500
What do you think
you're doing, Amadeus?

54
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,875
We were about to give
Toa some of that medicine.

55
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,666
You know it is unlikely
to do her any good.

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,583
Yeah I know that.

57
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,125
But they need our help.
We can't just do nothing.

58
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,541
I agree but let them have this
time for themselves, Young Miss.

59
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,208
Shall we go?

60
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,791
Yeah.

61
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,750
It sure is huge, we've never
fought anything like it before.

62
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,291
We're not going there
to engage in battle.

63
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,375
We're going there as diplomats,
so we can remind Thanatos

64
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,750
that humans and dragons
can live peacefully.

65
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,916
I'm confident.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,583
I know our message
will get through to Gio.

67
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
Well then, it sounds
like we have no choice

68
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,250
but to accompany you.

69
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,791
We want to tell it, Raina.

70
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,375
Our kinds do
have a future, together.

71
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,083
And if it gives
you any backtalk

72
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,625
after you go all
the way up there,

73
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,125
we'll be right behind
you to back you guys

74
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
up and make
that thing listen.

75
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,125
Yes, you can count on us.

76
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,583
Remember, we might
not come back from this.

77
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,541
We're all in this together.

78
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,500
There's no time to be scared.

79
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,333
Alright then.

80
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,958
[JIN] Are you going?

81
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,458
I am.

82
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,916
All ships, fire.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
Fire and unleash hell!

84
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,833
It's so pointless.

85
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,541
It would be impossible
for the humans

86
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,833
to have the power
to strike at Thanatos.

87
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,875
The two of you
have merged

88
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,208
with Thanatos, Akira. Machina.

89
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,875
We are the ones
you once referred to

90
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,750
as Akira and Machina.

91
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,708
However those names
are meaningless to us now.

92
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,166
I'm a spirit of Thanatos.

93
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,208
One of a countless number of
minds that have merged with it.

94
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,916
It's sad, they are
unable to rid themselves

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,958
of fear except by
drowning it in violence.

96
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,666
They can't help it.

97
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,583
Humans are fallible creatures

98
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,416
who are only able
to hurt themselves,

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,958
and show nothing
but hate to everyone else.

100
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,166
Why don't you get it?

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,333
Now is the time for
mankind to join forces

102
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,083
and launch an attack
against Thanatos!

103
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,041
We won't send our
soldiers against a foe

104
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,666
we don't know
anything about.

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,375
Didn't you start this?

106
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,708
Your organization
brought this terror upon us.

107
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,000
The Gillard Army
should take care of it.

108
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,583
If you want to accuse us of
being responsible for this,

109
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,333
you have to think about
surviving this first.

110
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,041
If Thanatos strikes us,
the other side of the Earth

111
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,375
isn't going to come
away unscathed after all.

112
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,208
What I want to
know is if the mighty

113
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,625
Gillard space force
can't beat this thing.

114
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,875
How do you suppose
the military forces

115
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,666
from the rest of the world be
of any use to this struggle?

116
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,500
Don't fret.

117
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,791
We still have
an ace in the hole.

118
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,291
Understood.

119
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,625
We will begin prepping the
Annihilator Module for launch.

120
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,541
To them, Dragons are
of a different nature.

121
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,208
Thus, they don't even
try to understand them,

122
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,833
they just use them
as implements of war.

123
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,666
You're saying our
contact with humans

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,708
was nothing more than a mistake?

125
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,416
But, you still
like them, am I right?

126
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,583
Just as humans have learned
many things from Dragons.

127
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,750
Dragons have also gained
something important,

128
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,708
the knowledge of souls.

129
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,750
It was by going through
Resonance with humans

130
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,625
that Dragons first
discovered what a soul was.

131
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,041
Gio, that goes for you, too.

132
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,791
[GIO thinking]
She's right.

133
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,125
If I had not come in contact
with the human soul.

134
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,708
I wouldn't be able
to be in this form.

135
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,541
Nor would I have ever
known these feelings.

136
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,583
I'm coming for you!

137
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,708
Jin, Toa.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,541
You're awake.

139
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,375
Jin.

140
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,583
How's the pain? Is it gone?

141
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,458
Uh huh.

142
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,916
I feel great!

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:33,291
Then, shall we go?

144
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,416
Jin...

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you remember,
the first day we met?

146
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,458
I'll never forget it.

147
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,166
[JIN] How could I forget?

148
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,500
Toa, it was because of you
that I could go on living.

149
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:17,541
Jin, at this moment,
I couldn't be any happier.

150
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,666
And I am not alone, Toa.

151
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,125
Jin, I'm so
glad I met you.

152
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,541
[WIDOW gasps]

153
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,791
So, you're finally awake?

154
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,208
You think you're really
something, don't you?

155
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,208
Kazuki...

156
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,166
Your time's almost up.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
Make the most of it guys.

158
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,500
Are you absolutely sure that
you don't want to say goodbye?

159
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,958
Sieglinde, you do
have feelings, right?

160
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,458
What?

161
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,291
Not in a million years would
I like that little man okay?

162
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,708
Oh, I'm sorry I
was only suggesting

163
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,791
that you have feelings
for the both of them.

164
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,750
You tricked me!

Come, Miss Sieglinde.

173

Yeah, yeah, I know.

Let's go, Amadeus!

175

Bye, guys.

176
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,125
You're impossible;
you go to kill Toa

177
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,666
and yet you almost
get yourself killed.

Get the hell up already!

181
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,875
The only thing you're
good for is fighting.

182
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,166
I don't know why
I put up with you.

183
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,625
An emergency evacuation
advisory has just been issued.

184
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,708
We would ask anyone who
is watching this broadcast

185
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,750
that if you have
not yet taken shelter...

186
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,875
I wish we could
stay here, forever.

187
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,750
Frozen in time like this.

188
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,333
Toa, don't worry.

189
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,083
It's alright,
you aren't going to die.

190
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,958
[TOA gasps] So, you
knew this entire time?

191
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,333
We must leave.

This time for sure, this time
for sure I'll hunt them down.

194
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,083
I swear it.

195
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:16,000
Please, let's bring
an end to this right now.

196
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Kazuki, I'm sorry I never
understood you, how you felt.

197
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,291
You loved Jin, didn't you?

198
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,416
If that's true,
then listen to me.

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,416
Please stop this,
You're only hurting yourself.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,250
You need to set yourself free.

201
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,875
It would have been better

202
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,333
if I had gone through
Resonance with you.

203
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,291
It would have been easier.

204
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,291
To understand.

205
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,166
We're going back
to Thanatos, Toa.

206
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,041
But, I can't.

Please, don't!

208
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,416
Toa, you must understand,

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
this is the only
way to save you!

210

Please, no!

211
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,708
I don't want to go!

212
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,875
I want to be right
next to you, Jin!

213
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,333
Until my very last breath!

214

Please.

215
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,541
Take care of her, Gio.

216
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,416
No!

Are you ok?

222
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,625
I want to know
where Toa is.

223
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,541
Gio took her
back to Thanatos.

224
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,083
I'm alone,
all over again.

225
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,125
So he saved Toa,
but allowed Widow to die?

226
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,916
What are you...?

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,250
Tell me!

228
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,250
Why did it end up like this?

229
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,250
I needed Gio, so I could
use him to protect you, Jin!

230
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,208
He was...
the perfect dragon for me!

231
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,583
Gio was pure power and it
was all to protect you, Jin!

232
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,791
Why did he
have to kill Widow?

233
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,583
It's all your fault!

234
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,083
Why did you do this?

235
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,333
I've lost everything
because of you

236
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,916
and what you stole from me!

lost everything!

You dumb ass!

Toa isn't human.

She's just a Dragon!

matter, I love Toa!

one else understands.

tell her, thank you,

or sorry...
or even goodbye...

to go through this anymore.

328
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,958
I'm going to
stay behind Kazuki.

329
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:07,625
Watching you, I decided
that when the time came,

330
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:13,750
I was going to face
myself, and not run away.

331
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,250
I think that maybe
the act of Resonance

332
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,583
was a chance that was actually
given to me by Thanatos.

333
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,250
Communicators are our desires,
given physical form.

334
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,458
In other words, they are
what we've come to seek,

335
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,791
as well as what we
should strive to be.

336
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:35,250
When we accept Resonance,
and can finally face ourselves.

337
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:39,958
We might be able to overcome
our indecision and our past.

338
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,750
That's the answer
I was finally able to see

339
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,541
after taking it for
granted for so long.

340
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,083
Alright then.

341
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:51,500
Go on, and seek
your own answers!

342
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,291
Understood.

343
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,166
Start roll!

344
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,750
Right up to the end...

345
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,083
You have always
been there for me.

346
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,166
You are free now.

347
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,625
You may go wherever you like.

348
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:24,625
I want to stay here, with you.

349
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:36,833
You're my daddy, always.

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,375
You still call me your... Dad?

351
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,458
Even after
everything I've done.

352
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:52,875
Thank you, Laura.

353
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,208
I love you.

354
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,041
I'll carry the
anti-Thanatos factor

355
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,291
and use myself
in your place.

356
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,250
Things sure have
taken an incredible turn!

357
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,041
I wonder what's
going to happen next!

358
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,500
It's times like this
we turn to fortune telling.

359
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,958
I've been training out
in front of the train station.

360
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,333
Sounds shady!

361
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm getting something!

362
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,666
I see a rubber band,
and golden, downy hair!

363
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,375
Well what do
you think it means?

364
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,791
What it means is, next time,

365
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,250
the Earth gets
in a tight squeeze!

366
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,875
How did you get that?
