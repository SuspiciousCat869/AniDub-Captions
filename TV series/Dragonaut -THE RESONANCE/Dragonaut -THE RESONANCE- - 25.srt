I have to admit
that seeing it

that came out of a dream.

were we thinking?

We believed we
could defeat that?

That look on your face

strong down here, too.

Ko...

12
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,625
Raina, I've got
an estimate for

13
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,541
the number of Ostrums
we're dealing with.

14
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,458
If my calculations are correct,
then Thanatos is sending

15
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,250
somewhere in neighborhood

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,000
of 6 billion Ostrums
down to Earth.

17
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,250
6 billion?

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,333

to force all of mankind

so it can absorb them.

20

It's a human wave tactic.

Then again,
since they're Dragons

22
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,083

a "Dragon-wave" tactic.

Yes.

What reasons could they have

to justify such
stubborn resistance?

83
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,041

These are the
emotions they feel.

93

Those primitive
sensations are the result

of being locked inside
the feeble mental framework

Why can't they simply
understand and accept that?

100
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:46,291
Perhaps it is
exactly because

101
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,375
their vessels and
the memories that fill them

102

I felt after going

118
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,375
I wondered if
the emotions we felt

119
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,125
were brought
about by Resonance.

120

And if that's the case
then the adoration

Which would mean
the love we have

been taken from us?

I realized something.

128
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,041
It doesn't matter
whether these feelings

129
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,916
for our partners
are the result of Resonance

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,125
or they come forth naturally.

131
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,208
The most important
thing is that the love

132
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,833
exists and you must
never ignore it.

133

Why would you do
something so rash?

00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,791
The Moon.

166
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,333
The Aegis.

167
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,458
It's destroyed.

168
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,333
We've got Ostrums closing in!

169
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,500
Take evasive action at once!

170
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,500
Bastards!

171
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,916
Keep walking we'll see
Thanatos' mind up ahead.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,791
Wait.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,958
It appears you are
still alive, Ostrum.

174
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,958
I've been waiting patiently.

175
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,666
For you, Gio.

176
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,375
Wait how is this
guy still alive?

177
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,041
I thought we
already defeated him!

178
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,041
You two should
go ahead without me.

179
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,750
I'd like to handle him myself.

180
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,333
But, Gio!

181
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,791
Hurry up.

182
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,458
See you soon.

183
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,166
Last time we met,
you humiliated me.

184
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,291
Now I'll get my
revenge for that.

185
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,083
How very appropriate.

186
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,083
You sound just like the
beaten-down dog that you are.

187
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,208
I've had enough!

188
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:22,500
Okay one down and
1,999,999,999 to go.

189
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,708
Guess we'd better get
started on the next one.

190
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,708
Young Miss, are you all right?

191
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,000
Speak to me.

192
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,375
Don't worry about me, Amadeus.

193
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,125
Itsuki! Otohime!

194
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,375
Sieglinde! Itsuki!

195
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,458
Howlingstar!

196
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,083
Easy there partner.

197
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,666
What's with
the gloomy expression?

198
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Get it together.

199
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,458
You look like
you're about to cry.

200
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't be absurd.

201
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,541
Let's take a quick breather

202
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,333
then we can get back
to winning this battle.

203
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,541
What do you say guys?

204
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,458
Yes.

205
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,166
Sounds good.

206
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,333
Yeah I'm in.

207
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,958
What the?

208
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,375
Are all of those?

209
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,333
Ostrums!

210
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,375
[OSTRUM and GIO grunting]

211
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,833
Why the struggle?

212
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,166
Why not just give in
and follow Mother's will?

213
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,208
You are already
a part of Mother aren't you?

214
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,666
Garnet! You're back!

215
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,458
Why is it you're so attached

216
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,333
to the human being
standing next to you.

217
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
I want to know.

218
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,208
Because I love him.

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,458
That is indeed
a fascinating reply.

220
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,541
But now I have to question you.

221
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,166
To ascertain
if that feeling is real.

222
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,208
There is no
greater feeling

223
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:54,375
than to give all that you
are and merge with Mother.

224
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,750
Jin, be careful okay?

225
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,416
I will and thanks for
coming down here Kazuki.

226
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,791
I should prob'ly go now.

227
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,458
Take a nice long look
at Earth for me would ya?

228
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,208
Sure!

229
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,958
Kazuki.

230
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,916
Widow.

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,041
Looks like
somebody's got a hot date!

232
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,958
C'mon man you know
it's not like that!

233
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,750
Whoa there tiger!

234
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,416
Simmer down!

235
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,125
Knock it off would you?

236
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,500
[MACHINA] Toa,
it's there somewhere.

237
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,125
You've got to find
your seatbelt!

238
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:52,250
[TOA yelling]

239
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,333
Hey! Big Brother,
that's not very gentlemanly.

240
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,750
Oh gosh, I'm sorry.
[JIN stammering]

241
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,666
Oh, uh...

242
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,208
It's fine!

243
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,833
[AI giggling]

244
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,041
Toa, you've found yourself
quite a handsome seatbelt.

245
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,291
Not now Sis!

246
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,500
It's not like that!

247
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,583
Yeah!

248
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,333
Stop saying stuff
like that, please!

249
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,875
Okay.

250
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,916
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

251
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,583
No, it's me who
should be apologizing.

252
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,541
What's wrong?

253
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,083
Is there something the matter?

254
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,166
This isn't right.

255
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,750
What is it Big Brother?

256
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
What's going on?

257
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,041
You look upset.

258
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,208
Are you okay Jin?

259
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,708
No.

260
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,791
None of this is
actually happening.

261
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,416
My mother is long gone.

262
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,208
My sister too.

263
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,750
Big Brother.

264
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,458
Jin.

265
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,208
What's the matter?

266
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,041
Is everything okay, Jin?

267
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,333
This is some
sort of elaborate

268
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,291
fantasy world
created by Thanatos

269
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,333
of how I wish
things would've happened.

270
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,791
[TOA] Jin.

271
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,500
Jin!

272
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,625
[JIN yelling]

273
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,083
Jin, thank goodness
you realized it was a lie.

274
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,791
I heard your voice in there.

275
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,458
Thank you for bringing
me back to my senses.

276
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,833
Why?

277
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,833
Once you submit
to merging with Mother

278
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,541
you will instantly be released
from all of your suffering.

279
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,708
Why can't you understand
that that is not what we want?

280
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,666
I will only explain this once.

281
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,208
By going through
Resonance we have gained

282
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,125
something we
will never give up.

283
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,000
It has changed us
on a fundamental level

284
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,375
and that change is
coming upon you too.

285
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,333
I will never accept that!

286
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
I will never be like you!

287
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,458
We were changed
forever when we went

288
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,833
through Resonance
with humans.

289
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,875
We now have souls that
allow us to care for others.

290
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,666
Is that something we need?

291
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,000
Is that
necessary for our kind?

292
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm fortunate that
I was born on this world.

293
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,875
Because now I have a soul.

294
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,125
I know of love,

295
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,375
and got to experience
life with Jin and Toa.

296
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,833
Could that be it then?

297
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,875
Could the only difference
between you and me, be a soul?

298
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,583
As humans we know
we aren't perfect.

299
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,791
We go through life

300
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,750
dealing with the
imperfections that we have.

301
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
And yes, sometime
it can be painful,

302
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,541
but that's what
it is to be alive.

303
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,083
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

304
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,583
Having all of that
experience taken away.

305
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:20,708
Then becoming a single entity.

306
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
That sure sounds an awful
lot like loneliness to me.

307
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,875
Like living in a void.

308
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:24,791
What do you mean?

309
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,208
With every fiber of my being,

310
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,666
I love the gentleness in
Jin's eyes when he looks at me.

311
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,250
And I love his voice,
I can't think of a better sound.

312
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,333
He's my everything.
I love him so much.

313
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,666
That feeling is
nothing but the result

314
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,375
of your Resonance
with each other!

315
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,291
No. It isn't.

316
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,791
I can feel it in my heart that
even without Resonance.

317
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,625
I would still love him.

318
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:51,250
And I love her, solely
because of who she is.

319
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:57,375
So neither one of us
has any need to merge.

320
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,166
We are not alone.

321
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,333
What's this?

322
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,125
Are you saying
that I'm all alone?

323
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,250
How could you have not known.

324
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,583
But, I'm...

325
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,541
What the?

326
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,333
Mother?

327
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,166
Are you Thanatos?

328
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,333
Victory is yours human.

329
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
It would seem
that I have spent

330
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,333
far too much time alone
in the emptiness of space.

331
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,958
I have forgotten the pure,

332
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,083
essential truth that
two hearts can share.

333
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,166
I will consider
what it means to love.

334
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,958
I think she's.

335
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,375
Mother, are you smiling?

336
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,958
What the hell is going on?

337
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,625
It seems pretty obvious.

338
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,875
Those two lovebirds up
there just saved the world.

339
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,500
Oh Young Miss!

340
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,916
Isn't that the most wonderful
news you've ever heard.

341
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,500
Thanatos is going away.

342
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,125
Someday, many eons from now I
shall visit this world again.

343
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,125
When I return, I don't know

344
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,416
whether it will be
you humans who greet me,

345
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,708
or those who have
inherited this world from you.

346
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,791
Only time will tell.

347
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,583
But if it is you,
and you nurture the hearts

348
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,166
you have beating
in your chests,

349
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:34,000
I know that there is no chance
I will be disappointed.

350
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,208
Jin!

351
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,875
Farewell Gio.

352
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:01,500
We are...

353
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,958
We are...

354
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,458
Not alone.
