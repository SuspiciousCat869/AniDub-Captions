1
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,791
I'd say we cut it pretty close.

2
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,500
Not a very subtle tactic.

3
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,166
Well take a moment to think.

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,291
There wouldn't be
any witnesses up here.

5
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,208
They can make up whatever story
they want to explain the fire.

6
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,541
But how did they know
about this place?

7
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,916
[YONAMINE]
If I was able to find you,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,166
it was only a matter of
time before ISDA caught up.

9
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,666
They're bound to find out
that cabin was empty.

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,416
They'll be looking for us soon.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,958
Where do we go now?

12
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,583
We're going to Tokyo.

13
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,166
[JIN] How can we really hide
with all these people around?

14
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,541
If you're trying to hide a
tree put it in the forest.

15
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,916
If you're trying to hide a
person put it in the city.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,166
Sneaking around will only
draw their attention.

17
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,750
Trust me nobody's seen you.

18
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,250
You're way too self-conscious.

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,125
You should really
work on fixing that.

20
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,750
I'll get right on that.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,250
[YONAMINE] There's another
reason that we came to Tokyo.

22
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,250
Right now, Tartarus is one

23
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,333
of the more heavily secured
facilities that ISDA controls.

24
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,000
It won't exactly be a cakewalk
getting in to that place.

25
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,291
We'll need to make all
sorts of preparations

26
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,416
to execute this
mission properly.

27
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
It's not like ISDA is
just going to let us

28
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,000
take their usual ferry
out to the island right?

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,833
You are so dumb,
little man.

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,416
What I mean is...

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,291
We'll come by more information
and the necessary illegal goods

32
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,041
where there are lots
of people around.

33
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,208
After all, it won't do any good

34
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,666
if we're not
completely ready to act,

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,875
and we wind up
getting caught.

36
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,916
So you know of
a hideout in Tokyo

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
where they won't
be able to find us?

38
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,708
It's going to be
extremely difficult

39
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,500
to keep ourselves completely
hidden from ISDA, even in Tokyo.

40
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,833
[JIN] So then...

41
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,333
In the event
that they do find us,

42
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,666
our only hope is to be

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,750
somewhere they
wouldn't dare strike.

44
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,708
Does a place
like that even exist?

45
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,833
Yes it does.

46
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,875
Wait a minute you're
not talking about...

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,250
This is the place?

48
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,708
This is the Baumgard
family home?

49
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,625
"Little man" goes for
that brain of yours too.

50
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,083
Geez you're dumb.

51
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,041
Do you honesty think that
my family estate is in Japan?

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,333
[YONAMINE] The Baumgards
are one of the oldest

53
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,000
and most powerful noble
families in Germany.

54
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,708
Your mansion is in
Nuremburg as I recall.

55
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,166
[SIEGLINDE]
That's right.

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,125
This is just the
vacation house

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
that we use when
we stay in here.

58
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,833
Vacation house?

59
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,875
I didn't stutter.

60
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,208
This isn't a house.
It's a castle.

61
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,583
Good to see you Young Miss.

62
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,791
Welcome home.

63
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,375
It's huge.

64
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
Hey.

65
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,375
Up there.

66
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,416
Is that Amadeus?

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,458
The name of the man in
the portrait is Alfred.

68
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,375
That gentleman was
the beloved grandfather

69
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,875
of Lady Sieglinde, sir.

70
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,666
That's her Grandfather?

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,708
I guess we're mistaken.

72
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,833
It's been a long time Sieglinde.

73
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,041
You seem so surprised to see me.

74
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,041
You do know you're not the only
person who uses this mansion.

75
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,416
He has a business
meeting here in Japan.

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,458
He arrived this morning.

77
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,708
That's the current head
of the Baumgard family.

78
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,333
The great Wilhelm Baumgard.

79
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,791
I guess that would make him
Sieglinde's father then.

80
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:56,791
So, have you eaten dinner?

81
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,416
Not yet.

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,416
But I don't feel
like eating.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,291
I wasn't asking you I
was asking your friends.

84
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,333
You really must be
more considerate.

85
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,666
You should always offer
your guests refreshments.

86
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,416
Forgive me Father but
I must excuse myself

87
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,458
for remainder of the evening.

88
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,208
Hey.

89
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,958
If you leave now you'll
have nowhere else to go.

90
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,625
Just stay.

91
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:22,583
You and your friends
will be safe here.

92
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,666
Are you saying you will be
kind enough to hide us?

93
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,375
Of course I will.

94
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,625
You my dear are the sole
heiress to the Baumgard family.

95
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,875
I have no intention of
handing you over to anyone.

96
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,583
Especially those
reptiles out there.

97
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,458
The Baumgard family has
provided a great deal

98
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,083
of financial support to ISDA.

99
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,500
I assure you they won't bite
the hand that feeds them.

100
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,333
As long as you are
here you'll be safe.

101
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,333
But I'm afraid
that's all I can do.

102
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,458
You understand.

103
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,458
That's fine.

104
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,416
All we really need
is a couple of days.

105
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,625
We can manage the
rest on our own.

106
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,583
Yes I see.

107
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,458
I'm sorry to interrupt
your meal sir.

108
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,875
There was a call from Germany

109
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,666
and I was instructed to
notify you immediately.

110
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,458
If you'll excuse me.

111
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,666
There is some urgent business
that I really must attend to.

112
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you know my father
would be in Japan

113
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,416
when you came up with this
brilliant hiding place?

114
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,833
Of course I didn't.

115
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,250
I have to admit I always knew

116
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,291
you and your family
were well off.

117
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,083
But I didn't know you were
rich enough to finance ISDA.

118
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah well they're not my family.

119
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,500
Sieglinde wait.

120
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,250
An anti-Thanatos factor?

121
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,833
Yes, and once we inject
this anti-Thanatos factor

122
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,916
into the cells we extracted
from the Raum, well.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,250
Please see for yourselves.

124
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,416
Once within the Dragon host,

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,000
the anti-Thanatos factor
causes repetitive

126
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,416
irregular cell growth,
much like cancer.

127
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,458
This quickly undermines
normal cellular development.

128
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,208
This process is fatal
and soon the host dies.

129
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,916
Thanatos is a living being.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,333
And as such this
disease will kill it.

131
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,625
That's all well and good but how
do we get this inside Thanatos?

132
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,125
We would use the Dragons.

133
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,333
Dragons?

134
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

135
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
In order to effectively
utilize the disease

136
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,666
it's necessary that it
be in an active state

137
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,583
when it comes into
contact with Thanatos.

138
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,875
So the first step would
be to expose a Dragon

139
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,458
to the anti-Thanatos factor.

140
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,541
Then we would send the Dragon,
as a host, back to Thanatos.

141
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,208
This would be
a lot like sending

142
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,666
disease-ridden rats
into an enemy camp.

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,375
We would essentially be using
a primitive biological weapon.

144
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,416
I understand.

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,000
But I thought it
was already decided

146
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,916
that we were going to use the
Dragon Slayer against Thanatos.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,333
We are still moving
forward with the operation

148
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,958
that makes use of the
Dragon Slayer as planned.

149
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,833
Why choose just one course.

150
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,750
Our goal is to destroy Thanatos
regardless of the methods.

151
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,000
Indeed it is certainly
to our advantage

152
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:10,041
to have multiple ways of
eradicating the enemy.

153
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
We have already begun
a preliminary round

154
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,666
of experiments with
Howlingstar and Amadeus.

155
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,500
When will you know the results?

156
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:20,375
We've scheduled our first
examination tomorrow.

157
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,041
Tomorrow is the day.

158
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
I can't fall
asleep Sieglinde.

159
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,583
Are you awake?

160
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,875
What is it?

161
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,791
What's it like to
have a father?

162
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,625
I mean how does it feel?

163
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,000
Where did that come from?

164
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,750
I'm curious because I was
created from Thanatos.

165
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,750
So I never had a father or
a mother, I thought I'd ask.

166
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,208
For one thing,
it's no big deal.

167
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,958
Sure if it wasn't for him
I wouldn't have been born.

168
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,583
But that's pretty much it.

169
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,416
We don't live
together or anything,

170
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,666
I mean I hardly
ever even see him.

171
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,083
If he were dead my life honestly
wouldn't change that much.

172
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,958
Just today I caught myself
wishing he wasn't here.

173
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,541
So you don't like
your father huh?

174
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,000
Well if that's what you
think that's fine with me.

175
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,500
What I think is that your
father cares about you.

176
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,750
He is giving you
shelter here Sieglinde.

177
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
He's only protecting me

178
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,750
because I'm the heiress
to the Baumgard family.

179
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,625
Are you certain
of that?

180
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,916
Believe me Toa, my father
has no feelings for me.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,625
He only cares for
the family name.

182
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,083
I guess I just
don't understand it.

183
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,208
Well, I couldn't
explain it to you anyway.

184
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,208
All I know is that I don't
belong in this place.

185
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Where are you going?

186
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,541
I think I'll
go for a walk.

187
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,916
The fresh air might
do me some good.

188
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,208
Toa.

189
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,375
Ah that felt nice.

190
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,083
You should hit the shower.

191
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,000
What the...?

192
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,291
I wonder where Gio went.

193
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,166
[OTOHIME roars]

194
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,166
What's that?

195
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,041
[ITSUKI gasps]

196
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,500
Hang on, Itsuki.

197
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,625
[KITAJIMA] Oh, so you're at the
Baumgard Mansion outside Tokyo?

198
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,333
[YONAMINE] Yeah,
we just had dinner.

199
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,166
I think we're through
the first part of this.

200
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,583
That must be nice.

201
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,291
To wine and dine
at a mansion.

202
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,625
I don't know if nice
is the right word.

203
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,708
Any new
developments at ISDA?

204
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,291
Itsuki Habaragi and Otohime
were taken into custody.

205
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,875
Both of them will be secure on
Tartarus a few hours from now.

206
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,125
So the only dragons left to
capture are Toa and Gio.

207
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,416
The science team has been
acting strange also.

208
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,375
What do you mean?

209
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,875
They've been moving

210
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,500
a lot of people and
equipment to Tartarus.

211
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,041
And that means...

212
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,875
That they must be planning

213
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,125
to use the Dragons
for something.

214
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,166
Well you know how
to contact me.

215
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,625
Wait, just a minute.

216
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,875
What is it?

217
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
I...

218
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,333
Does the lady want
a goodnight kiss.

219
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,083
Maybe...

220
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,750
How is Toa doing?

221
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,208
I'm not sure what you mean.

222
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,958
Is there anything
different about her?

223
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,416
Different? Not really.

224
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,708
Oh. That's good.

225
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,708
No. Don't hang up!

226
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,708
[phone busy signal beeping]

227
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,250
Good night beautiful, mwah.

228
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,500
Professor!

229
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,250
It's your back again!

230
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,208
I'm all right.
It'll pass soon enough.

231
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,708
But...

232
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,833
I said I'm all right.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,416
[GIO] Are you sure you
don't want to tell, Jin?

234
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,791
Yes.

235
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,750
He'll find out
sooner or later.

236
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,375
I know he will.

237
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
It's just...
Not yet.

238
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,875
You don't have much time.

239
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,666
What is it?

240
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,000
What's going on?

241
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
Hey, Gio.

242
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,666
Gio.

243
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,041
What's the matter?

244
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:12,583
Everything's just fine.

245
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,625
I will protect Toa,
no matter what happens.

246
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,041
I wonder here could
he have wandered off to?

247
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,541
Is everything all right sir?

248
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,791
Yes.

249
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,250
Well no.

250
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,041
My friend Gio left our room
and hasn't come back yet.

251
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,708
I'm worried he's lost.

252
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:36,583
So, I was just walking
around trying to find him.

253
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,958
Um...

254
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,041
My father loved this country.

255
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,625
As you can imagine
he was a busy man,

256
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,125
yet he often made time
to visit this estate.

257
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,625
Wow, is that right?

258
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,791
After Sieglinde was born
he always brought her

259
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,666
along on his
Japanese vacations.

260
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,833
He was a very strict father.

261
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,833
I don't remember him ever
making time to play with me.

262
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,916
But he was constantly pampering
that granddaughter of his.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,416
So um, is Sieglinde's
mother still around?

264
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,041
She died soon after
Sieglinde was born.

265
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,791
I'm sorry to hear that.

266
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,916
It was difficult.

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,875
I lied about having a business
meeting here in Japan.

268
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,333
When I heard that Sieglinde
was being pursued.

269
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,583
I thought she might come here
so I decided to wait for her.

270
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,416
If you're not here for business
then why are you here?

271
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,250
I want to help her.

272
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,958
Shouldn't that be reason
enough for me to be here?

273
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,666
So then why don't
you just tell her that?

274
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,291
Don't talk to her
about inheritances

275
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,416
or carrying on
the family name.

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,375
Just come out and tell her
that you're worried about her

277
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,750
and that you want to help
her in any way you can.

278
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,500
I would but I feel certain
that she loathes me.

279
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,291
The only ones she ever
opened her heart to

280
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,333
were my father and Amadeus.

281
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Who is Amadeus?

282
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,125
That was a dog that
we used to have.

283
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:04,458
And now she doesn't have my
father or Amadeus to confide in.

284
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
Once we've made the
necessary preparations.

285
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,750
We're going to break
into the ISDA.

286
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,458
This is going to be
way more dangerous

287
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,500
than anything we've
ever done before.

288
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,458
I should tell you that
there's no guarantee

289
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,916
that any of us will
come back safely.

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
So please tell Sieglinde
how you feel about her.

291
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,125
You may never get
another chance.

292
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,708
True.

293
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,708
But can I ever repair the
damage that's been done?

294
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,666
I'm sorry to interrupt
but this is important.

295
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,500
We won't be able to
take as much time

296
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,000
to prepare for this
as I had hoped.

297
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,166
It sounds like Howlingstar and
the others are in trouble

298
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,625
so we've got no choice but to
move out as soon as possible.

299
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,291
Okay. When?

300
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,166
We'll leave tomorrow
at daybreak.

301
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,208
She's leaving tomorrow?

302
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,041
Itsuki Habaragi and Otohime
are now secured on Tartarus.

303
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,541
I'm on my way back to base.

304
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,708
Excellent work.

305
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,958
Here I was losing
sleep over how to dispose

306
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,166
of you once Thanatos
has been destroyed.

307
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,208
What a convenient tool
you'll turn out to be,

308
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,166
not to mention
you'll die on your own

309
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,416
without any help from me.

310
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,000
[monitor beeping]

311
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,208
Commander.

312
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,166
The anti-Thanatos
factor we injected into

313
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,125
Howlingstar and Amadeus
has been eradicated.

314
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,916
What happened to it?

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,583
The only thing we can
figure is that anti-bodies

316
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,416
within the two of them worked
to destroy the disease.

317
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,208
Their macrophages displayed

318
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,041
a remarkable resistance
to the infection.

319
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,250
You're telling me it was the
result of an Immunoreaction?

320
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,791
Yes sir.

321
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,583
But we didn't observe any
measurable immune reaction

322
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,083
in samples from
the Album or the Raum.

323
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,208
Their dysplasia is proceeding
according to our expectations.

324
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,583
It seems the
anti-Thanatos factor

325
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,666
is only effective
in Original Dragons.

326
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,208
What do you think?

327
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,750
I agree sir.

328
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,958
I think that's
probably safe to assume.

329
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,750
However now that
we've lost the Raum,

330
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,833
unless we capture the Album or
the Atrum and test it on them,

331
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,666
we can't really say for sure.

332
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,500
We still need to
run further tests.

333
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,750
Commander?

334
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
I'll decide on this later.

335
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,833
Then for now I wait.

336
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:35,583
So this disease will only work
on Original Dragons huh?

337
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,750
[laughing]

338
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,083
Well isn't that just perfect.

339
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,916
I'm asking that you
return home at once.

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,833
So you want me to come home
and take over the family.

341
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,416
I always knew
this would happen.

342
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,375
That isn't it!

343
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,083
Please listen Sieglinde.

344
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,208
I want you safe so I'm
asking you to come home,

345
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,666
not as the head of a family.

346
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,541
But as your father.

347
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,666
Do you really
mean that?

348
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,125
[YONAMINE] It's an
old story isn't it.

349
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,083
A girl who hates
her strict father,

350
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,708
but took to her
doting grandfather.

351
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,916
Ha.

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,375
I guess families
are all the same.

353
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,041
It really doesn't matter
if they're rich or poor.

354
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,708
For some reason,
I'm not entirely convinced

355
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,708
that Sieglinde
hates her father.

356
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,875
Yeah I think
you're right.

357
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,708
It's just that she
and her father

358
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,916
are both so unsure
of how to finally

359
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,916
patch things up between
the two of them.

360
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,125
Sometimes it's really tough.

361
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,250
It is tough,
but its worth it.

362
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,166
Let's get out of here.

363
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
Are we going to leave
Sieglinde behind?

364
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,541
Yeah.

365
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,083
But Jin.

366
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,333
I think Sieglinde should
stay right here at home

367
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,416
and live a happy life
with her father

368
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,791
[SIEGLINDE] bWhere do you
get off deciding that for me?

369
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,583
Stupid little man!

370
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,000
You don't wanna stay behind?

371
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
Are you saying the bond
between parent and child

372
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,833
is the most
precious thing of all?

373
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,333
You of all people
ought to know

374
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,708
there are a few things,
that are even more important!

375
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,958
And don't you
dare try to tell me

376
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,916
that deep down you
don't believe that too!

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,333
You listen to me.

378
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,041
I belong with the Dragonauts!

379
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,250
I'm coming with you
to get Amadeus.

380
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,333
I'm glad you said that.

381
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,125
Welcome!

382
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,500
I'd like one ShinOgasawara
sandwich, to go.

383
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,291
I'll have 12 of
the Dragon Burgers.

384
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,166
Wha?

385
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,583
You're gonna eat that many?

386
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,750
Why yes, yes I am.

387
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm terribly sorry,

388
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,041
we discontinued the
Dragon Burger last week.

389
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,333
Hmm.

390
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,166
Ah, well then, one
preview please.

391
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,666
Right!

392
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,750
Next time, there's gonna be a
desperate rescue mission!

393
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,000
Dang!

394
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,833
I forgot my wallet!
