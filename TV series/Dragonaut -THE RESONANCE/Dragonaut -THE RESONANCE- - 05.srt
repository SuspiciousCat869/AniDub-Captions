But in order to understand
last night's events

00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,541
there is something else
we must discuss first.

00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,208
Does everyone
recall the appearance

52

of Thanatos at the edge
of our solar system?

We want to know about
those monsters yesterday!

Thanatos isn't some
harmless drifting asteroid!

57
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,041
It's an extra-terrestrial
life form!

00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,500
The first two giant creatures

59

that appeared yesterday
on the Shinogasawara bridge

60
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,458
are also extra-terrestrial
life forms.

61
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,833
In fact Thanatos
is their origin.

62
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,708
We call them Dragons.

63
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,583
The Dragons that
subsequently appeared

64
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,583
and battled the first
two are earth-born Dragons.

65
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,583
These were created by ISDA

66
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,166
to resist the eminent threat
of Thanatos coming to earth.

67

Now are there any questions?

68
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,000
Earth-born Dragons?

69
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,708
You're going to have
to tell us more than that.

70
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,083
Are you telling us that you've

71
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,708
been raising these
monsters in secret?

72
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,583
They are much more
than just monsters.

00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,041
These creatures are Dragons!

74
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,791
It's critical that we
be proactive in our defense.

75
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,125
These earth-born Dragons
can destroy Thanatos!

76
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,791
Defending Earth is
the purpose of the D Project

77
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,625
and the true mission
of the Dragonauts!

78
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,916
But you told us the Dragonauts

79

were just the next
generation of astronauts!

80

You've been lying
to us this whole time!

Do you believe
this no good liar?

Thanatos is directly
threatening the Earth!

83
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,000
The only hope our planet
has to eliminate

84
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,708

if holding a press conference

95
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,041
so soon was a wise decision.

96

I can assure you

97
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,666
that's what any reasonable
person would have done.

now my responsibility?

101
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,708
Indeed.

102
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,416
I'm afraid ISDA
has too many irons

103
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,833
in the fire to deal
with this situation.

104
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,125
However...

105
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,625
I want to be perfectly clear

106
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,500
that he is to be returned to
us as soon as you catch him.

107

Roger that.

108
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,708
From this point on, The Gillard
Army is under contract

109
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,541
to capture the Dragon, Gio,
and return him to ISDA.

110
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,333
I'm sure it goes without saying

111
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,000
that all of this is
to remain secret, Major.

112
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,333
It's not going to be that easy.

113
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
Another low-grade counterfeit.

114
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,125
I can't believe I still
have to use garbage like this.

115
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,500
Since the press conference,

116
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,791
the truth about the D Project
is out in the open.

117
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,875
Now that we're
declassified those in charge

118
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,375
have decided to speed
up project development.

119
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,250
That means the Lindworm Unit
will be working harder than ever

120
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,250
for the early implementation

121
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,500
of the D Project's
ultimate objective.

122
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,833
Also, the task of
retrieving our lost Dragon Gio

123

to the Gillard Army.

they're being brought in.

125

They don't have
anything to do with us.

126

Yeah Raina.

127
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,625
This is our problem.

128
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,375
We should be taking
care of this ourselves!

129
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,000
These orders are
not up for debate.

130
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,583
Is that clear?

131
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,541
Hey, d'you mind
if I sit with you?

132
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,208
I heard that you
and Jin Kamishina

133
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,083
were childhood friends.

134
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,166
You know Jin said something
to me before he left.

135
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,375
I have to go and find her,
I've got to learn the truth.

136
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,666
Toa's the only one who knows.

137
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,333
That's what he
told me right before

138
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,375
he and Gio left
earth for the moon.

139
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,625
The Album has got
to be on the moon.

140
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,166
You go on ahead.

141
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,625
Yes ma'am.

142
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,916
C'mon. Let's get going.

143
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,250
I don't understand why,

144
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,291
but it seems like Gio
needed to see the Album also.

145
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,750
What I'm trying to
say is that I don't think

146
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,000
Gio left because
he doesn't like you.

147
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,500
So he went to the moon
to see the Album?

148
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,833
Yeah.

149
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,791
So there's no
reason to be upset.

150
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
'Kay?

151

I need to know exactly
what happened with Jin.

152
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,458
Tell me everything you know

153
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,541
about the Album
being on the moon.

154
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,291
Toa is definitely
somewhere here on the moon.

155
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,958
I know.

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,583
I can feel it.

157
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,708
You don't have the right.

158
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,916
Who do you think you are?

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,125
Where are you
planning on taking me?

160
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,833
Silence!

161
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,916

165
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,208
Go on, drink it.

166
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,666
It'll warm you up.

167
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,208
Oh great. Stupid TV.

168
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:39,875
This message is for
the Communicator, Gio.

169
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,750
We are broadcasting
at a special frequency

170
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,125
only you Dragons can hear.

171
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:49,291
You should know that we now
have Jin Kamishina in custody.

172
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,166
If you want him released,

173
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
then surrender to our
forces immediately.

174
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,416
I repeat.

175
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,208
We now have
Jin Kamishina in custody.

176
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,041
Jin!

177
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey, is everything alright?

178
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,416
The city's southwest mining site

179
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,166
will be the location
for the exchange.

180
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,375
That is all.

181
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,833
CSS emission
carriage is on station.

182
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,000
The transmitter for the CSS
signal anchor has been set.

183
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,041
Very good.

184
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,250
Now all we have to do is wait.

185
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,041
Is there anything I can
get for you young man?

186
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,541
Don't play coy.

187
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,291
You're the Gillard Army right?

188
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,083
What do you expect
to get from all this?

189
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,625
If you must know,
you're going to be the bait.

190
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,416
With your help we're going
to catch a very big fish.

191
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,250
I can see what you're doing.

192
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,250
But it won't
make any difference.

193
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
Gio won't come.

194
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,791
He left me behind
and he's not coming back.

195
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,958
You're saying a Communicator
abandoned his Master?

196
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:54,333
You almost had me.

197
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,083
We know the Resonance

198
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,125
between a Master and
a Communicator is absolute.

199
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,583
Not that crap again.

200
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,000
What is this "Resonance"?

201
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,958
Look! I told you don't--

202
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,958
Stop lying to me!

203
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,625
I've had just about
enough of this. Now talk!

204
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,833
Uh-huh!

205
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,875
It's true! I swear!

206
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,208
Yeah? Are you kidding?

207
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,541
Nope! It's totally true!

208
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
Sorry.

209
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,083
Toa.

210
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,416
Has the Lintverm
Unit's punishment

211
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,708
for the Spirytus incident at
Shinogasawara been decided yet?

212
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,041
No not yet.

213
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,625
It was determined
that any punishment

214
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,750
would only
hinder the D Project.

215
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,583
I have to admit I'm quite
relieved to hear that.

216
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,625
Is that all you've
come here to discuss?

217
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:04,416
I heard that the Album
is most likely on the moon.

218
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,791
You could give the order

219
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,125
and dispatch
the Dragonauts immediately.

220
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,041
I've already told you,
from this point on

221
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,833
the Dragonauts' only mission

222
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,833
is to move forward
with the D Project.

223
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,416
What's the matter with you?

224
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Do you want to catch the culprit
of the shuttle accident or not?

225
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,875
Of course, Gio will be
brought to the military

226
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,833
research facility
immediately after capture.

227
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,541
We will however need you to
clean up the mess with ISDA.

228
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:38,583
It is critical that we
get a live communicator.

229
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,708
All we need to do is crack
the Resonance formula.

230
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,375
Once we do that,
then the ISDA will finally.

231
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,625
Target sighted!

232
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,833
Gio is approaching the site!

233
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,291
Here we go. 

234
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,000
Gio.

235
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,958
Well now it would seem to me

236
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,375
that he hasn't
abandoned you just yet.

237
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,541
But why?

238
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,750
Why come back?

239
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
That's it, come.

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,541
Target has entered the airlock.

241
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,625
He'll reach the trap point
in approximately 19 seconds.

242
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,833
Come on. Yes That's good.

243
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,166
Nine seconds
until trap is engaged.

244
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:09,208
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

245
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,458
Turns out if we flood your body
with CSS you can't actualize.

246
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,750
Isn't that just
the darnedest thing?

247
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,541
Men seize the Communicator!

248
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,708
I see you can
still move well enough.

249
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,833
Although I have to say it seems
like you're slowing down a bit!

250
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,333
No, I can't move properly.

251
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,416
Amazing.

252
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
Gio.

253
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,666
Settle down, Communicator.

254
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
No.

255
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,875
Oh man, that was close one.

256
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,958
How can you still fight back
after we raised the CSS levels?

257
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,833
His physical
abilities are so advanced

258
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,416
compared to those of
a normal Communicator.

259
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,708
You maggot!

260
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,333
The CSS! It's hit!

261
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,166
What?

262
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,291
You'll pay for that!

263
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:17,750
Gio!

264
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,166
Let's go, Jin.

265
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,166
Deploy the Agathion!

266
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,250
[alarm wailing]

267
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,291
Agathion, ready for deployment!

268
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,750
A Dragon?

269
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,416
Ready? Here he comes!

270
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
Gio!

271
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,416
Mayday! I've lost control!

272
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,791
Mayday!

273
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,208
The shock has severed my
connection to the Agathion!

274
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,250
[dragon roars]

275
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,916
Without a pilot,
that Dragon is out of control.

276
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,416
There's no way a counterfeit
Dragon could defeat him.

277
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,916
No matter.

278
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,083
I will get my hands
on the Resonance formula.

279
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
What's the matter with you?

280
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,541
Do you want to catch the culprit
of the shuttle accident or not?

281
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,083
Why did you come back for me?

282
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,583
I thought you said you were
going to leave me behind.

283
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,125
What I said was that
if Toa wasn't on the moon

284
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,833
I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you behind.

285
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,625
However.

286
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,083
If she was in fact on the moon.

287
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,291
I said we'd find her together.

288
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,000
Ah!

289
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,000
♪ closing song ♪

290
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,000
Working behind
the scenes is tiring!

291
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,083
We're always in
the command center huh?

292
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,333
Doesn't the command
center seem cold to you?

293
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,500
I'll bet the Commander thinks
it's super stuffy in there.

294
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,875
That guy's as serious
as heart attack huh?

295
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,625
Stop that! It's so rude!

296
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,541
It's okay, everything's fine.

297
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,875
Nobody's listening to us.

298
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,416
No, the mic looks
like it's turned on.

299
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,458
Eh? Um. Um.

300
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,833
Next time!

301
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,208
After missing each other
for so long the two finally.

302
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,916
Uh, I don't think you're
gonna smooth this one over.
