But if the asteroid
ever continued

82
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,250

Earth, the ISDA is working on

Ma'am, the Resonance
is now complete.

166
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,416
Vital signs for both
have returned to normal.

Congratulations

168

Your Resonance was successful.

169
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,083
You are officially
a member of the Dragonauts.

170

Thank you!

[GARNET] Come on?

00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,583
Don't do this.

I want you to say, "please."

You're not real.

Hey.

Oh, so you're still alive.

[JIN THINKING] Why?

00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,208
Why is this happening?

196
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,958
It's the same.

197
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,916
It's just like before.

198
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,666
Yep. It's her. No doubt.

199
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,750
She's the Communicator.

200
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,833
It's Yonamine.

[SAKAKI]
Request granted.

Sir, we need to catch her.
I'm counting on it.

208
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,041
Commander?

209
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,958
The Dragonauts were not
created to be a search team.

210
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,208
However.

211
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,458
Finding the Album is
a different situation.

have gotten away, Miss.

What happened?

215
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,666
That thing attacked me!

216
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,291
And then.

217
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:54,291

I want to make
sure of something.

227
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,125
What?

228
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,541
The three of us are
always together right?

229
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,083
So that makes us a trio,
sharing one body and one mind?

230
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,000
One body and one mind?

231
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,458
How would that even work?

232
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,833
That's only two things
and there're three of us.

233
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,166
That's not what I meant.

234
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,708
Well then explain it to us!

235
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,875
Oh! We're missing the preview!

236
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,958

big's gonna happen!
