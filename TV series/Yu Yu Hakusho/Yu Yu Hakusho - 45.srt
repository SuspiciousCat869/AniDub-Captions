heck happened to his sword?

158
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,583
I think it broke.

159
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,833
[HIEI] I'd rather destroy you
with own hands anyway.

160
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,958
He's in trouble.

00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,250
Hiei!!

162
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,416
[KURO] You still there?

163
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,875
Guess you're probably wondering

164
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,375
how I was able to fend
off your attacks so easily.

165
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,666
Simple, really. My body
does this neat trick

166
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,291
where it remembers the pain
of my opponent's attack.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
All I have to
do to get immunity

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,875
is expose myself to a small
dose of my enemy's offense.

169
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:05,291
Kind of like a flu shot.

170
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,250
[KURO] Once my body knows
what attack to look for.

171
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,791
Then it's time for a
good old Steaming Sphere.

172
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,375
What does that do?

173
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,583
Think of it as a
catalyst for my Beast Armor,

174
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,833
which makes me invincible
to my opponent's attack

175
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,833
and much more handsome to boot!

176
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,166
But, that's not fair!

177
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,833
There's no way Hiei can
beat someone invincible!

178
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,041
The big stupid one's
right about that.

179
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,291
[KOENMA] By golly!
Never seen that!

180
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,625
[KOENMA] Huh?
What's your trauma?

181
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,000
There... Those Steaming
Spheres he's got!

182
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,291
They're the same ones

183
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,125
used to brutally slaughter
my ancestors long ago.

184
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,583
Oh dear ancestors!

185
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,291
How you suffered so!

186
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,916
[KOENMA] This is no time for
misty water-colored nostalgia.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,750
Hiei is in serious danger!

188
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,875
Sometimes I
really hate you...

Come on, let's go!
The guys need our support!

190

This way, ladies,
I know a shortcut!

191
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:03,958
Wait!...

192
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,458
We're forgetting Shizuru.

193
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,458
We don't have time for this!
Your brother could be dying!

194
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,666
Wait a second!
I forgot Puu!

195
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,833
He's still up in the room--
I didn't even leave him water!

196
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,166
Yusuke said that it's
like his other half!

197
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,375
I'll be right back!

198
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,250
Nooo! Oh Puu!

199
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,875
Puu? Where are you? Puu?

200
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,083
[PUU]
Puu!

201
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
[KEIKO]
There you are!

202
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,208
I'm so sorry--
is Yusuke all right?

203
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,541
Puu, Puu.

204
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,375
[GENKAI THINKS] I know that
this pain is severe, Yusuke,

205
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,208
but it's only
going to get worse.

206

You must endure if you're
going to truly succeed me.

207
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,875
Whoa! Hiei?

208
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:30,708
[CROWD CHANTS]
Kill Hiei! Kill Hiei! Kill Hiei!

209
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,666
Come on! Whatcha waiting for?

210
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,416
Where's your famous
Dark Dragon crap?

211
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,416
You want it?

212
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,458
As soon as my body memorizes
your most powerful attacks

213
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,833
I can squash you
in the palm of my hand!

214
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,541
[KURAMA THINKS]
Don't let your ego

215
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,041
cloud your
judgment, Hiei.

216
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,416
[HIEI] Who am I to turn
down a fan's request?

217
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,625
Just remember...

218
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,875
You brought this upon yourself.

219
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,166
Oh no! It looks
like Hiei's gonna call

220
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,708
on the Dragon of the
Darkness Flame again.

221
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,541
Get ready to duck and cover!

222
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,708
Hey! What's the holdup
here, you too weak to do it?

223
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,125
[HIEI] True pain takes
time, my friend.

224
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,541
Just try to keep
yourself amused.

225
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,500
You show him, Hiei!

226
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,458
His memory's not
so sharp after all.

227
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,541
Obviously he's forgotten what
that attack did to the last guy!

228
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,541
Not just him. The flame
took its toll on Hiei.

229
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,666
What?

230
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,750
[KURAMA THINKS]
To summon the Dragon,

231
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,541
Hiei must use his
own Spirit Energy

232
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,166
as bait to lure it from
the pits of Spirit World.

233
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,583
This technique only works

234
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,541
if he can emit a
tremendous amount of energy

235
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,458
for a prolonged period.

236
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
[Onji chuckles]

237
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,583
Yes, you are correct.

238
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,041
Hiei was in peak condition

239
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,541
when he used the
Darkness Flame against Zeru.

240
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,708
And even that wasn't enough
power for him to control it.

241
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,583
The beast nearly took the
hook along with the bait.

242
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,541
[KURAMA] Who knows
how he will fare now,

243
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,708
operating with little
over half of his energy.

244
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,208
That's half?

245
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,708
You're telling me he's making
that much energy at half--

246
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,250
his normal strengh?!

247
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,875
Regardless, he doesn't have
enough energy to unleash it.

248
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,375
With Hiei's
present levels.

249
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,541
The Dragon will devour
our friend in his entirety.

250
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,666
He's right about that.

251
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,916
But the truth of the matter is

252
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,583
that Hiei doesn't
have an option.

253
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,666
Without such a technique,
Kuro won't get a scratch.

254
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,750
Hiei, where is it?

255
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,750
[HIEI]
Here!

Fist of the Mortal Flame!

Hold on--that doesn't
look like a dragon!

258
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,583
It's a related flame,
but of the human world.

259
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,875
[JURI] Hiei seems to have
hit Kuro Momotoro pretty hard

260
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,666
with some sort
of terrible attack!

261
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,041
I decided, why waste
the flame of the underworld

262
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,500
on the likes of you

263
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,708
when the more mundane one
of the humans would suffice?

264
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,333
[Kuro laughs]

265
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,208
I really had you going
there for a second, didn't I?

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,458
[KOTO] It's an
unlikely reversal,

267
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,041
Kuro is back
on his feet!

268
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,166
That Fist of the Mortal Flame
would've sent lesser fighters

269
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,333
running for their mommies,

270
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,125
but not this brick wall!

271
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,041
[KURO] And now I've
memorized this pain, too!

272
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,125
[JURI] Kuro is squeezing another
one of those Steaming Spheres.

273
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,875
I wonder what he's
doing that for?

274
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,750
Could he possibly
get any tougher?

275
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,625
[Kuro laughs insanely]

276
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,041
[KURO] Your
little fist technique is

277
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,500
completely useless against me.

badder than the first one!

chicken to stick around
