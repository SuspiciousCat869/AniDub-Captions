00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,875
I paralyzed him.

159
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,833
Fine, take your time.

160
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,166
This was too dangerous for you
anyway, I'll find him myself.

161
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,458
[KIDO THINKS] No!

162
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,458
[YUSUKE THINKS] Kido's
Territory. He's got my shadow.

163
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,416
I can't move!

164
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,750
Why? Why don't you
want me to go yet?

165
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,208
Unless he knows...

166
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,333
[KIDO THINKS] That's right.
He's here.

167
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,416
But how do I tell
you which one?

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Kido must mean the

169
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,500
killer Doc is in here. But who?

170
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,250
Keep going!

171
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,583
That'll have to
wait, son.

172
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,583
We've decided to
move him to X-Ray.

173
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,708
[KIDO THINKS] No you
don't, not yet.

174
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,500
I have to tell him somehow.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,208
But that doesn't
make any sense!

176
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,708
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Apparently it does, old man.

177
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,125
When you want to say
something bad enough.

178
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,166
He's writing a name!
Ka... mi...

179
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,083
Ya...

180
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,708
[YUSUKE]
Kamiya!

181
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,708
I'll take it that's you.

182
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,916
[THE DOCTOR] I get so tired of
operating on eggshells.

183
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,958
Hey, not to be bitchy, Kido...

184
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,208
...but could you get
off my shadow now!

185
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,333
Now that was cutting it close...

186
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,166
He's blacked out. Guess that's
why his power stopped.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,916
I was instructed to play
the friendly Doctor Kamiya

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,250
for a little longer.

189
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,291
But now that you have come
along, Yusuke Urameshi,

190
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,666
the plan will just
have to quicken.

191
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,958
So, Yusuke's a household name.

192
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,041
Yes it is, at least in the
house that I hang around.

193
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,000
Black Angel says
you've come to wake us

194
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,625
from our sweetest dreams.

195
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,166
[KOENMA] As much as I'm rooting
for humanity's survival...

196
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,041
You've gotta respect
a good villain.

197
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,000
Psychic scalpel, virus
bugs. He's stacked!

198
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,500
I'm a purist...
heroes all the way!

199
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,833
[AYAME]
Koenma, sir.

200
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,250
[KOENMA]
Villians, right?

201
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,166
Yes, as you say, sir. I have
the report you asked for.

202
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,000
We've done a depth
analysis around

203
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,583
the manifesting
tunnel's center-point.

204
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,416
[KOENMA]
And?

205
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,916
The tunnel is indeed placed

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,083
several hundred
meters below surface.

207
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,083
There's an intricate cave
system underneath the city.

208
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,250
It will take some more time
to pinpoint its exact location.

209
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,083
[KOENMA] Well done,
Ayame. Keep me posted.

210
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,291
Yes sir.

211
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,625
Do you like her
more than me?

212
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,666
My ogre puppy, have you
done one useful thing

213
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
since this threat began?

214
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,666
Well uh...

215
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,833
Exactly. You're for comic
relief and drink-serving.

216
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,958
Ayame and Botan are the pros.

217
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,625
I'm sure it's gotten
worse since we came.

218
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,041
I need one of those
zapper porch lights.

219
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,541
What are you talking about?
What's worse??

220
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,041
The insects of Demon World.
You can't see them.

221
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,666
We just have to say my
powers are gone every hour!!!

222
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,666
Botan's right. They've
doubled from yesterday.

223
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,000
[KURAMA] It's the tunnel.

224
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,041
It is expanding at an
extraordinarily fast rate.

225
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,958
I'm probably teasing you
because I'm jealous, Kuwabara.

226
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,958
Being blind sounds
perfect right now.

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,583
Hey buddy, is that bad
guy still on our trail?

228
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,750
No, whoever it was,
he left us a few blocks back.

229
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,916
Why would they
suddenly stop?

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,958
Perhaps they've chosen
to focus all their power

231
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,416
on Yusuke's group.

232
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,666
Urameshi?

233
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,666
Strategically, you would
never close an option

234
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,916
unless you've made
a decisive strike.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,708
If they've left us, Yusuke
is probably under attack.

236
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,041
Relax! Genkai's with them!
They won't get into trouble.

237
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,583
That was bad timing.

238
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,500
Hey, we better stop
wasting minutes.

239
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's find Urameshi!

240
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,833
[SEA MAN] I pulled
back like you said.

241
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,291
Splendid work, Sea Man.

242
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,958
They all seem so
simple, don't they?

243
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,625
Should I take one out?

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,500
Not yet. I've staged
an interesting test

245
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,083
at the Doctor's expense.

246
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,291
I want to see what happens when
Yusuke's group has to battle

247
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,916
a fellow human to the death.

248
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,375
[Laughing]

249
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,041
[NURSE 4]
Yes, officer.

250
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,625
I called before. But listen,
something else is happening.

251
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,541
[FEMALE OFFICER]
Hey, are you still there?

252
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,583
So cold...

253
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
[NURSE 6]
I'm freezing.

254
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,875
All these sick people,
but where are the doctors?

255
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,000
I feel it. We've walked
into something.

256
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,958
Even the medical
staff is unconscious.

257
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,000
What's wrong
with her skin?

258
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,250
I don't know, but it's
definitely not good.

259
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,833
I'm not so sure we need to be
hanging around here, Keiko.

260
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,250
But Puu must think
Yusuke's here.

261
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,166
[PUU]
Puu!

262
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,750
What is it now, Puu?

263
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,583
The insects, I saw them
outside but I didn't tell you,

264
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,875
but these are attacking.

265
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,875
But how come I
can't see anything?

266
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,750
[SHIZURU]
Just run.

267
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,250
Maybe this is why I
hate doctor visits.

268
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,083
[THE DOCTOR] This is
definitely my favorite power.

269
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,583
I can infect everyone within
my Territory with a disease

270
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,458
of my own psychic creation.

271
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,750
I changed these demon
insects to be my carriers.

272
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,833
The weaker the victim's energy,

273
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,916
the faster the
disease can spread.

274
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,541
Your friends will
last thirty minutes,

275
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,250
and then I'll get
to watch them die.

276
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,208
You're gonna regret
saying that one.

277
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,333
[YUSUKE] I'm writing an
advice book for bad guys.

278
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,750
It's called
"Don't Piss Me Off!"

279
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,875
I learned from Kido
about you psychics.

280
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,458
Your powers fade when
you're asleep, so go to bed.

281
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,083
No time to sleep.

282
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,875
[The Doctor laughs]

283
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,708
[THE DOCTOR] I'm
working a double shift!

284
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,166
Hey!

285
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,750
Let's see if you can catch me.

286
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,791
Damn it!

287
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,875
Pronounced dead!

288
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,375
Enough!!!

289
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,041
You can't win.

290
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,375
Super strength
and endurance.

291
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,458
You're not built like
a normal human, Doc.

292
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,083
Yet another one of
my medical talents.

293
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,708
I can manipulate my
body's chemistry

294
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,291
to tweak my performance.

295
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,375
Pumping adrenaline
makes me stronger.

296
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,666
And cutting off my analeptic
chemicals makes me

297
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,000
incapable of feeling pain.

298
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,500
[The Doctor laughs wickedly]

299
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,833
I wish you would have
told me that earlier, M.D.

300
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,458
Here I've been
going easy on you

301
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,291
because I thought
you were a human.

302
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,166
But now I can bring
out something special

303
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,083
and not feel so bad.

304
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:41,333
Go ahead, I'll bring
out mine as well!

305
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,333
[The Doctor screams]

306
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,291
Urameshi's Spirit Gun!

307
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,333
Well Kaitou, you were correct.

308
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,583
Yusuke's team is
definitely in a fight.

309
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,250
What do you say we check
ourselves into the hospital.

310
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,625
The famous Spirit Gun.

311
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,291
That was a warning shot
for the human inside you.

312
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,833
Next time I won't miss.

313
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,875
You're as dangerous as

But I have one more
talent to show you.

315
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,583
It's simple, as a doctor.

316
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,250
Anything I can cut,
I can stitch back in place.

317
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,375
I think it's time
for a dissection.

[NARRATOR]
A demented human psychic

319
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,625
fighting for the Demon World.

00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:49,125
To save his friends,
will Yusuke have to kill?

321
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,375
[YUSUKE] One downside
to making friends...

322
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,166
...you've got more
people to protect.

323
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,833
I mean, when does
a hero say,

324
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,916
'No! Don't hurt
that total stranger!'

325
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,166
I'll give up my own life!

326
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,250
Keiko, Shizuru, Yana, Murota,

327
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,708
they're all locked up
in this doomsday hospital,

328
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,625
not mention Kido who
may never walk again!

329
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,291
And to save 'em, I may
have to kill another human

330
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,375
with more powers than you
could throw a medical book at.

331
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,083
Don't miss the ass-kicking
episode of Yu Yu Hakusho!
