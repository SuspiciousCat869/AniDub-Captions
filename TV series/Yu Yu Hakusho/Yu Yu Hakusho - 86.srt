With little time remaining

until the tunnel to
Demon World is complete,

3
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,291
Kuwabara was finally rescued.

4
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,375
However, his freedom
was short-lived

5
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:48,291
as he, Kurama, Hiei, and Sea Man
were swallowed by Ura-Otoko,

tamed by Itsuki.

Isolated from their friends,

Yusuke and Sensui are locked
in a one-on-one showdown.

[SENSUI]
I can predict your moves.

10
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,000
Decoding my opponent's
style is my strength,

but I've been doing it
for decades longer.

Then I guess you know this, too,

13
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,750

[YUSUKE]
What's that, Sensui?

19
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,750
You forget how to swim?
You drowned?

Great, we'll pack up and go!

21

You heard Kuwabara,
he's starving.

[SENSUI]
Good hits, detective.

23
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,666
Between that and the water,

Gross. Look at all those scars.

about all those fights
he's been through.

[SENSUI]
Don't you know what they say

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,208
about assuming, Kuwabara?

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,458
These wounds aren't
from enemies.

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,791
No one's ever hurt me that bad.

33
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,583
I gave myself these scars
as a part of my training.

34
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,166
[YUSUKE]
Great, a masochist.

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,791
True, though,
his body's well trained.

36
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,875
It's like punching
a tractor tire.

37
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:54,083
[SENSUI] Now, let's fight like
there's a little more at stake.

[KUWABARA]
Oh, just great!

40
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,125
Now he can make things move
without touchin' 'em.

41
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,666
And that won't be all.

What?!

47
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,708
It multiplied!

48
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,708
Sensui's surrounded
himself with a minefield

49
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,666
of little energy balls. How's
Urameshi gonna get to him now?

50
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,125
The real task will be...
getting away from him.

51
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,375
Perhaps it's time
I stepped up my game.

Oh! Urameshi!

65

It's really quiet.
Almost eerily quiet.

66
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,833
So what do you think?
Should we take that as

67
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,208
a good omen or a bad one?

68
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,541
Well, I would think

69
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,458
the apocalypse would have
to make a bit of noise.

70
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,000
So, maybe they beat Sensui,

71
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,708
and resealed the hole
to Demon World.

72
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah. I have a feeling
everything worked out

73
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,708
exactly according to plan.

Mh-hm.

[GENKAI] No, the hole's
still open, wider than ever.

It's dilating even faster
than it was before.

77
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,291
But how can you tell all
that for sure, Master Genkai?

78
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,458
From the smell.

79
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,875
The smell?

80
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,458
The smell. The Demon World
has a very distinct odor,

81
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,708

stronger from that cave.

any way you can smell

to keep Yusuke down.

You are foolishly cocky.

108

A regrettable sin.

109
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,208
Now, reason number two
why you cannot beat me.

110

When attacked
from multiple angles,

111
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,458

negligible at best.

What?

113
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,833

You think too linearly.

114
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,208
Pitiable. You've been spoiled.

115
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,500
As a fighter you've grown
a little too comfortable

116
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,625
with these gentlemanly
one-on-one duels of yours.

[gasps]

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,083
I needed to fight many opponents
at once, when persuasion failed.

120
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,291
So, this technique was born
out of that necessity.

121
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,500
Ah, come on. You just did that.

122
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,875
Can we play another P.E.
favorite besides dodge ball?

123
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,541
You know, I play a real
mean game of four-square.

124
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,208
No time for jokes, Yusuke.

Uh?

His energy is so
much stronger now.

127
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,500
Which brings us
to reason number three.

128
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,000
Why you don't even stand
a slim chance of beating me.

129
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,708
The gap between
your Spirit Energy

130

and mine is far too great.

131

If your Spirit Energy
could fill a fishbowl...

132

...mine would fill the ocean.

of them aren't as big.

of that on my own.

If that's all your Energy can
do, what's that say about mine?

00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,208
Maybe I can't defend against
attacks from multiple angles,

162
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:52,416
but sometimes a good defense
is just kicking ass!

[KURAMA] Individually, those

that their power is too strong.

Ahh. I've got to admit,
that was very refreshing.

[yelling]

184
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,416
It's unfortunate, honestly, to
see that your brief spontaneity

185
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,208
was merely a passing reprieve.

This isn't martial arts.

Yeah, he's got potty mouth now.

It's not him.

The only person who can
produce that weapon

Indeed.

Each with distinct
traits and talents.

His subconscious created them
to cope with the madness.

It's an impulsive
defense mechanism.

survival instinct.

Witnessing something
beyond the range

Spirit Detective

320
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,750
from killing the replacement?

321
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,916
And if he can't, who will
prevent this mad man

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,666
from unleashing the Demon horde
and destroying living world?

323
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,458
[YUSUKE] I never thought
I'd need a toddler to save me,

324
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
but now he's all I've got.

325
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,583
Well, besides myself,

326
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,666
and don't forget, there's
still my trusty Spirit Gun.

327
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,916
Hey, sure, it's not a real
gat growin' out of my arm,

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,833
but at least I can still make
obscene hand gestures, right?

329
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,625
And as if a barrel
to my head isn't enough

330
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,500
to keep you glued
to the television set,

331
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,958
we finally get
to see what happens

332
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,625
when Koenma takes that
baby toy out of his mouth.

333
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,500
My money's on
his head deflating,

334
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,208
but apparently it's something
a bit more... captivating.

335
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,458
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
