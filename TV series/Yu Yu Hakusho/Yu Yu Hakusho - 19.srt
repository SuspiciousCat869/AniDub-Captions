[NARRATOR]
Storm of Torment.

Uniting the powers of
lighting with Spirit Energy,

00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,291
a hybrid force is created

in a wall of torture.

could've sworn he missed me.

Did you see what
happened to him?

I did, sir.

205

I really hate watching
violent scenes like that.

Yes, it looked painful sir.

207
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,750
Gee, did you see the way
his body wiggled around??

208

How can you have an appetite
after watching all that?

Regular meals are important
for my development.

Knock him flat, Yusuke!!!

211

You'll find that the
energy will seek you out

212

like lightning to a rod.

But take heart,

you are the first human
to ever survive my technique.

You must feel so proud.

[YUSUKE THINKS] I gotta
find a way to block that.

There's no way I
can handle another one.

You have much more
Spirit Energy

than the other pawns King Yama
sent after me in the past,

but it will never be enough
to ruin my great plans.

I'll have to finish this.

Why don't you stay down and
watch the end of Keiko's movie?

She won't be so easy to
shove in a corner you know.

Keiko's no fighter,
but she's plenty tough.

And she's not following
