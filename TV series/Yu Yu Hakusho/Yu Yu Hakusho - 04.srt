00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,166
We've had two fires
break out already,

160
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,166
and foul play is suspected.

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,500
So please be careful.

162
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,333
Thank you and
come back any time,

163
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,750
Neighborhood Watch Committee!

164
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,625
Oh, pinch yourself Keiko.

165
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,250
What in the world do you
think you're doing here?

166
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,125
Oh yes, shopping!

167
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,500
My mother wanted me to
go shopping after school.

168
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,750
Yes, I'll have to clean
this room later on.

169
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,666
There, you see? Her
feelings are very confused.

170
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,500
Well of course they are!

171
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,000
It's just young love, isn't it,
Yusuke you big cutie!

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,833
[YUSUKE]
Who was that?

173
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,083
The house is on fire.

174
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,666
Yes it, seems so.

175
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,833
My house is on fire!!!

176
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,750
My mom didn't
even have the decency

177
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,333
to lock the windows for me!

178
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,500
[BOTAN] Yusuke. Maybe we should
focus on other things.

179
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,791
This is great! My body's
about to be firewood!

180
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,666
Hey wake up stupid!
You wanna die?

181
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,666
It, isn't working.
I'm, definitely still asleep!

182
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,500
Hey wait a second.
Can't I just possess myself?

183
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,708
It doesn't work that way!

184
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,041
You can't revive
until the egg hatches!

185
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,500
Then what am I supposed to do?

186
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,583
You've got to get in
contact with someone!

187
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,750
What about Kuwabara!
He'll sense you!

188
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,333
He's probably on the other side
of town! There's no time!

189
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,625
I'll get him anyway!

190
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,208
Right! Do that! And what
am I supposed to do?!

191
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,791
Come on let's go!
There's a fire on 4th Avenue!

192
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,375
[MAN 2] That makes
a dozen just today!

193
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,791
The fire department
can't get to them all!

194
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,333
[WOMAN 1]
This is eerie.

195
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,583
[WOMAN 2] Yeah. I can't help
feeling like we're under attack.

196
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,125
Yusuke lives on
4th Avenue. What if he's...

197
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,166
So Urameshi? You ready
to fight back now?

198
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,625
Kuwabara! We've got
an emergency!

199
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,208
[BOTAN] Hey! Listen to me!

200
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,458
Hey!!!

201
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,250
[BOTAN]
Listen!!!

202
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,875
Oh no! I've got
the tickle feeling!

203
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,375
Yusuke's house is on fire!

204
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,166
If you ever want to fight
him again, go help!

205
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,250
Something tells me
I should go that way.

206
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,291
I hope it's not too late.

207
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,583
[YUSUKE] So just trust me and
take care of my body until then.

208
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,958
I will.

209
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,041
Yusuke!

210
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,208
Interesting.
Keiko has come back.

211
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,625
Yeah, great.

212
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,458
Move! There's still somebody
inside of the house!

213
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,250
No it's too dangerous!

214
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,416
You cowards!

215
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,541
Keiko, don't!

216
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,000
Yusuke!

217
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,958
Keiko! Forget about me!

218
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,666
You're a lot more important
to this world than I am!

219
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,208
Don't be stupid!

220
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,500
Go back!

221
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,041
You do know that
without your body

222
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,333
you can't come back, don't you?

223
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,375
What's the point
of being alive if Keiko

224
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
has to get killed for it?

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
[MAN 4] The fire's
blocking the door!

226
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,458
[MAN 5] I told that girl!
I told her!

227
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,041
Urameshi's house!

228
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,583
Kuwabara! They say
Keiko's trapped inside!

229
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,750
Keiko?

230
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,416
Urameshi's girl? The one
we saved from those thugs?

231
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,333
[KOMADA] Y-Yeah. I think!

232
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,083
[Keiko coughs]

233
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,083
Yusuke!!

234
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,458
[KEIKO]
Oh Yusuke!!

235
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,916
Here we go--

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,833
Botan! Please! There's gotta
be something I can do!

237
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,791
I'm sorry Yusuke. I've tried
everything in my power.

238
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,291
[SAYAKA] There is one way.

239
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,041
But you may
not be willing to do it.

240
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,333
I'll decide that
for myself!! Tell me!

241
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,875
You can save her life by using
the power that's been gathered

242
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,125
by the Spirit Beast
you've been carrying with you.

243
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,250
What? You mean this little guy?

244
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,500
Throw it in the fire

245
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,041
and it will unleash from
the egg, and save her.

246
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,916
And that's all I have to do?
Why didn't you say so?

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,791
But if you hatch the Spirit
Beast now, before it's ready,

248
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,083
it won't be able to
perform its usual duties.

249
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,583
So does that mean,
if he saves Keiko's life,

250
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,083
the beast won't be
able to bring Yusuke back?

251
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,208
Right, Yusuke will
never have a chance

252
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,166
to be alive in this world again.

253
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,625
[YUSUKE]
So my life or hers, huh?

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,583
Wish someone had
told me this morning

255
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,833
I'd make this kinda choice.

256
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,291
[SAYAKA]
Your time is short, I'm afraid.

257
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,166
[YUSUKE THINKS] Oh well,
it was a good dream.

258
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,208
Keiko!

259
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,250
Can this be real?

260
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,916
[KEIKO]
We'll make it, Yusuke.

261
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,083
[KEIKO]
We will.

262
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,833
Keiko!

263
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,416
Kuwabara!

264
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,916
Dear!

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,375
Someone's coming!

266
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,916
They're both okay,
we really pulled it off.

267
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,833
[YUSUKE]
Well I sure am... relieved.

268
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,625
[sirens]

269
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,041
[KUWABARA] Typical. Now the
fire trucks arrive.

270
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,833
Hey, whatcha got under
the blanket, anyway?

271
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,083
What are you doing
with Yusuke's body??

272
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,500
I promise I'll tell you
everything, but not right now.

273
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,083
We've got to get
him somewhere safe.

274
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,583
Are you some type
of sick grave robber...?

275
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,375
Well come on! We can't let
the police get a hold of you!

276
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,625
[YUSUKE]
Whoa Kuwabara!

277
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,750
Who said you could hold
Keiko's hand like that?

278
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,250
Don't start getting
fresh with her!

279
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,000
She's not your type!

280
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,208
[BOTAN]
Yusuke.

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,625
Things aren't going to be
so easy on you for a while.

282
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,708
You can't just wander
around here anymore.

283
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,708
I'll have to take you back.

284
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,500
I don't know who Keiko
will love in the future

285
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,500
but you cannot interfere.

286
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,375
There's no point in
her saving her heart

287
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,458
for someone she
will never have, like you.

288
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,750
Oh, no. I didn't think.

289
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,833
Sayaka, is there any other
way to make this work?

290
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,875
So it's really over.

291
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,875
[YUSUKE] Figures, just
when it was getting good.

292
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,083
[ATSUKO]
I'm so sorry

293
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,000
I put both you
kids at risk today,

294
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,375
just because I was out on
one of my stupid escapades.

295
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,000
And Keiko, your hair.

296
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
It's okay.

297
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,583
Yusuke's body is safe
and that's what's important.

298
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,750
I saw a road of
blue fire leading me out.

299
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,291
It was like a big explosion

300
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,000
and I was surrounded
by his presence.

301
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,958
Yusuke saved me because
he knows he's returning.

302
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,958
[KUWABARA]
I still can't believe it!

303
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,583
Yusuke, you old rascal!

304
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,666
Oh son, sorry about that fire

305
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,708
but you're okay
now at least! Right?

306
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,166
This is so stupid!

307
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,458
Isn't someone gonna tell them

308
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,333
they're just talking
to a dead body!

309
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,875
Stop apologizing mom!

310
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,625
I'll never be around to say
it's okay! I'm dead for good!

311
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
[BOTAN]
It's so sad.

312
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,333
[SAYAKA] It can't be helped. He
made this decision on his own.

313
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,875
[YUSUKE] Okay Botan,
just take me to Heaven or Hell

314
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,291
or wherever it is I'm going.

315
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,166
I'm tired of being here.

316
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,708
[KOENMA] Yusuke Urameshi,

317
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,208
there's no reason to
act like a baby.

318
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,291
What? Koenma?

319
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,166
[BOTH]
Koenma, sir!

320
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,791
[KOENMA] Sayaka, I have
received your report.

321
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,208
Yusuke, you've shown to have
more character than I thought.

322
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,333
I've been trying
to figure out whether

323
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,208
people around you
really want you back.

324
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,875
Contrary to my personal
opinion, they actually do.

325
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,083
More importantly, you've
exhibited astounding potential

326
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,541
to be a decent human being.

327
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,250
Because this trait is so rare,

328
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,458
I've decided to give
you another chance.

329
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,583
In retrospect, it was
a very good thing

330
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,333
you threw this
egg into the fire.

331
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,291
If you had allowed it
to hatch, the Spirit Beast,

332
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,125
which had been feeding off your
constant negative energy,

333
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,833
would not have
been a pretty sight.

334
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,916
It would have bitten
your head off.

335
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,333
But as you and I both know,
that's not what happened.

336
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,333
You threw the egg into
the fire without hesitation,

337
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,750
saving Keiko's life
at the cost of your own.

338
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,333
You have a special quality
buried underneath all that crap,

339
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,916
and your added
experience with death

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,958
could make you very useful.

341
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,791
You think I'm useful?!

342
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,041
So are you giving
his life back?!

343
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,416
[BOTAN] Oh Koenma!
You're so gracious!

344
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,750
[KOENMA] Just as
long as you don't call

345
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,583
me a toddler anymore, okay?

346
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,041
Yeah!

347
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,791
[BOTAN] Yusuke!
I'm so happy for you!

348
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,041
You did it! You really did it!

349
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Yusuke!

350
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:44,583
Hey! Come on! Don't cling to me!
It's embarrassing, okay! Yeah!!

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,291
[YUSUKE]
Okay, here's the deal!

352
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,458
Koenma supposed to get
me back in my body, right?

353
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,875
Well it turns out there's
some crazy rules!

354
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,625
Like someone
I know has to kiss me!

355
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,625
And man I hope
it's not Kuwabara!

356
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,000
But as always, I've got
myself in a tight spot,

357
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,708
and there's not much time till
I miss my window to revive.

358
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,583
And if I do, I'll have to
wait another fifty years!

359
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,041
You know, it'd be really helpful
if I had some sort of phone

360
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,333
where I could call
these living people

361
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,000
when I needed, but anyway.

362
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,583
Can Keiko contact me
before everything's messed up?!

363
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,125
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
