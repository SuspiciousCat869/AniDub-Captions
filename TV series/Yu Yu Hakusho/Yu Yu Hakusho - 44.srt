160
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,791
[TOGORO 2]
It's our mutual friend.

161
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,833
This tournament is finally
about to get interesting.

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,291
To be brutally honest,

163
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,458
you shouldn't be
ready for this

164
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,500
until another ten
years of my training.

165
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,000
Even if you did come to
me with unusual talent.

166
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:50,375
It's the secret of my
power, Spirit Wave Orb.

167
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,583
For years I toiled
with this creation.

168
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,916
Energy of the
spirit and the body

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,041
concentrated into
the smallest space.

170
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,291
It is both part of
and separate from me,

171
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,916
and it could power
a whole city block.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,041
Your test is to incorporate
this into your own body,

173
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,958
and hope it doesn't
tear you apart.

174
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,708
The agony of this
absorption is beyond words.

175
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,875
It could go on
for hours or days.

176
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,583
If your body cannot handle it

177
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,916
you will be eaten
away from the inside out.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,416
And the only thing you will
pray for is a quicker death.

179
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,750
Well hell, if it's
gonna be that exciting,

180
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,416
I might as well
order two of 'em.

181
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,458
Yusuke, are you ready?

182
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,666
Yeah.

183
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,833
[YUSUKE] So that's it?

184
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,833
Please, I've had measle shots
more agonizing than that!

185
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:57,958
[labored breathing]

186
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,625
[painfully] Darn you Genkai!

187
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,166
[GENKAI THINKS] I hope you
can endure it, Yusuke.

188
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,875
[Yusuke screams in agony]

189
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:09,083
Goin' fast! Primo seats on
the second deck! Whatta ya say?!

190
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,625
[JURI] Sorry to
keep you waiting,

191
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,208
all you demons out there!

192
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,250
Hello everybody,
it's so great to meet you!

193
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,250
My name's Juri and
I'll be the referee!

194
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,333
It's my first time!
So be friendly, okay!

195
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,833
[KOTO] That's right,
you pain enthusiasts!

196
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,791
The semi-finals of the Dark
Tournament are poised to begin!

197
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,791
For reasons I can't talk about
I've been moved out of the ring

198
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,500
and into the measly
broadcasting booth.

199
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,541
Not that I'm bitter of course.

200
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,833
[JURI] First let's have
everyone locate their nearest

201
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,375
emergency exit-- just in case
things get rough!

202
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,541
I don't know sir.

203
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,541
The new stadium is
really spooking me out.

204
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,208
I mean your chair looks
like a big tarantula

205
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,291
and you can't even
see the day light!

206
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,500
[KOENMA] Yes, it seems these
weather-proof dome stadiums

207
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,375
are all the rave
these days.

208
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,750
I just wish they would
have included some A/C!

209
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,375
I wish they would've
used pastel paint!

210
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,708
Now it's with great honor that
I get the ceremony started!

211
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,125
The four surviving
semi-final teams!

212
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,375
[JURI]
Team Gorenja!

213
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,083
[JURI]
Of course Team Toguro!

214
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,333
[JURI]
Team Uraotogi!

215
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,625
[JURI]
And Team Urameshi!

216
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,500
Get those dirty
creatures off the screen!

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,250
[CROWD CHANTS]
Kill Yusuke! Kill Yusuke!

218
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,500
[JURI] All right!

219
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,500
Let's review how those
four teams will match up

220
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,125
in the semi-final round!

221
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
The pairings run top to bottom.

222
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,250
First off- Team Urameshi
vs. Team Uraotogi!

223
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,500
Let's get it started guys!

224
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,208
Hey, what's with Team Urameshi?!

225
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,791
They're short members!

226
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,500
Ha, looks like their own team
captain's too scared to fight!

227
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,125
Koenma sir! Yusuke still
hasn't returned to the team!

228
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,500
[KOENMA]
That's to be expected.

229
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,041
The kid is undergoing
Genkai's ultimate test.

230
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,958
It's not like that was going
to be just an afternoon affair.

231
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,541
But what should they do?

232
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,875
Until Yusuke and Genkai return
they'll be severely outnumbered!

233
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,500
In the
semi-finals, no less!

234
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,375
[KOENMA] Oh blast it Ogre,
they'll just have to deal!

235
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,583
I'm much more concerned

236
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,833
as to whether Yusuke
will come back at all!

237
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,166
I was not exactly

238
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,416
expecting to fight this
round three against five.

239
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,875
Whatever cause is delaying
them must be important.

240
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,708
We'll simply have
to work around it.

241
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,666
I don't know why you're
all stressin', Hiei!

242
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,375
I'll just beat 'em all myself!

243
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,458
Let's go!!!

244
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,250
[Yusuke crying out in agony]

245
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,666
[GENKAI] Yusuke, you
mustn't be afraid.

246
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,708
The energy will
absorb in time,

247
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,291
but only if you have
the will to endure it.

248
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,500
Give in to the pain now,
and I assure you. You will die.

249
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,500
[Yusuke crying out in agony]

250
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,458
[KOTO on radio] Here I am
at ringside, people,

251
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,958
and the first fight
of the semi-finals

252
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,125
is only minutes away!

253
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,875
The energy of the
crowd is breathtaking,

254
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,916
and within the
walls of this giant dome

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,125
the excitement seems to fester
like mold in leftover take-out!

256
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,375
Team Urameshi and Team Uraotogi
are now approaching the ring--

257
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,958
I can tell already this is
going to be a joyous bloodbath!

258
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,458
Puu.

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,791
What magnificent images
of destruction and misery

260
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,791
must be swimming through
these competitor's heads

261
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,666
as they stare down
their enemies in the ring!

262
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,291
But as the countdown
approaches zero.

263
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,833
Yusuke and the Masked Fighter

264
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,416
have still not
entered the stadium!

265
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,041
Leaving their teammates
mismatched three to five!

266
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,041
Does this mean the
controversial demons

267
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,416
Hiei and Kurama will
each have to fight twice

268
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,875
to keep their team alive?

269
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,083
[KUWABARA] What's
that supposed to mean?!

270
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,250
I said I'm takin'
'em all myself!!

271
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,208
I thought we agreed
on a good fight.

272
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,583
What has happened to
the rest of your team?

273
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,083
Oh, they just said you guys
weren't worth their time!

274
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,708
It is now time to choose
the conditions for your fight!

275
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,833
It doesn't matter.
Let's just see who lives.

276
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,208
You're a hasty one,
aren't you boy?

277
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,125
I take it you're fighting first.

278
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,708
That's right I am.
First, last and only.

279
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,291
[HIEI] I've been under
too much stress lately.

280
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,083
Killing you all should
be a good remedy.

281
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,500
We're all anxious
to fight here.

282
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,708
Why don't we let an outside
party decide the pairings.

283
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,083
[SHISHI WAK.] Each six-sided
die represents a team,

284
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,958
with one member's
name on each side.

285
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,625
The sixth is a free space,

286
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,875
and anyone can fight
when it comes up.

287
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,875
You fight as many times
as your name appears

288
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
as long as you're still alive.

289
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,000
Doesn't bother me.
But one thing.

290
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,250
Whenever it's the name
of someone not around..

291
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,625
I will be fighting
in their place.

292
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,125
Okay! Matches will be
chosen by rolling of dice,

293
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,541
multiple turns are allowed,

294
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,416
and as always in the semi-finals
five wins will advance!

295
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,041
Fate makes her choice.

296
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,208
Looks like you
got Makintaro, Hiei.

297
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,708
Your desperate
plan has backfired.

298
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,500
You talk way too
big, little man!

299
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,708
Alright fans,

300
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,708
it's the first match-up
of the semi-finals!

301
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,125
Hiei versus the
big man Makintaro!

302
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,541
Begin!

303
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,291
That's very impressive.

304
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,500
What's wrong? Did we have a
little accident in our trousers?

305
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,000
Your whole nervous system...
It leaves much to be desired.

306
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,833
What are you talking about--
my "nervous system"!

307
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,833
Come on, just give
me your best shot!

308
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,083
Fool, I already have.

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,208
Well now, isn't
that a bit disgraceful.

310
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,333
He's even faster
than last time!!

311
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,166
Did you see that?

Got 'ya!!

What about that one?
Did you see him dodge sir?

Well of course!

And the winner

[NARRATOR] As Team Urameshi's
crucial battle begins,

their captain is still writhing
under Genkai's brutal test.

Can Yusuke endure the
over-powering energy

and it turns out that Kuro

is really some
kind of hairy freak!
