Fifty years ago,

3
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,791
Genkai and Toguro were
actually teammates

00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,000
who fought and won their
own Dark Tournament,

before becoming
violently estranged.

Yusuke Urameshi arrived just in
time to see his teacher slain,

and assaulted Toguro in a rage,

only to be knocked away
by one devastating blow.

[SUZUKI] These were
the starting points

for two items I
gave to my own team.

The bottle, Kurama, contains
the Fruit of the Previous Life,

00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,791
handpicked from the upper
realms of Spirit World.

100
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,791
It was from just
such a fruit that Ura

101
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,958
derived the smoke
for his Idunn Box.

102
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,916
And drinking that will produce
the same dreamy effect

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,875
of turning you
into your demon form.

And that one is
called the Trial Sword.

Made from a Japanese Cedar

106

sucking up the surrounding life.

For Shishi Wakamaru it
became the Banshee Shriek.

[SUZUKI] Because I dislike
you. But I hate Toguro.

121
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,750
It only took three percent
of his repulsive strength

122
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
to make a fool out of me.

everything like it should.

I went to pieces at his feet,
pleading for my life!

[SUZUKI] The insult to
my pride was death enough.

129
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,291
I spent decades
refining my techniques

130
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,625
and collecting every
enchanted item that I could.

131
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,833
I changed my appearance

132
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,250
and even helped
assemble a tournament team.

133
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,875
But you easily beat me
before I could reach him!

And I see it wasn't
meant to be.

But if my own
body can't beat him,

then at least my items can!

Actually it's a real pity.

needed slap in the face.

when she left the hotel.

00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,791
[KOENMA] They spent the
majority of their lives

157
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,625
consumed with each other.

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,291
A young fighter
and her role model,

159
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,208
two teammates,
two bitter enemies--

160
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,833
whatever terms they
happened to be on,

161
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,375
they were always
opposite magnets

162
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,125
on a life-long
crash course.

163
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,125
[KOENMA] Genkai came here
knowing she would die

164
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,333
and Toguro came
knowing he would kill her.

165
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,833
How were you, a kid whose
mother wasn't even born

166
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,000
when this
conflict began,

167
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,125
planning to interfere
with this dispute?

168
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,875
So, you gonna let go?

169
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,750
Or we just gonna stand
here and do the tango?

170
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,583
[YUSUKE]
Why did you go?

171
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,416
[KOENMA THINKS]
Is this the final ordeal

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
you planned for him, Genkai?

173
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,125
Overcoming his teacher's death?

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,791
It's only one more day
before the final round everyone

175
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,375
and I'm right in the
thick of the crowd!

176
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
Hundreds of thousands
of apparitions

177
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,875
have been standing
in line for days,

178
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:26,916
hoping to get a ticket

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and wishing they
were as lucky as me!

180

Don't forget it

182
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,208
My, you've done well for
yourself haven't you, Sakyo?

183
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,583
It's the usual forty trillion
to the winning owner...

184
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,500
That should treat you
nicely when stacked 

185
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,291
with the sixty-six trillion you
won from Tarukane before his...

186
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,666
...unfortunate and
untimely death...

187
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,625
[RICH MAN BLUE] It's a
ridiculous amount of money.

188
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,583
What are you going
to use it on?

189
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,166
You could do
great things, Sakyo.

190
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,250
Buy out everything

191
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,916
our organization
doesn't have already.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,333
Every big business
a marionette pulled

193
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,625
by the black market's
invisible hands.

194
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,958
[CLUB MAN 3] Now, don't
crowd the man with speeches.

195
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,166
I'm sure he knows the
potential of this prize.

196
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,041
And with the whole world to
run he'll need some trusty CEOs.

197
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,500
Actually I have
much bigger plans.

198
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,458
Oh really? Well do tell!

199
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,875
I present my master scheme.

200
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,666
A giant tunnel connecting the
living world with the demon one.

201
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,291
You are screwing with us.

202
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,250
[SAKYO] Please,
use your imaginations.

203
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,916
Do you know why a mere
handful of demons escape

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,875
into the living world at a time,

205
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,166
so that one Spirit
Detective and his friends

206
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,458
are enough to bring them back?

207
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,958
Cost. Portals between
the worlds are too expensive.

208
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,833
Just creating a
temporary tunnel

209
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,958
the size of a fist
costs a million,

210
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,708
so only small and very
crafty demons can get through.

211
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,916
But I have seen creatures
the size of shopping malls

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,250
roam across the Demon World.

213
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,166
What if a permanent
tunnel was made

214
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,250
so that every monster
could pass at their leisure,

215
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,041
regardless of size or strength?

216
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,541
[SAKYO] What an exciting new
world that would be.

217
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,541
You want to run
the world with money.

218
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,791
What if it could be
run by fear, by monsters?

219
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,375
I want to completely
redefine the food chain.

220
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,750
But not even one hundred
trillion is enough.

221
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,958
The real wealth is in the bets,

222
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,541
but Toguro is such a favorite

223
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,958
that no one would
bet against him.

224
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,083
Unless there was a wild card.

225
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,833
What? A wild card?

226
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,666
You mean Yusuke Urameshi!

227
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right--you said for
Team Urameshi to be guest

228
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,708
before this tournmanet start!

229
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,750
You helped him through
this whole thing

230
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,041
so people like us
might bet on his side

231
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:48,958
and get you more money??

232
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,750
Yusuke got through on his own.

233
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,583
The only thing I
did was murder Butajiri.

234
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,625
[Sakyo chuckles]

235
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,958
[SAKYO] And Tarukane
too, of course.

236
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,875
You... sick...!

237
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,000
Hustling our tournament
for your perverse project!

238
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,333
You madman! I won't
let you get away with this!

239
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,125
Well, I was afraid
you'd react negatively

240
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,833
toward my daring new ideas.

241
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,666
But at this stage in the game
it doesn't matter much, does it?

242
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,083
If you have placed bets,
I'll still collect...

243
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,708
Post-mortem.

244

Kill that rotten bastard!

245
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,625
By the way, what do
you think about my plan?

246
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,708
As usual I think it's
far too complicated.

247
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,208
With so many variables

248
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,000
you never know what
could push it all awry.

249
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,375
[TOGURO 2] But as for the idea,
how could I not agree?

250
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,750
I've acquired so much energy

251
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,125
that even if I wanted
to go to Demon World,

252
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,541
there is no portal
now that could carry me.

253
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,833
[TOGURO 2]
Once Yusuke Urameshi dies.

254
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,541
There'll be no one
left on this side

255
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,208
able to challenge my power.

256
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,000
And what's the point of
strength if you can't use it?

257
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,833
Eloquently
answered as always.

258
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,041
Care for a drink?

259
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,708
We've had a good
arrangement, Sakyo.

260
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,375
May the tournament
finish appropriately.

261
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,375
If you don't mind, I will take a
glass of orange juice over ice.

262
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,333
[SAKYO] Here's
to the tournament.

263
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,000
You're.. back!

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,625
I knew you weren't gone!
I knew you weren't!!

265
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,708
Grandma, wait...

266
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,916
[KOENMA] How long do you plan to
stay out here like this? Yusuke?

267
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,166
[KOENMA] Why do I deserve this?

268
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,541
Well, anyway, Yusuke,

269
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,708
Genkai left us a message
that you might want to hear.

270
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,541
Are you serious?

271
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,458
Please--what'd she say?

272
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,875
[KOENMA] She said the last
year of her life sucked

273
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,458
because as a student you
were such a pain in the ass.

274
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,916
And she asks you to stay
alive for a really long time

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,208
so she can have some
peace and quiet for once.

276
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,666
So in other words, dimwit,
go win that battle.

277
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,958
Sounds just like her,
doesn't it?

278
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,791
Yeah, yeah it does.

279
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,875
[GENKAI] It's time
you bit the bullet

280
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,375
and started caring
about something

281
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,958
with all your heart and energy.

282
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,125
But you can't care about it

283
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,791
if you're always
holding yourself back

284
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,041
in case it doesn't work out!

285
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,958
I got it.

286
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,333
Watch, Grandma. I gotta
message for you, too.

287
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,250
It's a little sample of
the energy you gave me.

288
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,125
My way of saying I understand.

289
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,041
Is that from...?

290
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,166
Yes, it is.

291
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,666
Such power.

292
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,541
Incredible,
that's from Urameshi?

293
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,333
He can do it.

294
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,333
Unbelievable, Yusuke
could really win.

295
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,666
Yusuke!

296
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,791
[Sakyo laughs wickedly]

297
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,166
You think it got
all the way up to her?

298
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,875
[KOENMA] Yeah,
I'm sure it did, Yusuke.

299
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,750
[NARRATOR] Yusuke has
taken his first step

300
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,750
in overcoming his
teacher's passing.

301
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,750
And so, night falls,

302
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,333
knowing that when
the sun next rises,

303
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,500
the climactic final round
of the Dark Tournament--

304
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,375
and Team Urameshi's greatest
challenge--will begin.

305
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,833
[KOENMA] Greetings everyone.

306
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,458
Koenma here, sporting my
totally suave teenage form.

307
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,583
You heard correctly,

308
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,416
the day of the final
round is arriving

309
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,041
when Yu Yu Hakusho continues.

310
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,708
And we'll see just how intense
this showdown is going to be,

311
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,166
as the various rivals throw
each other cold stares

312
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,708
and intimidating gestures.

313
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,708
But what's this?

314
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,000
A clause in the rule book says

315
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,666
both teams must
have five players,

316
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,916
and both sides have to
find a new member on the fly!

317
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,291
If that's not intrigue enough,

318
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,583
just watch to see how
cool Yusuke can be

319
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,916
when he's really p.o.'d!

320
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,791
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
