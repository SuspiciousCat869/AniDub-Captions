together with his Demon Energy!

blast was so robust

Then what? Then we have
to do it all again?

164
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,000
Sounds great! You can
sign me up to fight!

165
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,375
Why? So you can get your butt
kicked in the prelims again?

166
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,375
[PINK-EYED DEMON]
Shut up!

167
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,958
Well, the rule was
whoever wins,

168
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,958
no matter what, all demons
have to obey his or her laws,

169
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,083
and so I'll hold you to that.

170
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
Now it won't be
hard to remember.

171
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,708
I'm only enforcing
one great law.

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,708
[coughs] My law is, from now on,

173
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,083
there will be no mischief
in Living World.

174
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,458
[DEMONS]
Uh...

175
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,333
What?

176
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,875
[ENKI] We've been
fighting for too long.

177
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,791
It's something I learned
from an old friend.

178
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,666
This is how I'll
honor his memory.

179
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,166
I'll create a council and
figure out the particulars

180
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,166
of this in a week.

181
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,458
Where's Yomi? I'd like
to see his reaction.

182
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,583
He left, soon after his loss.

183
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,083
Where to?

184
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,916
He described it as a "Journey of
New Truths" with his son.

185
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,416
A good name.

186
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,791
[YOMI]
Yes.

187
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,125
My fight with Urameshi made
me reevaluate things.

188
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,708
I'll train Shura to beat
him, in the right way.

189
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,583
Huh! Give me credit.
I can beat him right now!

190
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,416
I'll train so I
can beat you, dad!

191
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,125
And of course I'll be tougher
than you, Kurama!

192
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,666
[KURAMA] Hm. Something
to look forward to.

193
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,333
When Urameshi wakes, could you
relay a message for me?

194
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,708
That he gave me a sense of peace
I've never had before...

195
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,500
And I'd love to fight him again,
though I doubt I could win.

196
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,833
As for you...

197
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,250
I want you to know that
I respect your decision

198
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,583
to leave your past behind.

199
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,583
[KURAMA]
Same for you.

200
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,500
Kurama...

201
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,666
I'm happy that you
took my invitation.

202
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,541
[ENKI] Well thank you
for coming, everyone,

203
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,375
and listening to me.

204
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,791
Things are going to start
getting better around here.

205
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,291
[DEMON CROWD cheers]

206
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
[JIN] Well I'm not sure when
I'll be seein' you again,

207
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,000
Yusuke, but you'll always know
that I see you as a friend.

208
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,083
Gotcha'.

209
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
It's not like it's
goodbyes for good.

210
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,833
There's another tourney
in three years, ace.

211
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,000
[TOUYA] If you're not
still in love, Chu.

212
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,666
I was only training
for a tournament.

213
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,625
I didn't expect a revolution.
But I do feel like myself again.

214
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,041
So it's back to Living
World for you, Kurama?

215
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,541
Yes, it's time I chose a home.

216
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,958
[TOUYA]
Yeah.

217
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,250
--[CHU] See ya, bludgers!
--[SUZUKI] It's been real.

218
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,375
[JIN]
Farewell, you two!

219
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,083
[JIN] I'll be up for
playin' any time!

220
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,500
[YUSUKE]
See you guys! You're the best!

221
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,375
[YUSUKE laughs]

222
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,583
So Yusuke's going
back, after all?

223
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,791
[KURAMA]
That's what he says,

224
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,666
after he takes care
of some things.

225
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,500
[HIEI]
And I guess you're off, too?

226
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,916
That's right. To my family.

227
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,916
[KURAMA]
Hiei...

228
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,333
I can't accept this.

229
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,416
I value our friendship,
and all we've been through.

230
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,458
[HIEI gasps]

231
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,500
But I'm not interested
in you that way.

232
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,000
You fool, I'm not giving
my stone to you!

233
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,458
[KURAMA]
Relax, it's a joke.

234
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,750
You want me to give
this to Yukina, right?

235
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,166
That's right!
I want you to tell her

236
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,666
that her dear twin brother's
been dead for years.

237
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,583
Why don't you return it
to her yourself, Hiei.

238
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,958
I'm staying here in Demon World.

239
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,500
I want her to call off her
ridiculous search for me.

240
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,500
Even if you did want that,
I won't shut this door for you.

241
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,708
You'll give this to her...

242
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,958
At your own pace.

243
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,458
You're the same way you
were the first day we met.

244
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,125
A pain who speaks the truth.

245
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,166
[KOENMA]
Happy with yourself, Yusuke?

246
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,208
[KOENMA] You realize you
took a serious gamble,

247
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,000
arranging this tournament.
If another demon had won,

248
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,500
all three worlds could have
been plunged into a war

249
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,041
of unspeakable horror.

250
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,083
Ha! Look on the bright side!
That's not what happened is it?

251
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,666
--[KOENMA] You idiot!
--[YUSUKE] Uh?

252
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,458
[KOENMA] Once again,
you didn't use your brain!

253
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,416
You acted on heart,
and dumb instinct.

254
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,791
In fact, all of you did.

255
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,750
[sighs] But somehow it worked.

256
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,708
Without you, Kurama, and Hiei
fighting on emotions alone,

257
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,666
this peace wouldn't
have happened.

258
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,916
Yusuke, what you've
managed to do is--

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,875
Spare me the gratitude. Like
you said, I wasn't thinking.

260
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,250
So my punching Yomi knocked
him out of the race...

261
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,291
And me powering up got
the others to max out

262
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,791
before the final round.

263
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,500
That's nothing I could've known.

264
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,666
I was just fighting.

265
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,375
[KUWABARA]
These fellas won't ever get it.

266
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,750
Winning's never been the
real reason I fight him.

267
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,166
[YUSUKE]
That's just the kinda guy I am.

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,750
I can't take thanks for it.

269
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:45,500
Come on! You saved the world,
so take the credit! [laughs]

270
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,333
[KOENMA]
I understand, Yusuke.

271
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,583
You two could live
a thousand lifetimes

272
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,791
and still never run out
of things to fight about.

273
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,750
That's what makes hanging
out with you so much fun.

274
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,125
I'll miss it.

275
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[KOENMA] As for your detective
gig, your firing is permanent.

276
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,333
That's good.

277
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,291
I was just about to
tell you I quit.

278
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,041
[KOENMA] Guess our next
meeting will be more formal.

279
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,541
Right. When my time comes.

280
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,708
[YUSUKE]
Just make sure you

281
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,958
actually have a space
for me next time.

282
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,375
[KOENMA]
Sure.

283
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,000
Who knows? Maybe by then you'll
be out of your diaper phase.

284
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,208
[gasps]

285
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,166
[laughs]

286
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,500
[KOENMA] Well, I'd say
that's a good end

287
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,125
to a detective's career.

288
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,083
What should we do with all the
footage we've compiled, sir?

289
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,083
[KOENMA]
Package it.

290
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,416
[NARRATOR]
And so, indeed,

291
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,166
Yusuke's journey as a
Spirit Detective is done.

292
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,375
What lies ahead as he
grows from boy to man?

293
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:42,291
Not even the supposedly
wise Koenma could know that.

294
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,291
I won't give you the narrator
job if you annoy me!

295
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,833
[laughs]

296
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,791
[RAIZEN]
Hey, son.

297
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,458
Just gonna stand
there looking stupid?

298
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,000
Your dumb war is over, Dad.

299
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,458
I wasn't tough enough to
take the crown, though.

300
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,375
Huh. Well of course
you aren't yet...

301
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,916
You'll need another 300 years.

302
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,291
So, what will you do
in the mean time?

303
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,250
[YUSUKE] Don't know.
I'll think of something.

304
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,833
[RAIZEN] Come on,
you can tell your old man...

305
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,000
There's a trip you need
to take, isn't there?

306
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:35,833
[YUSUKE]
A trip?

307
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,083
Okay.

308
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,583
You got me... There's one.

309
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,375
Tell her how you feel.

310
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,750
She's the best thing you've got.

311
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,083
Guess the apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

312
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,791
We're both jerks for love.

313
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,541
[RAIZEN chuckles]

314
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,916
See ya, Dad.

315
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,083
[RAIZEN]
Hey.

316
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,083
Don't worry, I'll come back.

317
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,250
Yusuke, Sir.

318
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,916
I know, save the speech.

319
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,666
Demon World is vast with lots
of great places to explore,

320
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,000
and I should stay and get
stronger, and not leave.

321
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,166
Right?

322
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,583
Actually, no, Sir.

323
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,125
We've come to say
have a good trip,

324
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,333
and we'll keep training
for your return.

325
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,333
Someday.

326
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,083
Farewell.

327
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,750
[YUSUKE]
Aw, thanks.

328
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,750
[NARRATOR]
As a fourteen year-old boy,

329
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,541
Yusuke Urameshi
was struck by a car.

330
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,291
Now, with friends and memories
locked in his heart,

331
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:48,041
he looks ahead to a new
adventure: Being all grown up.

332
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,250
[YUSUKE]
The secret's out.

333
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,000
And all this time you've
been watching clips

334
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,791
from the Spirit World's Records
department, about my life.

335
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,083
Botan begged to do
this preview, but--

336
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,291
[BOTAN]
I wasn't begging--

337
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,083
[YUSUKE] But the last
one's gotta be mine!

338
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,625
[KURAMA] Then perhaps
you say what happens?

339
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,041
[YUSUKE]
You're here, too?

340
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,125
Well obviously no one's gonna
miss the last episode!

341
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,708
I mean you guys wanna see
what happens to us, right?

342
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,500
Because there are
more surprises--

343
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,833
[BOTAN] Not to mention
the most romantic smooch--

344
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,125
[YUSUKE]
Shut up!

345
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
[KUWABARA] Urameshi,
your face is turning red!

346
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,208
[BOTAN] See you there,
on the last Yu Yu Hakusho!
