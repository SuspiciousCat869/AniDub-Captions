00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,833
[TOGURO 2] To become a
master of a trade,

2
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,625
you must commit your all to it
and throw everything else away.

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,666
Damn, you're stupid,
you didn't throw it away.

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,000
You just ran away from it like
a frightened little child.

5
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,708
I won't run,
and I won't let go.

6
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:23,000
Spirit Gun!!!

7
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,791
I killed Genkai
but one remained.

8
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,333
And now that surviving piece
can at last be put to rest.

9
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,458
[TOGURO 2] Thank you again,
Yusuke Urameshi.

10
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,375
[crackling]

11
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,083
[TOGURO 2] This was
the first time I could

12
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,250
use my absolute strength,
and you answered.

13
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,041
It was the only
way it could end.

14
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,666
That's hard to call.

15
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,791
[crowd erupts in cheers]

16
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,833
He did it!!

17
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,041
We are free.

18
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,416
We can go home
now Shizuru!

19
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,083
Winner of the Tournament!
Team Urameshi!

20
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
[KOTO] That's right people,
don't kick your radios.

21
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,166
The human verifiably
clinched an upset!

22
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,541
Now we just have to
accept our losses.

23
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,208
We should go now.

24
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,250
Keiko, are you all right?

25
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,250
Finally the Toguros fall.

26
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,500
It's been quite
a long run.

27
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,833
All I can think about is how
much our little sapling

28
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,416
has improved in
this tournament.

29
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,791
That and the whole
saving-my-life thing.

30
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,125
[KURAMA]
Yusuke!

31
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,833
Easy does it.
No sleeping just yet.

32
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,708
Yusuke, snap out of it! 
You have your victory.

33
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,291
[YUSUKE]
Am I...am I alive?

34
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,208
[KOENMA] Of course!
Do you see any halos on us??

35
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,291
Everything is a-okay now!

36
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,041
[YUSUKE]
No it's not.

37
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,458
No it's not.

38
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,583
[YUSUKE] Damn it!!!

39
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,291
[YUSUKE] If I hadn't been
such an irresponsible kid,

40
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:39,416
if I didn't have concrete walls
between my own stupid emotions.

41
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,958
Okay Urameshi.

42
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,041
It's all you.

43
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,625
I did what I could.

44
00:05:54,708 --> 00:06:01,000
Now beat him for all of us.
Make my death count, Yusuke?

45
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,791
I had all the
strength to save him.

46
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,500
I was just too dumb to
know how to reach it.

47
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
What the hell do
I say to that, huh??

48
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,041
You say you learned.

49
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,916
[YUSUKE] Shut up!
What good does that do?

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,791
He's already dead!
I can't say anything to him now!

51
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,666
Is that so hard to get??

52
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,541
I'm just like everybody
else with power!

53
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,625
I don't do anything to help!

54
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
[YUSUKE]
I'm sorry, Kuwabara!!

55
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,958
It's all my fault.

56
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,500
Okay, I think you've done enough
groveling for one day!

57
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,708
Though it is pretty
entertaining!!

58
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,083
Reporting for duty!
Captain Faker! That's me!

59
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,708
Hey, why's the dead
guy walkin' around???

60
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,375
Yes. Well, I tried
to inform you,

61
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,208
but you were too
engrossed in your speech.

62
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,458
The heart! The finger poking!

63
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,208
You're a moving public
speaker, by the way.

64
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,250
Look, he never died.

65
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,791
Just stay with us, Kuwabara! 
Just stay with us.

66
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,666
Hold on. Your pulse
is still strong!

67
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,250
Yeah that's right, don't worry.
Toguro missed my vitals.

68
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,666
But keep looking at
me like you're sad.

69
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,666
Urameshi could use some
good shock treatment.

70
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,333
And that's basically
how it went!

71
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,708
How's it feel to be
outta the loopty-loop?!

72
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,708
All you guys
were in on this?

73
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,750
[KOENMA] Naturally. I know
I'm not supposed to lie,

74
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,208
but well, whatever.

75
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,333
And you guys let me
cry like a baby??

76
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,666
You said it yourself.
It was your fault.

77
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,708
[KOENMA] I agree with Hiei.
Mostly so I don't feel guilty.

78
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,500
If you could've reached
your power on your own

79
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,125
the fake death wouldn't
have been needed,

80
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,708
and you wouldn't
look like a child.

81
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,708
I doubt he heard you.

82
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,833
[YUSUKE] We're in front of
about a million people,

83
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,166
including Keiko and my boss
and hardcore demon fighters,

84
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,375
and you make me say
all that sissy crap??

85
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,500
I really thought you
were dead you stupid ass!!!

86
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,458
Oh, I'm so very relieved
to see Kazuma's okay!

87
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,625
He should really try the
Junior High theater department!

88
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,625
Yes, he could at
least play the fool.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,750
[YUSUKE] Stupid! I'll teach you
to act like you're dead!

90
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,125
Yusuke, teach him anymore
and you'll actually kill him.

91
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,583
That's kind of against
the point, isn't it?

92
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,291
Wait a sec.

93
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,625
That still doesn't explain why
Toguro missed dufus-boy's heart.

94
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,416
Oh yeah, I hadn't thought
about that, Dufus-brain.

95
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,291
What with all the years
Toguro spent as a hired killer.

96
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,583
You'd think he'd know
where the heart was.

97
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,625
He obviously knew Kuwabara.

98
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,500
I'd say your defense level
just rose dramatically

99
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,875
and kept your heart
from being pierced.

100
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,750
Your stubbornness is even
greater than your stupidity.

101
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,208
That sure is a nasty
way to give a compliment!!!

102
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,000
I suggest an alternative,

103
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,500
that Toguro didn't
want Kuwabara to die.

104
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,541
He intended to
miss from the start.

105
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,666
I believe that the ultimate
outcome of this fight

106
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,666
is precisely what Toguro
had been looking for.

107
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,250
So he threw the fight??

108
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,666
No. He wanted to be legitimately
defeated, by someone stronger.

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,458
But why?

110
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,625
[KOENMA]
Maybe he felt guilty

111
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,125
for choosing strength
over his friends,

112
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,666
and for ditching the
one he cared about most.

113
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,958
[KURAMA] And who
better to vanquish him

114
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,250
than the apprentice
of the woman he abandoned?

115
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,583
He wanted you
to prove him wrong,

116
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
show him that your
choice could prevail.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,041
[KOENMA] Guess we'll
never know for sure.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,333
[SAKYO] May I put in my two
cents? I think Kurama's right.

119
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,791
What the hell?

120
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,083
I only knew him a couple of
years, but thinking back,

121
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,125
the signs were in neon lights.

122
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,625
Toguro's poker
face was famous.

123
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,708
When he saw Yusuke barrel into
Tarakane's stronghold,

124
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,875
it was one of the few times
I saw him lose a grin.

125
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,500
I just thought he was
anxious to kill you.

126
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,500
But that's what I get
projecting my tastes onto his.

127
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,333
In the greatest moment, facing
the greatest opponent,

128
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,083
he was able to face
a great end.

129
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,250
It's the dream of every
true competitor.

130
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,000
[SAKYO]
Speaking of, Koenma,

131
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,083
it's time for us to settle
our own great bet.

132
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,500
I see my weak point
was not knowing the truth

133
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,166
of what Toguro was thinking.

134
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,416
It's been a most enjoyable game.

135
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,625
Bet's off.
You've lost your fortune.

136
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,208
You're no threat to me now.

137
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,625
Such kind words.

138
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,083
But where is the
thrill in gambling

139
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,458
if you know you can
get out of all your bets?

140
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,333
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it myself.

141
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,708
That's kind of a showy
way to cark yourself!

142
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,750
I think we should leave now.

143
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,166
[COMPUTER] Stadium
detonation now commencing.

144
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,208
Fifteen minutes.

145
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,500
[COMPUTER] Stadium detonation...
fourteen minutes...

146
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,791
Stadium detonation...
fourteen minutes.

147
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,125
What the hell are we
standing around for?!

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,125
Come on!!!

149
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,291
This stadium will
be turned into ruins.

150
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,750
Taking me and my ambitions
along for the ride.

151
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,416
How can you do this?

152
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,833
[SAKYO] You should concentrate
on your own life, Kuwabara.

153
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,791
[KOENMA] Where are you going?

154
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,333
[COMPUTER] Stadium detonation...
thirteen minutes...

155
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,208
Stadium detonation...
thirteen minutes.

156
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,166
We can't waste time!
Or we'll be foundation!

157
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,458
[YUKINA] Keiko!
What's the matter?

158
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,416
You have to snap
out of it!

159
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,416
Keiko!

160
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,666
[KOENMA] Yusuke.
Can you help the girls?

161
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,833
Yeah, naturally.
What are you gonna do?

162
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,625
I still have a little
business to settle with Sakyo.

163
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,041
Don't get killed.

164
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,833
You heard the man, let's go!

165
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,166
Right!

166
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,166
Perhaps you should
let me help you.

167
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,958
See you around, Toguro.

168
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,166
[crowd crying out in panic]

169
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,875
[DEMON 2] Sakyo already closed
off the entrances!

170
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,250
[DEMON 3] Run through the
hole Urameshi made!

171
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,916
Stop the broadcast, Koto!
I wanna go home!

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,250
Never! In all my
years as announcer

173
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,583
I've sat through
a lot more danger

174
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,958
than a collapsing stadium.

175
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,166
I'll finish this broadcast!
It's my duty!!

176
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,375
No! I don't want to
die as a virgin!

177
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,750
Oh people! Juri's
just revealed a shocker

178
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,875
that I never would've guessed
with her popular stint

179
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,333
at the committee
cocktail lounge!

180
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,291
Well as dutiful
as I am to the awards,

181
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,666
I think this cause
is a little more noble!

182
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,333
[KOTO]
Let's find you a man!

183
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,291
[KOENMA] I want assurances.

184
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,166
This voluntary-death
bit is a little fishy

185
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,291
coming from a man like you.

186
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,916
[SAKYO]
Such a careful ruler.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,333
But motives aren't suspect just
because you don't understand.

188
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,708
[KOENMA]
Then explain.

189
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,416
I've been playing
my cards for longer

190
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,833
than you will ever realize,

191
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,750
and today Yusuke and Toguro
both had better hands.

192
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,291
It was all or
nothing from the start,

193
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,041
now I simply know
which one I receive.

194
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,750
How do I know the
plan ends with you?

195
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,916
Yes, you've been keeping
your informants busy.

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
And somewhere along the line,

197
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,750
you learned of
my humble aspiration

198
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,916
to dissolve the
barrier between worlds,

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,916
let demons of every size
cross to the human side.

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,291
Annul the careful order
your kind has enforced.

201
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,416
I find life would
be better that way,

202
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,250
and I know one
day it will be so.

203
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,833
But fortunately for
you I'm an egomaniac,

204
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,791
and won't let my
work go on without me.

205
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,000
This bomb is
linked to my lab

206
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,958
and will destroy all
the progress I've made.

207
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,625
[KOENMA]
Shizuru.

208
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,583
No, Sakyo, wait!

209
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,458
[SHIZURU] No!

210
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:29,916
Damn it...
Sakyo, don't leave!

211
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,250
[SHIZURU] Get off of me!

212
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
[crowd in panic]

213
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,666
What's up with these
demons going the wrong way?

214
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
It's like wading through
a pool of giant trout!

215
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
[KUWABARA]
Yukina's in trouble!

216
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,041
Hold on!!

217
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,166
[KUWABARA] Your loyal samurai
in shining armor is coming,

218
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,833
my loving sweet pea!

219
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,791
Hey, get out of my way!!!

220
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,583
Come on, you got
a death wish?!

221
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,958
Why'd Toguro miss?

222
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,750
Well, we might as well
follow his path.

223
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,291
She isn't responding
to anything.

224
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,875
Keiko? Keiko, honey?

225
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,833
We kind of have
an emergency here.

226
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,125
The girl's gone
absolutely catatonic.

227
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,916
I don't know what to do.

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,291
Keiko? Come on!

229
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,833
[YUKINA] Nothing.

230
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,500
[KUWABARA] Hey, Yukina!

231
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,291
I'm here to rescue you!
We can go whenever you want!

232
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,000
Kazuma! Something's
really wrong with Keiko!

233
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,750
She's not responding
to anything!

234
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,083
We can't get her to move!

235
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,583
[KUWABARA]
Yukina!!!

236
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,583
You're of no use.

237
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,791
Thank you very much, Hiei.

place for a party, guys.

Yusuke! Keiko's not well!

242
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,583
What?

00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,625
Post-traumatic stress,
and like everything else,

she excels at it!

Hey, Keiko.

00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,916
Did you hear me?
I said hey it's Yusuke!

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,041
We can go home now.

248
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,083
Well so much for that. Listen!

249
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,833
I'm sorry! But we don't have
any more time to talk!

250
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,875
Come on Keiko! Wake up!

251
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
Snap out of it will you?

00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,416
A thousand tons of rock
is about to fall on our heads!

253
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,625
And I'm sure you
already know this,

254
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,416
but that's kind of a lot!

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,333
I'm not sure, really.

262
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,333
We were so busy with Keiko,
I didn't see her slip away.

263
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,625
Sorry.

264
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,708
Hey, don't worry.
She'll take care of herself.

265
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,875
What's the hold up?

Uh-oh. I don't like this!

268
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,666
What now?

269
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,750
Get outta the way.
I'll bust through.

270
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,958
Yusuke, you know you don't
have strength left.

271
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,208
Well neither do you,
so what's our choice?

Damn it!

00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,791
How goes it, mate!

276
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,958
A lot better now, I guess.

277
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,500
Then don't just stand
there like a bludger!

278
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,750
Let's go! We can't let our
champion team get hurt now!

00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,416
Right he is! When the tourney
next around comes flying

280
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,708
we'll have to
face you ourselves,

281
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,166
and we'll have new
muscles on us and WHEW-WEE!

282

You'll go zipping and we'll
be the champions that one!

I didn't give
you a rock!

get whatever you wanted!

get a souvenir mug!

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,958
They couldn't haven given
us what we wanted anyway.

314
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,833
And uh, what
did we want again?

315
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,416
It's done!
We finished it Genkai!

316
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,000
[YUSUKE] That's it guys.
Well, all most.

317
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,166
The pain we lovingly
called the Dark Tournament

318
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,166
is now thankfully over,
now we can all go back home

319
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,875
and not have to look at
each other for a while.

320
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,541
Well give our last regards
to Hanging Neck island

321
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,458
and remember what
we lost and learned.

322
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,375
And just because Genkai

323
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,041
and Toguro took
their one-way passes,

324
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,583
doesn't mean they
won't be seen again.

325
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,541
They've still got a few
more words for each other

326
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,125
in Spirit World.

327
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:21,041
Look forward to that and more,
when Yu Yu Hakusho continues!
