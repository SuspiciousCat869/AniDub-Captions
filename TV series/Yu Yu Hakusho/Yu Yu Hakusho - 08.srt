[NARRATOR]
Recover three artifacts.

2
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,958
That is Yusuke Urameshi's first
mission as Spirit Detective.

3
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,541
After two desperate battles,

4
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,416
Yusuke defeated the demon Gouki
and won back the Orb of Baast.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,791
But the second
artifact required

6
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,125
much more than strength.

7
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,625
To save his dying mother,

8
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,125
Kurama offered his
life to the Forlorn Hope.

9
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,166
Yusuke asked the mirror
to take his own life instead,

10
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,208
and the mirror let him live.
Two down, one to go.

11
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,958
[HIEI] Their mistakes
were simple ones.

12
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,916
Gouki's was overconfidence,

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,458
and Kurama's,
sympathy for his human prey.

14
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,125
Well... I certainly won't
make the same mistakes.

15
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,916
My plan's too good for that.

16

[NARRATOR]
Shadow Sword.

17
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:44,041
Transforms any human it cuts
into the lowest level of demon,

18
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,833
a strong but sluggish creature.

19
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,250
Only the sword itself
can reverse the effect.

20
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,916
[HIEI THINKS]
It's better this way.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,791
The other two wouldn't
have the courage

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,875
to use the weapons
as they're intended.

23
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,833
I will... but first,
I'll kill Yusuke Urameshi!

[excited voices]

26
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,208
[YUSUKE] I'm still having
nightmares about that Gouki guy,

27
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,041
and most times
I don't even dream.

28
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,041
I gotta say, though,
your hand-thing really worked.

29
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,250
Without that trick,

30
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,583
I'd be limping around
for six more months!

31
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,375
They're just basic
healing powers.

32
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,916
All the good detective's
assistants have them!

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,250
[YUSUKE]
Really.

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,083
Do all the assistants
wear school uniforms, too?

35
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,416
Or do you just like
the little navy girl look?

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,458
Thought I'd fit the part

37
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,208
if I'm gonna follow
you around school all day.

38
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,541
Isn't it adorable?

39
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,875
Whatever you say.

Oh, I almost forgot!

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,583
What?

42
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,041
About Kurama.

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,291
His case was reviewed
by the punishment board.

44
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,875
Koenma has decided to
release him on good behavior.

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,250
That's great...

46
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,708
...all I gotta do now is
get back the last treasure,

47
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,333
and I've still got three days.

48
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,166
From monster guy--
what's his name?

49
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,875
Hiei. And listen
to me carefully...

50
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,875
He's the toughest one by far.

51
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,750
Both cunning and ruthless.

52
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,208
He'll do anything
to get what he wants.

53

There you are Yusuke.
Mr. Takenaka's looking for you.

You're the only one in class

00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,833
who hasn't turned
in his book report!

56
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,000
Gee that makes sense. Cause
I'm the only one fighting evil!

57
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,208
Hard to balance
school and work, huh?

No, not really!

to meet you in my own body!

person you are! When I saw you

00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,000
running through those
flames to save Yusuke

Do I know you?

his Spirit Energy--

about you or Spirit World!

thing I'm good for now?

It's the Jagan, a third

had a few setbacks.

But the end result is the same.

All three ancient weapons
of darkness are in my control.

will soon be bowing at my feet.

side. Was that a real hit?

impression it was a joke.

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,541
Oh but wait, you're not amused.

160
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,375
[YUSUKE THINKS]
He's so fast--

161
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,541
[HIEI]
And as for Keiko.

162
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,833
What?

163
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,750
Do you really think
I'd relinquish my hostage

164
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,625
without the reward?

165
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,750
Look at her closely Yusuke.

166
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,541
You'll see that
she's still mine.

167
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
[YUSUKE]
You're lying!

168
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,000
[HIEI]
Am I?

169
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,958
What is that thing?

170
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,083
I don't understand! How?!

171
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,000
[HIEI] You may have her body,
but her future is mine.

172
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,833
See I've struck her
with the Shadow Sword.

173
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,916
And once that Jagan
eye opens completely.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,458
She becomes a demon.

175
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,416
Not a very smart one I'm
afraid, but perfect for a slave.

176
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,250
Move!

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,083
I'll try to prevent
it from opening.

178
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,500
You go and punch his brains out!

179
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,416
[HIEI]
Yes.

180
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,083
You better punch
them out quickly

181
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,208
if you care about
your assistant.

182
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,833
I can feel her precious
energy draining fast, pity.

183
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,041
Her poor little body
is giving everything it has.

184
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,333
Soon you'll have a
girlfriend who's a demon

185
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,166
and an assistant who's dead.

186
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,875
Is that true?

187
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,458
[BOTAN] Don't worry
about me, Yusuke.

188
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,458
I'll stop it as long as I can.

189
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,541
Botan.

190
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,750
[HIEI: evil laugh]

191
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, that's IT!!

192
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,333
I'm glad you're so enthused.

193
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,875
The game will be more
exciting this way.

194
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,041
What game?

195
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,083
The hilt of
this sword is hollow.

196
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
Contained inside
is the only antidote

197
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,875
to stop the sword's effect.

198
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,416
If you get the sword,
the girl will live.

199
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,166
Fun, right? Think of
it as a little game of tag.

200
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,833
[HIEI THINKS]
Faster than I thought.

201
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,083
[HIEI] What happened
Spirit Detective?

202
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,125
You weren't that fast before.

203
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,041
This isn't a game,
dirt-face. Keiko's my friend.

204
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,083
Now I see.

205
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,041
You're a decent
fighter on your own,

206
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,250
but when your
friend's on the line

207
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,791
your strength increases greatly.

208
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,375
You're a team player.
A save-the-day super hero.

209
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,208
[HIEI]
I hate people like you.

210
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,125
And yes Spirit Detective,
I'll admit you surprised me.

211
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,458
But like a true amateur

212
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,875
you failed to take
advantage of the situation.

213
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,583
You didn't get back the sword.

214
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,708
A mistake that will prove fatal.

215
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,083
Because now that I know it

216
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,708
I won't be dropping my
guard any longer.

217
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,958
The world doesn't
give many chances.

218
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,583
You've just missed yours.

219
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,333
Are you done yapping yet?

220
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,208
Not quite!

221
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:40,958
Can you keep up?

222
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,958
Human eyes are so slow.
Come now! Where am I?

223
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,333
What's wrong? Do I confuse you?

224
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,041
Do I?

225
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,541
Now--You're dead!

226
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,541
[YUSUKE] See Hiei, that's
what I'm talking about.

227
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,041
Yap, yap, yap like you're
some crappy Pro Wrestler.

228
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,708
And then what happens?

229
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,166
You have to eat up all your
words. It's pretty dumb.

230
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,500
[HIEI]Consider
this a compliment.

231
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,000
I've never
transformed for a human.

232
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,375
What?

233
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,333
[BOTAN THINKS]
The monster inside her

234
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,041
must be feeding off
Hiei's energy!

235
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,291
I don't think I
can fight it much longer.

236
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,583
[BOTAN THINKS]
But I have to, I have to try!

237
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,375
Something's
wrong she's in trouble!

238
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,083
[HIEI LAUGHS]

239
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,333
[HIEI] Don't be alarmed,
Detective. It's just me.

240
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,208
Now that I'm
in my full demon form,

241
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,250
Keiko will join me any minute.

242
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,375
Never!

243
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,000
There's no reason
to be upset though.

244
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,166
I'll take you out of this world

245
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,791
long before you
ever have to see her!

246
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,791
Whoa, let's talk!

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,708
[KURAMA] That scent
is unmistakable.

248
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,750
Hiei must be desperate
to take that form.

249
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,416
Well this is new.

250
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,291
But maybe you could
get me green ones.

251
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,125
They'd match a lot better.

252
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,250
A joker to the end, aren't you?

253
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,708
Perhaps my Jagan
Tie Curse needs to be tighter

254
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,666
before you get serious.

255
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,791
I have a great idea.
How about I give you a choice?

256
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,666
What?

257
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,583
[HIEI]
I can end your life now.

258
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,916
Or if you prefer
I'll make you into a demon.

259
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,958
[HIEI] What's that?
You want me to choose?

260
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,875
Fine!!

261
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,750
[impact]

262
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,541
Kurama?

263
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,458
You really have gone insane!

264
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,083
[HIEI]
My eye! My Jagan eye!

265
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,916
Hey! I've come untied!

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,416
[KURAMA] The eyes on Hiei's body
are merely for amplification.

267
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,666
Without the Jagan
exposed on his forehead

268
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,083
his powers become useless.

269
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,041
Are you okay?

270
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,125
Fine only a minor
hole in my stomach.

271
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,791
You didn't have to do that!

272
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,625
I'm alive only because of you.

273
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,666
Please let me pay my debt.
You must handle Hiei.

274
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,041
I will use my powers to keep the
girl from transforming.

275
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,416
Kurama.

276
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,750
Kurama, how could you?

Take your problems up with me.

[HIEI THINKS]
What is this?

280
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,458
The more dangerous
the situation becomes,

281
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,250
the faster his
Spirit Energy grows.

282
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,500
I mustn't allow
this to go on any longer!

283
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,875
You see?

284
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,000
It doesn't matter how strong
you are if you can't hit me!

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,875
Damn it!

286
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,250
How sad!

287
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,708
After all this,

00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,833
you actually think
you can run away from me!

[HIEI] My, what
a well-kept secret.

296
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,541
Too bad all of your energy
was wasted on poor aim.

297
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,625
[HIEI CRIES OUT]

298
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,708
What happened?!

00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,791
Simple... I won.

300
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,916
But you missed--

301
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,541
The Forlorn Hope!

302
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,208
You reflected the shot.

303
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,708
Must have guessed exactly
the way that I would dodge.

304
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,208
I think that's what they
call watching your opponent?

305
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,208
You're pretty clever.

306

Goodbye Keiko Monster!

00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,875
She's going to recover.

308
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:18,625
I hope so. Thanks for all the
help Kurama. How do you feel?

309
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,125
Good I guess, I avoided
the organs at least.

310

[BOTAN] I still can't
believe what you did, Yusuke.

Why not?

312
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,041
Why didn't you
tell me the Spirit Gun

313
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,500
could bounce off mirrors.

314

When did you learn that?

315
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,291
Mmm... about ten minutes ago.

unless I could
shoot him from behind.

That's when I spotted the
Forlorn Hope in the corner,

321
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,625
and I thought,
hey I'd give it a try.

You weren't certain?

Well one time in science class
they bounced light off a mirror.

I thought it might be the same!

Might? You risked
our lives on a might?

326
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,541
What exactly would you
have done if the Spirit Gun

327
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,375
hadn't bounced off the mirror?

Get chopped in pieces I guess.

Hey watch it fox-boy!
What's that word mean, anyway!

A strategist is someone

the Shadow Sword
had bloodstains on it

and the Forlorn Hope
was a big mess of glass.

344
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,958
So what happened to Koenma?
Did he get a cruel punishment?

345
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,625
It wasn't anything too severe.

346
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,000
Just the normal punishment for
when he does something wrong.

347
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,250
What was it?

348
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,500
A hundred spankings.
