and he's wrapping
them around his body!

160
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,916
What is this?

161
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,500
I'm a master of earth,

162
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,500
and it makes for
excellent armor...

163
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,625
...of clay.

164
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,250
In addition to protection,

165
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,541
this armor turns my
whole body into a weapon.

166
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,500
Let me show you how!

167
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,666
[RISHO] Meteor!

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,791
NO!

169
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,708
I've seen bowling balls crash
into styrofoam with less force

170
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,375
than Kuwabara
just showed the ring,

171
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,416
thanks to that crunch from
Risho's Meteor attack!

172
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,625
However, Risho's down too,

173
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,541
hitting the ring like,
well like a meteor!

174
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,208
But Risho looks to be
unharmed and back on his feet,

175
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:31,500
and Kuwabara is definitely not!
Is this the end of his team?

176
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,208
[KOTO]
One!

177
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,583
[KOTO]
Two!

178
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,875
Three!

179
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,416
Four!

180
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,125
Five!

181
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,666
Six!

182
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,833
Seven! Oh wow, people!

183
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,333
Kuwabara's actually
climbing to his feet!

184
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,625
We've still got a
fight on our hands!

185
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,791
He's in pain!

186
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,958
I'm imploring you

187
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,875
as one heart-beating
creature to another!

188
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,375
Our friend is dying out
there! Please let us in!

189
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,416
No chance. You're all under
arrest for illegal entry,

190
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,916
and for the assault of an
extremely honorable employee.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,833
You mean that perv?!

192
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,375
They're hostile.

193
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,583
I say we take them down for
some demon-style interrogation.

194
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,958
[BOTAN]
Shove it!

195
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,250
[KOTO] Risho jumps into the
air for another attack!

196
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,791
It isn't safe!

197
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,875
Please don't hurt them!

198
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,958
Please! Spare them!

199
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,541
No!!

200
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,125
It's Toguro! Hey stop 'em!

201
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,208
Run along.

202
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,333
Sir! What'd you do that for?

203
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,916
Return to your stations.
She's with me.

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, of course sir!

205
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,333
We didn't know.

206
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,208
So, we meet again.

207
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,041
Better call the papers, huh?

208
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,291
That second meteor attack was
even stronger than the first!

209
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,958
Kuwabara's whole body
is doing the wiggle dance

210
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,750
and yet he still
tries to gets up!

211
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,541
[RISHO]
Why?!

212
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,625
Why don't you quit?!

213
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,500
[Kuwabara laughs]

214
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,500
You dummy!

215
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,375
Guess you haven't checked the
score for this round lately!

216
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,375
We got four wins
and you got two,

217
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,666
and the first
team to five advances.

218
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,666
Urameshi and Kurama
gave it all for us,

219
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,291
and now I still have a way
to bring it home for 'em!

220
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,875
He's going to kill himself.

221
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,666
See 'ya, Kuwabara!
You always were my favorite.

222
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,791
I don't follow what
this option is, sir!

223
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,166
I mean, I don't even see
how he's still standing!

224
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,708
The boy is using
the same strategy

225
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,541
Yusuke did in a previous case.

226
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,041
You know what I mean?

227
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
When he defeated the last
of those Saint Beasts, Suzaku.

228
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,916
[KOENMA] Yusuke was drained
of his Spirit Energy,

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,041
so he tapped into
his Life Energy,

230
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,583
a move that
would have killed him

231
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,000
if Kuwabara hadn't donated some
of his own life to save him.

232
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,041
But everyone still
has to fight this time!

233
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,875
Who's gonna save Kuwabara?!

234
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,291
That's right, Blue Ogre.

235
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,750
I'm afraid this
will be a sacrifice

236
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,125
of a more permanent kind.

237
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,500
I know what you're doing.

238
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,000
Using your Life Energy
will only delay this.

239
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,750
You're still going to die.

240
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,500
No joke, moron! That's the
whole point of this fight!

241
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,708
As long as
I take you with me!

242
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,708
What?

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,708
If this fight ends in
a draw, my team wins,

244
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,166
and the rest of
my guys get to live.

245
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,416
[KUWABARA] Hiei,
you're a little punk

246
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,875
and you always
said mean stuff to me.

247
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,250
But I know, underneath all
that junk, you're a good guy.

248
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,916
Kurama, you taught me a
lot with the things you said,

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,375
and there's nobody
more caring than you.

250
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
And Mummy fighter, person,

251
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,541
you saved those
guys from Dr. Ichigaki,

252
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,125
and that means a lot.

253
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,291
You didn't say much, but somehow
I really feel like I know you.

254
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,666
And Urameshi, well...

255
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,541
...just take care of
the rest of this, okay?

256
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,166
Don't you do this!

257
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,083
Let's not get
too upset, Urameshi.

258
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,333
I wanna keep my
finish nice and manly!

259
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,375
You ready, Risho?

260
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,333
It looks like this
intense team battle

261
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,375
is about to end in
the most exciting of ways!

262
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,500
[RISHO] Sorry boy, but
dying's not in my plan!

263
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,583
And this time Kuwabara's
charging as well!

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,916
Say hello to extinction.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,333
That's fine by me!

266
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,291
Kuwabara!

267
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,333
[KUWABARA THINKS]
Wait a second! Yukina!

268
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,500
Why am I thinking of her now?

269
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Must be my life
flashin' before me.

270
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,250
Sorry my love. I wanted
to protect you always.

271
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,708
[YUKINA]
Kazuma!!

272
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,916
[KUWABARA THINKS] That's weird,
I just thought I--

273
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
Hey wait! She's here!!

274
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,083
What on earth are
you babbling about?

275
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,166
I'm not babbling!
She's my girlfriend!

276
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,541
Hold on!

277
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,416
Kuwabara has just unbelievably
hurled Risho outside the ring!

278
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,791
What a come back!

279
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,291
Where has this sudden
surge of power come from?!

280
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,541
There's only one person who
calls me by my first name!

281
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,708
[YUKINA] We've been very
worried, Kazuma! Are you okay?

282
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,250
Yeah!

283
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,625
Yeah, I am never gonna
understand that bastard.

284
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,625
Well, it appears a
lady friend of Kuwabara

285
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,375
has come to witness
the brutalities!

286
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,375
They seem to be engaged
in small talk right now!

287
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,250
This is ridiculous!

288
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,708
I felt better right
when I saw you, my love!

289
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,416
Don't I look muscle-ly!

290
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,541
[RISHO]
Armor of Clay!

291
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,875
[KOTO]
Oh! Look out people!

292
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,250
Risho's stacking an
even larger coat of armor

293
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,458
on top of the first one!

294
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,250
Hey, my Spirit
Energy's coming back!

295
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,916
I think we all
know what this means!

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Try my Meteor Attack this time!

297
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,416
Spirit Sword!

298
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,458
What the...?

299
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,333
Eat my energy!

300
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,083
[KOTO] They're both out of the
ring! So I'll start the count!

301
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,666
You're just a no-good
cheater, Risho!!

302
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,833
So get out of my ring!!

303
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,833
[KOTO]
Five!

304
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,875
[KOTO]
Six!

305
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,208
Seven!

306
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,708
Eight!

307
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,333
Nine!

308
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,583
Ten!

309
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,125
Kuwabara is the winner!

310
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,958
And with five wins in the round,
the Urameshi Team advances!

311
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,041
But, I really like this island.

312
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,541
She's really here.

313
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,000
We're okay!

314
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,333
Not too bad!

315
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,166
Don't sneak up on me when
I'm breathin' hard, okay?!

316
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,333
I think I'm gonna
take a little nappy now.

317
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,916
So, what's the final word?

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,125
Will they be enough
to keep you entertained?

319
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,000
Not yet. Let's see
what Yusuke learns next.

320
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
Yeah! I showed Risho
who's the man, didn't I?

321
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,708
I'm the actual anchor
of our team, you know!

322
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,000
You did fight very
bravely out there.

323
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,291
I hope my healing
powers have taken effect.

324
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,625
Honestly, you're healing faster
than my new skills should allow!

325
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,083
That is the
power of love, baby.

326
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,333
I guess you're right.

327
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
[KUWABARA THINKS] She agrees!

328
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,375
She's finally admittin'
her love for me!

329
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,416
[YUKINA THINKS]
I wonder if Kazuma says

330
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,833
these funny
things to everyone!

331
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,291
Big clown.

332
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,833
All I'm saying

333
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,500
is you could at least have
dropped by our room or somethin.

334
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,416
It's not like we're on a stupid
field trip with chaperones.

335
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,916
Maybe I didn't
want to interrupt.

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,583
You seemed to be having
plenty of fun with those demons.

337
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,208
What? Since when does Keiko
want me to do what I feel like?

338
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,458
Since when does Yusuke
care what Keiko has to say?!

339
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,291
Hey! Why don't you try
not getting pissy with me?!

340
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,750
Why can't you have the guts
to tell me about these things,

341
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,416
so I don't have to
drag it out of Botan?!

342
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,458
Party pooper!

343
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,291
Cry-baby!

344
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,041
We're live at the tournament's
most exciting match yet!

345
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,250
[YUSUKE] Look, we've both
been doin' some growin' up

346
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,416
since we saw each other...
You for instance...

347
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,583
Is it just these pants or did
you really get a nice ass?

348
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,833
[KEIKO]
Yusuke, you jerk!

349
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,208
[KEIKO] Haven't
grown up that much!

350
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,541
[BOTAN THINKS]
Bad move by Yusuke.

351
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,958
[YUSUKE] Don't worry
about me. I'm okay!

352
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,791
Altogether I'd say it
was definitely worth it.

353
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,583
Oh shut up.

354
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,000
You know Yusuke...

355
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,500
I was impressed with
that move you pulled. Bang.

356
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,000
[NARRATOR] Yusuke and his team
have survived a punishing run,

357
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,083
and have finally earned
a few moments of rest.

358
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,333
But what awaits them now,

359
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,791
as the Dark Tournament

360
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,458
approaches its
final two rounds?

361
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,291
[YUSUKE] Let's see.

362
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,708
Surprises, first
encounters, surprises,

363
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,958
all of my friends making
fun of me, and more surprises.

364
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,666
That pretty much covers
what you can expect

365
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,458
when the Dark
Tournament rolls on.

366
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,541
We'll get a first glimpse

367
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,166
at the Toguro
brothers' whole team,

368
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,333
plus the jerks we
have to fight next.

369
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,333
Also, Koenma appears to
finally hatch my Spirit Beast,

370
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,458
and we get to see if it's a
fire-breathing monster or what!

371
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,125
And that's not all!

372
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,208
You know that
Masked Fighter girl

373
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,916
we could never figure out?!

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,666
Well, did I mention
the surprises?
