If you got mad and wanted
to blow up this whole world,

you could do that, and nobody's
strong enough to stop you.

So, I'm not gonna pretend I can
influence you when I can't.

to them that they can
protect or destroy.

beneath all your other feelings.

00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:01,000
She was Living World's
very first Spirit Detective.

133
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,500
Does she have seven
personalities, too?

134
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,916
She took a very different
path than Sensui,

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,833
and she's much more
like you than I am,

136
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,750
so maybe she can help.

Why do I even bother?

Can any of you children
tell me what happens

140
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,000
when you take one rotten apple

141
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,250
and put into a bowl
full of good ones?

142
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,958
They all go bad, real quick.

143
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,166
And class?

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,166
Urameshi is a
definitely rotten apple.

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,791
Keep your distance...

146
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,083
Or else you'll be
contaminated by his rot.

147
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,291
[KUWABARA]
Huh. Bad apple.

148
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,833
He'd sing a different song
if he knew how many times

149
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,125
Urameshi saved his rotten hide.

150
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,750
Wish he'd get over himself
and come to class, though.

151
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:01,458
Least then we could make
fun of this jerk together.

152

[MR. IWAMOTO]
But enough ranting,

gonna be scared of a stupid dog.

[KURUKO] Sorry about

Demon Energy.

You may have heard
of him; he's a novelist.

I'm in love with a movie star,
and want to marry him.

What?!

Yusuke is so strong now
that the best hope

to kill him would
be through ambush.

247

Poisoning, for example. But
even that would take some skill.

of hunting it.

for some kind of revenge,

[KUROKO]
You know, I met him once,

318
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,416
when he took over my position.

319
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,125
[KUROKO] Of course I
sensed how strong he was,

320
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,875
but he seemed... fragile. Like,

321
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,666
he was always thinking
so hard to stay afloat.

322
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,083
I won't pull that.

323
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,541
I know you won't have the
same problem as Sensui.

324
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,583
In fact, you just
need to get back

325
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,500
to how you were before
you fought with him.

326
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,958
Not really thinking at all.

327
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,041
But they fired me
as Spirit Detective.

328
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,000
[KUROKO]
Things will change.

329
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,208
They need you too much.

330
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,666
[KUROKO] Here, let my
husband read your future.

331
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,750
It's his hobby. He's good.

332
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,083
[SHOUGO]
Sure.

333
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,791
Let's have some fun.

334
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,583
May I see your hand
please, Yusuke?

335
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,166
Now, slowly turn your face
so you're looking at me.

336
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,750
Directly forward.

337
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,083
[SHOUGO]
Good.

338
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,750
[SHOUGO]
I see...

339
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,500
The world around you is nothing

340
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,208
you can complain
about. Peaceful.

341
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,625
Yet, for reason in your heart
that you can't fathom,

342
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,208
you yearn for danger,
then wonder if it's wrong.

343
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,375
Well, well... You are good.

344
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,208
But the more time you
want to spend thinking

345
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,458
and doing nothing,
the less you should think.

346
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,125
And the more want
to do something,

347
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,916
the less you should move.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,958
So is this fun for you?

349
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,791
[SHOUGO] It means whether
or not you want it

350
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
doesn't matter now, Yusuke.

351
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,875
The danger will come to you.

352
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,291
[KUROKO sighs]

353
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,791
You expecting anyone
to drop in tonight?

354
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,833
No... My editor is
supposed to come by,

355
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,916
but that's not
until the morning.

356
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,833
[crickets chirping]

357
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,916
[gasps]

358
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't hide.

359
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,208
[KUROKO] What business do you
have, coming into my home?

360
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,458
The business is not yours.

361
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,500
We've come for the boy,
now step aside.

362
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
Touou...

363
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,791
I do apologize
for my colleague.

364
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,500
It is uncivil for us to come
to you at such a late hour,

365
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,083
but we have little time to act.

366
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,208
I must explain
this all quickly.

367
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,458
His visit was a secret.

368
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,625
How did you know you
would find him here?

369
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,208
We've followed his
Demon Energy.

370
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,541
[YUSUKE]
Get to the point, cue ball.

371
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,083
What do you want from me?

372
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,916
[HOKUSHIN] We have come here
on a mandate from Demon World.

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,875
[YUSUKE gasps]

374
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,291
Demon World?

375
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,791
[SHOUGO whimpers]

376
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,958
I have come to tell
you your destiny,

377
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,666
and take you to the place
where you actually belong.

378
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,875
The place where I belong?

379
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:26,208
Yes. Not through jokes,
nor flight, nor fists...

380
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,750
...will you escape your call.

381
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,958
[NARRATOR] Three cryptic
visitors from Demon World

382
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,958
have tracked Yusuke down.

383
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,541
What is the destiny
they claim to know?

384
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,041
Is it the answer Yusuke needs,

385
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,625
or the start of
something more sinister?

386
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
[YUSUKE] Hell, if I
knew all I had to do

387
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,916
when I was feeling crappy

388
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,375
is call up a few
shiny-headed monks,

389
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,875
well I'd be a pretty
well-adjusted person.

390
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,333
In fact, I could start
up an 800 number.

391
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,083
Don't know what
you're doing in life?

392
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,916
Call the bald guy hotline!
They'll fix you right up!

393
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,916
So yeah, these guys are spittin'
out some insane answers

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,208
that could change
my whole life,

395
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,750
but that doesn't
mean I can trust 'em.

396
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,416
In fact, I just might
have to kick some ass!

397
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,416
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
