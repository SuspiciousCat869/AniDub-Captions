It's not a wonder why
Biggy was taking a

156
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,916
dive in the seats then--

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yusuke having punches like that
is enough to kill any mug.

158
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,083
Guess I'll just
rest up here a bit.

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,125
Think myself up another plan.

160
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,333
Hey!

161
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,583
Bingo!

162
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,583
I knew he'd do that!

163
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,625
Jin! Move, darn it!

164
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,333
Yes! In that stuttering,

165
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,041
off-guard position will Jin
be able to move back in time?

166
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,791
Not too likely!

167
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,166
That's right, I'm cool.

168
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,083
Always underestimating the wind.

169
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,583
Hey, I needed that!

170
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,000
Real heart-pounder that one was.

171
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,333
Did we get that on video?

172
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,166
Please tell me
we got that on video!

173
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
Jin just used a wall of wind

174
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,791
to turn Yusuke's
blast into a space cadet!

175
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,208
Don't get all big eyed.

176
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,041
Any attack has to travel
through air to get to me right?

177
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,208
I control the air so
you might as hand them over

178
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,041
and say do whatever
you want with them Jin!

179
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,416
[JIN] Do whatever you
want with them, Jin!

180
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,416
Urameshi's little light
shows won't do anything

181
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
against Jin's wind defenses now!

182
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,916
Good. I've been
waiting too damn long

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,750
to see that boy
get put in his place!

184
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,083
Not just him, either!

185
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,250
There's no one left on
Urameshi's team who can fight.

186
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,083
Once Yusuke's
finished, they all are!

187
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,791
Rip off his ugly human head!!!

188
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,875
Well they don't have to
act like it's already over!

189
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,750
Yes, I thought the: "Kill
Yusuke!" Chant was a lot better.

190
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,666
[KOENMA] I always thought of
wind as a sort of gentle breeze

191
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,000
on a summer's day kind of thing.

192
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,833
What about Hurricanes
and Tornadoes, Koenma sir!

193
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,250
Jet streams! Gale force winds!
That's serious!

194
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,833
Entire houses can be torn
to pieces like match boxes!

195
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,208
Pencils can be shot
through solid brick walls!

196
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,291
Calm yourself Ogre,
you're spitting on me.

197
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,416
Anyway, the problem here is that
Jin can use his powers over wind

198
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,208
for excellent offense and
defense against Yusuke.

199
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
That's not a happy combination.

200
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,375
So Yusuke can't use
his long range attacks

201
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,416
because Jin will
deflect them with wind.

202
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,041
Yeah the Spirit Gun is
pretty much a waste of time.

203
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,416
He'll have to stick to
the old fist-fighting action!

204
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,041
But every time Yusuke
gets close enough

205
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,083
for a final punch
Jin flies away!

206
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,541
Well yeah, that's true.

207
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,708
So how in the world is
he supposed to hit him??

208
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,041
I don't know Botan!
Don't yell at me!

209
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,666
The Spirit Gun should not be
completely useless against Jin.

210
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,291
There is one way to
get past his defenses.

211
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,041
But it will not
be exactly safe.

212
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,541
Don't have to worry about
Yusuke being afraid, at least.

213
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,000
Risking his life is the
only constant strategy he has.

214
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,333
Been a blast playing defender

215
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,250
but I think I'll
get on with my attack.

216
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,708
Here we go! Jin's winding up for
another smashing Tornado Fist,

217
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,375
but this time he's doing
it while still in mid-air!

218
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,291
Hope you're
thinking quick Urameshi!

219
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,958
[YUSUKE THINKS] There's
one way to do this.

220
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,958
[KOTO] Jin's on the move!
He's headed straight for Yusuke!

221
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,833
And yet the Spirit Detective
is refusing to back down!

222
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,958
He's not even guarding
himself! Has he gone berserk??

223
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,250
Don't be stupid Yusuke!

224
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
What is he doing??

225
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,625
Now I understand.

226
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,166
[JIN]
Hold on! Don't be crazy!

227
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,125
So, if he fires his attack
point blank into Jin's tornado--

228
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,083
The energy will be caught in
the wind current as it ignites,

229
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,250
causing the explosion
to surround them both.

230
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,875
[YUSUKE] Let's see who can
take a bigger ass kicking.

231
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,125
Spirit Gun!

232
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,458
[HIEI THINKS]
At least you tried.

233
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,541
[KOENMA]
Is it safe yet, Ogre?

234
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,333
I don't think you
want to look.

235
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,083
[KOTO]
Oh my, people!

236
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,000
Both fighters have been
obliterated in the explosion!

237
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:52,125
Nothing is left of their bodies!
Not even a pile of ashes!

238
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,916
Oh hell.

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,833
[KOTO] Wait! I stand corrected!
Yusuke Urameshi has survived!

240
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,958
Only Jin's been incinerated!

241
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,125
[KOTO] Never mind again!

242
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,708
Jin is alive and looking
quite perterbed!

243
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,125
I thought I was crazy Urameshi
but you take the prize!

244
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,333
The hell was that?

245
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,916
You don't make bombs
go boom in your face!

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Damn? At least one
of us should've died!

247
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,000
He is no amateur opponent.

248
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm not saying he is--
but that was a clean shot!

249
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,041
[HIEI] Yes. But Jin saw your
strategy in the last moment,

250
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,458
and took evasive action.
Rather than guard himself,

251
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,958
he tilted the air stream,

252
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,875
sending most of
the blast upward,

253
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,375
probably saving both your lives.

254
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,083
So he's funny and smart.
That hardly seems fair.

255
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,333
As a Shinobi he
has much experience.

256
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,458
A simple trick isn't
going to beat him.

257
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,916
I hope you have
more extensive plans.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,750
Ah, come on! It's Yusuke here!

259
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,791
I don't have a clue!!

260
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,208
You might not be so proud
after you're defeated.

261
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,041
Shut up. Something always
comes to me at the end.

262
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,500
Well yes,

263
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,833
even a fool has to admit a
certain truth to that, Yusuke,

264
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,125
so go ahead and be
as reckless as you want to.

265
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,666
If you do get killed.

266
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,458
I'll be taking your spot
in the next fight, anyway.

267
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,833
What?

268
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,125
Please-- even if
you could escape me,

269
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,250
it's illegal to return

270
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,958
after you've been
ruled unfit to fight.

271
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,541
[HIEI]
Illegal?

272
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
Listen Ruka.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,083
My power has nearly returned
and I'm going to fight.

274
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,416
And anyone who says otherwise...

275
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
Well, I think
you know the rest.

276
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,541
[MASKED FIGHTER] You truly have
a way with women, Hiei.

277
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,958
[KOTO]
Four!

278
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,541
Five!

279
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,750
Six!

280
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,041
Seven!

281
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,541
[KOTO] After seven counts
Yusuke returns to the ring!

282
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,583
Don't get too excited, Hiei.
I'm taking on their leader

283
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,666
just as soon as I beat down Jin.

284
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,083
Oh? Just as soon as
you beat Jin, you say?

285
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,291
Better pinch
yourself quick then.

286
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,666
Last I remember
it was you running

287
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,250
round the floor
tryin' to stay up.

288
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,625
Yeah, but this time
I thought I'd try.

289
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,750
[JIN] Funny man Urameshi!
Then I'll try as well!

290
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,041
[KOTO]
Fight!

291
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,083
Don't guess the finger gun

292
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,083
can handle two
these dallies at once?

293
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,125
[KOTO] Ooh, baby! Two Tornado
Fists buckled on at once!

294
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,125
Think we've got a challenge!

295
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,250
[YUSUKE THINKS] I'll say.

296
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,666
There's no way I
can deflect both

297
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
of those with my Spirit Gun.

298
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,083
Spirit Grenade Launcher,
maybe, but definitely not a gun.

299
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,250
Yusuke's having enough trouble
as it is with just one tornado.

300
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,958
Yeah, we better hope
that he's feelin' creative.

301
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,833
[YUSUKE THINKS] Two big
shots with one attack.

302
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,791
Come on Yusuke, you
know it's the only choice.

303
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,333
Even if you don't
really know how to use it.

304
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,958
[KOTO] Wait! Now
this is unexpected!

305
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,041
Yusuke is taking a stance
I've never seen him take before!

306
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,625
[MASKED FIGHTER THINKS]
He's going to try it!

307
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,083
Genkai's signature.

308

Yusuke's handled elements
of the move countless times

in his training,

310
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,916
but I know for a fact he's
never used its full form.

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
With his utter
lack of discipline,

312
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,250
Genkai was never led to
believe Yusuke was ready for it.

313
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,916
She still doesn't believe it,
I would even venture to say.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,916
The move could
definitely compete with Jin

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,875
but it could also destroy
Yusuke's body from within.

316
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,333
Holy smokes, that pose!

317
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,958
It does look curious
sir. Is it yoga?

318
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,000
It's a fighting stance, you oaf.

319
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,541
And it happens to be for
Genkai's greatest specialty.

320
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,291
I could never forget that one.

321
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,125
Uh, you're talking about the
Spirit Wave, aren't you sir?

Exact-amundo.

323
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,583
And Yusuke specifically
told me he hadn't learned it.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,083
He can stand upside down

325
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,791
with his thumb up
his ass for all I care.

326
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,000
He's not gonna win.

I never seen Urameshi

do that crazy stuff
with his hands before.

He certainly has a
history for surprises.

[JIN] Eye at the wind
on him now, so I say!

333
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,833
He's wrapping around like
a one big tornado of his own.

Whew and wee, and fun sorts!

Flying that power
like crazy he is!

[NARRATOR] After the long
and unusual battle,

339
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,083
Yusuke must brace himself
for one final charge.

340
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,958
Is he truly ready to
advance in his training,

341
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,583
and perform his
teacher's secret move?

[KOENMA] Greetings,
all you ordinary people.

Koenma speaking.

344
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,416
It looks like Yusuke's got
a mighty task before him,

345
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,291
in a crunch to perform
the incredible technique

346

that he was too lazy to
learn when he should have.

What? Not enough to
tantalize your senses?

It's Yusuke's first
rip-roaring Spirit Wave,

and some good
long-lost family drama.
