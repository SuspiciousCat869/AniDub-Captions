1
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:51,916
[APPARITION 1]
Did you hear?

2
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,666
Hina gave birth to twins!

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,333
[APPARITION 2]
And one of them is a boy!

4
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,625
[ELDER WOMAN]
He is a curse upon all of us.

5
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,250
My baby!

6
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,750
I beg you! Give him back to me!

7
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,208
Never.

8
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,083
The Imiko must be destroyed!

9
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,416
[ELDER WOMAN]
Rui!

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,000
Do not pity the beast.

11
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,333
[HINA]
I beg you, Rui! Don't!

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,708
No!

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,958
[HIEI]
That dream again.

14
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,500
[NARRATOR]
The three rulers of Demon World,

15
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,083
Mukuro, Yomi, and Raizen,

16
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,666
each summoned a warrior
from Living World...

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,583
Hiei...

18
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,791
Kurama...

19
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,083
...and Yusuke.

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,000
The recently fired
Spirit Detective

21
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,333
confronted his
dying ancestral father,

22
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,000
who tested Yusuke's strength,

23
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,958
only to tell him
it wasn't enough.

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,375
[yelling]

25
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,375
[NARRATOR] Now, Yusuke's
Demon-style training has begun.

26
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:39,291
I suggest you do not push
yourself so hard, Yusuke.

27
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,541
I suggest you shut up!

28
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,125
Don't you go
serious on me, Hokushin,

29
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,375
'cause if you are,

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,875
training with you is
a waste of my time!

31
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,916
[distant rumbling]

32
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,416
I'm not giving up
until I'm strong enough

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,708
to shred that
old bastard into pieces!

34
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,583
So what are you
punching bags waiting for?

35
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,375
Attack me, damn it!

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,333
I'm starting to think
he may be a bit stubborn.

37
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,666
[MUKURO] Like clockwork,
the sound of that mule's

38
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,416
ridiculous hunger strike.

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,750
Tell me, Kirin.

40
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,125
How is he holding up?

41
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,083
[KIRIN]
"He?"

42
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,250
Oh. You mean the one named Hiei,

43
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,000
who you called here
six months ago.

44
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,500
As we speak, he's being
attacked by hordes of our men

45
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,208
in the dungeon Training Hall.

46
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,166
[MUKURO] And how many of
our men comprise these hordes?

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
[KIRIN]
As my liege requested,

48
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,041
I unleashed five hundred
A-Class Demons,

49
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,750
which, if you'll
forgive me for saying,

50
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,833
sounded excessive, but he's
no doubt been killed by now.

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,083
[MUKURO]
Kirin.

52
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,916
How long have you been
my second-in-command?

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,750
[KIRIN] It's been two
hundred fifty glorious years.

54
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,083
[MUKURO]
I see...

55
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,750
Then you should know by now

56
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,166
that when I say five hundred
A-Class Demons,

57
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
I mean a thousand.

58
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,375
[KIRIN]
Pardon my insolence,

59
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,750
but why is Lord Mukuro
so interested

60
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,625
in this particular low-life?

61
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,625
He's shown nothing more
than A-Class levels

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,041
since he's been here.

63
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,958
[yelling]

64
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,375
[DEMON 1] I think we might
be the only ones left.

65
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,583
[DEMON 2]
Let's go! We can get him!

66
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,625
[DEMON 3] Hold on!
He'll fall asleep soon enough.

67
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,208
[DEMON 1] Fine, we'll attack
as soon as he's out.

68
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,416
[DEMON 2]
Now!

69
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,750
[DEMON laughing]

70
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,333
[DEMON choking]

[thud]

72
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,708
What a waste of time.

73
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,125
[RUI] Ice Apparitions
cloister themselves

74
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,875
on an island in the sky,

75
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,833
avoiding all contact
with the outside world.

76
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:01,708
[APPARITION 1]
Did you hear?

77
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,458
Hina gave birth to twins!

78
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,125
[APPARITION 2]
And one of them is a boy!

79
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,666
[APPARITION 3]
A boy? But that's impossible!

80
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,375
[ELDER WOMAN]
He is a curse upon all of us.

81
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,083
[APPARITION 2]
There's only one explanation.

82
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,875
Hina must have
snuck away from Ice World

83
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,000
and met a man.

84
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,500
[APPARITION 3]
How could that harlot do

85
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,625
such a disgraceful thing,
endangering us all like that?

86
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,791
[RUI] The Ice Apparitions
live in a world devoid of men.

87
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,833
Every one hundred years,
to each woman,

88
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,541
a daughter is born,
through immaculate means.

89
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,833
[crying]

90
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,791
[RUI]
The baby is always female,

91
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,375
unless the mother has violated
the laws of our society

92
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,333
and conceived
the child with a man.

93
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,666
[APPARITION 1]
Twins. One girl and one boy.

94
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,375
We've never seen
such an abomination.

95
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,875
[APPARITION 2]
What should we do?

96
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,125
[HIEI] I could see and hear,
even before I was born.

97
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,625
If I'd had the power then,

98
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,875
I would've set every one
of those cold women ablaze.

99
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,166
I wanted to.

100
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,750
My baby!

101
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,833
I beg you! Give him back to me!

102
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,250
Hina...

103
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,916
You have shamefully broken
our most sacred covenant.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You are too young to understand
how you have tainted us,

105
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,000
but I have seen the horrors
that men are capable of.

106
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,958
[HINA] This is my sin, please
don't punish my son for it.

107
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,125
The baby girl is yours to keep.

108
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,333
But the boy...

109
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,000
The boy is a curse,

110
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,916
and he will certainly
be our undoing.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,291
Then I'll leave here
forever and take my children,

112
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,291
and I'll promise
never to return again.

113
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,458
But please,
please give him back!

114
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,041
Never.
The Imiko must be destroyed.

115
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,333
[HINA crying]

116
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,958
[RUI] Our rules may be strict,
but not without reason.

117
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,583
Long ago, the ancients came here

118
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,375
to escape the harmful
influences of men.

119
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,458
We have been free
of vanity, abuse and war.

120
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,750
However, this security
comes at a high cost:

121
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,416
Total isolation.

122
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,333
The elders say there have,
in the past,

123
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,666
been boys born
through impure means.

124
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,791
In each case, the boy grew up
to be violent and cruel,

125
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,875
and the mother always
met a gruesome fate.

126
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,083
[ELDER WOMAN]
Rui...

127
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
I know that you
and Hina are close friends

128
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,875
and this is difficult for you,

129
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,041
but you must do this
for her own good.

130
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,708
And yours, and ours.

131
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,875
This Imiko--this boy of fire--
will slaughter us all.

132
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,166
But--

133
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,708
Do not pity the beast.

134
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,000
[HINA gasps]

135
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,916
You killed my son!

136
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,458
[HIEI] As I fell,
I willed myself to survive,

137
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,791
now that my nascent life
had a purpose.

138
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,875
I would live,
if only to see the day

139
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,541
that I would return
to that place

140
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,375
and kill every
last Ice Apparition.

141
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,666
[HIEI]
That dream again.

142
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,208
[MUKURO] You've made
quite a mess down here.

143
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,291
I'm running out of
A-Class Demons to sic on you.

144
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:26,458
Perhaps it's time we moved on
to a more powerful opponent.

145
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,041
[MUKURO] You've surpassed
even my expectations, Hiei.

146
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,833
But you still can go further.

147
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,875
You lack motivation.

148
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,166
Go figure--After six
months of this training,

149
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,166
I still don't know
what you want from me,

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,916
you odd mummy.

151
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,833
I don't know what
kind of Demon you are,

152
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,083
or for that matter, what you
even look like under there.

153
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
[MUKURO]
You want to see, don't you?

154
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,541
[MUKURO]
Don't worry.

155
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,000
There's no big revelation,

156
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,375
shocking or trite like
"I am your father."

157
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,875
But maybe it's time you
saw my face for what it is.

158
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,791
[MUKURO] A challenge:
I'll bring you one more warrior.

159
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,166
If you reclaim your potential,
you might even be in his class.

160
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,125
If you beat him,
I'll show myself,

161
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,875
hiding nothing from you.

162
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,416
And he just... has to die?

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,333
[MUKURO]
That's it.

164
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,291
[MUKURO] In addition to the
hundreds of expendable soldiers

165
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,791
you've already met
and done away with,

166
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,375
I always maintain a group of
seventy-seven elite warriors

167
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,041
as my select guard.

168
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,833
I'll bring one of them
here for you to fight.

169
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,916
If you defeat him,
I'll unmask myself.

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,041
And I'll give you
the distinct honor

171
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,041
of taking his place
on my select guard.

172
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,958
I have no use
for honors or distinctions.

173
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,875
They're nothing
but meaningless tokens.

174
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,000
[MUKURO] I think you
might change your mind.

175
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,375
You'll find this particular
"meaningless token"

176
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,625
opens many other doors.

177
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,333
You'll have a much easier time
finding what you seek.

178
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,708
[MUKURO] I'll return in five
minutes with your challenger.

179
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,625
[HIEI]
Eerie beast...

180
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,250
The way he spoke...

181
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,375
I wonder how much he really
knows about my quest.

182
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,125
[YUKINA] Mr. Hiei,
may I ask you something?

183
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,500
If you happen to come across
someone in Demon World

184
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,833
who carries a stone like mine,

185
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,833
would you please
give this to him?

186
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,041
It's sacred.
It belonged to our mother.

187
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,750
[YUKINA]
An Ice Apparition sheds a tear,

188
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,791
only one, at the moment
she gives birth to her baby.

189
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,416
When that tear crystallizes,

190
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,458
it appears different from
the ordinary Hiruseki Stone,

191
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,583
and is given to the child.

192
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,000
But I was told that
when my mother had twins,

193
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,041
she shed two tears.

194
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,958
[YUKINA]
I wear one around my neck,

195
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,708
and the other stone is
supposedly held by my brother...

196
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,291
Wherever he is.

197
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
[HIEI] I'm surprised
you managed to keep it

198
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,458
from the greedy human swine.

199
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:24,166
[TARUKANE laughing evilly]

200
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,041
[YUKINA] I hid it where
he could never find it:

201
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,583
My stomach.

202
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,250
[HIEI] So if it's
that important to you,

203
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,333
why are you giving it to me?

204
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,166
[YUKINA] Even as a baby,
my brother was surrounded

205
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,083
by an intense flame.

206
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,708
It was so intense that they
wrapped him up in sacred cloth,

207
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,958
and tucked his stone inside.

208
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,333
That's what Miss Rui told me.

209
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,041
Rui?

210
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,125
Oh... She was my
mother's closest friend.

211
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,958
[HIEI]
The woman who left me for dead.

212
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,041
[YUKINA]
Mr. Hiei?

213
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,666
So... as I was saying,

214
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,708
if his Demon Energy
was so radiant even then,

215
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,208
then he shouldn't
be so hard to find

216
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,791
with your gifted eye.

217
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,000
So if you see someone
with the same stone,

218
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,291
would you please
give that to him,

219
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,166
and tell him his sister
is looking for him

220
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,291
in Living World?

221
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,666
He's been missing
for years, correct?

222
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,625
What makes you think your
brother isn't just dead?

223
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,625
I believe he's alive.

224
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,583
[HIEI]
Yes.

225
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,000
But why?

226
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,166
Uh...

227
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,166
It's something that
Miss Rui had said to me.

228
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,333
[RUI]
I could tell that he understood

229
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,208
every word we were saying.

230
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,750
And he will come back
for his revenge.

231
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,791
She was confident and so am I.

232
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,583
[RUI]
When you come back,

233
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,916
seeking the revenge
that you, and we, deserve,

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,541
please kill me first.

235
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,125
It's the least I can offer to
atone for what I'm about to do.

236
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,500
[ELDER WOMAN]
This Imiko--this boy of fire--

237
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,125
will slaughter us all.

238
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,500
[ELDER WOMAN]
Do not pity the beast.

239
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,458
[YUKINA] If the only way
our Ice World can survive

240
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,750
is for our people
to freeze their hearts...

241
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,125
Well then...

242
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,166
They don't
deserve to survive.

243
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,875
That's how I feel.

244
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,125
[HIEI] So that's the
real reason why you left?

245
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,958
And all that crap
about you being "allowed"

246
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,125
to stay in Living World
to look for your brother

247
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,041
was just a lie.

248
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,125
[YUKINA]
Uh...

249
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,291
Never depend on others.

250
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,083
If you want them dead,
then do it yourself.

251
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,916
Quit waiting for a phantom twin
who for all you know is dead.

252
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,625
I guess you're right.

253
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,916
Thank you... Hiei.

254
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,291
I think...
that's the sort of advice

255
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,750
a girl might get
from her brother.

256
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
[HIEI]
My stone should be emitting

257
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,833
a powerful Demon Energy,

258
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,166
but I still haven't been
able to track it down,

259
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,333
even with my Jagan Eye.

260
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,666
I suppose there's the
chance that whoever has it

261
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,333
is hiding it as Yukina did--
in their stomach.

262
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,208
[MUKURO]
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

263
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,041
[gasps]

264
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,083
It's you.

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,791
[HIEI]
Shigure, surgeon of the damned.

266
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,875
So how long have you been
working for old bandage face?

267
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,375
[SHIGURE] Since shortly after
you left my services, Hiei.

268
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,250
[MUKURO]
You two know each other?

269
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,458
Well, strictly on
a doctor and patient level.

270
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,541
At the time, I did show him
how to swing a sword correctly.

271
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,458
Though...

272
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,541
From what I've seen,

273
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,166
he's made a few
improvements since then.

274
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,333
[MUKURO]
Fascinating.

275
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,708
But I must admit,
your recovery astounds me.

276
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,125
Can you really be the same
Demon I gave the Jagan Eye?

277
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,541
Performing a transplant's
like giving new life.

278
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,166
The process is a rebirth,
so to speak.

279
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,333
Afterwards,
the patient's power is reduced

280
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,458
to that of an infant.

281
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,208
As I recall,
you were no different.

282
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
When you left me,
your Demon Energy

283
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,041
had dropped to almost nothing.

284
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,875
Yet here you stand before me
only a few years later,

285
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,291
your power even greater
than it was before the implant.

286
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,458
Truly astonishing.

287
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,250
What can I say--
I've never really been one

288
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,291
for lots of bed rest
or homemade chicken soup.

289
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,166
[SHIGURE] I see you finally
found your mother's tear.

290
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,333
This isn't mine.

291
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,541
[SHIGURE] Oh...
then it must be your sister's.

292
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,958
Which means, at least,

293
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,166
you've found one of the
things you were looking for.

294
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,083
[MUKURO]
Interesting...

295
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,958
Tell me more.

296
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,458
[SHIGURE] Hiei came to me,
and asked for the Jagan Eye.

297
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,916
It was in order to help
him locate two things.

298
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,625
[MUKURO]
And they were...?

299
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,333
[SHIGURE] Number one: The Ice
World where his people lived.

300
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,875
And two: The stone
his mother had given him.

301
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,958
Now you see, I consider
the surgeries I perform

302
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,916
to be unique works of art,
poetry, really, if anything.

303
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,333
[SHIGURE] So all I ask
in return for my services,

304
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,958
as a modest fee, is an
ironic twist to finish it off.

305
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,500
In Hiei's case,
even if he found his sister,

306
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,625
he could never
confess who he was.

307
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,000
[MUKURO]
An ironic price, indeed.

308
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,541
But I will refund my fee

309
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,250
this one time
if you can defeat me.

310
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,125
That's very generous of you,
but I told you before...

311
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,208
I never had any intention of
telling her I was her brother.

312
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,125
Yes, but that
was before you met her.

313
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,375
[MUKURO]
Enough reminiscing.

314
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,958
This is a battle, and I
determine the stakes.

315
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,416
You will each be
fighting for your life.

316
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,541
[MUKURO]
Hiei.

317
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,375
You have the ability
to survive this.

318
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,625
But only if you reach
the strength you did

319
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,375
when fighting for
the pain of your friend.

320
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,208
Now you must
fight for your pain.

321
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,041
Bear yourself to me, and I will
help you find your answer.

322
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,875
[MUKURO]
Prepare yourselves!

323
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,000
[NARRATOR] Amidst haunting
memories of Hiei's dark origins,

324
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,375
a face from his past has
unexpectedly returned.

325
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,375
Is it coincidence, or the
mysterious workings of Mukuro?

326
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,041
In eerie telepathy,
Mukuro beckons Hiei

327
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,750
to dig deeper into
his subconscious.

328
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,541
But what are Mukuro's
true intentions?

329
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,416
[YUSUKE] I gotta say that this
has all been very educational,

330
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,666
and who said learning
couldn't be fun?

331
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,875
We're getting all kinds
of deeply personal things

332
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,208
about old short stack
that I'd never get from...

333
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,000
You know... talkin' to him.

334
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,958
And as much as I love watching
Hiei get his butt kicked,

335
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,541
I think I'm looking
forward to finding out

336
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,833
all about his past even more!

337
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,375
Oh, and Hiei's not
the only one wondering

338
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,666
what's underneath
Mukuro's bandages.

339
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,541
But we'll have to wait
'til the next episode

340
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,208
of Yu Yu Hakusho
to unravel that.
