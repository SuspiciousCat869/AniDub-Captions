killed in a car accident.

He awoke as a ghost,

chance to regain his life

00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,833
by hatching a
dangerous Spirit Beast

that fed off his own energy.

8
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,875
The Spirit Beast probably
would have eaten him alive.

But Yusuke used the power of the
egg to save Keiko's life,

Not just yet.

are lower than most people.

If you miss this
chance tomorrow,

you'll have to wait
a while to realign.

And in order for that to happen

you'll need someone in the

00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,333
[BOTAN] I can't let
Yusuke give up now.

160
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,541
There's got to be a way to--

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,958
If this won't do it
I don't know what will!

162
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,541
Wait! Botan!

163
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,250
Just hang tight! I have an idea
that could still make this work!

164
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,208
Doesn't she know when to quit?

165
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,000
[KEIKO THINKS]
It's gotten so late.

166
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,541
[KEIKO'S MOM]
Yu-ske.

167
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,416
[KEIKO'S MOM]
Yusuke.

168
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,041
You must save him.

169
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,375
His time runs out at twelve.

170
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,416
Remember what you dreamed.
It was more, than that.

171
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,666
Keiko, you must not be afraid.

172
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,625
Believe.

173
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,875
[KOENMA]
Five more minutes.

174
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,500
What will you do if
she doesn't make it in time?

175
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,583
The only thing I can do.
Wait around another fifty years.

176
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,250
Then I'll go see Keiko
when she's an old hag.

177
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,458
The mother was asleep so she
was tuned to the Spirit World

178
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,500
I relayed the
message through her.

179
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,958
Will she make it?

180
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,791
[KOENMA] It is now
eleven fifty-seven.

181
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,333
She's only got three minutes!

182
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,250
[KOENMA] Actually,
make that two minutes.

183
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,708
Eleven fifty-nine!

184
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,166
It's, too late!

185
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,833
Got it!

186
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,083
[bell tolls]

187
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,583
[KEIKO]
He's fading!

188
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,208
Yusuke!!

189
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,916
Keiko!!

190
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,375
Please come back, I need you.

191
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,250
Yusuke please, Yusuke.

192
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,041
No don't go. No.

193
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,000
[KEIKO]
Yusuke!!

194
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,666
[KOENMA]
She didn't make it.

195
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,708
Hey, nice kiss.

196
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,833
Yusuke!

197
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,625
[BOTAN]
She barely made it.

198
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,291
I was holding my
breath and everything.

199
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,416
Well I guess this case is over.

200
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,041
KOENMA]
Don't be crazy Botan.

201
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,250
This boy's case is only
beginning, didn't you know?

202
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,000
The real ordeal
will be much harder.

203
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,041
Let's see how our
little Yusuke fares

204
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,375
when he's not
floating in the sky.

205
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,291
My feet are so heavy
they're stuck to the ground!

206
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,250
Man I love gravity!

207
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,875
Pardon us sir, could
we borrow a little cash?

208
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,208
See we've lost our wallets
and we need to call our moms.

209
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,583
You remember how the Golden
Rule works, don't you?

210
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,208
Just give us all the money
you've got on, okay?

211
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,375
Are you guys talking to me?

212
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,583
I mean you see me?

213
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,916
Who else would we be
threatening, buddy?

214
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,291
I can talk trash to
people and even touch them!

215
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,208
To be alive is
a wonderful thing!

216
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,708
How dare you!
You can't touch me!

217
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,458
Leave him alone. It isn't
right to mess with crazies.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,458
[Yusuke laughs]

219
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,875
[BOTAN]
This way.

220
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,750
Yes, over here.
Do you have a minute?

221
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,250
Who, me?

222
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,250
Indeed.

223
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,375
Alright.

224
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,791
[BOTAN] You are born under the
influence of an unusual star.

225
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,666
Your life energy is somehow
different from other people.

226
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,583
You don't say.

227
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,750
[YUSUKE] Maybe I
should tell her I've been

228
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,000
dead for a couple weeks.

229
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,458
That would throw her.

230
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,750
[BOTAN]
No it wouldn't.

231
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,041
You have a mission
to accomplish, young man.

232
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,666
[BOTAN] Where are you
going? I'm not finished!

233
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,416
Sorry, but no missions for me.

234
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,291
All I'm doin' now is
some good old R and R.

235
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,958
[door opens and rattles bell]

236
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,791
[STUDENT 1] All those guys are
from Rugafuchi Junior High.

237
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,416
[STUDENT 2] Yeah, they
come here all the time now.

238
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,750
[STUDENT 1]
I hear they're trying to take

239
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,250
over the turf from Kuwabara.

240
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
[STUDENT 2] No way! Man,
we better get out of here.

241
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,125
[STUDENT 1] If only Yusuke
Urameshi was still alive.

242
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,791
[YUSUKE THINKS] These are
definitely kids from Rugafuchi.

243
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,541
I see they've been taking
advantage of things

244
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,083
while I've been gone.
Nice of them.

245
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,541
[WAITRESS] Here you go.

246
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,416
[YUSUKE THINKS]
From the way they're sitting,

247
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,708
I'd say four-eyes
there is the ringleader.

248
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,250
What the--

249
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,375
that guy's got horns!
That's not normal.

250
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,458
Oh well. Not gonna ruin my day.

251
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,458
Aye, Kuwabara's
later than usual.

252
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,166
Yeah, maybe he's
not gonna come after all.

253
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,250
So what makes you so sure he'll
follow your orders, Sakamoto?

254
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,750
[SAKAMOTO] Simple, my boys.
I'm playing with a loaded deck.

255
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,666
And as evidence of
his great loyalty,

256
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,416
I'm having him steal a
comic book from

257
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,791
the most guarded store in town

258
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,500
and bring it to me.

259
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,375
[YUSUKE THINKS] Oh,
give me a break, horn-boy.

260
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,333
Everyone knows
Kuwabara doesn't steal things.

261
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,666
It goes against his honor code.

262
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,208
[KUWABARA] Eikichi! Eikichi!
Where are you?!

263
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,125
She's safe here with me.

264
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,791
Now let's see what
you've got there.

265
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,541
[KUWABARA]
There!

266
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,041
I got you several kinds!
I didn't know what you liked.

267
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,791
Well, isn't that very
interesting, Kuwabara?

268
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,416
Didn't know they gave
receipts for stealing.

269
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,708
[KUWABARA] What
difference does it make?

270
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,625
I got you the comic books,
now give me Eikichi!

271
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,916
Fool. You've missed
the point entirely.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,333
I was trying to teach you
the thrill of stealing things.

273
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,625
This is not
what we agreed upon.

274
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,541
[SAKAMOTO]
Now apologize.

275
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,333
You heard me. Get on your knees
and apologize for being wrong.

276
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,875
--What?!
--Never!

277
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,666
Don't push it, Sakamoto!

278
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,708
[KUWABARA]
Quiet!

279
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,333
Kuwabara, don't.

280
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:12,375
I'm, sorry Sakamoto.
I was wrong.

281
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,958
[SAKAMOTO] What's that?
You were mumbling.

282
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm sorry I was wrong!!

283
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,291
[YUSUKE THINKS] Whoa.
This Eikichi girl must be

284
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,625
somethin' special to
make him sink that low.

285
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,083
You're pathetic.

286
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,416
Ya' might as well give
us your backbone too.

287
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,875
I just can't believe
you're doing all that

288
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,333
for a retarded fuzz-ball.

289
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,083
Eikichi!!!!

290
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,041
Please don't hurt her! I'll
do anything you want me to do!

291
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,416
How did such a pathetic loser
become boss on this turf?

292
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,041
Hey who you
callin' a pathetic loser!

293
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,291
Kuwabara would knock
your teeth out

294
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,583
if you'd just fight
him like a man!

295
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,208
It's wrong. Playing off
Kuwabara's love for kittens!

296
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,833
You want her?

297
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,833
You mad? Then why don't
you do something terrible?

298
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,708
I think you'll find it fun
if you do it once or twice.

299
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,416
It gives you a
thrill like no other.

300
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,958
Boss sure has gotten
weird in the last couple weeks,

301
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,291
but you gotta admit
he's getting the job done.

302
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
At this rate we'll
rule the whole city soon!

303
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,416
[SAKAMOTO'S BOY 1]
Yeah, Kuwabara's a sinch.

304
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,083
I'm just glad that
other guy got hit by a car.

305
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,375
[thugs laugh]

306
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,541
Well let's not
dwell on dead people.

307
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,541
Terrorizing the living
is much more entertaining.

308
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,666
[KUWABARA] Just tell me
what you want, Sakamoto!

309
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,833
I don't care what, as long
as you give me Eikichi.

310
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:28,583
Good, this will be your last
order. Hit your three friends.

311
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,000
What?

312

[EIKICHI] They've been staring
at me ever since we met,

313
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,458
I think it's very rude.

314
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,333
So hit them until I say stop.

315
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,291
Now. Hit them.

316
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,666
[KUWABARA] No. I could
never do that to them.

317
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
Fine, do it!

Hit them! Or else say
goodbye to your cat!

00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,708
Hit us Kuwabara! We can take it!

322
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,583
We'll just act like
it's Sakamoto hitting us,

323
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,333
and we'll get him back!

That's right. We owe you anyway.

No. That goes against my code.

You heard him! Kill the cat!

Where'd he come from?!

Don't you want to talk?

You know, I think you're right.

I didn't want to
talk to you either.

You're an embarrassment.

And what's with

And they certainly can't
pick me out of the air!

You're breaking the rules!

His name is Jyaki.

He is a ruthless criminal.

Wanted for five previous
convictions in the Spirit World.

355

He burrows into the evil
portions of a human's soul,

00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,166
and makes them do his bidding.

Hey you're that fortune-teller
from the alley!

[BOTAN] Yes, and you've proven
to be the one we're looking for.

Jyaki is very hard to find
once he's entered a human.

We've been tracking
him for weeks.

you catch the criminal,

knew the crime.
