See ya! I have to go
save the world again.

I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

For the second time today I
hold your life in my hands.

160

Somehow I doubt this Sensui
will be as merciful as I.

[Hiei laughs]

162

Kuwabara needs me.

163
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,250
Kuwabara was ill-prepared

164
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,541
for them and look
what happened to him.

Shut up!

Do I have to kill you to
keep you from being foolish?

You just might, Hiei!

since our last fight.

[YUSUKE] Well, that's
mildly disgusting.

You rose to the challenge.

174
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,291
It seems you haven't
lost your Spirit Power.

175
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,583
You just needed a
bit of a kick in the ass.

176
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,250
You mean you stalled me here
just to see how strong I am?

You really are a simple
child aren't you?

You still don't get it.

179
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,875
Do you remember when you fought
Toguro in the tournament,

180
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,041
and we let you think that
Kuwabara had been killed?

181
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,166
Back then, you lacked
the motivation

182
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,833
to reach your potential.

183
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,125
[HIEI] And Toguro went out of
his way to bring it out.

184
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,791
Sensui just wants you dead.

185

Harness your own power
if you hope to beat him.

If you take anything from
our scrimmage, take that.

187

So go--save the living world.
Or don't. I don't really care.

You're so full of crap!
"I don't care."

You've been
rooting for me!

193

You did all this to
help me survive!

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,750
I told everyone you would
come back to rescue us

195

when we needed you the most,
you big softy!

Or should I say
little softy?!

[HIEI THINKS] I should
have slit your throat

Really, thank you, Hiei. I was
needing that kick in the ass.

[YUSUKE]
Hey!

Where do you
think you're goin'?

Now that your little secret's
out, there's no reason...

Look, what I'm
trying to say is

204
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,500
that I could really use
your help on this one.

205
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,458
Kuwabara could really
use your help on this one.

206
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,333
But I hate Kuwabara.

207
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,041
[HIEI] You do them one
favor and they think

208
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,375
you're their best friend.

209
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,750
This is why I could care less

210
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,791
if their entire species
was swallowed up.

211
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,041
If you hate our kind so much,

212
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,666
I know of a videotape
that might interest you.

213
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,625
What tape would that be?

214
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,583
Oh, it's just a little snuff
film you may have heard of,

215
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,041
called Chapter Black.

216
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,958
Now that I think of it,

217
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,458
Kurama did say you tried to
get your bandaged hands on it.

218
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,625
It's outta print but
Sensui's got a copy.

219
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,083
I could get it for you.

220
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,583
The most forbidden contraband
in all of Spirit World?

221
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,791
You think they'll let
you walk out with it?

222
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,416
Think about it for a sec.

223

In all the rush of
the aborted apocalypse,

224

that stupid tape will
be the last thing

is thinkin' about.
