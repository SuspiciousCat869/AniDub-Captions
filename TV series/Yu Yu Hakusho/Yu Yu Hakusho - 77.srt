00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,208
[NARRATOR] Seven psychics
are forging a tunnel

2
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,000
between the human
and demon worlds,

3
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,333
hoping to destroy
the human race.

4
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,083
One of the psychics, Sea Man,

5
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,208
ambushed Kuwabara and
his school friends,

6
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,708
with Kuwabara's
powers still M.I.A..

7
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,083
But there was reason his
energy had been dormant.

8
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,375
A new power had
been forming in him,

9
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:57,041
and it awoke to dispel Sea
Man's Territory and prevail.

10
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,250
Back at Yusuke's apartment,
the group interrogated Sea Man.

11
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,541
Like the Doctor,

12
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,375
he was a friendless
human who had been turned

13
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,583
against his own kind

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,750
by watching a video
called Chapter Black.

15
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,000
But that was not all,

16
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,708
as Koenma revealed the
head villain's identity.

17
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,958
[KOENMA] Shinobu Sensui...

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,875
He was the Spirit Detective of
the earth before you came along.

19
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,625
An enemy just like you.
I wasn't prepared for that.

20
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,541
Look, Botan, no more
innocent acts.

21
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,958
What the hell is this?

22
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,000
Why me?

23
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
You help Spirit
Detectives, right?

24
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,166
You must've been with this guy.

25
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,208
In those days I was
just a simple grim reaper.

26
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,750
Oh give me a break.

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,666
What good's an assistant if
they can't dish out the gossip.

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,000
You might as well
have stayed on your oar.

29
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,208
Well maybe I should.
I liked that job.

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,916
It takes sacrifices being
in human form all day.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,750
Let's try to stick to
the subject of Sensui.

32
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,791
Fine, in that
case I'm useless!

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,708
Meow!

34
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,458
Koenma better come soon.

35
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,000
If I keep sitting
with these kids,

36
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,125
I'll find a new use
for my Spirit Wave.

37
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,125
Koenma sir!

38
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,041
Are you sure you
have to go there?

39
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,541
[KOENMA] Of course
I'm sure, you dolt.

40
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,583
I picked and trained
Sensui myself.

41
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,291
It's my mess to clean up.

42
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,833
Besides, we now
know for sure now

43
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,250
he has the Chapter Black video,

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,208
and he's using it against us.

45
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,000
Just imagine if that footage
got out to the human public.

46
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,125
But your father has ordered
you to remain here!

47
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,375
You'll get a
hundred spankings!

48
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,291
If that's the worst I get from
this, I'll be a happy camper!

49
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,000
You'll come back
soon sir right?

50
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,833
I think our dynamic
was really improving.

51
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,375
[KOENMA] Ogre,
you're a fruitcake.

52
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,750
But what should I tell
your father if he returns?

53
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,208
[KOENMA] You think of something.
You're big and blue.

54
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,500
But George wants
to go with you!

55
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,500
[KOENMA] George stands
out in Human World

56
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,250
like a heifer in
a beauty pageant.

57
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,416
[BLUE OGRE]
How 'bout now?

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,333
[KOENMA] Now you look like
you're gonna flash somebody.

59
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,541
[KOENMA] This might
be the time for me now.

60
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
In fact, this might
be the time for us all.

61
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,041
You take care
of things here,

62
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,375
and hopefully I'll have
a home to come back to.

63
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, sir, please be careful.

64
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,833
All those times I hated you,
I only half meant it.

65
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,291
[KOENMA]
Likewise. Sort of.

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,166
[BLUE OGRE] I promise
I'll see you again!

67
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,208
[SHIZURU] That should
keep you from falling apart.

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,875
Just no jumping jacks.

69
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,166
Oh dear, that's the
last of the bandages.

70
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,833
I'll go grab some more
from the drug store.

71
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,916
Great, I'm sure
we'll need them.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,208
Want to come
with me, Puu?

73
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,250
[PUU]
Puu!

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,250
[KUWABARA] Let's hear the
down and dirty on this guy.

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,458
Like what circus of
freaks was he raised by

76
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,125
that let him grow
up as a traitor.

77
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,208
I know you must have taken
great care to commission

78
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,875
him as a Spirit
Detective, Koenma.

79
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,208
How did he turn from
humanity's protector,

80
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,250
to its greatest threat?

81
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,125
Exactly! Or in
other words...

82
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,166
How'd you manage
to mess up so bad

83
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,291
the whole world's in danger?

84
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,041
Ow! It's hurting again!

85
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,750
Shut up and let him talk.

86
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
[KOENMA]
In all my reign,

87
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,583
nothing has seemed more natural
than choosing Shinobu Sensui.

88
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,291
He was a child prodigy.

89
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,541
Like you, Kuwabara,

90
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,750
he could sense apparitions
from a young age.

91
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,333
And they were drawn to
him like magnets.

92
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:34,458
But Sensui had something more.
He could destroy them.

93
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
[train horn]

94
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,083
[monster laughs]

95
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,958
You've come to me
like countless before you,

96
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,125
with selfish
and spiteful souls...

97
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,458
And just like them,
you have been judged.

98
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,500
[KOENMA] His universe was
cut and dry. Black and white.

99
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,583
Demons were evil and so
he had to destroy them.

100
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,291
And that's when he
saw what changed him.

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
What was it?

102
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,750
[KOENMA] Gray.
Truckloads of gray.

103
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,291
I'd given him an urgent case.
If only I'd known the results.

104
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,333
[KUWABARA]
What kinda case?

105
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,625
I had ordered him
to seal up the tunnel

106
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
between the Human
and the Demon World.

107
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,708
What?

108
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,791
You mean it's the exact same
thing we're doing now??

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,208
[KOENMA] The circumstances
were different.

110
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,708
[KUWABARA]
Really, how?

111
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,666
[KOENMA] That opening was
only ten meters wide.

112
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,208
There was no
threat of expansion,

113
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,333
but it was stable, allowing
lower class demons to pass.

114
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,041
It took eight psychics,

115
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,833
the strongest they thought
existed, to maintain it.

116
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,166
But it wasn't free
passage for the demons.

117
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,833
It was a trap, organized by
the young Black Black Club.

118
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,583
They captured demons as
they squeezed through,

119
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,208
and sold them
at enormous profit.

120
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,416
Black Black Club...
Rings a few bells.

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Those are the dirt
bags who watched us

122
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,541
while we rescued Yukina!

123
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,750
[KOENMA]
That's right.

124
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,166
And one up and comer
had just worked his way

125
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,666
into the group by his
talent at capturing demons...

126
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,125
Sakyo.

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,041
Quite the turn.

128
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,166
Sakyo?? You mean he was
already starting stuff

129
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,750
when I was getting kicked
out of kindergarten?

130
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,791
[KOENMA] One way to
look at it, yeah.

131
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,500
Today there's an entire
culture of demon bodyguards

132
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,791
for corporate crooks.

133
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,583
A multibillion
black market industry.

134
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,666
Sakyo began it all.

135
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,708
[KOENMA] My intelligence
team picked up news

136
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,541
of a giant
transaction that night.

137
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,750
All key members of
the Black Black Club

138
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,958
and the burgeoning demon
trade would be present.

139
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,375
If successful,

140
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,708
it would propel them into
every corner of the globe.

141
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:07,375
If we intervened, we could bring
the demon trade to its knees.

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,875
[KOENMA]
The raid was successful.

143
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,916
Sensui and his partner
Itsuki were skilled,

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,291
and the demons weak.

145
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,541
They caught the club by
surprise and cornered them.

146
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,541
It was perhaps too
much by surprise,

147
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,250
as Sensui saw something
he never should have seen.

148
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,208
Something he shouldn't
have seen? Like what?

149
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,125
Yeah, don't make me use the
running vagueness joke.

150
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
[KOENMA] It's a reckless
show of indulgence

151
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,833
in humanity's darkest side.

152
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,791
A ritualistic party they called
The Feast of Human Vices.

153
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,500
[KOENMA]
These privileged humans

154
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,041
were toying with the demons
they'd ensnared, torturing them,

155
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,666
with no motivation other than
their own twisted pleasure.

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,833
[demons screaming in pain]

157
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,291
Sensui had sworn his life to
protecting his race from demons.

158
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,958
But here, humans were enacting
cruelties a thousand times

159
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
worse than anything
he'd seen from a demon.

160
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,875
Black and white blurred,
flipped upside down.

161
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,833
His mind wasn't big
enough to hold the change.

162
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,791
[Sensui screams]

163
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,041
Sensui lived his life on
the straight and narrow.

164
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,291
But what he saw that night

165
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,041
went against everything
he knew the world to be.

166
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,583
A lot like we felt when we
went to Tarukane's place

167
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,000
and saw what they
were doing to Yukina.

168
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,333
Yeah, you're right.

169
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,083
[KOENMA] But there is a
most important difference

170
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,125
between your reaction and his.

171
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,250
There, in that room,
Sensui fell into a rage,

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,833
and murdered every
human at that feast.

173
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,666
We're late, Itsuki,
there weren't any humans

174
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,375
when I came through the door...

175
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,541
Not a single soul.

176
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,375
[KOENMA] Something
in him fractured.

177
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,833
He became obsessed with
the Chapter Black tape.

178
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,791
And then they
both were gone.

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,000
[KOENMA] Maybe Sensui was
too dedicated to his cause,

180
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,250
too hard a worker.

181
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,083
He gave himself entirely
to the purging of evil.

182
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,833
Then he came to
question the sanctity

183
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,541
of the human
race itself.

184
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,750
And now, he wants the
life of every human.

185
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,583
As atonement for
their collective sins.

186
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,375
That's the reason he's opening
the tunnel to Demon World.

187
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,375
To unleash the punishment.

188
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,083
See, that's why I always
half-assed, Grandma.

189
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,500
Never take anything
too seriously,

190
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,750
and you won't turn
into a friggin' fanatic.

191
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,041
[KOENMA] Precisely why
I chose you after Sensui failed.

192
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,083
I wanted someone who
wouldn't think too much.

193
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,125
Yes of course!

194
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,500
Don't be too quick
to defend me, pal.

195
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Sorry.

196
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,416
[KOENMA] I don't know
where Sensui's been

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,166
these last ten years,
or why he waited for now.

198
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,125
I let myself believe he'd lost
his mind, and was harmless.

199
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,916
I should have
tracked him better.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,916
One thing I know about Sensui
is that he'll never stop.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,291
Not 'till he's
accomplished his goal.

202

[YUSUKE]
We're not alone.

203
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,375
It's him!

204
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,875
He's listening.

205
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,833
They're after Mitarai!

206

[KUWABARA}
Get down!

You mind telling me
what that was, Kazuma?

The bad guys found us!
They're here!

210

Hit the ground, Botan!

They're attacking
through the window.

Don't let them see you!

213
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,250
[KUWABARA] I don't
know how they got here.

214
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,583
What is this?

215
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,000
[BOTAN] What?
I don't believe it!

216
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
It looks like
they've bugged you.

217
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,375
How could you do
that to your team?

218
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,166
I was counting on your
weakness, Sea Man,

219
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,500
as well as your betrayal.

220
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,000
I've heard every
word you've spoken.

221
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,583
And now that you've
served your purpose,

222
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,208
you can die with the humans you
couldn't detach yourself from.

so they could follow him to us.

You should try it sometime.

I confess, Sniper,

00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,458
at first I was surprised
when I sensed

the one we needed
among them.

232

Call me childish, but I think
it supports my view.

destined to clash.

needed is among us.

just feels really different.

I got all desperate,
and it just leapt out of me,

00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,750
a new kind of sword.

And I knocked away his
powers with one shot.

Also known as a Dimension Sword.

ambitious Territory of all,

I started him off, too.

So him and Urameshi

Far to the contrary, Urameshi.

I came to lead you
along the path of truth.

Like I told Genkai before.

There's something
fake about his power.

The only way to know
his strength for sure
