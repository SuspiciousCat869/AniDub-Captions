00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,541
But how can your guy
have Toguro's hands?

158
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,250
Because he swallowed him.

159
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,916
The same way he's going
to swallow you, Kuwabara,

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,208
as soon as your
power is completed.

No, I won't let you!

[Gourmet laughs]

[KUWABARA]
Let me go!

165
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,833
Oh, it's mouthwatering.
He's getting tenderized.

166
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,750
Uh oh. Is he a world
champion cyclist or what?

167
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,458
Damn it.

168
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,000
[KUWABARA] Help!

169
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,958
I'm in a pickup truck
full of psychic cannibals!

170
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,958
[YUSUKE THINKS] Hold on,
Kuwabara! I'm coming for you.

171
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,750
Urameshi!

172
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,666
[YUSUKE THINKS] I just hope
these wheels don't melt.

173
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,750
He's got some kind of iron-man
guts chasin' us on a bicycle.

174
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,291
Hey boss, think we
should shake this loon?

175
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,625
That's not necessary.

176
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,958
He's playing into my
contingency plan.

177
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,833
Just let him continue
to follow us.

178
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,458
He will be dealt with.

179
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,333
[KUWABARA] What, you couldn't
find a little girl's scooter?

180
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,583
[YUSUKE]
I don't know?

181
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,000
You couldn't go a week
without getting snagged

182
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,208
by the forces of evil?

183
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,458
Consider this your first

184
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,833
and only chance to
get out of this thing alive!

185
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,833
Now pull over or I'll
run you off the road!

186
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,750
He can't possibly do that
with a bicycle can he?

187
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,708
I don't know,

188
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,000
but if we don't
lose him quickly

189
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,875
he'll follow us to our secret,
ex-secret hideout.

190
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,000
I told you I have
it under control.

191
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,541
[YUSUKE]
So close.

192
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,833
Prick!

193
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,708
Whoa! Weird.

194
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,583
What'd you do to me?

195
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,333
I just marked
my territory Yusuke.

196
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,791
Well, that's gross.

197
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,708
Death Print Bull's-Eye.

198
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,291
[YUSUKE] Oh great!
I always wanted tattoos.

199
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,416
[SNIPER] Those, my
friend, are targets.

200
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,000
For what?

201
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,500
For me to hit of course,

202
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,333
and at any time and at any range
without me having to aim.

203
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,583
Oh, and with any
ammunition I so choose,

204
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,875
like these rocks for instance.

205
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,000
Hey... nice catch.

206
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,041
Now as long as you never
ever let your guard down,

207
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,791
you have nothing to worry about.

208
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,333
Freak.

209
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,416
Come now, let's not
resort to name-calling.

210
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,375
My proper name is Kaname Hagiri,
but my victims call me Sniper.

211
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,416
[NARRATOR] Kaname Hagiri.
Codename: Sniper.

212
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,875
His Territory encompasses
a five hundred meter radius.

213
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,375
Once he has marked
his victim's body

214
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,125
with the Death
Print Bull's-Eye,

215
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,250
he can shoot anything at that
target without ever missing.

216
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,583
From this moment on you'll
never again be able

217
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,333
to go anywhere without
looking over your shoulder.

218
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,625
Enjoy living in fear Yusuke,
while you still can.

219
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,916
Hey, get back here!
You don't scare me!

220
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,541
Welcome back.

221
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
What about Kazuma?

222
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,541
I'm afraid he has been captured
by Sensui and his men.

223
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,291
I'm sorry. We made a valiant
effort but could not stop them.

224
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,083
Don't beat
yourself up over it.

225
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,625
If I hadn't have been
standing under falling debris,

226
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,625
I could've warned
all of you that Kazuma was

227
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,666
the one they wanted
this whole time.

228
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,625
But why is Kuwabara on
everybody's A-List now?

229
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,458
Not that I'm jealous.

230
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,458
Because of what he can do.

231
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,041
Sensui needs him to
carry out the plan.

232
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,666
Kuwabara is a lot stronger,
a lot more important,

233
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,875
than any of you seem
to give him credit for.

234
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,083
[SEA MAN]
After all, he beat me.

235
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,208
And in that fight,
he awakened a new power...

236
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,250
...the power to slice
through dimensions,

237
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,708
cut down Territories,
psychic barriers--

238
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,458
the very power Mr.
Sensui was seeking.

239
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,458
You're killing me.

240
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,416
If Kuwabara can do that,
and they've got him,

241
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,208
they can crack
the Kekkai Barrier

242
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,500
we raised to seal
off Demon World.

243
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,958
Then all hell will
break loose, literally.

244
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,000
There'll be no
stopping the A-Class

or, heaven-forbid, S-Class
Demons from destroying mankind.

I trust Yusuke with a lot
these days, but not this.

247
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,333
Then we must
come to his aid.

00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,125
[GENKAI]
If we can find him.

We'll round up Kaitou and
Yana while we're at it.

comes back looking for us.

00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,875
Okay.

254
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,833
[SEA MAN] What about me?

255
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,666
Is there anything
I can help you do?

256
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,708
You should search your soul
for the answer to that.

257

You are free to go with us
or you are free to be our foe.

But if you chose
the latter,

the next time we meet
I'll show you no mercy.

260
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,541
You must choose what you
believe, and make your stand.

supposed to do with this?

How 'bout pretend for a
second that you're a man...

And hurry it up.

[SHIZURU] Make your
choice. Are we that bad?

are we supposed to go?
