00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,291
This mission goes far
beyond jewelry thieves.

161
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:36,166
It is imperative that
you bring her back quickly.

162
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,750
Oh, I feel awful for her.
We have to leave today!

163
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,375
What's his deal?

164
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,583
You look miserable.

165
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,416
I think I'm in love.

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,708
What?

167
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,625
Well come on Urameshi!

168
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,125
Let's send those
bad guys to the moon!!

169
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,916
I thought you weren't coming.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Shut up! Don't try to
dress up the facts again!

171
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm a good friend and I can't
let you go save her alone!

172
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,500
She's suffering!

173
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,916
Shizuru?

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,416
How long have you been here?

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,875
Calm down, princess.

176
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,750
I just heard you
watching that weirdo movie,

177
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,416
so I thought you'd like some
kiddy snacks or something.

178
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,291
We're just watching fuzz!

179
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,041
Fuzz, yes, fuzz.
We, find it relaxing.

180
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh, then I must have
imagined the little boy

181
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,125
with a pacifier
giving you orders.

182
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,666
Kids today with
your wild imaginations.

183
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,083
[BOTAN]
Give up, Yusuke.

184
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,250
Spirit Awareness must
run in the Kuwabara's family.

185
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,875
Okay Shizuru you win!

186
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,541
Now can we have
some money for the bus!

187
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,500
Like maybe a million or so.
That's enough, right?

188
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,416
Kiddo, for a million bucks you
could take a bus to Hawaii.

189
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,458
Here's fifty.

190
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,416
Yeah!!

191
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,083
Okay I'll see you
guys in a couple days!

192
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,833
You think he knows
the way to the mountain?

193
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,250
Doubt it.

194
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,958
That's my baby brother for you.
Better eat your snacks.

195
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
It'll take him a few hours

196
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,208
to realize he doesn't
know where he's going.

197
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,583
Let's watch
that video again.

198
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,541
Welcome back, your excellence.

199
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,375
What's new with
the broad? She cry?

200
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,500
No, I confess we've been
having trouble with that, sir.

201
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,041
She seems to have stripped
herself of all emotions.

202
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,875
Them broads are all alike.

203
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,833
Ask 'em nicely and they
stiffen up like a dead bug.

204
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,083
That's why I brought
in some experts.

205
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,625
[TARUKANE] These gents are
called the Toguro Brothers.

206
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
They're the leaders of
the Apparition Gang.

207
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,833
The apparition Gang, sir?

208
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,041
Are they not the ones who
capture and sell demons?

209
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:11,041
Yeah, turns out they do business
in all varieties of areas,

210
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,000
including some demon torture.

211
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,291
Let us handle it from here.

212
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,166
We will make her cry.

213
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,791
[YUKINA]
Sweet bird.

214
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,291
If I had wings like you do

215
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,666
I promise I wouldn't
be staying in here.

216
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,583
Don't you see?

217
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,291
There are many better places
to go birds, far away from me.

218
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,708
[key turning]

219
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,708
Go free.

220
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,500
Every time we come to
visit she freezes the room.

221
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,458
Frigid little whore, huh?

222
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,833
Are you sure you wouldn't
like one of our coats?

223
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,833
You needn't worry about us.

224
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,125
[TARUKANE] There she is.
A real knockout, ain't she?

225
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,833
But when it comes to feelings

226
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,916
it's like her heart's
been frozen shut!

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,666
Well open the door, boys!

228
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,500
[door opens]

229
00:13:55,666 --> 00:14:00,500
Well now, you decided to warm
up to your Uncle Tarukane yet?

230
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,250
[TARUKANE]
Don't bother.

231
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,500
We've already tried
filling that girl up

232
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,833
with every kind
of pain imaginable.

233
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,958
No matter what she just
stares at the damn wall.

234
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,625
Stay away!!

235
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,458
It isn't safe!

00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,708
Of course!

00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,833
Please don't hurt them!

239
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,500
These innocent little
birds keep you company

240
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,541
and give you a small
reason to hope, don't they?

241
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,583
Too bad your feelings
have betrayed them.

242
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,541
Please... spare them!

243
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,250
Please!

[Yukina gasps]

245
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,375
No!!!!

246
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,958
[YUKINA] I'll do anything
you want. I don't care.

247
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,708
[TARUKANE] Oh, you've done
quite enough, Missy.

248
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,958
For now, anyways!

249
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,833
You're gonna make me a
fortune, you know that?

250
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,916
How a creature like her can
have feelings is beyond me.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,666
To think she made all that
noise about some stinkin' birds!

252
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,125
Now get off the floor
and clean up your face!

253
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,166
I like my people to look happy
when I'm havin' a good day!

254
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,875
Call the market, boys!!

255
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,666
You can make this
easier on yourself.

256
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,125
Give up hope and start
practicing how to cry.

257

[YUSUKE] Wow, now this
is a big waste of space.

258

[BOTAN] You know, Yusuke.
Some people like the wilderness.

259

[YUSUKE] Yeah.
Old hermits and people

260

how to talk to girls.

You brothers came
with a big price tag,

264
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,000
but you sure get the job done.

Are the market boys
ready to buy yet Sakashta?

All the way here
in the mountains?

Grant a favor. Allow our demons
to deal with these intruders.

no way we're

gonna find this
house by nightfall.

The forest looked a
lot smaller on the map.

[BOTAN] Come on boys!

The other trail goes
all the way to the top.

I think it's our best bet.

Do we still have to walk?

about the rest of the video?

Well I'd hate to ruin his fun.

why they keep making me

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,625
the security guard.

318
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,833
You're a demon hired
by Tarukane, right?

319
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,333
That's very perceptive of you.

320
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:57,000
And I have orders to kill
anyone who comes after Yukina.

321
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,750
Well that girl is a
type of demon, right?

322
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,875
So doesn't that make
you cousins or something?

323
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,583
Your own kind
is being tortured

324
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,166
so that no-good human you
work for can make money!

325
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,666
Doesn't that
tick you off?

326
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,791
[HIRUE] Not at all.

327
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,416
What?

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,958
It is said that
there are humans

329
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,875
who will sell their souls
to the devil for power, right?

330
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,041
Demons can do it too.

331
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,875
[Hirue laughs wickedly]

332
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,750
Don't try acting holy.

333
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,041
There isn't one among you whose
loyalty couldn't be bought.

334
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,833
[YUSUKE] Oh please.

335
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,541
You creeps will say anything
to make yourself feel better.

336
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,833
You're just trash.

337
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,250
What did you say?

338
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,833
Can't you hear right?

339
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,083
He must've gotten carried away
and sold his ears off, too.

340
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,833
Oh, you will regret this!!

341
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,750
[HIRUE] Die!

342
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,125
You ready?

343
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,166
Sure.

344
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,833
Spirit Sword!!!

345
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,166
[YUSUKE]
Spirit Gun!!

346
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,000
And here I was thinking
they'd make it easy for us,

347
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,625
huh Kuwabara?

348
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,333
Yeah.

349
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:40,500
[NARRATOR] And so the mission
begins. A suffering prisoner.

350
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,416
A vengeful brother.

351
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,625
And a strange
human-demon alliance

352
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,791
unlike anything
Yusuke has ever seen.

353
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,041
[YUSUKE] Have I
mentioned I hate tag-teams?

354
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,416
Well that's exactly what
they're pulling on us next,

355
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,666
attacking us with three
monster demons all at once!

356
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,666
Meanwhile, up at the
ugly guy's stronghold,

357
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,666
they're bringing even more
greedy men in on the scheme.

358
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,333
It's turning into a Who's
Who of dirty crime lords,

359
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,375
and twisted demons with a
serious need for a toothbrush.

360
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,666
Botan's even back
to her old tricks,

361
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,125
as we bust ourselves
up to the front gate!

362
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,708
It's the kind of action
you don't want to miss.

363
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,333
So--don't!
