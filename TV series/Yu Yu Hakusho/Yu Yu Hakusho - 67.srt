158
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,166
Whoa, Botan.

159
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,708
I guess you just couldn't resist
playing the schoolgirl again?

160
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
Yeah well, if you came
with another job,

161
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,250
I'm not in the mood,
just tell my secretary.

162
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,000
You brat! You can't
just shovel stuff onto me!

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,708
Mr. Urameshi.
Mr. Kuwabara.

164
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,041
The class bell
rang some time ago.

165
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:05,166
[students laugh]

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,083
[TAKENAKA] Yusuke, I believe
your class is next door.

167
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,500
Yeah... Thanks for the
tip, old man.

168
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,541
As for you miss,
are you a new student?

169
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,916
You mean me?

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,041
I've never seen you here.
Who's your teacher?

171
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,375
Foreign exchange student.
Yes. My English-very choppy.

172
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,916
[TAKENAKA] Hold on,
young lady. Not so fast!

173
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,291
[YUSUKE] What are you doing,
you're leaving now?

174
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,666
All the way from
Spirit World,

175
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,708
just to keep me from
kickin' ass?

176
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,708
Sorry, I'd rather
not have to explain

177
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,875
to your teacher why I can fly.

178
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,583
We'll talk after school!

179
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,916
Must have another
crap case for me...

180
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,291
[school bell rings]

181
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,250
[GIRL STUDENT C] Hurry,
I want the good court today.

182
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,125
[GIRL STUDENT D]
Bet I'll get there first!

183
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,625
[GUY STUDENT C]
Man, it's sunny today!

184
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,375
You goin' straight to practice?

185
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,958
[GUY STUDENT D] You bet! Coach
says he'll start me pitching!

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,041
Everything feels
so stupid and dull!

187
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,958
I gotta get the
hell out of here.

188
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,500
See? A full day of
school isn't that bad.

189
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,916
Well, at least
you got through it.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Now don't forget Poo.

191
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,208
Puu!

192
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,916
Give me a break, Keiko.

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,750
I already told you I'd look
dumb luggin' that thing around.

194
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,958
But he's part of you.

195
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,333
Maybe not having him
is why you're so bummed.

196
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
Maybe it's 'cause
of your nagging!

197
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,000
[KEIKO] A tie here,
a tuck there...

198
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,833
And ta-da! A portable Poo!

199
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,875
People will just think
you have a stuffed animal.

200
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,000
Puu!

201
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,875
How is that gonna
help my look?!

202
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,208
Well, I must admit, the bag
is a little bit small for him.

203
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,208
I have a big pink bag,
I'll bring tomorrow.

204
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,958
Well, I've got a student
council meeting to run.

205
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,958
Great. Vote on a
shorter school day.

206
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,666
You are okay, right?

207
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,583
Just promise me you
won't do anything dumb.

208
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,208
Again with the nagging!

209
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,916
Don't do this, don't do that!
When have I ever acted dumb?!!

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,125
Um, besides getting
run over by a car?

211
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,875
[YUSUKE]
Stupid life.

212
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,083
The one girl who knows anything
about me uses it as a weapon.

213
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,666
I'm so happy to
be back home!!

214
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,000
School's out, kids.

215
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,250
[all chuckle]

216
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,416
[KUWABARA]
Wait up, Urameshi!

217
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,500
So what happened
with you and Botan?

218
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,791
Did she give you a
new case or something?

219
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,250
Nah, we just made out.

220
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,750
Then Keiko caught us
and a fight broke out.

221
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,958
I'm serious, Urameshi!

222
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,166
Just tell me what
you talked about!

223
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,166
She said she'd tell
me after school.

224
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,958
What? Then shouldn't
we wait for her here?

225
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,916
I think I'll pass.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,750
Why have you been
so down lately?

227
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,500
Did fighting Toguro make
you lose all of your powers?

228
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,333
Nah, my powers are all here...

229
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,000
And maybe that's the problem.

230
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,916
I mean, after I beat Toguro...

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,708
Well he was the strongest
demon there was, right?

232
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,041
Now that he's finished,
what could challenge me?

233
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,000
[KUWABARA]
You jerk!!

234
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,166
[YUSUKE] What the hell did
you do that for?!

235
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,375
[KUWABARA] Cause I was feeling
sorry for you for nothin'!

236
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,041
Whining for no good reason.

237
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,750
I thought you'd lost your
Spirit Energy like I have.

238
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,375
No joke, huh? So you
can't make your Spirit Sword?

239
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,333
Heck, I can't even
make a butter knife

240
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,000
since the final
round ended.

241
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,958
I'm worried it's a side effect
from that crazy Trial Sword.

242
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,875
If things don't
turn around soon,

243
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,041
I think I'm gonna
see Genkai about it.

244
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,916
[KIDO]
Yusuke Urameshi...

245
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,083
That is your name, right?

246
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,541
Yeah.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,041
[KIDO] We heard you fight.
Care to prove it?

248
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,541
[KUWABARA] Aren't you
gonna say hello to me?

249
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,125
I'm Kuwabara,
you know!

250
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,958
[YUSUKE] Easy with the
sidekick complex.

251
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,541
These guys are a great excuse
to avoid talking to Botan.

252
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,958
You be Spirit
Detective today.

253
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,000
What if it's an
important case?

254
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,250
So guys, where
should we do this?

255
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,500
Could care less.

256
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,875
Just a place where authorities
won't get in our way.

257
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,041
How about the old field
behind the school?

258
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,500
Classic.

259
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,375
Wait. This is dumb.

260
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,125
Maybe a regular knuckle-
buster's just what I need.

261
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,708
Tell Botan I said hey.

262
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,791
I can't believe you'd
fight ordinary humans.

263
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,875
You might as well
attack a nursing home.

264
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,416
Shh... The last thing I
want is for them

265
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
to find out you're alive, Poo.

266
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,541
I'd have to give
them all amnesia.

267
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,083
Yep, that'd be
real terrible.

268
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:22,875
[KIDO]
Say something?

269
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,583
What, you didn't hear me?

270
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,916
[YUSUKE] I said it's
time to get messy.

271
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,125
I'll just fight with one hand.

272
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,958
And, you should all come at
once, to make it go faster.

273
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,125
Actually Yusuke,
it'll just be me.

274
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,958
[BOTAN] How could he be so
plainly irresponsible!

275
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,625
Does he really think the
chief pilot of the River Styx

276
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,916
has time in her schedule
for recreational fighting!

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,458
None of those guys looked tough.

278
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
He prob'ly already flattened
them and went off to the mall.

279
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,500
What an awful mess.

280
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,583
Guess I'll just
have to tell you.

281
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,708
What do you mean have to!
I'm not a lame-o backup plan!!

282
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,333
[Laughing]

283
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,375
Let me guess,
you're giving up.

284
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,625
[Kido chuckles]

285
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,333
The whole thing
is rather bizarre.

286
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,875
Koenma hasn't quite
figured out the cause yet.

287
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,625
But something is definitely
in the works in this city.

288
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,500
Strange readings keep popping
up, and then vanish.

289
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,791
This demon, can you
tell how big it is?

290
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,333
That's the strangest part.

291
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,083
The bursts of energy seem
to be coming from a human.

292
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,625
You mean someone like us?

293
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,916
[YUSUKE] That's enough. I don't
want to write one of those

294
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,458
sorry I beat up your kid
notes to your mom.

295
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,791
I really like his
sense of humor.

296
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,458
Kido, how's it feel
to get punched by him?

297
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,083
He is fast, but his
punches don't hurt

298
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,875
as much as I thought they would.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,083
Hey, in case you
missed the news updates,

300
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,458
this is a bad day
to piss me off.

301
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,291
Urameshi, why don't
you untie that creature

302
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,458
you have strapped
to your book-bag.

303
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,000
He looks so small and fragile.
I don't want to hurt him.

304
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,500
Okay. Who the hell are you?

305
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,583
Asato Kido,
Junior High student.

306
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,166
I'm a human, born in
this city, just like you.

307
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,833
Though, I'm a little unusual.

308
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,291
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Well, that was unexpected.

309
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,416
What's he doing
to this field?

310
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,875
[KIDO]
Welcome, Urameshi.

311
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,166
You have become a
part of my Territory.

312
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,791
Go on ahead. Try as
hard as you can to move.

313
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,916
It will get you nowhere.

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,916
Damn it! 

315
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,291
[laughing]

316
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,375
Puu!! Puu!!

317
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,083
Puu!!

318
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,000
[Yells]

319
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,833
Hear that? Yells!

320
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,791
Sounds like there's a
riot in the hallway!

321
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,541
It's Poo.

322
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,250
Right there!
Straight ahead of us!

323
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,958
Puu!!! Puu-uu-uu-uu-puu-uu....

324
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,333
Is it yours, Kuwabara?

325
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,916
What on earth
is it anyway?

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,833
Yeah, they don't keep things
like that at the pet store.

327
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,583
What's the big deal?

328
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,666
Haven't you ever seen
a blue baby penguin?

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,041
But, we all know
penguins don't fly.

330
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,791
What are you guys,
the Junior Science Club??

331
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,625
Just get outta here before
I lose my gosh-darn temper!!

332
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,541
What's gotten into you?
Poo, how'd you get here?

333
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,875
[BOTAN] Just calm down
and speak to us slowly.

334
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,125
Oh, I forgot.
You can't talk.

335
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,083
Poo?

336
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,041
What?

337
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,083
What do you mean
Yusuke is kidnapped?

338
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,291
[KUWABARA]
But how can that be?

339
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,333
Yurameshi's not the type
of guy to get kidnapped,

340
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,291
you'd expect him to
be the kidnapper.

341
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,833
Well that's true.

342
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,458
Puu!

343
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,916
Okay, Poo!
Chill!

344
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,458
Should we go take a
look at the field?

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,166
Tonight at eleven,

346
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,291
come to the old mansion
in Rokurokubi Estates.

347
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,375
You may bring as many
guests as you like.

348
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,083
[KUWABARA] But Kurama, Hiei, and
Kuwabara must be among them?

349
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,916
If these three
don't show up on time,

350
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,750
Yusuke Urameshi's survival
cannot be guaranteed.

351
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,166
They know about you all.

352
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,166
I don't get it.
What are they after?

353
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,625
[NARRATOR] After seemingly
proving himself as the toughest

354
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,375
fighter in all of Earth
and the demon realm,

355
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,041
Yusuke Urameshi has
been easily captured

356
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,125
by three mysterious
human students.

357
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,958
What dark plan are
these teens concocting,

358
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,291
and what is the
nature of their power?

359
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,041
[BOTAN] Well, it's been
quite some time since

360
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,500
we've had an old-fashioned
Spirit Detective case,

361
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,250
though I never thought
rescuing the Yusuke in distress

362
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,666
would be our goal.

363
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,375
After convincing Hiei and
Kurama to rejoin the act,

364
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,083
we'll enter the dark old house

365
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,375
called the Mansion
of Four Dimensions.

366
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,458
Creepy!

367
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,208
You can be sure
that danger awaits,

368
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,833
along will more
intriguing questions

369
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,291
than I have time to ask!

370
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,333
So don't you miss the
next exciting episode

371
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,750
of Yu Yu Hakusho!
