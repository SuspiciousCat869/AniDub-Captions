00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,416
I bet it's
something bad.

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,125
Of course, being
the team owner,

163
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,041
I'm going to wager
on Toguro to win.

164
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,000
As for the
particular stakes,

165
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,125
I offer up my life.

166
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,791
But if Sakyo's dead, 
who'll fight next?

167
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,833
[KOENMA]
Nobody.

168
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,833
Sakyo is attempting
to effectively make this

169
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,416
the decisive battle,
very clever.

170
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,916
What I am proposing
here is that whichever team

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,333
happens to win this match,
in essence earns two points.

172
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,583
I'm doing this as
a man of the people.

173
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,791
And in that vein, I must
always strive to give the people

174
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,708
the competition
they desire.

175
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,125
Putting aside my own ego,
I know that the fans

176
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,250
would find it anticlimactic
for this tournament

177
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,958
to be decided by two alternates.

178
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,375
The public deserves
to have the true stars

179
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,500
of this tournament
determine its outcome:

180
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,750
Urameshi versus Toguro!

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,083
Of course, this will only
work if their team's owner

182
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,708
and the honorable tournament
committee can agree to my terms.

183
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,333
His head's
gone haywire!

184
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,833
Who just goes and bets
their own life like that?

185
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,708
[KOENMA]
Yeah, I'll do it.

186
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,666
[KOENMA]
I accept your challenge.

187
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,333
I am placing my
life on Yusuke to win.

188
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,041
[crowd buzzes with shock]

189
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,666
Koenma!

190
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,708
[KOENMA] Now I know how
you feel about me,

191
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,833
but please, don't
let that get in your way.

192
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,125
At least look like
you're trying to win.

193
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,791
But what if I don't win?

194
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:45,125
If you don't win, I'll already
be in a heap of trouble Yusuke.

195
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,541
Believe me when I say I know
that there is absolutely no way

196
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,166
I could ever beat Sakyo
in hand to hand combat.

197
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,750
Look at him,
then look at me.

198
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,500
I'm a ruler, not a fighter.
I bruise easily.

199
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,666
Why do you think I always have
you fight my battles for me?

200
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,750
I helped get you stuck in
this whole predicament Yusuke.

201
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,958
As leader of Spirit World I
can't just fly off on a jetpack

202
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,541
while Sakyo does what
he wants to with that money.

203
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,666
[crowd unruly]

204
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,916
Why would he throw
it all away?

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,083
I know.

206
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,666
I'm sure Koenma knows
what it is he's doing.

207
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,666
[JURI] Attention everyone!

208
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,333
The Tournament Committee
will take ten minutes

209
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,750
to consider this.

210
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,333
[KOTO] And that
means all parties

211
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,541
have an additional
ten minutes

212
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,083
to place any final
bets accordingly

213
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,208
at one of our many
fine betting windows

214
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,541
in the main concourse
of the stadium!

215
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,166
Can I wager
half my life?

216
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,958
Are you feeling
all right?

217
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,125
Oh naturally I'm
feeling just fine Keiko.

218
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,000
Now if you'll excuse
me I'm gonna place a bet.

219
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,041
On Yusuke?
I should hope.

220
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,666
[SHIZURU] Why am I putting
myself through this?

221
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,708
How is the
committee voting?

222
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,416
Didn't you have me
kill them all?

223
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,750
Really? Did I?

224
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,000
Then they shouldn't
take much convincing.

225
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
My little stunt caused a frenzy.

226
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,791
Do you think I've
raised the stakes enough?

227
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,708
[SAKYO] You know, there's
nothing quite like

228
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,833
putting your life on the line
to make you reexamine it.

229
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,708
I was born into a normal
working-class family.

230
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,000
I was the youngest
of five brothers.

231
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,958
My parents never had any money,
but they were very loving.

232
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,625
I hated them both.

233
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,166
My brothers all took honest,
white-collar jobs

234
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,625
and wives and kids.

235
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,166
If I had their lives
I would kill myself.

236
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,375
Luckily their fate was
not for me, I was too smart.

237
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,875
I think my adolescent
years were typical.

238
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,875
I became obsessed with death
and violence and suffering.

239
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,583
So I got an
after-school job

240
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,083
where I could surround
myself with those things.

241
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,875
I spent hours
every day locked

242
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,541
in the backroom of
that pet store.

243
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,083
Sometimes I'd play
a little game

244
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
where I'd challenge
myself to see how long

245
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,791
I could keep something alive
once I had carved out its heart.

246
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,750
But in time, we all grow
more mature and realize

247
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,458
that there's more to life than
blood, guts and minimum wage.

248
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,791
I soon discovered
that with gambling,

249
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,083
I could translate all
my teenage obsessions

250
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,000
into cold, hard, cash.

251
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,208
And there was no
turning back.

252
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,625
The power.
The adulation.

253
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,875
The sheer exhilaration
derived from gambling

254
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,208
is really indescribable.

255
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,875
But then one day, there's
nowhere left to take it

256
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,500
than the
highest extreme.

257
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,083
Then money begins
to lose its mystery,

258
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,833
so you wager your life on the
victory of your prized fighter.

259
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,500
Funny. I feel just like I did
when I played my first hand

260
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,833
of cards in a
friend's basement.

261
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,750
You're sure taking
a big risk.

262
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,958
[SAKYO] That's the point.

263
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,458
[KOTO] Toguro's odds of winning
hold steady at five to one

264
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,041
while the heavily
favored Urameshi's

265
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,250
are on the rise
at three to two.

266
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,500
[SAKYO] Everything's falling
into place exactly as planned.

267
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,208
I must say, I've really
outdone myself this time.

268
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,000
Who else could manage to turn
underdogs into champions

269
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,250
and champions into underdogs?

270
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,291
You know what, Toguro?

271
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,625
I don't even feel
the slightest bit nervous

272
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,208
risking my life on you.

273
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,791
I'm struck by your confidence.

274
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,041
Remember Tarukane's fatal
flaw was he forgot

275
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,333
who was on his side and
didn't know whom to trust.

276
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,250
I've held back at
your request long enough.

277
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,500
I fight this
one on my terms.

278
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,541
[TOGURO 2] And my terms alone.

279
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,500
I've wanted this since the
first time I fought the boy.

280
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,375
I expect no less.

281
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,083
[JURI] Ahem. I've been
informed the committee

282
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,458
has no objections to
Sakyo's proposal,

283
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,541
so this next fight between
Toguro and Urameshi

284
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,291
will be worth
two points,

285
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,375
and that means it will
determine the winner

286
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,250
of this year's
Dark Tournament.

287
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,875
[KOTO] At this time, the windows
will no longer be accepting

288
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,000
any more wagers for the
duration of the competition.

289
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,875
All bets are officially closed.

290
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,041
Be careful, Yusuke.

291
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,000
Gentlemen please,
take your places!

292
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:12,625
[JURI] Toguro versus Urameshi!

293
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,250
Hey, are you guys ready for
the climactic battle to begin?

294
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,125
On your marks, get...

295
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:27,291
[Laughing]

296
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,541
[KURAMA] That can't be...

297
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,666
Do you all hear
that or is it just me?

298
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,000
[Laughing]

299
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm willing to bet you
weren't expecting to see me.

300
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,666
At least not in this lifetime!

301
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,916
I killed you, I know I
killed you, why won't you die?

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Perception of death is
different from reality...

303
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,416
The simplest mind will always
believe anything it wants to.

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,958
The Elder Toguro's back.

305
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,625
Since Kuwabara splattered him,

306
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,875
I've narrowed
down the possibilities

307
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,166
to him being either
a ghost or a zombie-man.

308
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
[TOGURO 1] Before my
wounds were fatal,

309
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,458
I liquefied and seeped
between the tiles.

310
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,166
And then, I waited to hear
that the betting was closed,

311
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,958
just so I could
emerge triumphantly.

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,083
We're going to be rich!

313
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,708
Asshole.

314
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,625
[TOGURO 1] You and your
pals should know by now

315
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,541
that you can't defeat my brother
and me unless we want you to.

316
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,500
Fortunately, my brother
wanted to beat Genkai.

317
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,083
Of course, you know
how that turned out.

318
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,333
[TOGURO 1] It's a shame you
couldn't have cradled her body

319
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,833
in your arms
when she was younger.

320
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,041
She was a real wildcat
back in those days.

321
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,750
And not just in
the heat of battle.

322
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,291
If you know what I mean.

323
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,500
The things she did
with my brother... whew...

324
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,583
I wouldn't have minded
having a pass at her myself...

325
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,750
...back then anyway.

326
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,291
You might get a
shot yourself once

327
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,625
we reunite you with
your whore mentor.

328
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,833
Let's go!

329
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,000
It isn't your fight.

330
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,208
Oh the heck it ain't!

331
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,833
The call is not
left to the interloper.

332
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,208
Only those two determine how
this match will be fought.

333
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,875
You'll see.

334
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,541
What will it be, brother.
Any weapon you want.

335
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,333
A dagger, a sword, a semi-
automatic machine gun!

336
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,166
As long as we
work together,

337
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,833
this competition
is in our grasp.

338
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,166
No.

339
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,291
Brother, we can win!

340
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,708
This does not involve you.

341
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,250
[Toguro 1 cries out]

342
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,708
How could you?

343
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,666
I'm your older brother

344
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,375
and you just kicked
me you son of a bitch!

345
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,541
Your own brother!

346
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,125
You're dead to me.

347
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,333
I am sorry, but blood
can only run so thick.

348
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,708
This will be a
fair fight with you.

349
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,833
Down to the letter.
This time we fight for real.

350
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,708
You bet.

351
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,458
[NARRATOR] The time
has finally come.

352
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,625
Yusuke and Toguro
are about to face off

353
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,916
in the final bout
of the Dark Tournament.

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who will walk away the winner,

355
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,750
and who may not
walk away at all?

356
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,875
[KOENMA] Yo, Koenma here,
and this may be the

357
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,458
last time I talk to you,
so you best appreciate it!

358
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,708
As you know, I've got
a lot riding on this match!

359
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,916
A wise man once said to bet
with your head, not over it.

360
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,791
But what if you
actually bet your head??

361
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,291
Now, I do kind of
trust Yusuke to save us,

362
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,000
but when Toguro
demolishes the ring

363
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,000
and makes death
the only way to win,

364
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,208
Yusuke will have to tap into
the energy Genkai gave him

365
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,625
to form the biggest
Spirit Gun you've ever seen.

366
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,000
And that's just the start.

367
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,708
Miss any part
of this final battle,

368
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,208
and I'll take it
as a personal insult.
