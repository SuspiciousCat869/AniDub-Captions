00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,000
Guess I don't make much
of an impression on people.

160
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
No freaking way!

161
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,458
Is something the matter, Yusuke?

162
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,250
You have the strangest
look of surprise on your face.

163
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,916
I'm sorry, when I kill people
I'm used to them staying dead.

164
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,458
I suggest you come
with me for a talk.

165
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,666
After all, you wouldn't want
something some thing bad

166
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,375
to happen to your
precious girlfriend.

167
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,708
What's goin' on?

168
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,791
Hey Keiko!

169
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,541
[TOGURO 2] Surely
you didn't think you had

170
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,083
actually beaten me.

171
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,833
Money decided that fight long
before you entered the ring.

172
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,458
But don't be angry.

173
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,208
You might soon have a chance
to fight me on fair terms

174
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,958
and not get so easily crushed.

175
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,458
Why don't you get
to the point, muscles.

176
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,333
I've got better things
to do with my time

177
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,166
then waste it with you.

178
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,625
You're afraid of me.

179
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,291
What? Amused is more like it!

180
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,666
There's no one
here to impress Yusuke,

181
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,791
and I can see your
entire body shaking.

182
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,666
The ability to fear your enemies
is one of your strengths.

183
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,541
It forces you to
reach your potential.

184
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,166
But you haven't
been scared enough.

185
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,250
You need some motivation,
and that's why I've come here,

186
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,500
to show you my true power!!

187
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,583
I only used twenty
percent of my strength

188
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,916
when I fought with
you and your friend.

189
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,208
So why don't I now show you-

190
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,708
[TOGURO 2] There.
That's sixty percent.

191
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,833
Understand this is the last
time I will save your life.

192
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,916
Two months from now,

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,166
a martial arts competition
will be taking place.

194
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,333
Oh, sounds like fun.

195
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,375
[TOGURO 2]
It's a dark tournament,

196
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,416
organized by greedy
human crime lords,

197
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,541
and drawing on the most
vile demons of the Spirit World.

198
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,666
Each criminal gathers
a team of five fighters,

199
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,125
and the teams
battle to the death.

200
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,666
Humans enter for
gambling and entertainment.

201
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,625
Demons fight for blood,
and the chance to win the prize.

202
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,708
You and Kuwabara are special
guests to this competition.

203
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,041
If you refuse,

204
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,916
I will immediately kill
you and everyone you know.

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,833
If you want to
survive these fights,

206
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,875
I suggest you get stronger.

207
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,791
[YUSUKE THINKS] Stupid, Yusuke!

208
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,333
You got so scared around him you
couldn't even friggin' move!

209
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,208
You idiot!

210
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,625
He's going to
kick your stupid ass!

211
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,166
What's going on?

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,666
[KUWABARA] We beat him!

213
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,541
I assume from your dismal faces

214
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,041
that you've been invited
to the competition as well.

215
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,250
On Urameshi's team, no doubt.

216
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,000
Demons who side with
humans will get no sympathy.

217
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,666
Sympathy has never been
a part of those fights.

218
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,291
As you know the
teams are made of five,

219
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,208
so you'll have to
recruit another fighter.

220
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,666
[TOGURO 2] For your sake I
hope you find someone useful.

221
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,583
What is our chance?

222
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,000
[HIEI]
Don't ask.

223
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,708
It's about time
you came back.

224
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,250
Please tell me you've
gotten a little better.

225
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,083
At this rate
you'll never survive.

226
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,916
This time I
won't go easy.

227
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,375
Do you realize the
danger you'll be in?

228
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,541
Yeah.

229
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,125
[KURAMA] Hiei
can't prepare you for the

230
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,166
viciousness of the fights.

231
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,916
Your weakness and his honor
make him go easy on you.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,750
I will not.

233
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,500
Okay, come on! Toughen me up!

234
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,458
As you wish. Here goes!

235
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,958
Dammit!

236
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,708
Does it hurt, slacker?

237
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,541
Did you come all the way here

238
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,166
just to give me more
of your crap?!

239
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,583
It's different this time.

240
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,416
I promise I'll
push as hard as I can.

241
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,583
[NARRATOR] In this way, two
months of training passed.

242
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:38,500
[demon voices and laughter]

243
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,458
It's about time this
tournament day arrived!

244
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,125
Now we can kill without getting
those pursuers after us!

245
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,375
And imagine our power once
we've gotten that prize!

246
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,625
We're the ones who are
going to get the power!

247
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,791
Go home if you
don't want to die!

248
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,416
Obviously you haven't
seen us fight yet!

249
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,208
I think I smell
a human over there.

250
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,416
Maybe he's come
here to be our dinner!

251
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,750
Urameshi still
hasn't shown up yet!

252
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,500
What could that
dummy be doing now?

253
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,375
Hopefully he's finding
us a fifth fighter.

254
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
Why don't you worry
about yourself, Kuwabara.

255
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,916
Have you gotten any
better since our last fight?

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,625
You'll see for
yourself, shrimp-boy!

257
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,958
[KUWABARA THINKS] ]
If we win this competition,

258
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,791
I'm gonna get super famous.

259
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:29,083
Yeah. That way Yukina and
I can be together forever!

260
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,083
The ship is here, maties.

261
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,375
Now lets try to get on
board without any violence.

262
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,500
Uh, hey wait a minute sir!

263
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,750
Our team still
has some stragglers!

264
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,041
Then we'll have to
put a mark on their heads

265
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,583
and send out a hit man.

266
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,166
Standard rule of the tournament!

267
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,166
[YUSUKE] Now, now!
That's not necessary!

268
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,458
Sorry to keep you waiting guys.

269
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,250
You nearly gave me a
heart attack, Urameshi!

270
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,750
These forest hikes
really wipe me out!

271
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,958
[KUWABARA] Yeah, you look awful!
Oh wait, that's just you!

272
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,375
[HIEI]
Yusuke.

273
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,000
[DEMON 10] What is this?

274
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,125
I thought that they
were on the same team!

275
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,666
Gosh they're fast! I can
barely keep up with my eyes!

276
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,625
Damn Hiei, is this how you
say hello to people now?

277
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,125
I don't know where
you've been all this time,

278
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,166
but it seems you improved
your skills a little bit.

279
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,541
Improved a little bit!

280
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,541
Oh man! I'd say he
improved a lot of bits!!!

281
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,708
Don't be discouraged.

282
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,500
The fact that you
could follow their moves

283
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,791
shows you have
improved as well.

284
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,791
[HIEI] So, Yusuke.

285
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,583
I assume the
little one over there

286
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,416
is going to be the
fifth member of our team.

287
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,833
[KUWABARA] You mean
this little guy here?

288
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,541
He's even smaller than Hiei!

289
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,541
And, what's wrong with his face?

290
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,166
He looks like a
mummy or somethin!

291
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,166
Trust me. That one's gonna
be a lot of help to us.

292
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,125
I don't know--he barely
comes to my waist!

293
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,541
Forget him. Yusuke and I
are all that we'll require.

294
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:24,375
Enough of pesky distractions!
Let's all get on board!

295
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,125
[ship horn sounds]

296
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,375
[NARRATOR] And so,
the next adventure begins

297
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,875
for Spirit Detective Yusuke
Urameshi and his friends.

298
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,125
On a ship filled
with bizarre demons,

299
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,500
who all have a
craving for blood.

300
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,500
What is this strange new world

301
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,375
where the dark
tournament will begin,

302
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,666
and can Yusuke
even get there alive?

303
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,875
[YUSUKE] Hey guys, it's me,

304
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,500
and I'm about to get
some much needed shut-eye

305
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,333
while my teammates take care
of a little problem on deck!

306
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,416
Turns out that from
the whole shipload of fighters,

307
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
only one team is really
eligible for the tournament!

308
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,916
And that means an all out war
between everyone on board!

309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,416
And in case you didn't know,

310
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,583
demons tend to
fight pretty dirty,

311
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,375
so it's going to be intense.

312
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,583
You don't want to miss
the next whip-lashing,
