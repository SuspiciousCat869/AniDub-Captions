1
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,791
[NARRATOR]
Having learned that Yusuke

2
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,541
is the descendant of the
Mazoku, King Yama dispatched

3
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,583
the Spirit Defense Force
to destroy his corpse.

4
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,416
But Yusuke's recently
transformed Spirit Beast, Puu,

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,208
came to his rescue.

6
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,875
Thanks to the Demon blood within
him, Yusuke was revived--

7
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,958
though what he is now,
no one is quite certain.

8
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,708
He immediately raced
to Demon World,

9
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,208
to save his friends and finish
his battle with Sensui,

10
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,208
once and for all.

11
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,791
[gasps]

12
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,291
[SENSUI]
Impossible!

13
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,000
Is... that him?

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,791
But how?

15
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,666
[YUSUKE]
Some friends you are!

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,625
Ditchin' a guy while he's
down and then hoggin'

17
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,208
the bad guy all to yourselves!

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,708
I gotta admit, I'm
disappointed in you jerks.

19
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,625
But did you honestly
think I'd just lie there,

20
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,833
and let you guys
fight my battles for me?

21
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,416
Gimme a break!

22
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,000
Urameshi! But you were...

23
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,458
Well, you were definitely
dead! I swear it!

24
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,875
Your heart stopped beating!

25
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,666
I double-checked!

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,416
Yeah, I can't explain that.

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
In fact, my ticker's
still not tickin'.

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,333
I guess I should
be worried, huh?

29
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,750
[KURAMA, HIEI chuckle]

30
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,500
[KUWABARA]
Uh...?

31
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:24,000
[KURAMA, HIEI laugh]

32
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,875
[giggles]

33
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,458
You'll get used to that...

34
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,666
You see, Demon hearts don't beat
in the conventional human sense.

35
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,083
Demon?!

36
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,916
[KOENMA]
Yes, Demon.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,166
I keep hopin'
I'll wake up soon.

38
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,333
It's no dream.

39
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,625
Yusuke has had dormant
blood inside him,

40
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,666
Mazoku blood,

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,500
which explains a
few things, I'd say.

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,291
[KUWABARA]
Hm?

43
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,666
Yeah, funny story...

44
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,083
One of my ancestors way back
was this Mazoku guy...

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,125
So, when I died, I was able to
come back, but more like him.

46
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,125
Ah! So you are a Demon?!

47
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:59,125
Transmigration. The
Atavism of the Mazoku!

48
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
That's correct.

49
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,625
[SENSUI]
An ironic twist.

50
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,666
The Demon Hunter
has become the Demon.

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,958
I had no idea you were
one of us, Yusuke.

52
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,458
How's it feel to be so superior?

53
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,333
Uh... Honestly...

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,458
I really don't feel
all that different now.

55
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,083
I mean, I haven't sprouted
horns or extra eyes yet...

56
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,833
But I do have a
sudden burning desire

57
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,166
to tear this guy to pieces.

58
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,916
So how about it, Sensui?
Ready to feed some worms?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,875
[HIEI]
Back off, Yusuke.

60
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,875
We're in the middle
of something...

61
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,750
And I've suddenly
discovered my second wind.

62
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,791
No, Hiei... I will take him.

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,041
What is this, a
prom date dispute?

64
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,500
I mean, I'm sure
Sensui's flattered

65
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,458
by the popularity and all,
but this's my damn fight.

66
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,375
I hate to say it, Kuwabara,
but you're the only acting sane.

67
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,750
[laughing]

68
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
I'm ready! An' better than ever!

69
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,375
Stand back, 'cause I can
kick his butt myself!

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,166
[HIEI] You do realize
he'll be... kicking back?

71
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,666
Yeah, and after him you're next!

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,875
[HIEI]
There won't be a next.

73
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,416
Just shut up!

74
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,583
[SENSUI] Those three have
become as strong now

75
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,500
as they were when they
watched Urameshi die.

76
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,916
[SENSUI]
No. Even stronger.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,250
Koenma, you've chosen
your team wisely.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,583
[SENSUI] It's one thing
to be empowered by rage

79
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,291
at the loss of your friend.

80
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,083
It's something extraordinary
to be empowered by his return.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,166
[YUSUKE] I sense how strong
you've all become,

82
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,250
and I appreciate your help,
but I need to finish this alone.

83
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,833
Ya dig?

84
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,416
Heh.

85
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,000
Knock him dead, Yusuke Urameshi.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,833
But if you fail,
know I've got your back.

87
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,750
[RINBAI]
Sir, I'm sorry.

88
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,458
I don't know how
he did it, Captain,

89
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,000
but the Mazoku Urameshi
blew right past us.

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,041
I know how.

91
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,375
We were there
when he was reborn.

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,458
The guy's Demon Energy
is off the charts!

93
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,416
We've never had any
problems in the past

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,458
neutralizing even the strongest
A-Class Apparitions,

95
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,041
so why aren't we able
to stop this teenage boy?

96
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,000
I hunted the Spirit Fox,
and his energy

97
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,708
was nothing compared to the
vibes coming off this kid

98
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,375
It doesn't make any sense...

99
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,166
Captain, sir.

100
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,500
It's impossible!

101
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,416
They said we're the best!

102
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,500
Let me assure you
that you soldiers

103
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,666
are the finest Spirit World has.

104
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,333
But with that said, there's
always someone better.

105
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,041
[gasps] This... can't be.

106
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,291
[OOTAKE] We've operated
on a need-to-know basis,

107
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,666
and as long as we stayed
clear of Demon World's pits,

108
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,041
you didn't need to know.

109
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,625
But beyond B and A-Class...
there exists an S-Class.

110
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

111
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,916
So you're saying
that Urameshi is...

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,875
...the descendant of
one of these S-Class?!

113
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:12,958
[SHUNJUN]
And what about Sensui?

114
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,625
[OOTAKE]
Sensui is still a human,

115
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,708
but his power is equivalent
to that of an S-Class Demon.

116
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,833
So what now?

117
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,250
We should just
throw in the towel?

118
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,458
No...

119
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
I refuse to believe
that a human and a Demon

120
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,333
are stronger Spirit
World's toughest.

121
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,500
Is that really the
situation, Captain?

122
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,041
[SOLDIERS murmuring]

123
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,958
Attention, hut!

124
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,791
There's a good reason
why you never knew

125
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,208
that S-Class existed.

126
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,250
Because the Kekkai barrier
kept them out of our way.

127
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,541
So what do we do, stand around
feelin' sorry for ourselves?

128
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,708
We're the SDF
for cryin' out loud.

129
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,375
I'm sealing that net!
Who's with me?

130
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,583
[SOLDIERS]
We are, sir!

131
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,875
[OOTAKE]
That's more like it.

132
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,250
We'll have that baby
sealed up in 48 hours.

133
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,916
And we won't quit
until those two monsters

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,708
are stuck in there for good!

It's too fast!

[gasping]

144
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,375
I missed? With a
blast that giant?!

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,416
[SENSUI] It barely grazed
my Sacred Armor.

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,916
If that had been a
direct hit, I'd be in pain.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,583
My aim's off, I guess.

148
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,041
He must learn to adjust
to his new powers.

149
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,666
Yes, hardly a
marksman-like performance.

150
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,083
But don't forget...

151
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,916
If we've learned one thing
fighting with Yusuke,

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,375
it's that he adapts quickly
to new circumstances

153
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,041
to squeeze out a win.

154
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,416
Hey! Don't waste any ammo!

155
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,666
Oh! Right, I forgot...

156
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,916
There's only one more shot left.

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,541
Well, I hope I can save
it for the after-party.

158
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:50,833
[growling]

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,791
Now what?

00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,666
I don't think he likes sarcasm.

[growling]

162
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,125
He's stripped off the
Sacred Energy Armor!

163
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,541
But won't that make
him easier to attack?

164
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,500
He's shifting his
strategy to offense!

165
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,625
[yells]

166
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,875
Tch. Hey... Nice change.

167
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,541
[YUSUKE]
Now, let's go.

168
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,916
[gasps]

00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,000
[gasps]

170
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, of all the places...

171
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,125
Hey! Up here!

172
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,625
Botan?

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,708
What on earth are
you girls doing here?

174
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, Puu stopped breathing
and then he started to float,

175
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
so Shizuru and I
followed him here.

176
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,291
But then he turned
into a giant bird.

177
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,666
[gasps] So, Puu is still alive?!

178
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,541
That means Yusuke must
not be dead-- [gasps]

179
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,041
Then it's true, Yusuke really...

180
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,583
Oh, no.

181
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry, let me re-emphasize

182
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,166
this is good news...
It means Yusuke is alive!

183
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,666
[KAYKO sighs]

184
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,000
[KAYKO]
I can't keep going through this.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,166
[BOTAN] Well, we should
probably find Genkai

186
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,833
and see what she knows.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,541
Puu...

188
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,916
Take them so they
can watch the fight

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,750
from a safe distance.

190
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,250
I have a feeling this is
gonna get pretty rough.

Which one of them did that?

00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,250
I think both!

199
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,833
[KAZUYA]
Kill them all! Kill them all!

200
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,250
Kill them all!

201
00:12:55,333 --> 00:13:04,375
Soon every human will be
ass-up in their graves! [laughs]

[MINORU]
Shinobu, it feels so good

203
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,750
to manipulate them.

204
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,041
We hold Human World with
the words on our tongue,

205
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,875
and we can crush them
like little ants!

that's not what
you really want.

I know that, deep down, you
truly love your own World.

[GEORGE]
Yeah...

210
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,208
Love it so much, you wanna kill
the humans that plague it!

211
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,708
[MINORU]
With arrogance and insecurity,

212
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,583
they have destroyed
their most sacred gifts,

213
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,791
their world and their brothers.

214
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,000
At long last, their day
of judgment has come.

215
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,750
[SENSUI] Who am I...
to pass that judgment?

216
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,166
This ends here.

217
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
[KAZUYA]
Never, Shinobu!

218
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,083
It has yet... to begin!

219
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,166
After all this,
don't pussy out now!

220

Not when things are about to
get really frickin' fun here!

[SENSUI] We wouldn't...
survive to see that.

It's already too late for us.

Great...

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,500
They've knocked the

they won't be dropping in

230
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,458
to give Yusuke a helping hand.

were behind me.

Just you and me now.

There was a rock

...and now that those two
are through, there's nothin'

whaddaya say we move this fight
to a more open schoolyard?

All right, Yusuke.
Where do you suggest?

262
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,833
[YUSUKE] See that tall pointy
mountain over there?

263
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,875
There's nothing but
rocks and sand around it.

It'll be perfect.

as though you've
been there before.

so was Puu.

291
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,750
[HIEI] Quite good, considering
that the two of them

292
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,916
caused it.

All right...

294
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,750
Well, we'd better
pull back for now.

295
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,791
The power they're
generating is as great

as two S-Class Demons.

I know you're there.

It's no use hiding
your body from me

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,041
if you don't take
measures to hide

303
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,166
that Demon Energy of yours.

worry," not "Go dumb!"

00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,333
Who knows?

321
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,666
As much as Yusuke's strength

322
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,708
and abilities are continuing
to evolve before us,

323
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,333
I'm concerned about Sensui's
change of demeanor.

324
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,916
[KOENMA]
Kurama's right.

325
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,833
[KOENMA]
Before, fighting was a chore.

326
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,125
But now, he seems
to be enjoying it.

327
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,583
A weight has been lifted...

328
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,708
As though this fight is
what he's desired all along.

329
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,375
The joy of a worthy foe.

330
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,500
It's what I felt when
I fought with Yusuke.

331
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,125
That was before. Big deal.

332
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,916
Are we gonna finish this?

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes... let's.

334
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,833
--[gasps]
--[heart beats]

335
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,250
Huh?

336
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,916
[YUSUKE] There it goes
again. What is that?

337
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,125
[RAIZEN]
You are the one. At last.

338
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,000
Who... are you?

339
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,625
[RAIZEN]
You don't know

340
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:43,000
how to use your power.
Let me show you.

341
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
[gasping, grunting]

342
00:20:51,083 --> 00:21:00,208
[screams]

343
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,791
[gasps, yelps]

344
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,250
Hey, what's happened to him now?

345
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,166
I mean... Is that
really even him?

346
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,416
[NARRATOR]
Is that really Yusuke?

347
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,291
Or has he fully
become the Mazoku?

348
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,916
And as he prepares to finish
the battle with Sensui,

349
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,750
is the voice in his
head steering him

350
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:44,250
in the right direction,
or down a darker path?

351
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,833
[YUSUKE, RAIZEN]
I have returned.

352
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,458
[KUWABARA] I don't know
what's gotten into Urameshi.

353
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,500
First they say he's turned
into some kind of a Demon,

354
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,375
and now he's turned into
an 80s hair band reject.

355
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,458
But his power's turned
all the way up to 11,

356
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,625
which is bad news for Sensui.

357
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,625
Now that's all well and good,
but I'm a little worried

358
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,333
about who the new Demon-Urameshi
might go after next.

359
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,750
Especially after he does
something so drastic,

360
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,208
it shocks even him.

361
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,791
At least he doesn't
have to worry about

362
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,291
his hair turning white!

363
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,291
Sadly, I can't say the
same for you after

364
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,708
you've watched the
next Yu Yu Hakusho!
