00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,208
[NARRATOR] As Sensui threatened
the lives of Kuwabara, Kurama

2
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,375
and Hiei, Yusuke miraculously
returned from the dead,

3
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,708
revealing an astounding secret.

4
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,291
Yusuke was somehow part Demon.

5
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,791
The two resumed their battle,
though now evenly matched

6
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,208
as Yusuke displayed the energy
of his mysterious birthright.

7
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,083
With both fighting at a level
equal to S-Class Demons,

8
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,750
the fight was an
explosive stalemate--

9
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,791
until something strange stirred
within Yusuke and spoke to him,

10
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,541
guiding him toward
a transformation.

[SENSUI gasps]

17
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,666
[YUSUKE] I've waited
a long time for this.

18
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,833
What in the heck's
goin' on here?

19
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,791
And what's with that hair?!

20
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,250
Looks like he played
with an electric socket!

21
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,625
I don't know what
triggered this,

22
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,166
but it appears Yusuke's
body has finally accepted

23
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,000
the transformation
the Mazoku desired.

24
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,791
This is perfect.

25
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
[KUWABARA]
Did you guys see that?

26
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,375
Sensui cracked a smile when
he saw our freaky half-breed.

27
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,875
He really is an arrogant
creep, isn't he?

28
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,333
Pretty much, but that's
beside the point.

29
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,208
It's not Yusuke's change
that Sensui smirks at.

30
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,791
Even from this vantage point,

31
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,083
I can tell that Sensui has
undergone a profound

32
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,041
transcendent metamorphosis.

33
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,333
A "Spiritual Awakening,"
if you will.

[KUWABARA]
"Spiritual Awakening?"

[KOENMA]
Back in the cave,

36
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,291
his fighting was
filled with such...

37
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,125
...loathing and
callousness. Self-hatred.

38
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,833
His heart was so dark,
even for a bad guy.

39
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,333
But now, that's gone.

40
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,208
Yes, as if he's suddenly
come to terms with his place

41
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,000
in the world and achieved
some sort of balance.

42

What a jerk.

43
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,833
Ha! You are indeed the
descendant of the Mazoku.

44

so funny about that?

Not so much funny as...

would smile upon me.

once every forty-plus

him, it wasn't me.

But we all saw you.

'cause it was my body,

there when it happened,

wasn't, you understand?

kind of healing plant on him?

He's not dead,
he just needs a boost.

Unfortunately, I used
up most my energy

124
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,791
when I was fighting him before.
The most that I can do for him

125
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,208
now is give him something
to ease his final pain.

use 'em when you need 'em?

But if that's it, fine!

it's at least gotta be me
pulling the trigger...

Your final attack, Yusuke,

151
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,875
with it you proved yourself
to be much stronger than I.

152
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,375
But, that wasn't even my power!
I had no control over my body...

You and I, we
aren't finished yet.

00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,083
I need to know
who's really stronger.

Trust me, consciousness
exists on many levels.

Part of you that was ready
to make the choise,

157

must have taken control.

But it was definitely you,
a Demon you, who killed me.

to me, it wasn't me!

00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,625
I'll give you time to heal up.

162
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,583
You take some painkillers,
now, and then we'll do it over!

163
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,416
Only Yusuke would still want
to fight a man after he's dead.

164
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,291
Wake me when it's over.

165
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,166
Don't just stand there
Koenma, you've gotta have

166
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,000
some kind of powers
that could bring him back!

167
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,208
I did, but unfortunately they
were stored in my pacifier

168
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,708
which I drained empty in
the cave trying to stop him.

169
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,333
He's the author of his
own fate, once again.

170
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,833
I doubt I would've had
enough energy even before

171
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,666
the Mafuukan spell, I drained
so much on the way down.

172
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,125
What? Is this a confession?

173
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,875
[grunts]

174
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,791
[gasps]

175
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,583
Have a good nap, kid?

176
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,125
I-I don't get it: Why?

177
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,041
Koenma brought you back to life.
As for, why, I couldn't say.

178
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,500
Lost soul, now retrieve!

179
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,916
Maybe I've been wrong.

180
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,833
[GENKAI] The battle
must be over by now.

181
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,208
So you wasted it all saving
that brat kid's life?

182
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,416
[KOENMA]
Pretty much.

183
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
[SENSUI laughs]

184
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,166
[KOENMA]
You think that's funny?

185
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,500
You see I realized
your Mafuukan,

186
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,291
would be my greatest obstacle,

187
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,250
I arranged Amanuma's
death to drain your energy.

188
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,916
You were already riddled
with guilt over me.

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,625
I knew you would feel
compelled against all logic

190
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,166
to save the boy.

191
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,250
It was the only way
that I could ensure

192
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,375
my ultimate passage
to Demon World.

193
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,791
[KOENMA]
Shinobu,

194
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,958
I do not understand
why coming to this place

195
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,541
would matter so much to you.

196
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,958
You went through so much
trouble, and risked the

197
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,416
destruction of all of
Living World to get here. Why?

198
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,250
Because it's home.

199
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,541
[SENSUI]
Home to the apparitions whom

200
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,625
I've been taking life
from since I was a child.

201
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,500
[SENSUI] When I was younger,
I always wondered: Why me?

202
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,000
Why do these horrible
creatures pick on only me?

203
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,833
Why do they hate me?

204
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,833
Why do they want me to die?

205
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,791
But I was a child and I
never tried to ask them.

206
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,333
I never gave them
a chance to speak.

207
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,291
Instead, I improved
my fighting techniques,

208
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,791
while I grew to
hate them more

209
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,000
and wanted them
to die even more.

210
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,541
When I became a Spirit
Detective, they told me:

211
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,583
"They are not like us,
so they must be against us.

212
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,750
Their difference threatens our
sameness. It is us versus them.

213
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,666
Humans are good
and Demons are bad.

214
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,583
We are just and
they are unjust."

215
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,166
But I was an adolescent

216
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,541
and did not even think to
question such simple binaries.

217
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,833
I could not have
been more wrong.

218
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,375
I discovered the humans
I was sworn to protect

219
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,458
were, in truth, the
greater monsters.

220
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,916
And if that were so,

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,541
then I had to
question everything

222
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,000
I knew of the monsters
I'd been fighting.

223
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,250
My world turned inside out.

224
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,916
The truths I'd held to be
irrefutable were all inverted.

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,958
When I learned that
I was going to die,

226
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,041
I knew that I needed to collapse
those boundaries between us

227
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,541
and them, thus the tunnel.

228
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,333
And then, I could
come here to die.

229
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,958
I thought if I could see the
world through their eyes,

230
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,958
be a stranger in a strange
land, then maybe I could

231
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,375
understand them better,
and thus understand myself.

232
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,000
Dying by Demon hands,

233
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,458
I could then make
penance for my sins

234
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,541
[gasps]

235
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,791
[SENSUI]
But then I saw you, Urameshi.

236
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,208
First demonized in
a human's body,

237
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,750
and then humanized in a Demon's.

238
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,583
You dissolved the
barriers between us

239
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,458
in ways I never imagined.

240
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,833
And now, I can finally rest.

241
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,583
Shinobu...

242
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,875
Urameshi, you are the
justice I could never find.

243
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,666
Great changes will
come through you.

244
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,500
Someday when you're
lying in my position,

245
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,416
you'll know a dying
man's need for closure.

246
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,333
But until then, thank you.

247
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,375
[gasps]

248
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,708
I'll take you myself.

249
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,166
[ITSUKI]
I won't let you.

250
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,291
[ITSUKI]
Shinobu's dead.

251
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,708
You got the end you desired,

252
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,291
so don't you think he
deserves the same?

253
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,833
He devoted the
last ten years

254
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,916
to refuting everything
you believe in.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,541
He didn't live by your standards

256
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,333
and he certainly didn't
want to die by them.

257
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,541
So, I won't let you take
him to Spirit World,

258
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,041
for you to judge
him in your way.

259
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,625
See?

260
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,375
Being defeated by the Mazoku
was precisely the cathartic jolt

261
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,250
he needed to resolve his inner
turmoil, and pay off his guilt.

262
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,166
He finally conquered those six
personalities and emerged as

263
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,708
Shinobu, his original,
untainted self.

264
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,666
So, in a way, he's
already been redeemed

265
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,291
and doesn't need you
people to do it for him.

266
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,500
[gasps]

267
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,250
Where will you take him?

268
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,250
[ITSUKI] Somewhere his
soul won't be subjected

269
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,708
to your overbearing
scorn and judgment.

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,250
Where it will be safe from
hypocritical administrators

271
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,833
who train a boy to be a killer

272
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,666
and then hunt him down
for being one as a man.

273
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,708
Your people do not
deserve Shinobu's soul.

274
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,458
Your Spirit World will have
to create another enemy so

275
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,375
you can keep on fighting, as
that is, after all, what you do.

276
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,750
But Shinobu and I
grow weary of that.

277
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,416
We are going to spend
the rest of eternity together,

278
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,166
in solitude, and in peace.

279
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,916
Damn it.

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If I kicked his ass, why do I
still feel like he won?

281
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,833
It's true, in a way, Sensui
achieved the very thing

282
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,458
that he intended by
initiating all of this.

283
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,708
Uh... Question, Urameshi.

284
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,083
What is it?

285
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,666
I was just wonderin'
if you feel kinda' weird.

286
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,500
Now that you mention it...

287
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,875
yeah, somethin' on my
back's really been makin' it

288
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,791
itch quite a bit.

289
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,083
[gasps]

290
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,000
I must look like I've
been playing around

291
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,125
with an electric socket!

292
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,500
See you guys, that's
exactly what I said.

293
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,500
That's just the
physical resemblance

294
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,458
to your ancestor rising
to the surface, Yusuke.

295
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,916
Though, I'm beginning to suspect

296
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,041
that he's still alive
somewhere in this world.

297
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,583
So then,

298
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,000
he must've been the guy who
turned me into his own personal

299
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
marionette during that
last shot on Sensui.

300
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,958
What makes you so sure?

301
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,750
Oh, just something
that the crazy voice

302
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,666
in my head said to me,
but you'd never know.

303
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,375
You're hearin' voices?

304
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,500
[RAIZEN]
You are the one.

305
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,250
[RAIZEN]
At last.

306
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,000
Who are you?

307
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,416
[RAIZEN] You don't know
how to use your power.

308
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,166
Let me show you.

309
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,333
And those words are the
last thing that I remember

310
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,625
hearing before everything went
silent and I blacked out.

311
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,041
Then what?

312
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,083
[gasps]

313
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,375
Hey watch where you're
pointin' that thing!

314
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,125
You asked what
happened next, right?

315
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,291
Well this is how I
was when I woke.

316
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,958
I'd just finished
shooting my Spirit Gun.

317
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,666
I saw the blast
heading for Sensui

318
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,083
like it was in slow motion,

319
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,500
but I realized I wasn't
the one who fired it.

320
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,416
Let's go!

321
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,166
[KUWABARA]
Uh?

322
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,708
[KOENMA]
Go where?

323
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,666
If my ancestor is here and still
alive, we have to find him!

324
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,958
[KOENMA,KURAMA gasp]

325
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,875
Oh... come on Urameshi!

326
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,625
We closed the case
and saved the world.

327
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,541
Can't we at least take a nap?

328
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm not gonna rest until I
get to the bottom of this.

329
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,833
My ancestors got in the way of
my fight and I can't let him get

330
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,625
away with that, no matter
who he's related to!

331
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,916
If you aren't with me, fine.

332
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,666
I'll just stay and
find him on my own.

333
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,041
You know Yusuke...

334
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,416
[YUSUKE gasps]

335
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,583
...you may want to give
this decision more thought.

336
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,458
The S.D.F. have no doubt
been busy little beavers

337
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,708
while we've been gone,

338
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,458
damming up the tunnel
on Living World side.

339
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,958
[KOENMA] Now those toadies
may be many things,

340
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,583
but they are not inefficient.

341
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,875
That hole will be
filled in like a cavity

342
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,666
within a matter of days.

343
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,458
[KUWABARA]
Wait a minute.

344
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,708
If the hole is sealed up,

345
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,041
t-then we... uh...

346
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,583
Won't ever be able to
return to Human World again.

347
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,291
You mean I'll never eat another
double cheeseburger?

348
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,500
[KOENMA] You can go
back to Human World now,

349
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,708
or stay here in
Demon World forever.

350
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,833
But you have to choose.

351
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,791
[KOENMA]
I'll give you a couple minutes

352
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,666
to think it over, Yusuke.

353
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,125
Ha! I don't need it, I've
already made up my mind.

354
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,583
[KOENMA]
What?!

355
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,375
Load up, Puu.
Let's go back home.

356
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,875
[NARRATOR]
Another case draws to a close.

357
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,083
Sensui has been defeated and
Human World has been spared

358
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,375
cataclysmic destruction, thanks
to Yusuke and his friends.

359
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,833
Now that the battle is over,

360
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,541
life for our heroes
can return to normal,

361
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,833
at least, until the next dark
cloud appears on the horizon.

362
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,166
[YUSUKE] Back at school,
and I could use the sleep.

363
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,000
You think we're all
wrapped up, right?

364
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,875
Well, what about
Doctor jail-busting

365
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,750
and meeting Sniper in the woods?

366
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,125
Or Game Master fitting
into normal life?

367
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,916
Is Kido still paralyzed?

368
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,541
And can Mitarai
do school work

369
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,000
without attacking
his classmates?

370
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,166
Where did Itsuki go with Sensui?

371
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,625
And will King Yama disown
Koenma for going AWOL?

372
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,041
Eh... Can I even stay
in this world at all?

373
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,708
So yeah, there's just a
few loose ends to tie up,

374
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,250
next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
