00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,666
[BYAKKO]
A fine view, isn't it?

162
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:59,375
This is my private chamber.
I come here to... play.

163
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,833
No way! He's back to normal!

164
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,875
Monster you piss me off!

165
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,875
As you've already discovered,
this room is filled with lava

166
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,166
that will melt
anything it touches.

167
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,000
So, does anyone have the courage
to come and challenge me?

168
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,958
You bet I do, circus-freak!

169
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,833
You think you've
got so much power!

170
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,375
Hey.

171
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,541
Leave him to me, Urameshi.

172
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,125
Kuwabara.

173
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,666
Let the sword-man come.

174
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,583
He and I have a very
pressing score to settle.

175
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,291
You got that one right, Byakko!

176
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,208
And this time I'm beating you up
in ways the Vet can't even fix!

177
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,041
There's no need
to push yourself.

178
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,583
You have fought well enough.

179
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,291
Now let Yusuke take
over the battle

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,833
so you can heal in the small
chance that we need you later.

181
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,625
I'm sorry Hiei, but I just
don't think I can do that!

182
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,583
See I got this
thing called a code.

183
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,041
And it says no matter how ugly a
fight gets I always finish it!

184
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,875
Even if it means
risking my life!

185
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,916
A human with an honor code.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,458
You can't argue with the
guy. He's like a mule.

187
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,041
Yes, he's almost
as stubborn as you.

188
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,333
[BYAKKO] What, have
you all surrendered?

189
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,666
Shut up! I'm coming
you impatient hair-ball!

190
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,083
[YUSUKE]
Kuwabara!!

191
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,666
I don't wanna die. I don't
wanna die. I don't wanna die.

192
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,916
[YUSUKE] Hey! You sure you
don't want me to tag in?!

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,916
[KUWABARA] Shut up Urameshi!
I'm completely on top of this!

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,875
Yeah, I just got
distracted 'cause

195
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,250
it's so stink'n hot in here!

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,958
Now I'm ready to fight!

197
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,708
Come claw at me whenever
you want, Byakko!!

198
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
[Byakko laughs]

199
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,916
Actually,
I was planning to use...

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
A different kind
of attack this time.

201
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,375
That's fine with me.

202
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,541
What is that?

203
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
Something powerful.

204
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:33,791
Very.

205
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,041
So it does exist.

206
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,208
You'll have to do
better than that!

207
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,791
With my good old Spirit Sword

208
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:50,541
I can knock that baby out of the
ballpark and into your face!

209
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,166
No! You mustn't
touch it! Get away!

210
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,375
What?!

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey! My jacket!

212
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,958
[Byakko laughs]

213
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,458
You like it?
I call it my Tiger Scream.

214
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,250
Everything it touches transforms
into a pile of ashes!

215
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,583
Uh-oh.

216
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,000
For years I have heard
of a fighter who

217
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,708
could destroy molecular bonds

218
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,708
with the vibration of his voice.

219
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,750
I never thought I'd meet him.

220
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,375
So he can't use his
Spirit Sword on it?

221
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,958
No, the sword would
cause a chain reaction

222
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,583
that would destroy
his entire spirit.

223
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,750
[KOENMA] Hiei is right.
That type of attack

224
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,791
is impossible to block.

225
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,041
Koenma sir, there must
be something he can do!

226
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,875
I wish I knew more
about these Saint Beasts!

227
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,708
But I'm afraid all
we can do is pray!

228
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,000
Please don't let these Saint
Beasts win and invade the Earth!

229
00:15:53,083 --> 00:16:04,708
So much paper work. 

230
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh man.

231
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,041
The only thing you
can do now is run!

232
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,125
Guess I'm too fast for ya!

233
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,291
[Byakko roars]

234
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,291
Had enough??

235
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,208
Tiger Claws!!!

236
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,708
What the...?

237
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,541
Kuwabara! Would you
switch with me already?!!

238
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,333
You ain't so bad.

239
00:16:54,416 --> 00:17:00,625
You surprise me, still fighting
despite your frail human body.

240
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:05,083
Get used to it. 'Cause I'm
not stopping until you die.

241
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,958
[BYAKKO] That's very noble,

242
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,375
but the truth is you've
already stopped.

243
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,333
Like all my victims before you,

244
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,333
my Tiger Scream
has proved too much.

245
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,375
I don't know what
you're talking about.

246
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,916
You never hit me once!

247
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,333
All those freakin blasts and you
missed me every single time!

248
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,875
Yes, but while
you have been

249
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,916
frantically running
for you life,

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,958
I've ensnared you.

251
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,125
You what?

252
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,583
[BYAKKO]
Take a look around you.

253
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,375
I've destroyed every pillar
within your jumping reach.

254
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,875
You have nowhere to go.

255
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,833
Except of course for the
pillar I am standing on.

256
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,000
With all of your effort,
you might be able to reach me,

257
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,000
but then I will kill you myself.

258
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,083
[KUWABARA THINKS] He forgot one.

259
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,166
[BYAKKO] Once again, I'll let
you choose your way to die.

260
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,291
Either burn up in the lava...

261
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,708
Or be eaten by me.

262
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:12,041
Sorry. The little ones
are so easy to overlook.

263
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,000
You're trapped,
just accept it.

264
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,958
It'll make the last
moments much easier.

265
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,041
Kuwabara?

266
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,416
Can you reach him Hiei?

267
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
If need be.

268
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,166
[KUWABARA]
You guys better stay put!!

269
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,250
You're whispering to each other
about how you can rescue me,

270
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,708
aren't you!!

271
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,208
How many times do
I have to tell you

272
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,166
I don't want your help?!

273
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,125
I don't understand that guy!

274
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,625
Does he not realize
he's about to die?

275
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,500
Perhaps he's still
devising an attack.

276
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,291
Perhaps
he's a fool.

277
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,500
Those guys are just anxious to
fight. Don't worry about them.

278
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,333
Idiot! They were your
last chance to survive!

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,625
[KUWABARA THINKS]
We'll see about that!

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,208
He's jumping.

281
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,541
Kuwabara!!!

282
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,458
He didn't make it!

283
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,666
Actually I lied! You could
never have reached me!

284
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
[Kuwabara cries out]

285
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,791
[BYAKKO] His sword!
He used it like a vault!

286
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,166
[KUWABARA THINKS]
I'm just happy I got to hit you.

287
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,666
Now let's go to
Hell together!

288
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,416
Kuwabara!!!

289
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,666
No, he can't.

290
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,583
It's--it's wrong.

291
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,166
[YUSUKE YELLS]
You can't die!!!

292
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,625
It's all so stupid!!

293
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,708
I mean we're protecting the
world! So who's protecting us?!

294
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,625
[KUWABARA] Hey!!! Can I get
some help here?! Guys?!

295
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,875
Come on you guys! Hurry up!

296
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,000
I think I can
feel somethin' slipin'.

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,083
He's alive!

298
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,416
How fortunate.

299
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,916
[KOENMA] I'm going to
die at an early age.

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,166
Byakko's gone!

301
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,208
That means two out of
the four Saint Beasts

302
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,166
have been defeated, sir!

303
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,125
[KOENMA] It's far
too early to celebrate.

304
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,500
Soon we'll see if Yusuke's
training really paid off.

305
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,875
You had me scared
there, Kuwabara.

306
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,166
For a second I thought
you bit the dust.

307
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,791
Yeah-yeah it's exciting.
Now help me up!!

308
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,083
Well, an interesting strategy.

309
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,500
Maybe we should let you kill
the other Beasts this way, too.

310
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,791
Yes.

311
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,041
No way, you guys!

312
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,708
I've done my share of
fighting for this trip!

313
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,708
Now would you please stop
goofing around and help me up?!

314
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,833
But we can't Kuwabara!
Don't you remember?

315
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,041
You said you'd kill
us if we helped you!

316
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,083
Yes, it goes against
your honor code.

317
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:25,416
But, that doesn't count! Once
I beat them it's okay you see!!

318
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,291
Well, we've still got two more
Saint Beasts we've got to fight!

319
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,416
Might as well get going!

320
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,125
Yes.

321
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,000
[YUSUKE] We'll catch up with you
later, Kuwabara! Hang in there!

322
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,541
[KUWABARA] Hey,
come on, guys, wait!

323
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:41,791
No, no-no! You didn't leave,
did you? Come on guys!! Hey...!!

324
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,541
[NARRATOR] Finally,
the ferocious Byakko

325
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,125
has been put to rest.

326
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,000
But two beasts
are still lurking.

327
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,750
[YUSUKE] Okay,
we're getting closer to the

328
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,125
top of this castle,
but what do you know!

329
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,458
We just can't move a few feet

330
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,666
without meeting
more ugly trouble!

331
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,541
This time it's
the Third Saint Beast,

332
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,750
a twelve-footer named Seiryu who
says he's a Blue Dragon!

333
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,875
And Hiei's gonna
take him alone.

334
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,791
You know, I fought
Hiei once before,

335
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,250
but--WHOA--he never
pulled these stunts!

336
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,791
Sword-slashing, huge powers,

337
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,416
and that nasty attitude
we just can't resist!

338
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,416
That's next time
on Yu Yu Hakusho!

339
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:27,416
