resort to his Spirit Gun.

allowed to use his Spirit Gun?

[KUWABARA] Because
Urameshi made a promise...

And now everything he lives for

is hanging on
his ability to fight.

188

Not too long ago,

a very strong fighter.

His attacks still haunt me, and
I think they haunt Urameshi too.

This guy was insanely muscular
and completely unstoppable!

[KEIKO] And that's
who he's fighting now?

[KUWABARA] No. Chu's tough,
but not that tough.

He's nothin' compared
to that other guy.

195
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,125
[KEIKO] So... then
we shouldn't worry?

196
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,666
[KUWABARA] I wouldn't say that.

197
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,958
Urameshi could definitely
still get killed by Chu.

198
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,375
Besides, winning this fight

199
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,541
is only his first step
in taking on that guy again.

200
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,875
[KEIKO] What?!

201

I'm not really supposed
to talk about this stuff,

202

but an honest to
goodness rematch

203
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,250
with Toguro is the only
reason we came here to fight.

00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,208
Oh, but, but why?

205

It sounds like you don't even
have a chance at beating him!

206
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,041
[KUWABARA]
Well, Keiko, let's just say,

207
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,208
we don't have a choice.

208
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,583
So, who won in the first fight?

209
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,166
Well, Urameshi
and I worked together

210
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
and knocked Toguro down--

211

put a sword through his stomach.

212
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,208
We left him for dead,

213
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,125
but it turns out he
faked getting beat

214
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,541
for some kind of payoff.

215
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,458
Then the guy shows up again

216
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,916
and forces us to
fight him here for real.

217
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,416
Urameshi has to
fight Toguro again.

218
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,750
And more than that, he wants to.

219
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,708
You see Keiko it's our
only chance to settle this.

220
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,625
Then and only then, we'll
know who's stronger than who.

221
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,458
And that is why I
owe it to Urameshi

not to step in there
now and save his life!

They're so evenly matched.
It must end in a stalemate,

or it might never end at all!

standing on their last legs.
