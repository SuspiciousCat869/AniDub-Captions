[NARRATOR]
The Demon World Tournament

2
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,250
comes with a hefty prize.

3
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,500
Its winner will become king
of the entire Demon World.

4
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,625
Yusuke's friends from the past
were beaten one by one.

5
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,500
Then, moving to round two,
Kurama faced Shigure,

6
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,708
the infamous surgeon

7
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,208
who implanted Hiei
with the Jagan Eye.

8
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,791
Trying to sever his connections
to his dark past,

9
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,541
Kurama refused to summon
his full demon form, Yoko.

10
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,291
By the numbers, Kurama
was gravely outmatched.

11
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,541
But through heart and wits,
he has narrowly prevailed.

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,458
[DEMON CROWD cheering]

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,916
[KOENMA sighs] That was too
close for comfort if you ask me.

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,166
He... barely has any
of his energy left.

15
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,708
[KOENMA] I hope he can
survive the next match.

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,083
And if he's beaten...

17
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,208
What happens if Yusuke
or Hiei can't win either?

18
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,708
Oops. Speaking of which,
where did Hiei go?

19
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,041
Hey, uh, pal, can you
tell me who's up next?

20
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,958
Hold on, let me see. Uh... Uh.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Whoa... That's a match-up.

22
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,416
Well sports fans, I hope
you brought your appetites

23
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,958
for destruction, because
our next gruesome twosome

24
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,708
is no other than
Mukuro and Hiei!

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,416
[KOTO] That's right. The top
two in Mukuro's camp

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,833
slated against each other!

27
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,333
And it looks like Hiei's ready

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,583
to get this freak
show on the road!

29
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,375
We could not have asked for a
more fortunate turn of events.

30
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,583
By fighting one another,

31
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,125
they're greatly reducing
our competition.

32
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,125
Would you quit muttering
crap like that!

33
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,791
You're embarrassing us!

34
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,375
[HOKUSHIN]
What do you mean?

35
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,875
I mean, it makes
us sound weak.

36
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,958
[HOKUSHIN gasps]
Right... I'm sorry.

37
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,125
Maybe we do need help,
but no one needs to know.

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,291
[TOUYA] Kurama, let us
take you to a doctor.

39
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,625
Yeah, Touya's right, you're
not looking so pretty.

40
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,458
[JIN]
Yeah, it's no lie he says.

41
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,125
I'm fine...

42
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,083
All I need now are a
few moments to rest.

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,583
Y'be needin' more'n that.

44
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,791
Just alow me to watch
Hiei's next battle...

45
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,708
then I will go with you.

46
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,416
[KOTO]
Hiei, ready...!

47
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,916
Mukuro, ready...!

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,541
Begin!

49
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,416
Before we have our battle,
I'm curious to know...

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,666
is your opinion about death
still the same as it was before?

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,666
Yes, I remain convinced.

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,875
There's nothing left in
this life to live for.

53
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,625
I don't believe you.

54
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,416
[MUKURO] You have been
the only one to submit

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,375
your consciousness
to mine so fully,

56
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,208
and it feels the most like home.

57
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,291
Touch my consciousness,
and you will not be empty.

58
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,291
[MUKURO] Like you,
I was also abandoned,

59
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,708
and I fell victim to a
fate worse than death.

60
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:23,125
[baby cries]

61
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:39,583
[chains rattle]

62
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,333
[MUKURO] I was sold into slavery
before I was even old enough

63
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:47,125
to know what a slave was. My
first memories were of the cold,

64
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,291
hard shackles tearing
through my delicate skin.

65
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,333
I knew nothing of
my home or family.

66
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,500
I didn't even know my own name.

67
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,708
[MUKURO]
The only thing I was sure of

68
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,708
was my intense desire
to taste freedom.

69
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:09,000
So when the time was
right, I ran away.

70
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,083
[MUKURO] But in those years,
my captors had stolen much more

71
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,500
from me than my liberty.

72
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,916
No matter how hard I tried,

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,541
I couldn't free myself
from my shackles

74
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,458
The scars that bondage
had seared into my spirit

75
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,583
were so deep, it didn't matter
if my body was free...

76
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,375
In a way, it seemed fitting
that I should remain in irons,

77
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:50,041
held captive by
my own dark past.

78
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,583
From that day forward,

79
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,041
a deep burning hate began to
consume my already empty heart,

80
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,166
so it only made sense that I
should become a fighter...

81
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,125
the more severe
my hatred became,

82
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,666
the more successful
I was in combat.

83
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,666
I soon earned a reputation of
being one of the most ruthless

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,291
killers Demon World
had ever seen.

85
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,958
Eventually, I grew strong enough
to compete with Raizen himself.

86
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,166
[MUKURO]
But now, something's changed.

87
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,000

why aren't you dead?

91
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,916
Continuing to fight isn't
going to change anything,

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
so you might as
well put yourself

93

out of your misery
once and for all.

For my entire life,

I've never experienced
the joy of being loved.

97
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,125
I've had to endure being
despised and deserted

98

[HIEI grunts]

to purge my pain through blood.

101
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,500
[HIEI] Perhaps that's why
I feel you understood me.

[HIEI grunts]

[HIEI] After all,
we're both only capable

of expressing ourselves
through our violence.

This is really
quite interesting.

What are you
mumbling about now?

110
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,916
Well, I could be wrong,
but it seems to me that they're

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,291
using fighting as a means to
communicate with each other.

112

[BOTAN]
Uh.

Why didn't you hit me
when you had the chance?

116
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,833
[HIEI] I was under
the impression

117
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,375
that you were supposed
to be a ruthless killer.

118
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,166
The kind of competitor
that's incapable of mercy.

119
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,750
Why should your tactics
change so dramatically

120
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,916
because you're
fighting against me?

121
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,125
Don't you know?

122
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,958
[HIEI] Those kinds of gestures
are wasted on me.

123
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:20,250
I refuse to be insulted by
these half-hearted attempts.

you were born a fire demon

even though your mother's
people are all ice apparitions.

to be born with a nature in
direct opposition to my breed...

with no choice but to consume

You know, for a fight
between two heartless,

uncomfortably bloodless.

I can't pin it down,

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,250
but there's definitely something
in the way of his fists.

[HIEI grunting]

162
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,708
If you're having such trouble
hurting me with two eyes, Hiei,

163
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,416
then why don't you
open your third?

164
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,416
Unless, of course, you're
the one fighting half-assed.

Uh.

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,166
Confront it now.

168
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
You've obviously got
the Jagan for a reason.

169
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,583
All I want you to
do is use it to find

170
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,333
what you've been looking for.

171
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,541
[MUKURO]
End your search.

172
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,083
The real one.

173
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,583
[MUKURO]
And find yourself.

174
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,416
Did you see that ray of light?

175
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,416
She's able to divide space.

176
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,833
What did you say?

177
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,208
I thought that it was
nothing but a rumor...

178
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,791
but it would seem the stories
are actually true.

179
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,500
What does it do now?

180
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,041
Mukuro can cut directly through

181
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,208
the entire third
dimension itself.

182
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:30,416
Anyone who comes in contact with
the cuts will be split as well.

She's slowly creating a
razor sharp spider's web.

186
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,958
If Hiei doesn't do
something swiftly,

187
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,458
he's going to
be torn apart.

Stop playing games, Hiei.

190

We can't keep going
back and forth forever.

191

Neither of us will be satisfied
until we properly settle this...

to its only true resolution.

Yes, you're right about me,

194
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,125
there is something
I can't avoid.

195

Just remember,
you asked for it.

Ah. Um, well... fight fans...

[HIEI]
I hope you understand

199
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,041
that once I unleash
this kind of power,

200

there will be no turning
back for either of us!

In fact, I welcome it.

Very well.

other way for me to know.

Thank you.

In truth, every time you've
summoned the dragon,

00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,875
you weren't strong enough
to control it consciously.

It could only feed off the
intentions of your soul.

Ha. I accept that,
and all that it means.

Well folks, I can't
believe my own ears...

it sounds like Hiei
has conceded...

is advancing to the third round!

Maybe he did win.
