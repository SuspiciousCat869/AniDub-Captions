One hundred days after Yusuke

00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,416
persuaded Yomi and Mukuro to
dismantle their governments,

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,208
the Demon World Tournament
is set to begin.

00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,666
Six thousand two hundred
and seventy-two Demons

have signed up to fight.

6
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,083
And hundreds of
thousands are filing in

7
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,541
to see who their
new leader will be.

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,125
Though most expect Yomi
or Mukuro will win,

9
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,958

the air over a contest

[DEMON 1] That's Yusuke
Urameshi, descendant of Raizen.

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,916
This was all his idea
in the first place.

I'm not feelin' much
power from him.

22
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,500
I wonder how Yomi and Mukuro got
swayed by such a lightweight.

Hah! It's not important how,

that they got swayed!

get matched up early on

and knock each other out, then

then you're absolutely right!

00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,708
...like Koto rocks it,
am I right?!

00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,875
--[CROWD cheering]
--[CHU] I love you, Foxy!

160
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,666
On a brief note,
for my hardcore fans,

161
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,916
I'd like to say I did escape
the last tourney safely,

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,125
and Juri got what
she was looking for!

163
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,291
But on that note,
let's get into the action!

164
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,708
Joining me now is... uh... huh?

165
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,166
Hey, there!

166
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,291
[KOTO]
I know you!

167
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,750
You're that rapping ogre!

168
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right, but you
can call me Jorge.

169
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,500
How great is this,

170
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,166
the two of us together again
away from my heartless boss?

171

[gasps]

172
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,166
[JORGE]
Huh?

173
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,541
[KOENMA]
Ogre!

174
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,250
[JORGE]
Oh, just kill me now.

175
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,875
Standing in for
the rapping ogre is

176
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,958
Yomi's old advisor,
the expert Mr. Youda.

177
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,208
Thank you.

178
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,625
Have you gone and lost
your last marble, Ogre?!

179
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,875
If anyone here finds out
we're from Spirit World,

180
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,333
they'll chop our heads off!

181
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,458
But I have a great voice...

182
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,041
Originally, the
drawing was to use

183
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,375
the engraved Rurimaru stones
that Yusuke presented to Yomi.

184
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,958
But because of the huge turnout,

185
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,416
we'll be using lottery
cards instead.

186
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
Each contestant will draw
the number of the group

187
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,041
they'll be in for
the preliminaries.

[KOTO]
Miste--Miss Mukuro,

189
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,500

be fighting in Group 74.

[KOTO]
Mr. Yomi,

191
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,500

has drawn Group 34.

[KOTO]
The man who proposed this event

194
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,708
and won the Dark Tournament,

195
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,375
Mr. Urameshi,
will be in Group 106.

196
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,458
[KOTO]
Mr. Hiei, Group 5...

197
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,333
Things didn't shape
up too poorly...

198
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,875
None of us are
in the same group.

199
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,250
[YUSUKE]
That's not exactly true...

200

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,708
What's this?

203
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,791
[KOTO]
Oh my!

204
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,666
It seems Yomi and Shura,
father and son,

205
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,500
are being pitted
against one another.

206
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,708
Both of them will go in,

207
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,625
but only one of them
will come out a winner!

208
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,375
That's good news
for us, Mr. Urameshi.

209

[TOUOU gasps]

210
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,541
[YUSUKE] Don't ever say
anything like that to me again.

211
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,958
[KOTO] And that concludes
the lottery portion

212
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,500
of the Demon World Tournament.

213
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,625
Well, I've just been
handed some information.

214
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,083
It's a long list
of all the fighters

215
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,833
who've voluntarily dropped
out of the tournament!

216
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,875
What do you make
of this, Mr. Youda?

217
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,833
Any number of things.

218
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,666
First of all, I'd venture
that many of them

219
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,333
were placed either in
Mukuro or Yomi's brackets,

220
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,750
and would rather turn tail than
go head to head against them.

221
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,125
The rest probably just
wanted their 15 seconds

222
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,541
in front of the camera, and are
leaving before it gets nasty.

223
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,041
There's a point of view
I can't understand.

224
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,791
Now, let the Demon World
Tournament begin!

The preliminary matches

00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,458
who shrunk into his imp form
to attack from the inside!

316
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,333
[CHU]
It's no use, you dills!

317
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,375
[CHU yells]

318
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,041
[KOTO] Other fighters
are having no problems

319
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,000
racking up decisive wins,
like Enki,

320
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,166
the king of the hill
over at Group 59.

321
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,125
He must've gotten
some practice at home

322
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,958
because his wife, Kokou,
is no slouch herself!

323
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,833
[KOTO]
Such grace, such poise,

324
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,083
such complete ability
to kick the boys' asses!

325
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,291
Making Enki and Kokou our
only husband-and-wife champs!

326
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,833
[NARRATOR] Others of
Raizen's old friends

327
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
made it past the preliminaries

328
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,500
without revealing
their true strength.

329
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,250
However, some in the crowd
could not be fooled.

330
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,000
[YOMI]
They are more powerful...

331
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,291
[MUKURO
...than they are letting on.

332
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:51,333
[CROWD cheering]

333
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,833
By my count,
that makes 47.

334
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:56,833
[thud]

335
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,375
[groans]

336
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,041
Huh?

337
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,166
I see they've saved
the cutest for last.

338
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,916
[CHU]
I can feel it.

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,916
She's mightier than she looks.

340
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,625
[CHU]
She's about to pounce, is she?

341
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,458
[CHU yells]

342
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,041
Huh?!

343
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,666
[CHU]
She's up and vanished!

344
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,333
[CHU] Strewth, her energy's in
a whole other league than mine.

345
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,250
Ready for round two?

346
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,708
[CHU]
No...

347
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,500
Not just yet.

348
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,291
[KOTO] Well, this is
certainly disappointing.

349
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,458
Instead of exchanging punches,
they're exchanging words.

350
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,125
Can we get in closer?
And jack up the audio!

351
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,541
I don't even know
your name, my love.

352
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,833
Natsume.

353
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
[CHU]
Natsume...

354
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,625
[laughs]

355
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,833
Well, I surrender.

356
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,333
Now, how bout a date?

357
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,541
Sorry, I must've knocked a few
screws loose when I hit you.

358
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,375
[CHU] No, no, I haven't
gone batty! I'm just in love!

359
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,791
That's too bad.

360
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,916
I don't usually go
for the wimpy guys.

361
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,166
I can change! Please,
give a bloke a fair go!

362
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,625
I'll train till I'm dead
or stronger than you,

363
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,083
if only you'll promise
to be my own sheila.

364
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,625
How dare you...

365
00:18:55,708 --> 00:19:00,125
...turn this tournament
into a dating service!

366
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,875
[CHU] I'll kick your ass
if you want, I swear!

367
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,208
Man, what a hypocrite
he turned out to be!

368
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,541
Ever since the Dark Tournament,
all he's said is,

369
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,708
"I gotta train, so I can
beat that bloke, Urameshi!"

370
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,250
Then he gives it
all up, for what?

371
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,458
Only a nice pair of legs and
a cute butt, that's what!

372
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,541
[SASUGA]
Oh! There you are!

373
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,000
It is you, isn't it? Rinku with
the killer yo-yos from Group 8?

374
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,500
I heard you took out 16 guys
at once with one amazing attack!

375
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
I'm Sasuga, winner from Group 7.

376
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,375
It's great to meet you!

377
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,000
I got dragged here by my friends
and only entered on a dare,

378
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,000
but now I'm the only
one who's still in it!

379
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,708
Anyways, I think you and me
are gonna be matched together,

380
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,333
which is great. Just don't
be too rough on me, okay?

381
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,875
This is my first tournament!

382
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
Rinku?

383
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,333
What is it?

384
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,041
Oh... nothing...

385
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,208
At least the rest of
us still have focus.

386
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,416
[REF 2]
Group 106,

387
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,750
your preliminary fight
is about to begin.

388
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,708
You're disqualified if you
faint, die, or surrender.

389
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,916
They must mean business if
they cut you just for dying.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,250
[DEMON 19]
We should take him out first,

391
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,958
and then go after each other.

392
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
[DEMON 20]
Fine, on my command, attack.

393
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,833
[REF 2]
Let the match begin!

[alarm buzzes]

395
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,125
There's nothin' betta than
being the center of attention.

396
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,541
Attack!

397
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,166
[DEMON 21 groaning]

[CROWD chattering]

403
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,541
I guess the odds
weren't in their favor.

--[BOTAN] Oh my!
--[JORGE cheers]

405
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,583
[KOENMA] I guess to say,
"He's gotten better",

406
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,375
would be the usual
understatement.

407
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,541
[YUSUKE]
Hey!

408
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,166
Doesn't look like anybody
fainted, died, or surrendered!

409
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,833
So, what happens now? We done?

410
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,458
Well, I think it's safe
to say they're... out!

411
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,625

[CROWD cheering]

414
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,833
That leaves just one last
preliminary match undecided!

415
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,666
[NARRATOR]
But that final preliminary match

416
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,291
is no ordinary one...

417
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,625
Group 34, featuring
Yomi versus Shura,

418
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,291
a dramatic battle,
pitting father against son,

419
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,333
where one of them has to fall.

420

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,500
[KOTO]
Hello, all you fans,

422
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,375
gripped to your well-cushioned
households seats,

423
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,083
have I got a treat for you!

424
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,750
There's only one
person in the world

425
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,541
Yomi cares about more
than his lust for power,

426
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,416
but to get one, he may
have to sacrifice the other!

427
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,958
Isn't fate delightfully cruel?

428
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,166
Or will the son be the one
to spoil daddy's dreams?

429
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,541
Either way, it's going to be
the most intensely personal,

430
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,541
physical, and
mystical prelim yet!
