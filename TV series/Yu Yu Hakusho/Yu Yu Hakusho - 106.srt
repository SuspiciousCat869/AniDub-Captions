00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,166
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Yu Yu Hakusho,

2
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,750
Yusuke respected
Raizen's final wishes,

3
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,625
and proposed to decide
the leader of Demon World

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:48,166
by tournament with an invitation
for all Demons to enter.

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,875
As the ambitions and egos
of the fighters began to stir,

6
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,041
the preliminary matches
got underway

7
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,333
following a drawing to
match up the fighters.

8
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,875
Through this process,
Yomi and Shura,

9
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,583
father and son, were
pitted against each other.

10
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,041
This last battle of
the preliminary matches

11
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,708
is going to be a stormy one.

12
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,583
[KOTO] After launching
128 preliminary matches,

13
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,875
the only one of those that
has yet to see a victor

14
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,250
is between Yomi and
Shura of Group 34.

15
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,375
Although this is just
an elimination round,

16
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,625
there's a lot of drama
stirred up over this battle

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,916
between father and son.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,375
Which one of these
brave fighters

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,500
will be moving on to
the main tournament?

20
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,166
Well, as soon as they decide
to end their staring contest,

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,166
we'll have a better idea.
Let's go!

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,416
[SHURA yells]

23
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,291
Bandit Darts!

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,375
And Shura makes the first move!

25
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,708
But with all that smoke,

26
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,083
it's hard to see what
kind of damage he's done.

27
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
[giggles] I won!

28
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,791
[YOMI]
What are you so giddy about?

29
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,833
[gasps]

30
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,708
[chuckles]

31
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,041
[SHURA screams]

32
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,333
[SHURA screams]

33
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,208
[KOTO]
This father and son duel is

34
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,000
moving so fast
through the trees that

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,416
even our best cameras
can't keep up with them!

36
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,250
The kid moves like a
gazelle on steroids.

37
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,083
And Yomi matches his pace,
bounce for bounce.

38
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,666
[KURAMA]
I wonder what importance

39
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,541
this battle holds for Yomi.

40
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,291
If he were simply
playing to win,

41
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,708
he could have taken out
his son a long time ago.

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,500
What do you see
in the fight, Hiei?

43
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,208
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,708
Does it look to you like

45
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,208
Yomi's forgotten everything
to further enjoy the battle?

46
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,875
That's what I've heard
people say about him.

47
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,125
I don't care.

48
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,958
[SHURA yells]

49
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,041
[SHURA yelling]

00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:39,125
[grunting]

00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,541
[SHURA screams]

[groans]

59
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,083
[YOMI]
You're not blind, Shura.

60
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,625
And you're a smart kid.

61
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,875
You can see how this will
turn out for you, can't you?

62
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,541
You should accept your defeat.

63
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,791
[SHURA gasps]

64
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,791
Accept it!

65
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,666
[gasps]

66
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay...

67
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,375
[KOTO]
It looks like this is the end

68
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,500
of the final battle of
the preliminary round,

69
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,708
as Yomi shows he's a master at
balancing power with patience.

70
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
What a victory!

71
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,833
Just the kind you'd expect from
the former king of Gandara.

72
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,875
[YOMI]
Defeat doesn't come easily.

73
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,208
But one can always...
go with grace.

74
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,166
[growls]

75
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,750
[SHURA yells]

76
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,958
Heh, now that's more like it.

77
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,375
[KOTO]
Wow!

78
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,083
One surprising move from
the seemingly defeated Shura,

79
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,000
and this battleground
washes over in a

80
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,291
devastating sea of flames.

81
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,125
That kid is a monster.

82
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,166
Yeah, tricking your own
father is pretty dirty.

83
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,000
In the ring, Yomi and Shura
each would be a toughie.

84
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,375
There's no doubtin' about that.

85
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,750
That should settle that.

86
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,458
[gasps]

87
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,083
Wait...

88
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,375
What is that?

89
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,250
No!

90
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,541
[SHURA groaning]

91
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,958
I... can't see... anything.

92
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,500
That was my best attack...

93
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,875
How can he even be
walking right now?

94
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,625
[YOMI] Shura, my son,
your ego carries you too high.

95
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,583
Even my patience with you
is beginning to wear thin.

96
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,875
Heh, that's what
I was looking for...

97
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,333
You promised me that you
wouldn't hold anything back

98
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,958
when we faced each other.

99
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,000
[chuckles]

100
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,875
[KOTO]
Amazing!

101
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,583
I've never seen someone get
hit with a blast like that,

102
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,208
and walk away with
their clothing intact,

103
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,708
much less the rest of them!

104
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,250
Like father, like son!

105
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,708
And if you're like me, nothing
is gonna pull your eyes away

106
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,958
from whatever happens
next down there!

107
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,541
[chuckles]

108
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,000
What's so funny?

109
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,250
I was musing over the
surprising aspects of

110
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,541
your fight with Raizen as I
watched the match below.

111
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,708
This is more evenly
matched, I think.

112
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,250
Yeah, well, fighters fight while

113
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,416
the jealous stand
by and criticize.

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,666
[KOENMA]
All right, pally, come with me.

115
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,833
[KOENMA]
Well?

116
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,166
[YUSUKE] What sideshow
act let you three out?

117
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,875
Come on, Yusuke! You can't
see through a simple disguise?

118
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,250
Koenma?!

119
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
It's been a long time...

120
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,000
...no see!

121
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,791
But why are you three here?!

122
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,458
We are as curious as anyone

123
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,833
about who's going to be the
one to unify Demon World.

124
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,500
Don't include us in your lie.

125
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,000
If I remember correctly,
you were looking for any

126
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,375
possible excuse to wear your new
costume, weren't you, Koenma?

127
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,875
Would you two be quiet?!
I've had just about enough!

128
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,416
It's doesn't matter
why you came,

129
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,333
just keep yours costumes on
or the Mazoku might discover

130
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,708
what you are and decide
to take an early lunch.

131
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,041
[BOTAN screams] Oh, please,
I don't wanna be lunch!

132
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,125
[crying] Mazoku scares Jorge!

133
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,708
Fear not, you two, just stick by
my side, and all will be fine.

134
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,583
--That's my prince! [laughs]
--You're my hero!

135
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,291
And we will all
stick close to Yusuke.

136
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,750
Something's happening.

137
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,208
It's about time.

138
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:06,791
[growls]

139
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,125
[YOMI] He's concentrating the
energy evenly into both hands.

140
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,166
This attack is familiar.

141
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,083
[yells] Demon Spiral!

142
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,958
[YOMI] Point zero four
seconds until impact.

143
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,958
[gasps]

144
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,333
For your education, my son,
the Demonic Absorption Wall!

145
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,375
[gasps]

146
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,875
That's it...?

147
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,916
[gasps]

148
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,791
[SHURA]
I can't believe it.

149
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,833
He absorbed my entire attack.

150
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,541
Although Shura's been dishing
out most of the attacks here,

151
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,208
to this announcer's eyes,
it looks like the upper hand

152
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,083
in this round still
belongs to Yomi.

153
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,666
It's not looking like

154
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,291
it's going to be an upset for
Shura this evening, after all.

155
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,916
[KURAMA]
I see now.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,875
Shura is today what
Yomi was in his youth.

157
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,000
But Yomi isn't so
much fighting to win,

158
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,833
as he is focused on
teaching his son

159
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,208
not to make the same
mistakes he made.

160
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,458
It can only get more
interesting from here.

161
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,166
[YOMI] Shura, it's time
to concede this fight.

162
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,875
[YOMI]
I am proud of you, son.

163
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,666
You fought like a true warrior.

164
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,583
[YOMI]
But you can never know victory,

165
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,125
until you understand
the nature of defeat.

I won't stop...

178
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,083
Not for you or anyone.

179
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,333
My father will never defeat me!

180
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,916
Then fight!

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,875
[SHURA]
Unguarded points...

183
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,375
I have to find out
where he's vulnerable.

184
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,416
[gasps] That's... not fair...

185
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,791
[SHURA]
Every point...

186
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,833
Every point my father
has is... guarded.

187
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,500
[groans]

188
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,666
How am I supposed
to fight you when

189
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,708
you don't have any weak spots?

190
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,708
[laughs] You should learn that

191
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,541
when fighting a warrior of
greater power than yourself,

192
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,750
nothing will ever seem fair.

193
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,458
Then... how am I
supposed to fight?!

194
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,916
If your opponent has
no unguarded points,

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,291
then you should make one.

196
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,583
[SHURA] Hmph! If my opponent
has no unguarded points,

197
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,916
then I should make one.
This one is for you, father.

[grunts]

201
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,750
[YOMI]
He's trying to confuse me

202
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,500
by covering up his movements
with this explosion.

203
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,916
There you are!

204
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,583
[YOMI]
Hm. That was sly.

205

[SHURA grunts]

210
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,916
[SHURA]
He's absorbed all of my energy

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,291
from all of my biggest attacks.

212
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,666
It's like he knew every attack
I was making before I did.

213
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,791
I can't do anything
without him knowing.

214
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,541
What's wrong?

215
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,833
Have you decided to cease
your attacks, Shura?

216
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,166
If so, I'll bring
the battle to you.

217
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,333

[KOTO] I hope everyone
is watching closely

225
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,708
because what was
once an even match

226
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,416
has quickly turned into
a one-sided beating!

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,916
Yomi is teaching his kid
one tough lesson.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,291
And it doesn't look like Yomi's
backing off any time soon.

229
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,833
If you ask me, it looks like
he's trying to kill his own son.

230
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,000
More than half done,
the job is, I'd be sayin'.

[SHURA groaning]

[YOMI]
Shura...

233
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,458
Are you ready to
accept your defeat?

234
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,208
What?!

235
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,750
No way!

236
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,666
You can kill me if you have to,

237
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,291
but at least keep
your word to me,

238
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,291
and fight this
battle to the end.

239
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,333
[growls]

240
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,708
You have to know
when you're beaten!

241
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,250
Only the weakest
fighters move blindly on,

242
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,375
believing that the
greater the blood shed,

243
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,041
the fiercer the fight.

244
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:56,041
Do you have any idea how little
of my power I used to fight you?

245
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,708
How obvious your
attacks are in battle?

246
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,916
So, if you choose an
easy death, then welcome...

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,875
This is exactly
how far it got you.

[SHURA whimpers]

249
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,791
[YOMI]
I will ask you one final time.

250
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,208
Will you accept your defeat?

251
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,000
[sobs]

252
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,916
[SHURA]
I surrender to you, F-Father.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,041
[KOTO]
And Shura concedes the fight!

254
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,083
This concludes the final bout
of the preliminary rounds,

255
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,125
moving Yomi a step
higher up the ladder,

256
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,916
and into the main tournament.

have moved forward today!

Now, if I could get
everyone's attention, please!

261
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,208
Before we proceed,

262
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,416
I promised that I'd hand over
the mic to Mr. Yusuke Urameshi,

263
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,375
so that he can say a few things
to get tonight started right.

[YUSUKE]
Hey...

266
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,416
Ready for a fight,
he is, but not for this?

267
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,166
That's not very Yusuke of him.

268
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,333
[ALL laugh]

269
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,916
Ahem! First, congratulations to

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,166
those who made it to
the main tournament.

271
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,625
Now, I know all of you think
that you're pretty bad Demons,

272
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,500
but I want you to
consider one thing.

273
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,333
You don't have to fight
to the death here.

274
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,916
To be honest, I'd rather
no one die in battle at all.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,750
If for no other reason
than I get the feeling

276
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,625
all of you would like
to fight more than once,

277
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,291
and I feel the exact same way.

278
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,208
And if you're dead,
you can't fight.

279
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,750
I'd hate for this
to be the one day

280
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,166
I see some of you in the ring.

281
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,791
I'd rather you all return
to fight another day...

282
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,000
Because, to be honest, I don't
have the greatest confidence

283
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,208
that I'll walk away
the winner here.

284
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,583
[laughs]

285
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,625
Only losers make excuses
before the fighting starts.

286
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,750
I think, in a couple of years,
I'll be a better fighter,

287
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,625
and better suited
for this tournament.

288
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,791
Of course, that's hoping
whoever wins here today

289
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,708
doesn't call this
the final tournament.

290
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,833
The point of all of this
is my proposition that

291
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,083
we all meet here once
every three or four years

292
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,458
to battle it out again,

293
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,750
and decide who
replaces the old ruler.

294
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,041
Like a presidential
election... with fists.

295
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,458
[SHURA]
Will I fight?

296
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,500
[YOMI]
Yes...

297
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,125
By then, my son, your skills

298
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,333
will be honed to a
vicious precision.

299
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,541
[YUSUKE] I'm not predicting
the future or anything,

300
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,208
but I think that
whoever wins here today

301
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,416
can find this agreement
to be a fair one.

302
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,416
And with that little
bit being said...

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,416
[KOTO] Well, at last now,
we can begin this tournament.

306
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,625
We have divided the 128 winners
of the preliminary matches

307
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,791
into eight groups.
Each group holds battles

308
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,458
according to the
tournament rules

309
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,375
until the elimination
leaves only two fighters.

310
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,208
Victory is decided in the
same fashion as earlier.

311
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,625
The battle is over when
one opponent surrenders,

312
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,916
or is no longer capable of
fighting.

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,666
And the first match
of the first group is

314
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,833
Yusuke Urameshi versus Nekotama!

there are Demons here today

that are virtually unknown.

00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,125
rely on any of your old tricks.

322
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,791
[NEKOTAMA growls]

323
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,875
Yusuke better put a
spring in his step!

324
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,708
He's got a super-sized Nekotama
barreling right at him!

325
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,250
Why isn't he getting
out of the way?

326
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,666
Is he already that
frozen with fear?

327
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,541
[NEKOTAMA growls]

328
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:06,916
[NEKOTAMA roars]

329
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,750
[NEKOTAMA laughs]

330
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,625
An interesting
attack by Nekotama!

331
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,375
One wrong move, and Yusuke'll
find himself shish-kebabed.

332
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,583
Move, now!

333
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,833
[BOTAN, KOENMA]
What are you doing?!

334
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,500
[NEKOTAMA growls]

335
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,416
[NEKOTAMA roars]

336
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,583
[YUSUKE yells]

337
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,166
[NEKOTAMA groans]

338
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,125
That's right!

339
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:49,500
[CROWD chattering, cheering]

340
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,333
He did it! [laughs]

341
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,291
Heh, I can't believe it.

342
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,000
He actually put in
a few good moves.

343
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,916
If he can come through like
that, then you can, too.

344
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
So why don't you blow through
those other fighters quickly,

345
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,625
so you and I can get to fight?

346
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,458
I like your plan.

347
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,666
That guy doesn't
have any cheap moves,

348
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,666
or any real form to
his fighting at all.

349
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,000
This is true...

350
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,791
He fights simply to enjoy
the pure nature of it.

351
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,958
[YOMI] And one day, you will
face him down, Shura.

352
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,375
This is the way it will be.

353
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,166
You guys ready, then?

354
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
[NARRATOR]
Here begins the main tournament

355
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,583
to decide the king
of Demon World.

356
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:42,791
When the smoke clears,
on whom will victory shine?

357
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,666
Find out next time,
as the heads begin to roll.

358
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,791
[BOTAN] I came along with
Koenma to this nasty place

359
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,500
because I thought
it would be fun.

360
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,041
Was I ever wrong!

361
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,291
Every time I turn around,

362
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,583
there's another
horrible face to look at.

363
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,833
And I think that most of
them came all the way here

364
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,166
just to get a crack
at fighting Yusuke!

365
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,916
I wouldn't want to be him.

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,958
But, against my gut instinct,
and to support my friend,

367
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,416
I'll stick close to Koenma,

368
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,958
and watch this
tournament thingy unfold.

369
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:20,000
Why don't you join me, on the
next episode of Yu Yu Hakusho!
