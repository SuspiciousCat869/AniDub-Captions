00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,208
[NARRATOR] The tunnel to
Demon World is moments

2
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,000
from completion, and Sensui
has isolated Yusuke

3
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,791
from his friends so they
can fight one-on-one.

4
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,250
Or so it seemed, until Sensui
revealed he is actually seven

5
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,958
unique personalities.

6
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,833
The cruelest, Kazuya,
nearly destroyed Yusuke

7
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,833
until Koenma appeared,
ready to use the power stored

8
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,166
in his pacifier to stop
Sensui once and for all.

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,375
But Yusuke shoved
Koenma out of the way,

10
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,000
wanting to finish
what he started,

11
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,083
Spirit Detective to
former Spirit Detective.

12
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,083
Just as Yusuke was
getting his second wind,

13
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,875
and knocking it
out of his nemesis,

14
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,791
Sensui revealed
his truest persona.

15
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,791
My name is Shinobu...

16
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,125
It's an honor to meet you.

17
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,708
[YUSUKE panting]

18
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,125
[YUSUKE]
This is gonna be fun.

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,291
[laughs]

20
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,875
[gasps]

21
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:47,916
[laughing continues]

22
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,416
It's so weird.

23
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,375
I've never seen
Mr. Sensui like this.

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,708
Yes, his countenance
has changed from before.

25
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,500
I dare say he sounds innocent.

26
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,875
He is.

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,666
In his reality, Shinobu has
never committed a crime.

28
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,416
He knows his other sides
have done wrong...

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,625
But he's separated from it,
able to blame them

30
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,208
and grieve for what
they've done while

31
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,583
realizing it's necessary.

32
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,750
Such complexity... That's why
I like him the most.

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,958
[growls]

34
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,708
What? That doesn't make sense.

35
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,916
If this side's so darn pure,
how did he get away

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,458
with hurtin' Urameshi?

37
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,708
Not that it matters.
Just goin' by this new name

38
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,250
can't make him any
stronger, right?

39
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,541
Don't sweat it, Urameshi...!

40
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,041
Whatever he is, he's all
part of the same Sensui!

41
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,000
You can take him!

42
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,916
[SENSUI laughing]

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,833
You sure have the
crazy laugh down.

44
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:53,583
[laughing]

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,291
Spirit Energy that
makes my head hurt?

46
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,416
That's new.

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
[gasping]

48
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,416
That's not...
Spirit Energy at all.

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,375
It's not Demon Energy either.

50
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,791
Wait a second, if it's
not Spirit or Demon...

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,958
What the heck kinda
energy is it--solar?

52
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,291
[gasping]

53
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,916
[grunts]

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,416
I bit my tongue!

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,833
[gasps]

56
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,000
No! It isn't possible!

57
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,500
He's mastered...

58
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,625
...The Sacred Energy.

59
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,166
Sacred Energy?

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,875
What the heck is that?

61
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,500
He can't!

62
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,541
Hm.

63
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
Sacred Energy is
the highest echelon

64
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,958
of power that any
being can harness...

65
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,125
But how could you?

66
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,541
It takes 40 years of
discipline at least!

67
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,041
[SENSUI] Forty years shared by
seven personalities is only six.

68
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,166
Of course, even the
training's no guarantee...

69
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,750
You need to be receptive to it,

70
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,291
having the inherent desire to
correct the world around you.

71
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,500
Something Genkai discovered
she did not possess.

72
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,916
What?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,916
Even your teacher
has her limits.

74
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,583
[grunts]

75
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,041
Sacred Energy's about
operating on a higher plane,

76
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,583
transcending the physical realm.

You're tired. You should
take a break now.

You're gettin sloppy, Sensui.

91
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,208
So I'll need a cast.
You'll need a nose job.

92
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,583
Eww! I have to put that
back in my mouth!

93
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:16,541
I know... what you
are planning to do.

Well, it sure beats giving up.

You don't have a clue
what I have to do!

[KOENMA gasps]

103
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,166
I know... we'll win.

104
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,375
We're going to
beat him, in the end.

105
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:48,125
Yusuke? What on earth
are you thinking?

106
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,458
[YUSUKE]
I'm thinking I see now.

107
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,583
I'm thinking...

108
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,833
No, I know I'm close

109
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,000
to the world's best
strategy for kicking ass.

110
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,625
You're close?

111
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,916
[YUSUKE] And I'm thinking
that Sensui's thinking

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,291
he knows what I'm thinking,
because he usually does.

113
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,375
But there's just one
thing I don't know.

114
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,500
Do you have the
stones to pull off

115
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,125
what it is you're thinking
you'd like to do to me?

116
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,458
Or are you scared...

117
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,875
...that your little destiny
is nothin' but crap?

118
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,833
Yeah, Sensui...

119
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,125
Destiny-breaking's
our specialty!

120
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,958
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

121
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,416
Why not?

122
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,166
Yusuke doesn't have a plan.
There's no way he can win.

123
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,541
Hey! Whose side are you on?

124
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,791
[KUWABARA] Hiei's a wreck.
What's he know that I don't?

125
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,875
Your senses probably aren't
sophisticated enough

126
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,250
to know this...
But Sensui's energy...

127
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,000
...is currently that of
an S-Class apparition.

128
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,083
[KUWABARA]
That's a lot, right?

129
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,541
That's as strong as they get...

130
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,416
And I think Sensui's
been restraining himself

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,000
as much as he possibly can.

132
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,416
He broke Yusuke's arm
with limited power...

133
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,541
Delicately, as if
snapping a twig.

134
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,833
Shame on you!
I still have faith.

135
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,541
Well, that makes sense.

136
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,833
Faith's for the fools.

137
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,625
But we've all been
made fools here.

138
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,125
We assumed we'd triumph--

139
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,041
That... we'd be able to kill
another arrogant enemy.

140
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,625
We were arrogant this time.
Sensui will kill us all.

141
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,333
I hate being underestimated,
but underestimating is worse.

142
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,041
His power's rare
even in Demon World.

143
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,166
I never thought I'd
see it like this...

144
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,916
and to see it
manifested in the hands

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,625
of a crude human being no less!

146
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,708
I get it. He's strong.

147
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,291
[gasps]

148
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,708
Not again.

149
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,000
[gasps]

150
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,041
Was that me...?

151
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,166
I've checked my power

152
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,250
for so long now that
I sometimes don't

153
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,541
know my own strength and just
lose all control over it.

154
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,458
[SENSUI]
That's my only setback, really.

155
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,333
I'm too strong for
the Human World.

156
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,708
Its physics can't hold me.

157
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,000
Literally, my strength
is my weakness.

158
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,916
Isn't that ironic?

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,125
Really.

160
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,041
You don't make any sense.
You wanna destroy this world.

161
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,500
Or so you say...

162
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,625
But you also say that
doing this kinda damage

163
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,333
to the world is your

00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,791
It's my mess to
answer for, not yours.

325
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,875
Oh, right. I'm killing you.

326
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,916
Forgive me, I got distracted.

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,708
[YUSUKE]
You'll walk into my plan.

328
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,208
I knew Urameshi had
some approach all along!

329
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,958
I'm big enough to admit
when everyone else is wrong.

330
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,291
Just try and contradict me now.

331
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,583
You're wrong, Kuwabara.

332
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,166
Didn't you just
hear what he said?

333
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,500
I heard amply.

334
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,833
Remember what you did
in the fight with Toguro?

335
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,500
Yusuke now intends
to do the same.

336
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,583
He's using...
The Spirit Flyswatter?

337
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
Wrong, Toguro...

338
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,958
What you did when Yusuke
fought the younger one.

339
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,041
[KUWABARA] Oh yeah, that.
How could I forget?

340
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,916
Okay, Urameshi...

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,583
It's all you...
I did what I could...

342
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,083
Now beat him for... all of us.

343
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,333
Make my death count, okay?

344
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,666
I see now.

345
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,208
What you did for him,

346
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,958
Yusuke is going to do for all
of us, except that Sensui...

347
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,625
...won't be faking.

348
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,541
No...! He can't do that!

349
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,083
Urameshi, come on!

350
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,625
[NARRATOR] The most awesome
resources Spirit World

351
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,541
has at its defense are
unable to penetrate

352
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,791
Sensui's Sacred Energy.

353
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,000
Will Yusuke Urameshi
have to sacrifice

354
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,583
his own life to end his rival's?

355
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,916
Can he accomplish in death
what he could not in life?

356
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
[KUWABARA]
Urameshi, you jerk!

357
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,333
When are you gonna
get your own moves

358
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,625
instead of rippin' off mine?

359
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm the man with the code.

360
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,375
I'm supposed to be the
one to take the fall.

361
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,208
Oh, This is so
like you, though--

362
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,416
You hate givin' anyone
else the credit.

363
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,833
But you can't go.

364
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,333
I don't know what we'd do
without you-- what I'd do.

365
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,583
I mean, every hero
needs a sidekick.

366
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,333
And you're mine!

367
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,333
Now no teasing if
things get emotional.

368
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,250
We all went through this
once before, a long time ago.

369
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,708
Don't make us do this again.
