in the House of
Four Dimensions.

Hiei scoffed at the human

but soon learned
the bizarre truth.

They have entered a world of

where violence is not allowed,

whenever I please!

158
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,083
Then let me
determine the rules

159
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,000
of the word game
and I assure you,

160
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,833
I will force you to speak the
taboo within forty-five minutes

161
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,791
and thereby free
my friend's souls.

162
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,958
Oh? You're that confident
you can outwit me?

163
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,375
All right, and what
if you cannot get me

164
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,375
to break the rules in
forty-five minutes?

165
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,541
Then you may have
my soul as well.

166
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,083
Oh my...

167
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,208
So, you in?

168
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,708
Or will you cower from a game

169
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,791
in which you clearly
have the advantage?

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,958
[KAITOU THINKS] Brilliant,
arrogant Suichi,

171
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,250
I have more advantage
than you think.

172
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,208
Since I found my power,

173
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,625
I've obsessed over every
word puzzle in print.

174
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,166
You can't beat me.

175
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,583
Yet here you are,

176
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,708
strolling into my trap
like it's your idea.

177
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,625
[KAITOU]
I accept your challenge.

178
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:39,125
So, let's hear the taboo
that ended Suichi's life.

179
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,125
It starts as one letter.

180
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,166
But as time moves forward,
we eliminate more.

181
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,791
There are twenty-six
letters in the alphabet

182
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,708
and forty-five minutes to play.

183
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,083
Thus, every one hundred
and four seconds,

184
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,750
we will lose another
letter we can say,

185
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,750
starting from the end,
at Z, and moving backwards.

186
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,875
[KAITOU] Yes, and
at the end of the game,

187
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,583
every letter will be taboo!

188
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,291
[Kaitou chuckles]

189
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:06,125
Fascinating imagination,
this game will be fun.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,958
Let's see...

191
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,875
It's fifty minutes
after midnight.

192
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,625
Why don't we start
it neatly at one.

193
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,250
Sounds perfect.

194
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,333
[KAITOU] Follow the rule,
both host and guest.

195
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,125
Don't utter a letter
crossed off from the list.

196
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,166
Each hundred and four
seconds, note too...

197
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,000
Another letter becomes taboo.

198
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,708
We begin.

199
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,583
Better get any z words out
of you before they're taboo.

200
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,916
Zealous zebras, and
crazy zinc Zippers.

201
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,333
The next will be
more a challenge.

202
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,666
We'll forfeit the letter y...

203
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,416
Why, oh why, do we
lose the letter y?

204
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,250
What if we need to cry?

205
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,250
I find this game very
enjoyable, don't you?

206
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,250
Be careful, Kaito. You'll tire
yourself and make a mistake.

207
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,708
At last a challenge.

208
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,250
It's rather remarkable...

209
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,083
So much I use
those last letters.

210
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,833
Losing s t and u should
be a greater obstacle.

211
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,083
When people say I
can't do something,

212
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,041
it makes me want to do it
even more... It's like walking

213
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,875
by a fire alarm and
not being able to pull it!

214
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,291
Sir, calm down...

215
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,750

Is this one of your
baby talk days, sir?

219
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,041
A challenging mindgame,
Minamono.

220
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,791
Ready for conceding?

221
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,458
[KURAMA]
No.

Running clock...

225
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,166
Forbidding more of freedom.

226
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,041
Going off?

No lip...
I'll be back.

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,958
[YANAGISAWA THINKS] Right.
I'm in his Territory, too.

230
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,625
I shouldn't even risk a laugh.

[KAITOU THINKS] What is
that genius brain up to?

233
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,125
He knows I won't slip on my own.

234
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,458
But he sits,
letting the clock run,

235
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,416
knowing if neither
us speaks, he'll lose!

236
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,125
He must be
waiting for the end,

237
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,625
when no one can speak,
to commit some heinous trick.

238
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll watch him carefully.

[body hitting floor]

240
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,875
[KAITOU THINKS] But, no

him gently to the ceiling,

242
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,333
then gently let go.

00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,500
Has he moved
on alone?

244
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,291
No, he couldn't have.

245
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,500
The layout of the house
wouldn't have allowed it.

246
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,625
There are three doors
between here and the next room.

247
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,625
I have the second key,
and we hid the third.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,875
Besides, Suichi told
me how protective

249
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,875
he was of his friend's souls.

250
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,833
He wouldn't have
left them behind.

Unless, unless
he found a way

this so quickly?

[KAITOU THINKS] What?
Everything's still here.

00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,708
He wouldn't have abandoned them.

257
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,333
Which means he's still
somewhere in the room.

finish the game.

should be, adversary.

It's one thirty.

Two thirds of the letters
are restricted now.

265

That doesn't leave
many combinations.

266
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,083
The vast majority of words or
sounds will break the rules.

I just have to
keep from speaking.

here and not say a word.

I know that's your
plan, Suichi.

into screaming a taboo.

unravel him was a laugh.

You invited three jerks

they'd obey you politely?

They're coming up here,
and they're gonna bust me out.

And then I'm gonna
kick your ass.

[NARRATOR] The kidnappers have
suffered a serious blow,

306
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,375
as Kurama's wit has
disembodied Kaitou's soul,

00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,875
I'll finally get free
of Kido's hold on me,

315
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,041
but there's another challenge.

316
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,208
One of my teammates
is an imposter,

317
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,875
and I've got one killer
punch to figure it out.

318
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,375
But that's not all.

319
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,291
Want to know who the evil
mastermind is behind all this?

320
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,208
The truth will make you sick...

321
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,500
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho.
