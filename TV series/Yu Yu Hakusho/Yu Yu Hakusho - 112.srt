True. Our victories were
not of the winning kind.

Wow, so even Urameshi
ate some dirt?

Yeah. Well, when
I was a freshman,

I used my awareness to
predict an earthquake.

Since your school's partnered

with the university here,
you should be a shoe-in.

Yeah, people always think that,
but we still have to pass

That's one thing I've learned,

Time does fly by.

But I do miss the guy.

Well he hasn't changed
one bit, if that helps.

47
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,833
Does he ever say anything
about coming back?

Every time I see him,

he says he has something
different to take care of.

50
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,583
Of course I heard of
his promise to Kayko,

and his maybe-true proposal.

Sometimes I think
he has cold feet.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,291
So he won't come back
for a whole nother year,

all? Guy's repressed.

choice not about fighting.

let loose the strongest demons.

and the barrier net.

[DEMON A] Nothing about that
tournament made sense.

157
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,708
Enki is strong, no doubt,

158
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,333
but if Lord Mukuro had
fought with all her energy,

159
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,583
she could have beaten him.
Cut him wide open.

160
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,708
[KIRIN] No. Lord Mukuro
didn't hold back.

161
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,750
She fought with all
she had at the time.

162
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,083
[DEMON A]
I don't believe it.

163
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,166
[KIRIN] Lord Mukuro's
strength is tied directly

164
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,625
to her state of mind.

165
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,291
When filled with hatred,
her powers are unmatchable.

166
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,875
But in that tournament,
for some reason,

167
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,083
she only had half her
strength, at most.

168
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,625
And I don't think
we'll see her full power

169
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,791
anytime in the
near future, either.

170
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,375
[DEMON A]
Why not?

171
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,291
[KIRIN] I've seen her.
Something's changed.

172
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,791
Her eyes have become
unbelievably calm.

173
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,000
[DEMON B]
Well, what's happened to her?

174
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,083
[KIRIN]
Damned if I know.

175
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,166
[MUKURO]
How's the patrol?

176
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,958
[HIEI]
Nonsense.

177
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,291
[MUKURO] You could go
back to Living World.

178
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,541
I'd make certain no one
came looking for you.

179
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,125
Hmph. That's not why I stay.

180
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,458
Uh... He's on patrol...

181
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,750
Sounds bad, but trust me,
he's doing quite well.

182
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,416
So, did Genkai tell you the
reason for this whole meeting?

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,458
No, she just said she
wanted all of us

184
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,625
to visit her together.
I have no idea what it's about.

185
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,458
She wanna show us her new
set of dentures or somethin'?

186
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,875
We'll know soon.

187
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,291
Not a bad place she's got here.

188
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,208
Yeah, coming here
always calms me down.

189
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
Hey, guys!

190
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,125
Ah! Yukina!

191
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,208
[KUWABARA laughing]

192
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,875
[YUKINA]
Hello, Kazuma. Hello everyone.

193
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,125
How have you all been?

194
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,041
[KUWABARA]
Well, I've been just great!

195
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,208
[YUKINA]
Good. And everyone else?

196
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,458
Still alive.

197
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,791
And what about you?
I figured you'd be bored

198
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,583
out of your mind living
here with just Genkai.

199
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,125
Oh... We get by.

200
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,916
Besides, Kazu's come up
pretty frequently to visit.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,416
Oh?

202
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,083
Still trying to work that famous

203
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,458
Kuwabara-family magic,
are you bro?

204
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,625
[laughs] Workin' magic.

205
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

206
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,708
I've been tryin' to
relay Kurama's news.

207
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,458
Oh, and that's not cologne you
smell, it's my natural scent!

208
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,125
[KURAMA]
Yukina, is Master Genkai here?

209
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,666
Of course. Here she is.

210
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,083
You're late.

211
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:28,458
[GENKAI] I see. So Yusuke
still hasn't come back?

212
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,541
What the hell is he working on?

213
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,166
No one is really
sure, specifically.

214
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,125
Oh, come on, we know
what he's doing.

215
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,375
He's picking fights.

216
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,500
It's not like he cares
about anything else now.

217
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,291
[SHIZURU clears throat]

218
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,333
[KUWABARA]
Uh?!

219
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,500
[KAYKO] You don't have
to protect me, guys.

220
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm just glad to see Genkai.
Let's focus on that.

221
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,666
Yeah, me too.

222
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,958
It's a relief to see
you're still well.

223
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm happy every day
you're alive!

224
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,083
[GENKAI] Hm. Well that's
a peachy spot I'm in.

225
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,458
Sticking around just so
you don't have bad day.

226
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,458
[KURAMA, SHIZURU, KAYKO laugh]

227
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,708
[KUWABARA]
That's not what I meant!

228
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,375
Well! I didn't know all
of you would be here!

229
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,708
[KAYKO]
Hey, Botan!

230
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,625
Hello, Kayko. Love the hair!

231
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,041
That's convenient.

232
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,333
I guess Genkai called you
the same time she did us.

233
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,500
--[KOENMA] Me, too.
--[KUWABARA] Huh?!

234
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,333
[KUWABARA]
Koenma? Where did you come from?

235
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
[KOENMA]
Well, that's a lengthy story,

236
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,916
you'll just have to ask my dad.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,250
You cheese-ball.

238
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,666
[GENKAI] Good. You're
all here. Now sit down.

239
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,875
[GENKAI] There's only one
reason I asked you all to come.

240
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,875
These recent years have caused
me to think about my legacy,

241
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,083
and so I want to tell you
what to do after I die.

242
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,958
Ah. Genkai,
you shouldn't talk like that.

243
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,583
It brings bad luck.

244
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,041
You won't die soon.

245
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,416
You look good.

246
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,208
You look better than
I do on some days.

247
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,458
Ah. Just shut up and
let me get this done.

248
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,250
Once you've given me
a teary-eyed funeral,

249
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,791
I'll be leaving this
whole estate to your group.

250
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,541
[ALL gasp]

251
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,791
[GENKAI] That includes this
temple and all surrounding land.

252
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,000
A shore on one side and
a stone wall on the other

253
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,708
will tell you where it ends.
Leave nature as it is.

254
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,291
It takes several hours by car
to reach the closest town.

255
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,875
Not a convenient place
for humans to live,

256
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,000
but perfect for apparitions.

257
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,750
The Kekkai Barrier is down,
but it will take a long time

258
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,541
for humans and demons
to live in peace.

259
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,250
I spent my life trying to
understand a demon and failed.

260
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,458
Make this a safehouse, to bridge
the gap as I never could.

261
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,625
[KURAMA]
Amazing.

262
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,583
All of this land, far as
we can see, belongs to her.

263
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,791
[KUWABARA] Yeah, definitely
something we won't be

264
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,291
chopping down. We'll do
a lota good stuff here.

265
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,833
We have time. We could
go down to the shore.

266
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,625
Yeah! Let's go!

267
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,333
You game, Yukina?
It's guaranteed fun!

268
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,666
Sure.

269
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,958
[BOTAN] It's weird hearing
Genkai talk about death.

270
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,458
As healthy as she lives,
she could outlast us all.

271
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,375
[SHIZURU]
Makes me want to quit smoking.

272
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,625
[BOTAN, KAYKO, SHIZURU laugh]

273
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,916
[KURAMA]
Something wrong, Kuwabara?

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,916
I met Genkai for the first
time ever after going up

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,875
these stairs. And I ended
up fighting against Rando.

276
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,458
Though I didn't
know it at the time,

277
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,208
it was the first case Urameshi
and I worked on together.

278
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,041
After that it was Maze Castle.

279
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,375
I met you, and called Hiei
a runt-boy for the first time.

280
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,541
And then Tarukane,
and my pinky string,

281
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,666
and meeting the love of my life.

282
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,000
And then it was the whole
Dark Tournament with Toguro,

283
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,541
and then Sensui, and now this.

284
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,875
This treaty sounds great,
but it means that's all over.

285
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,208
We gotta move on. It's just...
It's just hard to believe.

286
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,708
[KURAMA]
True.

287
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:21,000
But when we need to, as you
just have, we can remember.

288
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,166
[KUWABARA]
Yeah.

289
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,458
[BOTAN]
Hey!

290
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,333
Enough flirting, boys!

291
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,083
Hey, if you want,
the four of us

292
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,916
can just go to the beach alone.

293
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,458
[KUWABARA]
No, no! I'm coming!

294
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,000
Uh, Yukina, you didn't by chance
pack a bathing suit, did ya?

295
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,291
[BOTAN, KAYKO laugh]

296
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,166
[SHIZURU]
You're so pathetic.

297
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,791
[KOENMA]
They're a good group of kids.

298
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,958
Yeah.

299
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,291
Oh, my. Perfect ending
for a perfect day.

300
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,166
A sunset by the ocean.
It's the most romantic

301
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,333
thing I've ever seen.

302
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,833
Most romantic, huh?

303
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,041
This is gonna be my hour!

304
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,125
Wanna get your feet wet, Yukina?

305
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,166
Yeah.

306
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,208
[KAYKO, YUKINA laugh]

307
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,416
Best take advantage
while the sun's up!

308
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,541
I will! I'm gonna
find me a starfish!

00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,333
[YUKINA]
Uh!

310
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,083
It feels like ice!

311
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,416
[YUKINA] You think I'll
ever be with my brother?

312
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,666
[KAYKO] I think you will,
when he's ready. Now have fun.

313
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,125
That's the one bad
thing about sunsets.

314
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,166
They make you think too much.

315
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,208
Let's come back soon,
in the day.

316
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,291
Sure.

317

[KUWABARA]
Yukina! Ha, ha.

318
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,208
I caught the world's
biggest starfish!

319
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,833
I sensed it under a rock!

320
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,250
And I found shells
to make a necklace!

321
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, cool! Wait for me!

Yusuke...

323
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,125
This is the end!

324
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,208
[KAYKO] I'm tired of
waiting for you, Yusuke!

325
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:34,041
Half my life I've waited
for you to come around!

326
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,000
Even when you were here
you weren't really!

327
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,083
You weren't here for me!
Go on fighting!

328
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,000
But it's time I get what I want!

329
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,666
I could cry.

330
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,500
[YUSUKE] I don't want
you to wait, either.

One of us has gotten more
athletic since I've been gone.

Bingo.

Oh, you're gonna pay
for that one, Kayko!

342
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,541
You stole that
lip-time from me!

[KAYKO]
Come get me, tough guy.

346
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,625
Now you know I could dump
this whole ocean on you

347
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,708
if I wanted.

What's wrong, Mister Mazaku?

355
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,708
I thought you were goin' to
Demon World to become the king!

356
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:51,000
I will someday, but then who's
gonna be here to kick your ass?

357
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,416
Well if you're goin' back, I
better give you the beatdown now

358
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,416
I was always too nice to give!
