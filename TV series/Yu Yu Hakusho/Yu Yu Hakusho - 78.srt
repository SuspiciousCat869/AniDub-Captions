let's see how you play
kick ball with this!

159
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,625
[SENSUI] Lucky for
me I have a spare.

160
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,125
[KUWABARA] Hey you
yellow-bellied bully!

161
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,791
Are you just gonna kick
a man while he's down?

162
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,958
Why not fight me,
the warrior of love,

163
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,791
defender of the defenseless?!

164
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,500
He'll kill you!

165
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,125
For I am Kazuma Kuwabara!

166
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,250
And now prepare to
feel my shiny new sword!

167
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,041
[SENSUI THINKS] At last,
the moment of truth

168
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,166
I've been waiting for.

169
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,750
We'll see if he
really is the one.

170
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,791
Wait a sec.

171
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,333
This is just my plain old,
everyday Spirit Sword.

172
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,708
[KUWABARA] Man, what happened
to the new souped-up one

173
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,375
I used against Sea Man?

174
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,208
Darn, woulda
been cool.

175
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,375
[SENSUI THINKS] That blade could
barely slice through butter,

176
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,708
let alone dimensions.

177
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,083
He must need
stimulus to power up.

178
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,041
Here goes!

179
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,416
That isn't
very wise!

181

182
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,083
[KURAMA THINKS] He may be
able to elude direct attacks,

183
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,875
but my Rose
Whip can hit

184
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
several points of
contact at once.

185
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,625
That's not normal.

186
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,875
Must be a movie stunt!

187
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,583
So...

188
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,458
Dare you risk that erratic
weapon amongst civilians?

189
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,833
[KURAMA THINKS]
Merciless coward.

190
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,916
No wonder he moved the
fight to the center of town.

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,041
[Sensui chuckles]

192
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,500
[SENSUI] I'm hurt, Kurama.

193
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,000
Isn't my death
worth a few lives,

194
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,041
they'll be dead soon enough.

195
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,958
[SENSUI THINKS]
Ah, Sniper... perfect timing.

196
00:16:59,041 --> 00:16:59,791
[SENSUI]
Farewell!

197
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,250
After him!

198
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,750
You can't do that with these
innocents standing around.

199
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,750
Fine, not that I
ever miss my target,

200
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,041
but if it's a change of
venue you want, I'm game.

201
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,750
With all these gawkers waiting
for blood I can't see a thing!

202
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,750
[KURAMA THINKS] Obviously
they're trying to split us up.

203
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,250
But why? To isolate Yusuke?

204
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,458
We should stay together,
yet they leave me no choice.

205
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
[KEIKO] Kurama!
It's Kuwabara!

206
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,208
We have to find
Yusuke and warn him!

207
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,291
Stay back!

208
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
[KEIKO] Oh, Puu!

209
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,000
Puu please wake up! Please!

210
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,250
[PUU]
Puu.

211
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,791
You're alright!

212
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,708
[KURAMA]
Keiko! Are you injured?

213
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,500
No, but we absolutely have to
get to Kuwabara before they do!

214
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,333
[KURAMA]
Why?

215
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,666
[KUWABARA THINKS]
I mean, seriously.

216
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,333
Why can't we ever have
a chase on an elevator!

217
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,541
Why aren't you inside watching
cartoons like a normal kid?

218
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,458
Anyways there's a lot of
weirdoes out there today,

219
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,166
so go on, run home
to your mom.

220
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,166

listened to our elders,

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,000
and our video games!

[KUWABARA THINKS] My Spirit
Awareness is working again!

223

of those mutant's Territories.

You little punk!
Is this yours?

00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,625
No more running
away for you, Sensui.

I end your damn life.

a blast that big
