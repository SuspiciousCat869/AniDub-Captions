00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,250
Now, with no further ado,

157
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,125
the moment you've all been
waiting for! So let's begin!

158
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,208
[JURI] On my left,
Team Urameshi!

159
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,041
[crowd boos]

160
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,875
You guys have just
signed your death warrants

161
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,000
by showing up here!

162
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,375
You, Yea you!
Rest in peace!

163
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
Let's see some blood!

164
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,541
[crowd chants]
Kill them! Kill them! Kill Them!

165
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
I'd really like to show
every one of those jerk-faces

166
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,916
a thing or two about
minding their manners.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Besides, all their shoutin's
givin' me a headache.

168
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,958
What's the hold up, sister?

169
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,750
I came to see those punks fight,
not just stand around!

170
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,375
He's right! Let's get
this party started!

171
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,333
Ahem... Your attention please...

172
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,708
Please put your hands together
for everyone's favorite,

173
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,041
Team Toguro!

174
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,958
[crowd erupts in cheers]

175
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,458
Enough already!!!

176
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,041
Die!!! You hear me
Team Urameshi? Die!!!

177
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,125
Wait, something's
wrong here...

178
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:29,875
One, two, three, four...

179
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,000
...One, two, three, four...

180
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,750
Both sides are short one;

181
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,458
there should be five
fighters for each team!

182
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,750
What's the deal?

183
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,916
Without five, they
shouldn't be able to fight!

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,208
You know what?

185
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,416
If you don't figure
out what's going on soon,

186
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,125
we're bound to get
really pissed off!

187
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
Ahem, everyone please calm down

188
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,083
and I'll get to
the bottom of this.

189
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,000
Uuuh, let me see, according
to the tournament rule book..

190
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,041
Each of the ten
players must participate

191
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,125
in a one-on-one match,

192
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,083
assuming five
matches are necessary.

193
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,458
The first team to win three
matches will be the champions.

194
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,041
Sorry, about that.

195
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,166
Since it's the final and neither
side has used their substitution

196
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,083
you must have five or
your team will forfeit.

197
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,541
Hey, you did say you
got somebody for Genkai,

198
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,583
but I just want
you to know

199
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,375
that imaginary
friends don't count.

200
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,000
Riiight. I think it'd be best

201
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,041
if you didn't talk for
the rest of the tournament.

202
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,708
Great, so we're
already experiencing

203
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,083
officiating difficulty!

204
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,875
In case anybody
upstairs is curious,

205
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,750
I do have the entire
tournament rulebook memorized.

206
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,250
[DEMON] Come on, buddy!

207
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,833
Can't you make one
small exception?

208
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:40,875
I'll even give
you the money

209
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,083
I planned on buying
my ticket with!

210
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,375
You can't beat that!

211
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,833
Have a heart, I've been
here since last night!

212
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,791
Yeah, well I've been
waiting here for two nights!

213
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,291
Aw lighten up, dude.
We won't tell if you won't.

214
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,250
How many times do I
have to tell you jerks!!

215
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,791
You best back up or
I'll take your heads off!!

216
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,958
If you ain't got no ticket,
you ain't got no seat!

217
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,250
There's no ifs, ands,
or buts about it, got me?

218
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,958
Oh, it sounds like it's
impossible for us to get in.

219
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,166
I'm sorry girls,

220
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,208
I was so preoccupied
when I spoke with Koenma

221
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,875
that I totally forgot
to ask him about tickets.

222
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm afraid we won't be
able to watch the finals.

223
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,333
Well, you know what they say.

224
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,208
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

225
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,541
You're not gonna charge
the bouncer again are you?

226
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,333
Unless you have
another bright idea.

227
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,041
No...

228
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,500
[YUKINA] Attack really
is our only option.

229
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,166
[BOTAN] Why, Yukina! You're
just full of surprises!

230
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,750
Well, what do we have here,

231
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,666
it's the oh-so-lovely
friends of Koenma.

232
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,250
You know, this day just
keeps on getting better.

233
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,000
Uuuh!! I know you.

234
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,666
You're that sleazy scalper
who tried to con Koenma

235
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
into buying those
fourth-rate tickets!

236
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,666
How nice of you to
remember me, I'm touched.

237
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,083
I don't mean to
be presumptuous,

238
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,541
but I couldn't
help noticing

239
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,375
you foxy ladies are
in need of a hand, eh?

240
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,458
Well we sure as hell
don't need one of yours.

241
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,083
Oh, I see, my mistake.

242
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, then I guess you won't
mind if I sold these elsewhere?

243
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,208
Um, are those what
I think they are?

244
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,833
You bet they are, sweet-stuff,

245
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,500
and they happen to be four of
the best seats in the house.

246
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,375
And for you, I might be
willing to part with these

247
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,083
for about five
thousand clams apiece.

248
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,458
Geez, I'm such an idiot.

249
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,666
Can you believe that the tickets

250
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,291
were in my hand
this entire time?

251
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,583
Hey! You'd better
give those back!!

252
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,125
I guess I could be wrong,

253
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,000
but these look an awful lot
like our tickets, don't they?

254
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,416
Botan?

255
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,041
Uh, yes, yes those are
definitely our tickets,

256
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,500
our tickets definitely!!

257
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,041
Alright, girls that's very
funny, but the joke's over.

258
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,000
Just give me back
my tickets, okay?

259
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,541
But our names are on
them--they must be ours.

260
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,708
What do you mean?!

261
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,625
[SHIZURU] Look.

262
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,000
Here.

263
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:41,750
See.

264
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:44,916
[BOTAN] Told ya so.

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,583
Thanks for holding
'em for us though.

266
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,000
Sorry buddy,

267
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,541
but you gotta admit their
names are on the tickets--

268
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,625
and common property laws--

269
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,833
[SHIZURU] You see.

270
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,416
We really didn't need
your help after all.

271
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,708
Thank you so much
for our tickets.

272
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,375
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

273
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,000
Hope you learned it won't pay
to take advantage of people.

274
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,041
I can never resist the
charms of one beautiful woman,

275
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,541
much less four crafty ones.

276
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,375
But they've got no
problem resisting you!

277
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,958
Shut up!!!

278
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,500
Both teams need to
find another player soon.

279
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,916
Because if you don't I'll
be forced to disqualify you

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and forfeit this match,
and that's not good!

281
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,250
That's all you had to say.

282
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,750
Our reserve team member

283
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,166
is always ready to
join us when required.

284
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,791
It's him!

285
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,375
Right, uh-which him?

286
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,583
What's going on-- why is
everyone just standing around.

287
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,875
I suppose we'll
know soon enough.

288
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:58,958
[YUKINA] Does anyone know

289
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,625
who that strange
man at the gate is?

290
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,375
No, I don't really
know who he could be,

291
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,958
he's very good-looking.

292
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,583
Yes he is. Do you think
he's someone important?

293
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,958
Hurry.

294
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,541
[SAKYO]
Come on!

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,500
[SHIZURU] Let me
guess, human?

296
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,166
Yes, but remember
that down here,

297
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,916
we're in the minority,
so be careful.

298
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,333
[SHIZURU]
That's right.

299
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,166
Just walk away like all
the beautiful men in my life.

300
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,625
[KEIKO] Hey Shizuru,
earth to Shizuru.

301
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,708
Is something wrong?

302
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,708
Just a little dizzy.

303
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,791
[DEMON FAN] Hey big shot!

304
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,500
Do you even know
how to fight?!

305
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,541
Well, to be honest...

306
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,500
I have no intention to
participate in this match.

307
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,416
Granted, my presence
allows Toguro to continue,

308
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,208
but all it means for
me is a much better view.

309
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,708
I'll stake my life on
Yusuke's team being defeated

310
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,375
before my turn arrives.

311
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,875
Now let's begin.

312
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,500
That's what I call putting
your mouth where your money is!

313
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,916
Toguro is prepared!

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,125
Now present your fighter
or the finals are over!

315
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,958
Uuuh, what now
Mister Team Captain?

316
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,708
We've got like two seconds
for this guy to show up!

317
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,000
Hello!

318
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,916
Since Team Urameshi
has failed miserably

319
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,250
to produce a fifth player,

320
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,916
Team Toguro will be named
the winners by default!

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,500
[KOENMA] Hold it, missy!
Patience is a virtue.

322
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,458
[KUWABARA] Wow Urameshi,

323
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,875
this fighter you got even shoots
out some kind of magical smoke!

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,166
[KOENMA]
Um, not exactly.

325
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,041
I just thought dry ice
would be a nice touch.

326
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,500
It's the giant Koenma!!

327
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,500
So, what kept you,
a diaper change?

328
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,750
Great.

329
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,125
[KOENMA] Look Yusuke, you can
cool it with the wise cracks.

330
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,458
I don't have to
be here, you know.

331
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,625
I'm doing this as a favor.

332
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,666
Highly important
people like myself

333
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,916
shouldn't risk their lives,

334
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,958
but Genkai was a friend
and Toguro is a jerk.

335
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,208
So this is
what he meant

336
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,416
when he told me he had
business to attend to?

337
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,083
Way to go Koenma, sir!
You knock 'em dead!!!

338
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,708
[BLUE OGRE] This is the
proudest moment of my life!

339
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,166
Are you sure this
is a smart idea?

340
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,500
We don't even know
if he can fight!

341
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,958
[KOENMA] Believe it or not,

342
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
fighting isn't way up
there on my list of priorities,

343
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,333
so I've implemented
an escape route.

344
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,708
[KOENMA] The KOENMA-TRON five
thousand. What d'ya think?

345
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,375
[KUWABARA] I think we're in
deep trouble, that's what!!

346
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,458
Okay. Forget what I said.

347
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,041
Let's go!

348
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,333
Wait a second!

349
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,750
You can't just switch!

350
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,500
The rules say that a new
player may only be brought in

351
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,166
if an original
fighter is dead.

352
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,791
Well, about that.

353
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,416
It doesn't matter.

354
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,958
[KARASU] Their team will
never get to the fifth match,

355
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,750
so it won't be necessary
for junior to fight.

356
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,291
We all know he's just
here to take up space.

357
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,958
[KOENMA]
Anytime, mask boy.

358
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,125
What's wrong with you!!!

359
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,708
Alright! There's
finally a full roster,

360
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,958
so get ready to feast your eyes

361
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,791
on the Dark Tournament's
bloodiest massacre yet!

362
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,500
Ladies and gentlemen, it's taken
us seven long days to get here.

363
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,500
Welcome to the finals!

364
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,625
[buzzer]

365
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,083
[KARASU]
Bang.

366
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,833
Awe, look at him tryin' to
scare us with his dumb finger.

367
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:11,958
Man, I'm gonna beat him

368
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,291
until his mother
doesn't recognize him!

369
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,625
No.

370
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,541
I will handle him.

371
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,708
It has been decided--

372
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,208
we will begin the final with a
match between Team Toguro's...

373
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,208
Karasu!

374
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,750
And from Team
Urameshi's side... Kurama!

375
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,541
[NARRATOR]
After much anticipation,

376
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,875
the long-awaited
final has begun.

377
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,041
Kurama has claimed
the opening battle

378
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,875
against the charismatically
powerful Karasu.

379
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,208
But can he overcome
his new rival?

380
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,708
[BOTAN]
Hello everyone, it's Botan!

381
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, it looks like the
final is finally here!

382
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,791
Anyway, don't be fooled
by the earlier confusion,

383
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,125
because now the teams are set

384
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,791
and the Dark Tournament's
greatest action begins!

385
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,041
Anyone who's followed

386
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,083
since we first landed
on Hanging Neck Island

387
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,750
knows how much we've endured,

388
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,458
and this climactic final is
guaranteed to topple it all!

389
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,500
Carnivorous plants
the size of buildings,

390
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,875
explosive bats,

391
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,041
and you can bet that steely
Yoko Kurama will appear!

392
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,208
Next on Yu Yu Hakusho!
