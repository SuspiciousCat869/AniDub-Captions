00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,250
[NARRATOR]
Yusuke now fights the deepest

2
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,583
of Sensui's seven personalities:
Shinobu himself,

3
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,625
fracturing mankind's hope for
survival, as not even Yusuke

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,375
had the strength to win.

5
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,000
Out of options, Koenma
had released the power

6
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,333
of his Mafuuken,

7
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,541
a defensive spell designed
to trap Demon World's

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,416
greatest threats. But with
Sensui's control over

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,666
the elusive third type
of energy--Sacred Energy--

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,208
he miraculously deflected Human
World's last line of defense.

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,500
[sighs]

12
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,333
[KOENMA]
I'm ready to pay for this.

13
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,916
The rest of the world
shouldn't have to.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,333
[gasps]

15
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,875
You're not ready to die.
You just stopped teething.

16
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,125
Don't...! You can't win!

17
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,250
It's my mess to
answer for, not yours.

18
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,416
Oh, right. I'm killing you.

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,250
Forgive me, I got distracted.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,958
No!

21
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,666
Urameshi's not gonna
leave it to us!

22
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,458
It's not his style
to trust anybody.

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,875
He wouldn't give his life unless
he was savin' us for sure.

24
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,875
Perhaps that's just it.

25
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,875
[KUWABARA]
Hm?

26
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:00,958
Think, Kuwabara...

27
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,416
What you did wasn't
a real gamble.

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,791
You knew what Yusuke
had just been through.

29
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,166
They were sayin' he was
s'posed to be stronger.

30
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,541
[KURAMA]
That's right.

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,208
You knew Yusuke wasn't
living up to his potential.

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,791
A mulberry's a tree.

33
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,750
Kuwabara's a man.
And I'll prove it.

34
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,583
We all have to die
when our time comes,

35
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,000
but if we do our duty,
we don't got regrets!

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,875
So taste a little piece
of my sword, Toguro!

37
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,916
Stay right there, Kuwabara!

[KUWABARA]
It's all you...

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,458
I did what I could...

45
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,208
Now beat him for... all of us...

46
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,541
Make my death count, okay?

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,666
Genkai's Spirit Orb.

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,333
Yes. He possessed the power,

49
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,333
but he didn't know
how to tap into it.

50
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,166
Well then, maybe we
should kill Kuwabara again.

51
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,875
No, Yusuke's maxed-out.

52
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,625
We're the untapped ones...

53
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,375
We have the power, but not the
strength of mind to reach it.

54
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,291
Not without the pain of loss.

55
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,000
So, could we save him?

56
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,083
[KUWABARA]
Wait, Urameshi!

57
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,541
You don't have to die!

58
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,833
If you really think I have
the strength, I'll find it!

59
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,333
Please, just give
me time! I swear!

60
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,416
[KOENMA]
This won't accomplish anything.

61
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,041
Please... Yusuke.

62
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,583
You're half right.

63
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,000
I've got a feeling what I'm
about to do isn't gonna seal up

64
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,458
any tunnels, or keep Demons

65
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,291
from having Earth
to play with...

66
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,958
Whole world's probably screwed.

Who cares?

But I'll get one
thing accomplished...

00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,541
I'll know the loser
of this fight.

[KOENMA groans]

You are asking me to
take your life, Yusuke?

Yeah, that's right.

74
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,458
And do it with some style.

I don't want some
piss-poor, half-assed try.

it real quickly.

You can't go this way! Think!

What I did against Toguro
in that fight, I did for you.

The breaking point.

we can't help,

of trapping us?

While you were never a
threat for defeating Sensui,

with teamwork, run away.

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,541
Please... Is this
why I came back?

324
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,416
More pain?

That was awfully
bizarre turbulence...

329
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,291
Something's been shaken up.

330
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,750
[gasps] I've...
felt that before...

331
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,875
The first time.

332
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,166
[KUWABARA]
Come on, stop clownin' around.

333
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,500
Ha, ha... Prankster.

334
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,041
I get it, it's payback
for me trickin' you

335
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,083
with Toguro. Good one.

336
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,333
Too bad I'm not as gullible
as you, big lame-o.

00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,291
I mean, hey, I'll just
cover up your mouth and nose!

338
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,666
You can't complain, right?

339
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
I mean, dead guys
don't gotta breathe!

340
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,125
Look...

341
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,833
Your plan to motivate
us worked. I broke us out.

342
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,166
Now let's beat Sensui
together and go home.

343
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,083
Come on, I'm not dumb!

[growling, panting]

348
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,333
For some reason,
I thought taking his life

349
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,708
would bring catharsis...

350
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,125
I even timed the video's
climactic final scene

351
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,416
as a requiem for his death.

352
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,583
Instead, I just feel
a deeper sadness.

353
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,916
Another soul lost,
fighting for the wrong side.

[SENSUI] But in truth,
there's little point

357
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,916
in mourning his passing...

358
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,750
As humans, we will all
join him soon enough.

[SENSUI] If you insist on

00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,500
you should hurry.
The tunnel is complete.

[KOENMA]
Yusuke is dead.

363
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,291
And now my father is
sending his own army

364
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,916
from Spirit World
with mysterious orders.

365

Sensui's madness
is growing deeper,

366
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,583
and the tunnel between
worlds is finally opened

367

for the demon invasion.

368
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,250
But as Yusuke intended,
his sacrifice calls forth

369
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,625
unbelievable powers
in his friends.

370
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,500
Now, a desperate fight
for humanity's fate,

371
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,166
staged not in caves,
but on the battle field

372
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,083
of Demon World itself.
