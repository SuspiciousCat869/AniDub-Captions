00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,708
[NARRATOR]
At the urging of Genkai,

2
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,166
Yusuke paid a visit
to Kuroko Sanada,

3
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,041
the first Spirit Detective.

4
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,291
But their meeting was
interrupted by the arrival

5
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,208
of messengers from Demon World.

6
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,958
They told of three Demon
rulers who have maintained

7
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,916
the balance of power
for over 500 years.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,083
Only now, one of those rulers
is on the verge of death,

9
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,958
That ruler is Raizen,
Yusuke's ancestral father.

10
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:04,500
However, Yusuke is skeptical
if all they say is true...

11
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,125
Why is it I don't think
you're telling me everything?

12
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,166
Liar!

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,375
[HOKUSHIN grunts]

14
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,250
[YUSUKE] And that was
me takin' it easy on you.

15
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,250
I'll decide whether
or not to kill you,

16
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,416
after I've heard
your real story.

17
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,708
Impressive, I couldn't
tell you'd held back

18
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,541
until I was already beaten.

19
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,375
No matter how many times I do
that, it still makes me dizzy.

20
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,541
As you've deduced, I haven't
been entirely forthcoming.

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,958
But only because

22
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,458
I didn't think you'd trust
us if you knew how we fed.

23
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,208
[YUSUKE]
Give me some credit, baldy.

24
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,500
I get it. Food is food.
And to you, people is food.

25
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,833
[gasps]

26
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,375
[YUSUKE] Look, I've gotten
plenty of dirty looks

27
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,083
from vegetarians while
scarfing down a burger.

28
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,208
I feel ya.

29
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,625
So you guys need to eat people,

30
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,333
it's not like
you've got a choice.

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,250
I mean, your king went anorexic

32
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,250
and look what's
happening to him.

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,083
And even though
those other two rulers

34
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,250
still have pro
people-eating platforms,

35
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,416
you guys are backing
the un-cannibal.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,541
Now that's loyalty.

37
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,833
So all I'm saying is,

38
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,041
I would've had a lot
less trouble trusting you

39
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,291
if you had just been straight
with me from the get go. Got it?

40
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,833
Now,

41
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,541
we've all learned a valuable
lesson about telling the truth.

42
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,208
I can see you are truly the
son of the great King Raizen.

43
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,000
You two are much alike.

44
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,625
Stop calling him my father.

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,791
[HOKUSHIN]
It is quite an honor

46
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,041
to be compared so
favorably to our King.

47
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,541
That is our highest compliment.

48
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,375
[YUSUKE gasps]

49
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,750
[HOKUSHIN]
When you spoke before,

50
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,833
I could tell that you share
your father's gift for

51
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,958
fairness and reasoning.

52
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,416
[YUSUKE]
Hm.

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
And from what we've heard
of your battle with Sensui,

54
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,041
not to mention what
we've witnessed firsthand,

55
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,916
you have inherited his
warrior's strength as well.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
Strength that we will need
on our side if we're ever

57
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,875
going to defeat those
other two ruling Demons.

58
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,000
I guess I don't know
what the big deal is

59
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,666
I mean, why do you want
these two guys dead so bad?

60
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,125
[HOKUSHIN] Because our
King does not like them.

61
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:08,541
And if our King does not like
someone, then neither do I.

62
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,208
Well, how very
lemming-like of you.

63
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,750
You cannot understand the
intricacies of our world

64
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,375
until you are a part of it.

65
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,000
We will be back here in a week

66
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,500
which should give you enough
time to make your decision.

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,541
[TOUOU, SEITEI]
Hm.

68
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,833
[HOKUSHIN] I'm sure you've
already made up your mind,

69
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,541
but since you will be
leaving this world,

70
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,375
there must be many things
you need to attend to.

71
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,041
[HOKUSHIN] The King looks
forward to seeing you.

72
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,250
[gasps]

73
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,666
You have to go.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,875
Kuroko?

75
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,083
How long you been
standing here?

76
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,208
Long enough. I heard
everything that you said.

77
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,833
You would be better
off in Demon World.

78
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,041
[KUROKO] Without hesitation,
you described people as food.

79
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,208
That's not something an ordinary
person would just accept.

80
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,458
I'm afraid you don't belong
in this world, anymore.

81
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,916
Maybe you're right.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,958
I wasn't going to
say anything to you,

83
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,500
but you weren't the first
visitor I received this week.

84
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,500
Who's there?

85
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,333
[gasps]

86
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,958
Yusuke Urameshi must
be killed immediately.

87
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,083
[KUROKO]
But isn't he Spirit Detective?

88
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,500
Not anymore, he isn't.

89
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,375
He's become a danger to
himself and to others.

90
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,916
He's a Demon, now. A Mazoku.

91
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,416
I've retired from Spirit World
and no longer answer to them.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,375
Now, leave me alone.

93
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,500
[YUSUKE]
Huh, I guess Koenma was right.

94
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,083
Those guys really do
have it out for me.

95
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
You know, it makes a
guy feel kinda special,

96
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,083
to be wanted like that.

97
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,750
[KUROKO]
I told them I wouldn't do it,

98
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,125
then I called Master Genkai,

99
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,875
to learn more about this
notorious, Yusuke Urameshi.

100
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,666
So? what did
the old bat say?

101
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,041
Master Genkai told me
that I'd relate with you

102
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,458
the moment that I
met you in person.

103
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,791
And she was right. I was
convinced when we met

104
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,625
that you really were
somebody worth protecting.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,125
At first anyway, but...

106
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,666
...I'm really sorry, Yusuke,

107
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,958
But I don't trust you, and this
is one time I can't just go on

108
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,041
Master Genkai's faith alone.

109
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,791
[KUROKO]
It's different now.

110
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,625
I have children and I have to
think about their safety first,

111
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,708
and I don't think
that they can be safe

112
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,166
while you're around.

113
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,250
That's ridiculous. I'd never
do anything to hurt them!

114
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,541
[KUROKO] Yes, but are you
always yourself, lately?

115
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,791
[YUSUKE sighs]

116
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,666
I hoped that because of
our shared experience,

117
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,208
I could offer some advice,

118
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,416
but it seems you have a lot more
in common with those three, 

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,166
now, than you do with me.

120
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,916
There is nothing to say.

121
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,041
It's all good.

122
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

123
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,875

telling you your fortune?

Why not?

I didn't get a chance

to tell you it could
come from close in.

129
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,416
I saw a great separation
developing between

you and your friends.

a separation made in blood.

than that to surprise me.

to see you alive and well.

Of course, I can't actually see,

as this is just a
spirit of words.

meet you in person soon.

00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,625
But several hundred years ago,
I joined their ranks.

159
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,958
And now, I'm prepared
for my next ascension.

160
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,791
I'm planning to
dethrone the two of them,

161
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:06,250
and then will unify all of Demon
World as one nation under me.

162
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,041
But if I am to succeed in this,

163
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,666
I will require your
assistance, Kurama.

164
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,416
And so, my friend, I plead
with you to join my crusade.

165
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,333
If you believe in
the unification,

166
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,708
then I beg you to return to us.

167
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,750
Oh, and one more thing.

168
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,416
I almost forgot to tell you.

169
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,333
I apprehended the one who
stole the light from me.

170
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,083
I think you'll be amused, as was
I, when you see who it was.

171
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,208
Another incentive to come
back to Demon World, I guess.

Now don't feel too special,

00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,625
you weren't the only one who
received a midnight visitor.

[HIEI]
Messengers came to me as well.

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,791
Though, in my case, they
were sent by Mukuro.

Greetings, Hiei. I am Mukuro.

[MUKURO]
I would've been there in person,

183
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,166
but I seldom show
my face in public.

184
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,583
Not out of fear,

185
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,708
but out of annoyance at
being mobbed by adoring fans.

186
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,291
Huh...

187
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,375
[MUKURO] Your recent appearance
here has come to my attention,

188
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,500
and I had to wonder: Why
aren't you working for me?

189
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,708
Think of it.

190
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,333
You could be my right-hand man.

191
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:38,791
I'll even let you in on a little
secret. For your ears only.

192
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,666
Raizen is on the brink of death.

193
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,375
And when he has breathed
his very last breath,

194
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
I will strike Yomi
with full force.

195
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,375
He pushes for a peaceful,
unified Demon World.

196
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,875
I'm sure the mere thought
of such a desecration

197
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,041
of our homeland disgusts you.

198
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,250
[MUKURO] If I am correct
in my assumption,

199
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,916
you should join me.

200
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,291
What a talkative and
self-important fool he is.

201
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,750
Was he always like that, Kurama?

202
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,166
And much worse.

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,666
Mukuro has always been a
dangerous, tyrannical ruler.

204
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,250
You have no idea, Hiei, of the
damage Mukuro could do.

205
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,208
Demon World thrown in chaos.

206
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,750
Then I suppose this is
going to be interesting.

207
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,250
Well I'm off to visit him now.

208

Goodbye.

209
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,916
You can breathe, you know.
I'm not going there to help him.

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Yes, that is good thinking,
it will be beneficial

211
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,708
for us to have a man on the
inside whom Mukuro trusts.

212
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,666
Just be sure to get
as much information

213
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,041
as you can without
raising suspicions.

Oh, I'll be sure to use
him for everything I can.

Hey, Kayko, get down here!

315
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,916
We got a special customer!

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,083
[YUSUKE] Oh, y-you don't have
to bother her, Mr. Ukimura.

317
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,708
Nonsense, she'll love it!

318
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,875
Hey Kayko, get your butt
down here, right away!

319
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,833
[KAYKO] I'm trying to
do my homework, Dad!

320
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,000
If getting into that
school means turning your

321
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,041
back on your old man,

322
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,333
you don't need high
school, anyway!

323
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,250
Look it's your friend, Yusuke!

324
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
[KAYKO] You interrupted
my studying for him?

325
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,208
He wants an order of
grilled beef with rice and--

326
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,916
[KAYKO]
I know what he wants.

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,416
[MR. YAKIMORA] Watch it,
sweetie, or you'll burn it.

328
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,416
If you keep cooking like that,

329
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,625
no man will ever
want to marry you.

330
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,750
[KAYKO]
How enlightened of you.

331
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,083
Now your mother,
she can cook!

332
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,041
[KAYKO]
Please, Not now, Dad.

333
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,750
[KAYKO]
Here's your food.

334
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,541
Enjoy. Don't choke on it.

335
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,333
I'd enjoy it more
if you sat with me.

336
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,250
[KAYKO]
Why?

337
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,291
Just because, okay?

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,708
This looks great!

339
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,166
This is the best food I've
ever tasted in my life!

340
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,000
Can I go now, Dad?

341
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,708
[YUSUKE]
Want some?

342
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,125
Want some what?

343
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,791
[YUSUKE]
Your loss...

344
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,000
Uh, so, Kayko, I guess

345
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,125
you know tomorrow is
my birthday, right?

346
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,583
Yeah, I knew that.

347
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,208
So, uh...

348
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,541
So what?

349
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,958
So by my 18th birthday,
I'll get back here.

350
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,541
I will find a way...

351
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,250
I promise to.

352
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,125
And, then what?

353
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,041
Then let's get married.

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,958
[KAYKO gasps]

355
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,125
[sighs]

356
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,458
Yusuke, I don't
know how my new...

357
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,041
...boyfriend is going
to feel about that.

358
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,333
[MR. YAKIMORA laughs]

359
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,458
Been a while since
last time I heard one

360
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,708
of Yusuke's proposals. [laughs]

361
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,583
He used to play that card every

362
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,541
time you two had an
argument as kids.

363
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,041
[laughs]

364
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,416
You haven't changed.

365
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,833
[YUSUKE]
I'm serious.

366
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,500
Three years and I'll be back,
and we'll get married.

367
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,708
I don't know, buddy, I'm
going into high school.

368
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,083
A lot could happen in that time.

369
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,333
[YUSUKE] Kayko... You
know I love you, right?

370
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,375
[KAYKO]
Yeah, yeah, me too.

371
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
[YUSUKE laughs]

372
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,875
[MR. YAKIMORA laughs]

373
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,625
[sighs]

374
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,041
[door clatters]

375
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
[KAYKO]
Yusuke, just give me a sign

376
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
that everything's
gonna be all right.

377
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,541
[gasps]

378
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,750
[YUSUKE] Well, the time has come
for me to go back to Demon World

379
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,541
and Kuwabara's got
problems with it.

380
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,291
But then again, Kuwabara's got
problems with lots of things,

381
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,166
so let's focus on me, okay?

382
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,833
Looks like I get quite a sendoff
from all my friends at home,

383
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,250
which I'll have to enjoy while
I can, 'cause when you hit

384
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,958
the ground running in Demon
World, they mean it literally.

385
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,166
But it'll be worth it when
I come face to face with

386
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,083
the bastard that
hijacked my body during

387
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,041
my fight with Sensui:
My ancestral dad.

388
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:20,166
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
