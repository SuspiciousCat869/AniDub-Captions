[NARRATOR]
Control of Demon World

2
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,375
is divided among three rulers:

3
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,541
Raizen, Yomi and Mukuro.

4
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,000
From his deathbed, Raizen has
invited his descendant, Yusuke,

5
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,333
to return to Demon World
to train under him

6
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,250
and defeat his foes.

7
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,708
Deciding to go, the young
Spirit Detective said farewell

8
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,000
to the one he loves.

9
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,875
By my eighteenth birthday,
I'll get back here.

10
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,125
I'll find a way. I promise.

11
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,000
[KUWABARA] FOIL: First, Outside,
Inside. What's the "L" for?

12
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,708
[groans]

13
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,750
I know this...

14
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,875
It's not the
speed of light, is it?

15
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,208
[SHIZURU]
Kazu, are you studying?

16
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,208
Of course.

17
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,000
Here's your reward.

18
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,208
[KUWABARA]
Mmm, that looks great!

19
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:17,791
Thank y--

20
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,125
[yells]

21
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,750
What the heck was that for?!

22
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,541
It can be your
reward if and only if

23
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,208
you promise to
finish reading this book

24
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,291
on twentieth century
geopolitical shifts

25
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,458
by morning.

26
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,708
Tomorrow morning?!
But I'm doing my math!

27
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,708
You'll read this in addition
to doing your math work

28
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,000
because you know
the prep school

29
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,208
that you want to get into

30
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,083
is looking for only
well-rounded students,

31
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,583
and you are already far
behind the other applicants.

32
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,291
[KUWABARA] Fine. I'll do it.
I promise. Happy?

33
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,083
I'm ecstatic.

34
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,166
[SHIZURU]
Cover to cover.

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,166
She's such a nag!

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,750
I guess she does know me,
though. Gotta hand it to her.

37
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,916
She knows the best way to get
to me is through my stomach.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I guess she forgot
to use the sugar.

39
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,916
[purring noise]

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,250
Eikichi!

41
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,208
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty!
Come out and play.

42
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,916
Here, kitty!

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,166
[meows]

44
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,833
[KUWABARA]
Oh! Botan!

45
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,583
I was just looking
for my contact, that's all.

46
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,083
That'll have to wait,
I'm afraid.

47
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,458
You've been summoned to
Master Genkai's compound ASAP.

48
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,166
[KUWABARA]
Why?

49
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,416
Dunno.

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,958
What am I saying?

51
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,708
I can't go out--I'm gonna be
up studying all night as it is.

52
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,166
Some other time.

53
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,708
[BOTAN]
All right...

54
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,208
I'll tell Yukina you
were too busy to see her.

55
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,166
[KUWABARA gasps]
Yukina's gonna be there?!

56
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,500
Why didn't you say so?!

57
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,750
But you're too busy
to come tonight, right?

58
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,125
How dare you
put schoolwork ahead

59
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,458
of the girl I love
more than anything?!

60
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,666
Don't you know the best
way to get me to do anything

61
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,458
is through my heart,
for I am the warrior of love!

62
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,250
Driver, take me to Genkai's
place now, and step on it!

63
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,041
We're not going anywhere
'til you say "please."

64
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,625
Kazuma, I forgot
the sugar for your...

65
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,625
[gasps]

66
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,791
Botan?!

67
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,458
We'd better get
a move on, Botan.

68
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
Away we go!

69
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,583
[SHIZURU] Hey!
Get your asses back here!

70
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,125
Shizuru! Please forgive me!

71
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,125
[KUWABARA] What do you mean
you're going back there?!

72
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,750
When we were there,
you said you wanted to go home,

73
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,708
and now that you're here,
you wanna go back--

74
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,250
Maybe you're just a spoiled brat
who can't be happy anywhere!

75
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,666
I've decided...

76
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Despite your kind and heartfelt
tribute, I'm going back.

77
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,041
So what're you gonna do there?

78
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,166
You gonna turn into one of them

79
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,333
and then come back
and attack us? Huh?

80
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,416
I don't know.

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,083
You don't know?

82
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,208
[gasp]

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,833
[chuckles]

84
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,500
I think I'll miss
your weak-ass punches

85
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,958
most of all, Kuwabara,

86
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,875
so I guess I'd better savor
this last one while I can.

87
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,083
[YUSUKE]
Anyway...

88
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,416
I don't know
what will happen to me

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,625
when I get there,
or what to expect.

90
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,833
That's why I'm going--
To find out more about myself

91
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,583
and what I'm capable of.

92
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,916
What I do know

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is that I'm no good
to you or anybody else

94
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,625
as long as I can't even
keep control of my own body

95
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,000
or its actions--you get that?

96
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,041
And what about
your duty to protect?

97
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,541
In all your selfish plans,

98
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,500
you've forgotten that you're
still the Spirit Detective.

99
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,833
[KOENMA]
Not anymore, he's not.

100
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,958
[KUWABARA gasps]

101
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,083
[KOENMA] Spirit World has given
him a dishonorable discharge,

102
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,458
relieving him of his
duties as a Spirit Detective.

103
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,083
Still, there's
the pesky little matter

104
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,375
of the death warrant my
father placed on his head.

105
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,166
[gasps]

106
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,833
There's a death warrant?

107
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,333
[YUSUKE] Yeah, I didn't wanna
make a big deal out of it.

108
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,916
And I'm not using it
as an excuse,

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,583
but the fact that every second
I spend here brings me closer

110
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,166
to assassination does make
Demon World pretty appealing.

111
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,958
[GENKAI] Do you remember
when you first came to me?

112
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,333
Before your Awareness
had fully developed,

113
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,708
you had such difficulty
fighting in the darkness.

114
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,208
Since that time, I've guided
you through the shadows,

115
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,583
tried to shed light
on what you could be.

116
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,875
But now Yusuke
has gone beyond us all.

117
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,833
And as he's discovered,

118
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,875
sometimes the more you see,
the less clear things become.

119
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,208
Yusuke thought he knew it all.

120
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,750
He thought he was just
some dime-a-dozen punk.

121
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,416
But the more he
learns about himself,

122
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,041
the more confused he gets.

123
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,875
I think we owe it to him
to allow him the chance

124
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,875
to fumble around in the
darkness for answers,

125
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,166
because the truth of it is-- 

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,000
We can't stop his Demon blood
from causing him to do wrong.

127
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,291
We just have to have faith.

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,750
Is that too much
to ask, Kuwabara?

129
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,166
And how do you
propose gettin' back

130
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,666
to your precious homeland?

131
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,500
In case you've forgotten,
the border tunnel between

132
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,875
Living World and Demon World
has been sealed back up!

133
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,750
Then we'll just have to
go unseal it again, won't we?

134
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,583
Wha--What are you talking about?

135
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,666
[KUWABARA]
The Spirit Defense Force?

136
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,791
Well, Mr. Urameshi,
are you ready to go?

137
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,208
Oh yeah... Anytime you are.

138
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,708
You've gotta be kidding me!

139
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,750
You freaks wouldn't really
open the hole to Demon World!

140
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,833
[KOENMA chuckling]
Not only would they do it,

141
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,750
they volunteered
for this mission.

142
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,333
Could you guys
be any stupider?!

143
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,750
What, just 'cause you tools
are too weak to kill him,

144
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,666
you're gonna give him a
free ticket to Demon World

145
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,166
so he's out of your hair?

146
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
I'm not going to deny that.

147
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,708
Faced with the
possibility of a Mazoku

148
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,916
on the loose,

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,791
the Great King Yama
in his infinite wisdom

150
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,541
granted Yusuke fair passage,
thus containing him

151
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,458
and preserving peace in both
the Spirit and Living Worlds.

152
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,875
This is all to
preserve the peace

153
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,416
of the Living World?

154
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,875
And what about the next time
somebody like Toguro or Sensui

155
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,916
decides to pass
through there, huh?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,833
You just expect me, Kurama and
Hiei to fight them off alone

157
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,666
with our bare hands?

158
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,000
That won't happen.

159
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,500
Kuwabara, the intricacies
of Demon World politics

160
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,333
are complicated,
and their impact can be

161
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,625
quite far-reaching.

162
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,375
What's that got to do with this?

163
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,625
[rustling]

164
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,166
Hi, Hiei.

165
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,791
I was personally
invited to return

166
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,250
to Demon World as well.

167
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,333
Don't tell me...

168
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,541
You're gonna fight
on behalf of

169
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,625
Urameshi's dear
Demon daddy, too?

170
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,833
Actually it's the opposite.

171
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,916
The invitation was from
one of Raizen's major enemies...

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,333
Mukuro.

173
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,416
[KUWABARA] You really
aren't gonna accept that,

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,458
are you, Hiei?

175
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,916
[HIEI]
In fact, I am.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I belong in Demon World,
not this one.

177
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,291
Even if that means going up

178
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,375
against your friend Urameshi
when you're there?

179
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,458
If that is our destiny,
then so be it.

180
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,250
After all, I always
have wanted a rematch.

181
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
Maybe my destiny, too.

182
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,208
[KUWABARA]
Kurama, too?

183
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,875
[KURAMA] My presence in Demon
World has also been requested.

184
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,208
And at the behest
of the third leader...

185
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Lord Yomi.

186
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,083
An old acquaintance.

187
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,000
I feel... like the
ugly one at the dance.

188
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,958
[KURAMA] I'll be leaving
for Demon World myself,

189
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,291
though probably some time
after Yusuke and Hiei do.

190
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,833
I don't believe
what I'm hearing!

191
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,791
Have you all gone
totally bonkers?!

192
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,000
I thought we had a good thing
going! I thought we had a team!

193
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,291
We were gonna fight
the good fight together,

194
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,000
but it turns out
you'll fight any fight

195
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,458
even if it's fighting
against each other!

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
I consider you my friends,

197
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,541
but you're no
friends of mine!

198
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,791
Somehow I think I'll
manage to live with that.

199
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,208
I'm gonna kill you,
you little punk!

200
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,500
[GENKAI]
Stop!

201
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,791
[GENKAI]
We have no reason to believe

202
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,208
they're abandoning
the good fight.

203
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,416
Get off it, old lady,
they're going to Demon World!

204
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,166
Evil's all they do!

205
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,500
Kazuma, just because
someone is born a Demon

206
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,625
does not necessarily
make them evil...

207
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,375
Or have you forgotten
that I, too, am of Demon World?

208
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,750
[KUWABARA]
Uh... but I didn't...

209
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,625
Listen, pal...

210
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,750
Whaddaya want with me,
you traitor?

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,291
Study hard so you can
get into that prep school.

212
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,666
--[KUWABARA gasps]
--[YUSUKE] Shh!

213
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,250
How... did you
ever hear about that?

214
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,083
Kayko told me about it.

215
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,000
Now don't let those brainiacs
turn you into a nerd,

216
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,500
but do us all proud and go on

217
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,041
to become a doctor
or lawyer or something.

218
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,875
I'll be back
in three years, okay?

219
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,791
And the first
thing I'm gonna do

220
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,500
is make sure you
got into that school,

221
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,250
and you're on
your way to college.

222
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,625
[laughs]
Three years exactly?

223
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,750
All right, I'll hold up
my side of the deal,

224
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,458
but here's one for you.

225
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,083
If you gotta go,
don't come back

226
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,458
until you're the
king of all the Demons.

227
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,583
Oh, and hey,
while you're there,

228
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,041
could you track down
Yukina's long lost brother?

229
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,125
[YUSUKE] Um, uh, yeah, if he's
even there at the same time.

230
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,625
[YUSUKE] I'll bet even his
third eye is glaring at me!

231
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,833
Why does everyone
always get all weird and nervous

232
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,875
when I bring up
Yukina's brother?

233
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,291
[laughs nervously]

234
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,875
Shizuru.

235
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,166
So Yusuke's really
going to just keep on flying

236
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,208
in the face of danger?

237
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,500
Honey, if Yusuke
ever weren't in danger,

238
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,333
he'd up and die of boredom.

239

[SHUNJUN]
Mr. Urameshi.

240

The time has now
arrived for your departure.

All right, soldiers!
Double time!

242
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
Let's go.

243
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,166
Does anyone else
think it's kind of ironic

244
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,625
that someone as strong as Sensui

245
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,000
had to go through
all that trouble

246
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,625
to open up a hole
to Demon World,

247
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,583
but these little weak
security guards can do it

248
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,916
with barely a
snap of their fingers?

Forget what I said before.

We may have chosen to
follow different paths,

252

will always be...

[KUWABARA] I'm sorry. I just
got some dirt stuck in my...

...contact lens, that's all.

256
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,708
You don't wear contacts.

Good job.

00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,333
[YUSUKE]
Right. I guess... that's my cue.

262
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,625
Well, Kurama, Hiei...

263
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,541

[SHUNJUN] Not that you'd
ever take my advice,

but for what it's worth,
don't ever come back here.

You're right,
I wouldn't take your advice,

but if I do come back,
I'll get here on my own,

to leave us, are you?

is that the Special Defense
Force let Yusuke go--

they actually opened the gateway

from the three kings
of Demon World,

all on the same day,
each seeking an extradition.

And Mukuro wanted Hiei.

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,083
They each suggested it would
be safer for Living World

316
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,291
to have these powerful and
potentially dangerous Demons

317
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,166
quarantined forever
in Demon World.

318
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,375
And my father agreed to that.

319
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,625
[KOENMA] The Mighty King
of the Spirit World

320
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,916
bended to their whims

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,166
and made a pact with
the Lords of Demon World.

322
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,666
You can't ever tell
anyone about this, Ogre,

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,083
do you understand?

324
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,875
[BLUE OGRE] But, sir, I'm sure
that the Great King Yama

325
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,000
must have had a much better
reason to agree to such a thing.

326
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,750
I can only hope so.

327
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,625
Uh, guys, how much
further do you think

328
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,166
we have to run
'til we get there,

329
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,916
'cause I mean it feels like
we've been sprinting for hours.

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,291
[HOKUSHIN]
Not too much farther.

331
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,875
If we keep running,
we should arrive in four days.

332
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,291
Four days?!

333
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,375
We gotta keep running
for four more days?!

334
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,500
I didn't know that
would be a problem for you,

335
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,083
but if you need a rest
we'd be happy to stop.

336
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,875
Ha! Me?
I was born on a treadmill!

337
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,708
[HOKUSHIN]
In that case, let's go faster.

338
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,916
[HOKUSHIN]
Here we are, Mr. Urameshi.

339
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,541
That's incredible.

340
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,833
We ran as fast
as we possibly could,

341
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,125
and yet despite our efforts
to leave you behind...

342
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,833
You not only kept up with us,
but you did not break a sweat.

343
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,833
You should take some of
that quickness from your feet

344
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,458
and stick it to your brain
and then maybe you'd learn...

345
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,375
I'm not the one to
turn down challenges.

346
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,625
[distant rumbling]

347
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,583
What's that rumbling sound?
A thunderstorm?

348
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,708
[HOKUSHIN] That's the sound of
King Raizen's empty stomach.

349
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,375
Ever since he
stopped eating humans,

350
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,208
his belly growls like
that at every mealtime.

351
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,500
We use it as a clock
to mark the passing of time.

352
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,791
There...

353
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,458
...in that tower,
our King is waiting for you.

354
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,083
[HOKUSHIN] From this point,
you are on your own.

355
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,583
[YUSUKE]
Knock, knock.

356
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,166
[RAIZEN]
Welcome, my son.

357
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,708
What's the matter?

358
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,041
[chuckling]

359
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,833
You too big and cool to
give your old man a hug?

360
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,083
[YUSUKE]
You're not my dad!

361
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,125
Now tell me...

362
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,833
Why did you
have to get involved?

363
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,875
When I was fighting Sensui,
what did you do?

364
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,041
Tell me or I'm gonna
kick your ass!

365
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
[choked yelling]

366
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,791
[RAIZEN chuckling]

367
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,250
[RAIZEN]
That's why I did it.

368
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,000
For your own good,
you ungrateful bastard.

369
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,750
That human would've killed you.

370
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,625
You may have
inherited my genes,

371
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,041
but you haven't the slightest
idea what do with them.

372
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,083
Shame to waste them
on a weakling like you!

373
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,875
[YUSUKE yells]
I'll waste you!

374
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:02,666
[crashing noise]

375
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,666
[HOKUSHIN]
Well that sounds about right

376
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,500
for a father-son reunion.

377
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:13,125
[YUSUKE yelling]

378
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,958
[RAIZEN]
Had enough, boy?

379
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,250
See how your feeble skills
pale in comparison to mine,

380
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,625
or was my lesson
too dense for you?

381
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,791
The only thing I see is
an over-confident dead man.

382
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,958
[RAIZEN]
I'll make you a deal.

383
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,875
If you can move me
from my throne,

384
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,625
I'll more than gladly give it
to you, son, along with my life.

385
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,375
[YUSUKE]
Keep your throne.

386
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,708
Ha! Your life is
good enough for me!

387
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,875
[YUSUKE yelling]

388
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,458
Well...
Not sittin' so pretty now.

389
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,791
[RAIZEN] You hear,
but you don't listen, child.

390
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,166
You moved the throne, not me.

391
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,958
A tedious
technicality to be sure,

392
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,375
but we are men of honor.

393
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,416
Don't you worry, though.
We'll get your prize yet.

394
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,083
As long as my body continues
to shrink at this pace,

395
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,166
I'll no doubt be dead
within the span of a year.

396
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,833
Right...

397
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,125
The low-human diet's
working wonders for you.

398
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,083
As for the
matter of my throne...

399
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,041
you'll have to get much stronger

400
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,166
if you're to
fend off my enemies.

401
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,666
[NARRATOR]
For the first time,

402
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,375
Yusuke has met face to face
with his ancestral father.

403
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,208
But as Raizen attempts
to make Yusuke stronger...

404
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,708
the other two Demon lords
make their own preparations.

405
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:56,333
[HIEI] At last I return to the
world where I belong, my home.

406
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,833
There's just one thing
that I didn't miss

407
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,666
about the land of apparitions:

408
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,791
being haunted by
ghosts from my past.

409
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,541
And unlike in the
death-defying battles

410
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,291
I've become accustomed to,
there's no escape in sight.

411
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:12,000
The memories assault my senses
when I'm at my most vulnerable.

412
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,041
So if you're feeling
particularly sadistic,

413
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:18,291
then by all means, please join
in my personal nightmare

414
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,500
on the next Yu Yu Hakusho.
