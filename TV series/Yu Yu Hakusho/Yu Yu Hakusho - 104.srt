00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,500
[NARRATOR] After a year
of training in Demon World,

2
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,416
Yusuke has made great strides,

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,416
becoming even more powerful
than he was before.

4
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,583
But he was powerless to stop the
death of his ancestral father,

5
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,791
Raizen, whose passing has set
Demon World's other rulers

6
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,166
scrambling to assert
their dominance.

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,875
Yusuke, too, as his
territory's new king,

8
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,541
set in motion his own plans.

9
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,541
Hokushin...

10
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,583
I need you to take me somewhere.

11
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,041
To the house of Yomi.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,125
Yomi! You son of a bitch!

13
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,250
Can you hear me?!
'Cause I'm comin'!

14
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,125
So, boil up a
kettle of tea, Yomi!

15
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,583
Kurama, this friend of
yours seems rather silly.

16
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,708
Can he really be the
descendant of Raizen?

17
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,208
But let's assume it is true,

18
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,500
doesn't his presence here
confirm that Raizen is no more?

19
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,708
I suppose so.

20
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,125
Well, then...

21
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,083
I am eager to hear what
Raizen's heir has to say to me.

22
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,916
Youda, prepare to welcome
our guests in proper fashion.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,375
Yes.

24
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,458
Inform the sentries at the
gate to give them no trouble

25
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,875
when they arrive.

26
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,125
Just measure Urameshi's
energy at the door.

27
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,791
As you command, sir.

28
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,458
Kurama, I want you
to have your men

29
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,166
standing at the ready
in the next room.

30
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,250
[gasps]

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,083
If he tries anything,
I won't hesitate

32
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,875
to issue the
assassination order.

33
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,500
And I know as Chairman
of the joint Chiefs of Staff,

34
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,791
you won't hesitate to act on it.

35
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,916
[KURAMA] You haven't
changed at all, Yusuke.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,041
Only this time,
your impetuous nature

37
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,208
may trigger a full-scale war.

38
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,125
[CHU]
He wants us to off the bloke?

39
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,416
And at the first meeting?

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,208
Well, first, let's
see how things go.

41
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,750
Who knows, maybe
Yusuke will treat

42
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,833
Yomi with grace and humility.

43
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,125
Not likely.

44
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
Look on the bright side,

45
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,625
at least you'll get to see
Yusuke again like you wanted.

46
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,416
Too right! I bloody
miss the fella!

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,875
Aye! Make that a double.

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,958
I'll want to be seein'
him, too, I say.

49
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,083

[MUKURO]
Hiei!

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,791
[MUKURO]
I'm coming with you.

56
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,041
I want to see my competition
with my own eye.

57
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,666
All right, suit yourself.

58
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,583
Strange, I would've thought we'd
encounter a welcoming party.

59
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,708
[MUKURO scoffs]
He knows we're here.

60
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,916
And believe me, we'd know
if he didn't want us to be.

61
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,000
I present your tea, sir.

62
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,750
Uh... I guess you
do have good ears.

63
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,875
Mukuro's arrived, sir.

64
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,750
I am aware.
Keep your eyes on them.

65
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,000
[YOUDA]
Of course.

66
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,833
[laughs] Been so long
since I seen him, it has.

67
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,083
But he's not changed
one itty-bitty bit.

68
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,583
[CHU]
'Cept he's even stronger!

a brick shithouse!

[BOTH laughing]

71
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,916
[TOUYA]
That's all well and good,

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,416
but what will we do if Yomi
gives the order to attack?

73
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,833
[KURAMA]
I've been pondering that myself.

74
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,541
I did swear my allegiance...

75
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,041
...to Yomi.

76
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,458
And I would enjoy sparring
with Yusuke in his new state...

77
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,916
...but not to the death.

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,083
[KURAMA]
To be honest, I'm torn.

81
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,666
Which is why I want to know
what you all are thinking.

82
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,875
If it comes to that, whose side
will you be on: Yomi or Yusuke?

83
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,208
[ALL]
Yusuke!

84
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,916
[RINKU]
Do you even have to ask?!

85
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,000
[SHISHIWAKAMARU]
Undecided.

86
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,041
[SUZUKI]
I mean, Yusuke.

87
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,500
[KURAMA]
Thank you.

88
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,458
[JIN]
No sweats, pal.

89
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,625
[YOMI]
So, why have you come to see me?

90
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,041
And please, be direct.

91
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,208
I have neither time
nor patience to waste

92
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,125
beating around the bush.

93
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,875
Well, Raizen is dead now...

94
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,583
And you know, as the
new king on the block,

95
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,208
I thought it'd only be fair
for me to tell you in person

96
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,125
exactly how I'm gonna
rip you off ya throne.

97
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,458
Oh?

98
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,000
[KURAMA]
That's far too direct.

99
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,000
He's going to get
himself killed.

100
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,750
[YOMI] All right, then in the
interest of full disclosure,

101
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,041
allow me to show you
how I plan to stop you.

102
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,708
[KURAMA] Yomi is powering
himself up to take Yusuke out.

103
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,083
[ALL]
We have to do something!

104
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,291
[HIEI]
Fool!

105
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,125
You're playing right
into the enemy's hands.

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,708
Heh.

107
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,166
That's cool, but first,
I got something for ya...

108
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,250
We'll call it a gift.

109
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,458
[KURAMA]
A gift?

110
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,791
He couldn't be naive
enough to give Yomi a...

111
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,375
[YOMI] ...peace offering.
No, he's smarter than that.

112
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,958
It's a trap.

113
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,166
How thoughtful of you! Would
you mind unwrapping it, too?

114
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,041
I'm afraid I can't see things
as well as I used to.

115
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,541
Sure.

116
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,166
Now, they might scatter a bit,
so I hope you don't mind.

117
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,041
But that's our entire
national treasure!

118
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,041
All our Rurimaru stones!

119
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,958
Do you have any idea how
rare and valuable those are?

120
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,291
[YOMI]
So, this is a sincere offering.

121
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,375
He'll be easier to
crush than I thought.

122
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,458
I thank you Mr. Urameshi,
for this most generous of gifts.

123
00:08:55,541 --> 00:09:00,041
Ooh, I can tell this Rurimaru
stone is real by its touch.

124
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,125
But what is your true
purpose and offer?

125
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,500
[YOMI] There's something
carved in this stone.

126
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,666
It says "Mukuro."
And that one says "Kurama."

127
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,833
And "Touou."

128
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,750
"Hokushin."

129
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,208
"Hiei."

130
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,416
You engraved names in
all of these stones?

131
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,208
Yeah, well, I would've
just painted 'em on,

132
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,916
but I thought this way,
you could read 'em yourself.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,583
[gasps]

134
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,416
[screams]

135
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
You desecrated the treasure!

136
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,875
How could you do such a thing?!

137
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,458
[YUSUKE] Look, I'm not a
particularly bright guy.

138
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,083
And just because
I'm Raizen's heir

139
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,791
doesn't mean I'm
qualified to replace him.

140
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,791
So, maybe it's time
we found another way of

141
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,166
crowning the big
cheese around here.

142
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,833
Each of these has
the name of someone

143
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,250
from Demon World on them.

144
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,208
We'll all face off in
a big tournament,

145
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,916
representing not
kingdoms, but ourselves.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,958
[gasps]

147
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,333
And the one who
wins the tournament

148
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,000
will be the one to rule us all,

149
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,500
for a period of time, at least,

150
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,041
until the next tournament
when we all do it over again.

151
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,791
From what I understood
in social studies,

152
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,708
it's called "democracy," and
it's all the rage back home.

153
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,166
Except we'll cast our
votes with fists.

154
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,583
What do you say, big guy?

155
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,166
[YOMI] He would be willing
to surrender his own power?

156
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,250
He can't be serious.

157
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,708
Do you honestly
think that I or anyone else

158
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,833
will go along with this?!

159
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,208
[JIN]
Sign me up, so I say!

160
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,666
[laughs]

161
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,958
[YUSUKE]
What are you guys doin' here?

162
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,833
To see you, pal!

163
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,625
Jin! How ya doin' man?

164
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,875
--[CHU] Hey!
--[YUSUKE, JIN laugh]

165
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,666
--[CHU laughs]
--[YUSUKE] Chu! Are you sober?

166
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,583
[GROUP laughs]

167
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
I'm sorry, Yomi,
but from now on,

168
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,583
I represent only Kurama's side.

169
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,250
But if you don't go along
with this, I promise you...

170
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,666
None of us will hesitate to
take his side over yours.

171
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,250
Kurama... Not you...

172
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,625
[laughs] Yomi doesn't
know what hit him!

173
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,291
[MUKURO]
Hiei...

174
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,833
Spread the word.

175
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,958
From this point on, Mukuro
is just another apparition.

176
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,583
That sounds good to me.

177
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,791
[MUKURO]
Like the rest of the masses,

178
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,500
I'll be fighting for myself.

179
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,583
I accept Yusuke's terms.

180
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,916
[YOMI]
Damn you, Mukuro!

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,416
Fine...

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,791
I accept.

183
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,125
[NARRATOR] Less than a
day after Raizen's death,

184
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,833
word spread throughout
Demon World that his regime,

185
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,583
along with Mukuro's and
Yomi's, has been dismantled.

186
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,958
Control of the entire
land is now up for grabs

187
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,541
in a worldwide tournament.

188
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,791
[YOUDA] It is only a matter
of days now until he awakes.

189
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,916
[YOMI]
Mhm...

190
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,875
[YOUDA]
Your son, Lord Yomi...

191
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,416
Lord Shura.

192
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,416
I'll begin his intense training
regime as soon as he wakes.

193
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,250
Time is of the essence.

194
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,500
Check his energy
level again, Youda.

195
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,541
[YOUDA]
Yes.

196
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,833
It's up to 80,000
points now, sir,

197
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,291
and who knows how
high it will get

198
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,000
by the day of his emergence.

199
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,208
He's not just my son;
he's my ace.

200
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,083
Even if everyone in Demon World
competes in this tournament,

201
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,541
the final match will no doubt
come down to Mukuro and myself.

202
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,625
And that chaos-preaching tyrant
will be a tough opponent,

203
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,208
even for me.

204
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,708
However, if I can raise my son
up to my energy level in time,

205
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,291
then I'll be twice as
likely to defeat Mukuro,

206
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,458
and seize control of
the entire Demon World.

207
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,875
It seems Urameshi's plan may
turn out to be the best thing

208
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,041
that ever happened to me...

209
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,291
Right, Shura?

210
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,875
[YUSUKE]
Guys, lighten up, will you?

211
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,958
And stop looking at
me like that!

212
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,541
Raizen left me in charge,

213
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,666
and I did what I think is best
for every one of you out there!

214
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,916
[SEITEI] Nothing we can
say will change your mind...

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,125
But we're concerned
about your prospects...

216
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,583
For winning the tournament,

217
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,125
which is why the four of us
will fight on your behalf.

218
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,791
Have you guys not
heard a word I said?

219
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,708
This is going to be a battle
between individuals, not kings!

220
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,375
We are leveling
the playing field.

221
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,708
Do you honestly believe
that Yomi and Mukuro

222
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,000
have actually
abdicated their power?

223
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,000
[YUSUKE gasps]

224
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,375
[HOKUSHIN]
You can be certain that

225
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,750
they will be using every
advantage at their disposal.

226
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,833
That may be, but I'm
stickin' to my proposal.

227
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,833
And besides, I think Mukuro at
least is someone we can trust.

228
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,708
I mean, you were at
the conversation.

229
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,750
Sorry, but I will
never believe a word

230
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,291
that comes from that beast.

231
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,625
[MUKURO] It is truly a pleasure
to meet you, son of Raizen.

232
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,625
[MUKURO] Please place these
at Raizen's grave for me.

233
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,541
[MUKURO]
He was a great leader, like you.

234
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,833
But he died a fool.

235
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,500
In any case, we
shall try our best

236
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,625
to help you win this
tournament, Your Majesty.

237
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,625
And if that's what
we individuals want

238
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,250
then are we not complying with
your wishes for independence?

239
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,916
I don't want you to do this
just becase I want you to,

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,041
I want you to do what you want.

241
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,541
You know what I mean!

242
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,416
[KOKOU]
We're here!

243
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,291
[gasps]
It's an invading army!

244

--[footsteps]
--[GUARDS murmuring]

245
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,208
Just who the hell
or what are you?!

246
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,708
When we heard that
Raizen croaked,

247
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,833
we set out for this dump
as fast as we could

248
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,416
to pay our respects.

249
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
Hello, my name's Enki,

250
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,833
and this little firecracker's
my lovely wife, Kokou.

251
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,333
[HOKUSHIN]
And what exactly is the nature

252
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,666
of your relationship
to our late king?

253
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,750
Well, we used to be sparring
buddies back in the old days.

254
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,458
[gasps]

255
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,458
[ENKI] Sure we were strong,
but he was stronger.

256
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,791
I'll tell you,

257
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,541
if Mukuro and Yomi had
seen Raizen at his prime,

258
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,708
they would have
pissed their pants,

259
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,458
if you'll excuse my
colorful language!

260
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,541
That was until he went all ga-ga
for some cheap little whore

261
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,333
that he met up in Living World!

262
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,250
So, he comes back and dumps me
like I'm yesterday's garbage.

263
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,583
Got any clue how
insulting that is?!

264
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,583
Jeez! You smell like booze!

265
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,000
After he rejected me,

266
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,791
I didn't give a crap anymore,
so I married this lug.

267
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,041
But I don't care 'cause

268
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,375
I've been drinkin' ever
since and feel great!

269
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,916
[sighs]

270
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,708
Your loss, Raizen!

271
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,291
[ENKI]
Please...

272
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,791
Forgive my wife, she's
really not always like this.

273
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,458
[ENKI screams]

274
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,750
[ENKI]
Now be a good girl, sweetie.

275
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,250
[KOKOU]
You be a good girl!

276
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,750
[sobs]

277
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,541
Why?! Why have you
abandoned me twice now,

278
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,666
and this time for good?!

279
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,375
[sobs]

280
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,458
I loved you, Raizen!

281
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,541
You're the only man
I ever loved!

282
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,833
[sighs] And she promised
that she wasn't gonna cry...

283
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,666
You see, when Raizen
first told us

284
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,541
he was through eating
humans and fighting,

285
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,500
it went against
everything we stood for,

286
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,166
and we took it as an insult.

287
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,333
And so we left, and cut
off all ties with him.

288
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,541
[ENKI]
But after we parted,

289
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,250
we lost our passion
for fighting, too.

290
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,208
We've come to lead a
quiet and peaceful life.

291
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,416
I wish we'd have told him
that while he was still alive.

292
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,708
[ENKI]
It's funny.

293
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,000
We thought he'd lost his mind,

294
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,833
but maybe this was his
intention all along.

295
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,291
To change the way we lived,
through example.

296
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,916
[GROUP]
Hello!

297
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
This time I'm sure!
It's an invading army!

298
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,875
It certainly did take them
all long enough to get here.

299
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,250
An army of freaks!

300
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,125
Hope this is a social visit.

301
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,541
Do you know these guys?

302
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,666
Yeah, all of them used to
fight with Raizen as well.

303
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,583
So then, am I right to
say you're Raizen's son?

304
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,250
Something like that, why?

305
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,041
Oh, you know it's just that

306
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,125
you remind me so much of
him when he was younger.

307
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,875
[ENKI laughs]

308
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,791
[YUSUKE]
Hokushin...

309
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,000
[HOKUSHIN]
Yes?

310
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
I always thought Raizen
was just a bastard,

311
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,250
but I really didn't get
to know him at all.

312
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,666
There was more to him,

313
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,250
and now seen through their eyes,
I can't help but feel...

314
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,416
...proud... of my father.

315
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,916
I think, in a way, I can
finally call him that.

316
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,208
Right everyone, that's
enough grieving for one day,

317
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,750
don't you think? And besides...

318
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,416
I believe we all had another
reason for coming here today,

319
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,583
isn't that right?

320
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,333
[ENKI]
Ready?

321
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,458
Hey!

322
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,541
Raizen Junior!

323
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,125
[gasps]

324
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,000
Guess what, we're all gonna be
taking part in that tournament!

325
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,791
[gasps]

326
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,166
I'm warning you, though,
I'm not gonna go easy on you!

327
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,500
I don't care who you are,
I'll kick your ass!

328
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,041
And the same goes
for you, mister.

329
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,541
I'm not cutting you any slack!

330
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,291
I'd have it no other
way, my darling!

331
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,250
All's fair in love and war.

332
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,416
Let's make this tournament
so brutal and tough

333
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,166
that Raizen rolls over in
his grave in jealous rage,

334
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,791
what do you say?!

335
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,458
[GROUP]
Yeah!

336
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,000
Now, why don't we dust
off our rusty powers,

337
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,500
and see if we've still
got it like we used to?

338
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,083
[GROUP]
Yeah!

339
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,375
[ENKI]
And... go!

340
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:22,708
[ALL yelling]

341
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,375
[YUSUKE, HOKUSHIN gasp]

342
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,250
[YUSUKE yells]

343
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,833
[YUSUKE grunts]

344
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:38,875
[ALL yelling]

345
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,875
[YUSUKE gasps]

346
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,708
[ENKI yells]

347
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,083
Aww... Sweet! [laughs]

348
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,958
Now this... is getting good!

349
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,166
[MUKURO]
Quite impressive, isn't it?

350
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,208
A beaut! A real beaut!

351
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,625
Youda! What the
hell is going on?

352
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,250
A surge of power
from Raizen's region!

353
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,750
And it's a big one!

354
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,625
[YOUDA] The energy
level is off the charts!

355
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,583
[YOUDA yelps]

356
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,083
That's impossible!
Such displays.

357
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,750
Each one of their energy
levels, close to mine.

358
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,666
How could I have known?

359
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,125
The only Demons with such powers

360
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,000
have been in seclusion
for centuries.

361
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,458
Yet, I... feel invigorated.

362
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,791
[YOMI]
My warrior's spirit's returning.

363
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,666
But do I dare go into
this as an individual,

364
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,166
merely to prove myself?

365
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
[SOLDIER]
Lord Yomi!

366
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,333
What is it?

367
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,916
Quick! It's Lord Shura!

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,208
Is he hurt?

369
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,000
[SHURA laughing]

370
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,791
[YOMI]
My son,

371
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:13,000
you're experiencing the
same feelings I am.

372
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,416
[YOMI]
Youda.

373
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,625
Yes?

374
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,083
[YOMI] I'll no longer
need your services.

375
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,208
You're free to go.

376
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:19,916
[gasps]

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,750
You and I, we are now...

378
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,666
...considered as equals, Youda.

379
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,541
Does this mean that you'll be
playing by Mr. Urameshi's rules,

380
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,083
and fighting as an individual?

381
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,250
Yes, it does...

382
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,833
You may have just witnessed the
most foolish choice of my life.

383
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,458
[NARRATOR] Yusuke's unlikely
proposal has been embraced

384
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,375
by Yomi and Mukuro, preventing
a full-scale Demon war.

385
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,666
But the battle for control of
Demon World now begins.

386
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,416
Who will win the tournament
and attain complete power?

387
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:52,958
[CHU]
G'day mates!

388
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,541
Your ole pal, Chu, here.

389
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,541
And if you thought the
Dark Tournament was a blast,

390
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,208
wait'll you take a squizz
at Demon World's go at it!

391
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,125
It's so bloody fierce!

392
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,750
The first round will toss
49 gladiators together,

393
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,916
with only one codger
coming out on top,

394
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,791
while the others go home
to cry to their moms!

395
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,291
All your favorite fighters'll be
there, including yours truly!

396
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,208
Believe me, you're in for
one rip-snorter of a tourney

397
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,291
on the next Yu Yu Hakusho,

398
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,708
'cause the winner decides the
future of every bloke there is!
