[TOUYA] Do not get
too upset, Bakken.

158
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,708
He wants only a true
challenge in his battle.

159

[BAKKEN] I could care less.
Who's fighting them first?

160
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,250
[GAMA] Please.

161
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,708
The master of disguise will.

162
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,750
You're on!

163
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,500
What are you doing?

164
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,000
[KURAMA] You must leave
this one to me.

165
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,041
We're going to have to play this
round very carefully, Yusuke.

166
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,500
Let me fight them
as long as I can--

167
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,666
and ascertain their weaknesses.

168
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,541
You'll take over when I fall.

169
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,583
And it's Kurama versus
Gama! You may begin!

170
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,875
Tell me demon traitor,

171
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,083
what does the word
makeup bring to mind?

172
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,583
[GAMA]
Human females, no doubt.

173
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,666
A little gloss to
attract the next mate.

174
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,500
Disgusting isn't it?

175
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,708
The way humans
manage to bastardize

176

everything they touch.

177
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,875
Over centuries
the human influence

178
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,291
has infected the
Spirit World as well.

179
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,416
Now few demons even
know its original power.

180
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,708
Allow me to show you.

181
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,625
Now I haven't
seen that one before!

182
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,291
Gama's covered his body
with some sort of face paint!

183
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,375
And now his spirit
energy is going insane!

184
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,375
[KURAMA THINKS] His spirit
energy is strong,

185
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,666
but does not extend
far from his body.

186
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,125
Close combat is
clearly his strength.

187
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,666
Gama's decorations really
seem to boost his power!

188
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,250
Kurama can't even
squeeze in a counterattack!

189
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,125
[HIEI THINKS] You're playing
a dangerous game Kurama--

190
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,125
waiting to gauge the enemy's
weakness before you attack.

191
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,250
You could at
least draw your weapon.

192
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,541
I know all about you and
your plant concoctions, Kurama!

193
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,291
And I don't plan to
give you time to make them!

194
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,916
Let me demonstrate what I mean!

195
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,125
[KURAMA] If you
don't mind me asking,

196
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,375
what exactly have
you done to me?

197
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,291
Your leg feels like a giant
block of lead, doesn't it?

198
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,041
[KURAMA]
That smell.

199
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,666
Let me get this straight.

200
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,666
You can't move
any part of your body

201
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,541
that gets marked
up by that junk?

202
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,875
[Gama laughs]

203
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,708
Why try to fight the inevitable?

204
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,166
[GAMA] The Makeup of Death has
already marked you Kurama.

205
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,750
There's no hope for escape.

206
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,541
Kurama!

207
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
Gama's makeup seems
to take a reverse effect

208
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,125
when painted on his enemies!

209
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,041
And with Kurama
barely able to walk,

210
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,125
Gama is slowly
moving in like a tiger,

211
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,875
stalking his wounded prey!

212
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,541
Rip him apart!

213
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,750
[TOUYA] Kurama's
struggling is pointless.

214
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,166
The makeup seeps
through any clothing

215
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,750
and attaches to the skin.

216
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,666
Transmitting
Gama's spirit energy,

217
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,166
as if he were gripped
by Gama's own fist.

218
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,750
[GAMA]
The costume is completed.

219
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,625
The Makeup of Chains.

220
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,500
Go ahead--just
try to limp away now.

221
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,958
Kurama!
Get rid of the outfit!

222
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,500
Don't be naive.

223
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,541
Even if he had the strength to,
it wouldn't change a thing--

224
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:02,291
Nearly 2000 pounds of weight
is chained directly to his skin!

225
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:17,041
[Gama laughs maniacally]

226
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,250
Yes, that's better.
Finally accepting your fate.

227
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,916
Kurama's arms and legs
are completely useless!

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,791
He can do nothing but stand
and wait for his bloody demise!

229
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,458
Don't leave me
alone with these guys!

230
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,500
If he dies we're done for!

231
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,000
And now you die, demon traitor.

232
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,416
[KURAMA]
Rose whip!

[Gama cries out in pain]

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,750
But... The Makeup of Chains.

235
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,958
Only an amateur depends
on arms and legs for victory.

236
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,166
Way to go Kurama! One down!

237
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,333
An unbelievable 180,
people! Kurama has

238
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,666
somehow taken control
of this fight!

239
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,916
Damn you...

240
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,875
Don't take the
credit for this...

241
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,791
I've killed myself today,

242
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,041
by the mistake of not
sealing your energy as well.

243
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,583
Don't waste your breath
in conversation.

244
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,000
I know with the power
you're using to restrain me

245
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,708
you could easily
heal your injuries.

246
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,791
Release me and I will let
you walk away with your life.

247
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,958
Convincing, aren't you? 
But the battle isn't over yet.

248
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,625
Even with my
arms and legs bound,

249
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,541
you are in no shape to fight me.

250
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,291
Don't die pointlessly Gama.
You're too intelligent for that.

251

I... appreciate
your... confidence!

252

Don't move!
You'll bleed to death if

253
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,666
you keep trying to fight!

254
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,250
It's of no use. Be wise.

255

That was the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

die in vain. I cannot pity you.

What?

265
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,458
You never asked what
gave my makeup its power,

266
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,166
what made it different from
the makeup of those human fools.

267
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,333
The difference is
the main ingredient, Kurama.

268
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,166
It's made of my blood.

The Makeup of the Seal.
