00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,708
That was fast.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
What repulsive creature
makes my eardrums bleed?

161
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,041
Thanks, Hiei. I thought you
would come if we called.

162
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,708
I didn't know it was you.

163
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,250
I only came to find the source
of that vile noise...

164
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,416
...and kill it.

165
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,583
[KURAMA] Here.
You had better read this.

166
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,666
So, the detective's
been ensnared.

167
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,250
Wish I'd been around to see it.

168
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,541
Must have been too cocky
to realize his own weakness.

169
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,625
Just tell the kidnappers
I turned it down.

170
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,291
I'm finished babysitting.

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,166
You must be
curious, Hiei.

172
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,958
Someone strong enough
to overcome Yusuke

173
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,208
must surely provide a challenge.

174
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,458
Nice try...

175
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,791
...but I no longer care.

176
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,791
How can you even of
walking off, Hiei?

177
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,166
If you don't come,
Yusuke could be killed!

178
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,250
Not my responsibility.

179
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,458
You should have
learned by now

180
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,000
this is a kill
or be killed world.

181
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,625
If you're too weak
to help yourself,

182
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,875
you deserve to fall.

183
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,375
[KURAMA] Then what if stopping
these people now protected

184
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,416
your own interests?

185
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,500
The culprits are likely human,

186
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,833
and we both know what
powerful humans like to hunt.

187
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,291
If they're allowed
to kill Yusuke,

188
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,125
perhaps you will be next.

189
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,708
Fighting humans, that
nearly peaks my interest,

190
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,125
but not quite.

191
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,333
I wonder, Hiei...

192
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,250
How have you liked being
stuck on probation,

193
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,458
bolted down to
one human city?

194
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,250
What do you think?

195
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,333
Well, if you help bring
back Yusuke alive,

196
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,875
I'll have Koenma cut your
sentence to time served.

197
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,875
You'll be free.

198
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,541
You sure you
wanna do that?

199
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,416
There's no other choice.
We're almost out of time.

200
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,416
Make your call, Hiei.

201
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,041
Fighting humans
to win my freedom...

202
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,458
Yes, sounds like a deal.

203
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,250
[BOTAN] Then come on!
This is one house party

204
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,541
we can't be late to!

205
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,416
[KUWABARA] I'm gonna
kick so much tail!

206
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,541
[Laughing]

207
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,125
[KUWABARA]
Stop laughing, hamster-legs!

208
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,833
[KUWABARA] Is this the place?
Looks deformed.

209
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,708
[BOTAN] It's the only old
mansion on the block.

210
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,416
Well, stay here Botan.

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,666
Whatever this house is,

212
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,125
it's definitely not
safe for non-fighters.

213
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,333
That's sweet I guess,
but I'm going.

214
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,875
With Yusuke out and you missing
your Spirit Energy,

215
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,291
I'm the only one who can
use the detective tools.

216
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,375
She's right. Our strength
lies in numbers.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,958
Give a warning
next time!

218
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,625
The House of Four Dimensions...

219
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,916
Once entered, this do not:
Ever utter the word 'hot.'

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,208
Is it some kind of riddle?

221
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,750
No, it is a warning. There's
no way to know if it's real.

222
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,666
[KURAMA] But we might as
well take precaution.

223
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,250
[KUWABARA]
Right. Nobody say hot.

224
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,375
[BOTAN]
Shh!

225
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,833
Damn it.

226
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,750
[Kido chuckles]

227
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,458
Your friends have come
to visit you, Yusuke.

228
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,333
[YUSUKE] What are you
poser bastards up to?

229
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,333
How come I can't move?

230
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,083
And hell, why do your
doors look so stupid?

231
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,875
[KIDO] You've entered
my Territory.

232
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,125
Space and time follow
different rules.

233
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,791
See how I'm stepping
on your shadow?

234
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,791
Here, it's as binding
as a straightjacket.

235
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,958
Now try to relax.
Our night's about to begin.

236
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,916
Well, that's odd.

237
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,791
What is this place?

238
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,291
It looks all twisted up.

239
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,541
And that steam. It's
like an oven it's so ho...

240
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
Remember the word
we're not saying.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,458
[HIEI] Kurama...

242
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,916
Did you feel that?

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,875
Yes, when we entered the
energy schematic changed.

244
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,291
It feels as though we've
somehow been transported

245
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,250
to a different space.

246
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,333
[VOICE] Or a different
space-time.

247
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,250
Welcome to the house, everyone.
I'm so glad you made it.

248
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,333
Yeah, that's him, one of
the guys Urameshi left with.

249
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,083
[chuckle]

250
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,625
Recognition. I just
love how that feels.

251
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,375
Listen, dork. I don't
know who you think you are,

252
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,333
but we're no
normal school kids.

253
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,916
His name is Kaitou.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,541
Hold on, how on earth
do you know that?

255
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,583
He is a classmate.

256
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,250
All of his test scores
are second only to mine.

257
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,833
Remarkably bright for his age,

258
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,583
I've never spoken
to him personally,

259
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,375
and naturally I never
told him about you.

260
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,916
Kaitou!

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Where have you gotten
your information?

262
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,083
And why have you
kidnapped Yusuke?

263
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,833
[Kaitou chuckles]

264
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,708
It's a real grip-your-seat
mystery, isn't it.

265
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,708
I hear your team won something
called the Dark Tournament,

266
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,083
and I hear that's quite a feat.

267
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,833
My congratulations.

268
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,458
[KAITOU] Really, I was most
surprised about you, Suichi.

269
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,958
Try to put yourself
in my shoes.

270
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,166
Learning my school rival

271
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,500
can also do the funniest
things with plants.

272
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,583
[KAITOU] Ooh. 
That's a scary look...

273
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,250
I don't remember
you ever making

274
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,250
that face in
the classroom.

275
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,916
Then again, we both keep
things from our peers.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,625
You see, I've learned
that I have a talent, too.

277
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,750
And being such great
champions as you are,

278
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,458
I was hoping I could
test them out on you.

279
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,458
Okay, this is ridiculous!

280
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,291
We've been through stuff you
couldn't even dream about!

281
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,458
[HIEI]
I'll take him.

282
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,291
You'll agree my impatience for
human fools will be an asset.

283
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:36,791
Now!

284
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,708
[KAITOU] 
You'll be sorry.

285
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,750
I doubt that!

286
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,583
[Laughing]

287
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,291
[KAITOU] 
Never doubt.

288
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,375
How the heck did
he just do that?

289
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,916
Energy came right out of
nowhere, it looked weird!

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,791
As you see, this is
a very special room,

291
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,458
where brute strength
cannot exist.

292
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,000
[KAITOU] Only your
words have power here.

293
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,625
Just make sure you
follow my one posted rule.

294
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,333
What's he saying?

295
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,625
He must mean the
note on the door.

296
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,250
Indeed.

297
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,375
As a child,
playing pretend,

298
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,833
I would make my own
world with my own rules.

299
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,666
But I've learned I
can do it for real.

300
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,291
Growing up as a bookworm,

301
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:28,458
I guess it was inevitable what
I would decide to rule out...

302
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,375
...violence.

303
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
[Growl]

304
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,000
[KAITOU] I see why that
disturbs you, Hiei.

305
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,458
In the world of fighting,

306
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,125
your skills let you
bully anybody you want.

307
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,125
But in my Territory,
you're just a tiny,

308
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,875
swordless man.

309
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,166
Control your temper, Hiei.

310
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,958
He wants you to act
out of anger.

311
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,416
Any buffoon can
make a shield.

312
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,708
How do we know your other
claim isn't just a bluff?

313
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,833
There's only one way.

314
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,666
No three-letter word
can rule my fate.

315
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,083
[HIEI]
Hot!

316
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,250
[KURAMA] Fight it,
Hiei. Try!

317
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,375
[KAITOU] I told
him not to doubt me.

318
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,208
But, that's what happens when
you say the taboo word.

319
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,166
Your soul becomes
part of my Territory.

320
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,583
Wake him up!

321
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,541
He's ice cold!

322
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,416
Oh dear.

323
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,208
[KAITOU] 
You lose a point.

324
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,041
Now we've taken
two hostages,

325
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,166
Urameshi's having
his fun upstairs.

326
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,250
So, what's
your next move?

327
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,166
[KAITOU]  Go home? Or play
through the round?

328
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,208
[KAITOU] 
It's a kick, your lifestyle.

329
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,500
The secrets. Dueling opponents
with special powers.

330
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,000
I only started last month,
but I've worked hard.

331
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
My first challenge was learning
how to control my power.

332
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,291
The guys and I call it
manifesting our Territory.

333
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,833
So far, I've gotten to a
ten meter radius around me.

334
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,291
As long as I concentrate,

335
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,333
everything inside it has to
follow the rules I've set.

336
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,791
Imagination turned
to physical law.

337
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,416
So, by that logic,
if we incapacitate you,

338
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,291
the rules will cease and Hiei's
soul will return to his body.

339
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,083
[KAITOU] 
I don't know. Maybe.

340
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,333
No one's beaten me yet
so it hasn't come up.

341
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,958
That's it!

342
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,250
I can't take anymore of this
rookie and his ego trip!

343
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,666
How do you stand these
friends of yours, Suichi?

344
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,833
They can't handle one
smart conversation.

345
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,875
It must get lonely.

346
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,958
Still, you haven't chosen.

347
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,250
Will you challenge me,
or go home?

348
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,416
Wait, you're forgettin'
the third option.

349
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,333
Really? I'm drawing a blank,
what do you mean?

350
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,708
We forget about Hiei
for now and move on.

351
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,166
That's my vote!

352
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,958
I never expected to hear
that from you, Kuwabara!

353
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,041
Hiei's your teammate!

354
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,375
It's his own code!

355
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,416
Right? You had to bribe
him to help Urameshi

356
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,541
'cause he said weak
men deserve to fall.

357
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,583
Then he turns around and says
the wrong thing on purpose,

358
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,291
just to be cool!

359
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,333
Let's save him
after we're through!

360
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,250
That'll teach
him a lesson!

361
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,375
[KAITOU] You have
a brain, after all.

362
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,083
[KAITOU] Of course it's not
a very good one.

363
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,458
That option isn't valid.

364
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,291
Why not? You can't
hold us back!

365
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,333
[KAITOU] 
No.

366
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,416
But you can't get
through a doorway

367
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,291
if you don't have
the proper key.

368
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,458
You mean Urameshi's
in there?

369
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,666
[Yanagisawa chuckles]

370
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,083
[KAITOU] Let's just say that
door is your first step.

371
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,750
But Yanagisawa
has the only key.

372
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,125
Now this is I can handle.

373
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,833
All right, Mr. Hairspray,

374
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,333
hand over the key while
I'm askin' ya nicely.

375
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,041
No dice.

376
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,500
Listen, I'll give you
one more shot

377
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,625
just in case you
don't know who I am.

378
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,666
Give me the dumb key!

379
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,916
All right!

380
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,958
Why don't you come knock
me out and take it man?

381
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,458
Come on, or did you lose
your strength, too?

382
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,375
You little...

383
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,000
Shut your hole!

384
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,250
You gotta get a
better memory.

385
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,416
We're still inside
of Kaitou's Territory,

386
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,041
and you know he
doesn't like violence.

387
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,708
We gotta be gentle
with each other, okay?

388
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,166
[KUWABARA] How 'bout I gently
shove my foot down your throat?

389
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
So, you finally decide?

390
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,333
I'll play by your rules
Kaitou, whatever they are.

391
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,458
Good.

392
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,875
[NARRATOR] And so,
the trap has been laid.

393
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,291
To get the key and go
deeper within the house,

394
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,958
to rescue Hiei's captured soul,

395
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,333
and to free Yusuke who
is bound by his own shadow,

396
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,500
Kurama must answer

397
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,250
his brilliant
schoolmate's challenge,

398
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,375
and take part in a
mysterious battle of words.

399
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,500
But what exactly
does that mean?

400
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,500
What grand scheme do these
strangely powered teenagers

401
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,583
have in mind,

402
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,583
and what other oddities
await our team

403
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,041
in the House of
Four Dimensions?

404
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,708
[YUUSKE] Yeah, yeah,
what I think

405
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,083
we're trying to
say here is...

406
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,000
...what the hell is going on
in this freaky house!

407
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,708
Freckly four-eyes over there
is definitely got a thing

408
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,375
for turning souls
into bouncy balls,

409
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,125
as Kuwabara gets the
statue-treatment too.

410
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,458
I don't know what game
Kurama's got to play here,

411
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,750
but he better be good at it,

412
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,333
cause his smarts are the
only way to save us all.

413
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,166
Not to mention that
being paralyzed

414
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,041
is really pissing me off.

415
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:20,666
It's a battle of minds,
next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
