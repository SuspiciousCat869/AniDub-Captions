00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,291
[NARRATOR]
At the stronghold of Lord Yomi,

2
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,958
Kurama has been faced
with his dark past.

3
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,083
One thousand years ago,
he lived as a pitiless bandit,

4
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,333
with Yomi his second in command.

5
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,708
But when Yomi's reckless actions
threatened their success,

6
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,041
Kurama betrayed him,

7
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,250
hiring an assassin who
robbed Yomi of his sight.

8
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,708
Yomi has discovered the truth,

9
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,208
and now forces Kurama
to serve as his advisor.

10
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:02,666
Because if he doesn't, Yomi
will destroy his human family.

11
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,541
[thunder crashing]

12
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,791
They're still at it.

13
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,041
Any leads?

14
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,208
No. They seem
to talk of nothing.

15
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,833
It's how they speak--
between the lines.

16
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,791
Hardly the warrior's way.

17
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,625
I know one thing--

18
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,208
Lord Yomi certainly
values his opinions.

19
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
Apparently they
were friends ages ago.

20
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,458
He treats his words like gold...

21
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,333
And mine like copper.

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,125
A shame.

23
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,333
For your sake,

24
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,666
I hope you're thinking
during that silence.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,958
I have devised a plan
to make you stronger, Yomi.

26
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,583
Oh?

27
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,291
There are six powerful Demons

28
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,250
that I encountered in
a previous tournament.

29
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,083
I'd like time to go recruit
and train them for you.

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,000
On the surface,
it seems you've acquired

31
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,166
the ability to make friends now.

32
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,083
But they're just tools
to further your goals.

33
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,916
You don't care about them.

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,791
Your care for
your family is tougher.

35
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,625
What do they give you?

36
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,125
[laughing]

37
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,958
Allow me to return home
and tend to family affairs,

38
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,041
and in exchange I will
bring you these fighters.

39
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm sure you'll be
watching me, anyway.

40
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,416
Of course...
I have to protect...

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,333
...my investment.

42
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,000
All right, Suichi,
give me your test.

43
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,791
It's time for me to brag.

44
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,416
Hmm... So many mistakes.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,708
Your equations
are off-balance...

46
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,458
I smell metaphor.

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,916
Could be.

48
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,541
So tell me,
what's the scoop?

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,333
Are you guys in another
struggle to save the world?

50
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,541
Which world?

51
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,833
Come on, you know what I mean.

52
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,000
Who's the bad guy
you're up against?

53
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,333
Each other.

54
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,083
Yusuke and Hiei are
already on opposing sides.

55
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,750
Say what?!

56
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,750
And which side are you on?

57
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,458
Neither.

58
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,166
Well obviously,
I'm not clear on the facts.

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,208
But if you need help,
I'll be right here.

60
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,833
[KURAMA] A noble offer,
but one I could not accept.

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,208
This is a Demon war,
where humans should not tread...

62
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,750
A fact that leads me down a
spiral of troubling thoughts.

63
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,708
[KURAMA] For years,
I have lived two lives:

64
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,500
Suichi Minamono,
the normal human teenager.

65
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:55,000
And Kurama, a fighter helping
to protect what is good.

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:59,458
But in recent times, a third
identity has reemerged...

67
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,125
Yoko, the bearer
of my dark past,

68
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,708
a figure who survives
on bloodthirst

69
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,583
and brutal instinct.

70
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,875
I cannot juggle them all.

71
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,166
But which one will I lose?

72
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,541
Hey, Suichi...
Where did you go?

73
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,750
[KURAMA]
Kokoda. Don't stray too far.

74
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,791
Oh hey, there you are.

75
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,791
You left. Is something wrong?

76
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,041
No, I'm just
staring at the moon.

77
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,083
[KURAMA]
My new step-brother, Kokoda,

78
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,541
the son of the man
my mother married...

79
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,333
In a short time,
he's come to depend on me.

80
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,166
[pager beeping]

81
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,291
Let me guess...

82
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,333
It's your girlfriend.

83
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,541
No, it's just my stepbrother.

84
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,166
Odd though, he should
be in school now.

85
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,916
Pranking from the
lunchroom payphone, no doubt.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
Understood.
I'll be right there.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,041
Hey bro, thanks for meeting me.

88
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,208
Come on, why are you
looking so serious?

89
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,875
I figured you'd
be happy to see me.

90
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,250
Not only should
you be in school now,

91
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,416
you've never
called me "bro" before.

92
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,791
Ah, relax, let's just
go somewhere private

93
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,791
where we can talk.
Trade some advice.

94
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,250
I mean, that is your specialty.

95
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,875
[KOKODA] Your friend
Hiei keeps getting stronger.

96
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,000
Mukuro's officially made
him second in command.

97
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,666
I was aware.

98
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,833
Urameshi is training
like a dog, too.

99
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,291
He'll be sure to take over
once Raizen dies.

100
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,125
Now do you really want
to fight your friends?

101
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,333
Say what you will,

102
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,958
but I won't let you
spoil this boy's lungs.

103
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,875
Now come, I want to see
who I'm talking to.

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,250
Now before you
try getting violent,

105
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,750
you should know the
nature of my power.

106
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,250
As long as I'm still
connected to my host's body,

107
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,750
if I die, then so will they.

108
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,333
A Parasite Demon...

109
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,375
Did Yomi put you up
to this cowardly act?

110
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,208
Is this his way
of watching over me,

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,875
so I'll be certain
to fulfill my duties?

112
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,833
[chuckling]

113
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,791
Actually, Chief Shachi
is who I'm working for.

114
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,500
He wants to make sure you
stay home and never come back.

115
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,250
And you think you
have control over me...

116
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:35,333
Since as you said, if I kill
you now, my brother dies.

117
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,458
But I have methods to make your
life so utterly meaningless

118
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,583
you'll crawl out on your own...

119
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,208
And then beg me for your death.

120
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,750
Okay, yes, I believe you!

121
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,791
Now don't do anything rash--
No need to kill me.

122
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,083
Forget Shachi!

123
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,291
[PARASITE DEMON]
Let's face it, I'm a parasite!

124
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,666
Jumping from one master's back
to another is what I do.

125
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,916
Truth is, I lied.
I'm playing two sides!

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,458
Yomi sent me here. You wouldn't
kill his aide, right?

127
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,375
And he wants to know about
those six fighters.

128
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,375
Yes... It's all in the works,

129
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,083
and though I don't
exactly trust Yomi,

130
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,583
I'll bring them to his side.

131
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,208
Oh? Is that wise?

132
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,541
Not that I'm
calling you unwise!

133
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,250
Look, yes!
Let's work something out!

134
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
I can do lots of things!

135
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
You need intelligence?
Protection?

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,416
You're lucky, Demon.

137
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,625
I do have a use for you.

138
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,291
Sure... They're here.

139
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,500
Has all of the
training been going well?

140
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,541
Yes, but I don't
think it's enough...

141
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,583
Hell, I doubt Yusuke's
strength is enough.

142
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,791
[KOENMA]
Yo.

143
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,083
[KURAMA]
Koenma? You're--

144
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,541
[KOENMA]
Back in my robes, yeah.

145
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,625
My dad decided this
Demon World business

146
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,583
was more important than
his grudge against me.

147
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,500
[KOENMA] Sometimes I think
he planned it all--

148
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,291
That even my disobedience
was part of it.

149
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,875
[KOENMA]
So what's your plan?

150
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,125
This could turn
into a war, you know.

151
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,916
If what you mean to ask
is why am I involved...

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,125
I want to make sure the result
isn't bad for Living World.

153
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,333
[KOENMA]
I believe that's part of it,

154
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,833
but I doubt you plan
to come out of this

155
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,333
as Demon World's new king.

156
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
And I know the
threat on your family,

157
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,166
but you could get around that.

158
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,833
There's more.

159
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,000
When Raizen dies,

160
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,708
the power balance
will fly out of control,

161
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,250
and the outcome
will be crucial.

162
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,833
[KOENMA]
Kurama.

163
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,166
I need you to tell me that your
motivations aren't personal.

164
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,875
I can't do that.

165
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,625
Ask Hiei or Yusuke
if it's personal.

166
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,583
I don't have to.

167
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,166
I know you're all fighting
for some inner need.

168
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,625
But the stakes
are too high for that.

169
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,958
If Mukuro takes over, we'll have
more chaos than ever before...

170
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,291
[KURAMA]
And if it's Yomi,

171
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,375
there could be a unity
that's just as dangerous.

172
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,166
[KOENMA]
Whatever does happen there,

173
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,500
how it's resolved will affect
all three worlds for centuries.

174
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,875
When you're making
your decisions,

175
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,125
just try to
keep that in mind.

176
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,791
'Bout time, piker.

177
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,208
Chu. In high spirits as always.

178
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,500
[CHU laughing]

179
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,583
Very funny, mate.

180
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,958
Why don't you
take a real hard look

181
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,791
at these muscles
I been working up.

182
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,375
Urameshi and I will have
one rage of blue this time...

183
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,833
I guarantee it.

184
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,791
Yeah. It'd be pretty awesome
to throw down with Yusuke.

185
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,250
We've fought against
all sorts of baddie biggies

186
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,500
being Shinobi and all,
so I see it as nothing new...

187
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,750
But it's to chance
the run with Yusuke

188
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,291
that brings me back 'round.

189
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,833
Well said, Jin.

190
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,541
Not only do we
believe in this cause,

191
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,250
we're anxious for good battle.

192
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,250
Since my embarrassing loss
against the old witch,

193
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,458
I have been craving a
reason to start fighting

194
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
and feel beautiful again.

195
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,458
Good.

196
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,666
Maybe you'll stop asking
me to call you pretty.

197
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,333
Not all of us have groupies
to pad our self-esteem, Shishi.

198
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,791
[SHISHI chuckles]
So true.

199
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,125
[KURAMA]
A slew of motivations,

200
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,875
but the result
should be the same.

201
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,333
We'll fight hard to protect
the balance of all three worlds.

202
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,000
[ALL]
Yeah!

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just six months left...

204
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,916
Easy now...

205
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,041
No goin' home...

206
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,583
...till I can toe
the line on the terp.

207
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,666
[CHU]
All right...

208
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,250
What's that you say?
Eighty creeps at once?

209
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,958
Yeah, that does sound tough.

210
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,166
[laughing]

211
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,625
Guess I'll have
to use these, then!

212
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,416
I'll start with
something simple...

213
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,583
[yelling]

214
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,833
[yelling]

215
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,500
What's that? Not enough?

216
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,375
Then how 'bout the kicker?

217
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,166
[RINKU]
Serpent Yo-Yo... Kick!

218
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,833
Yeah, I'll be signing
autographs after the show.

219
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,708
[GENKAI] That'd be great if you
were just fighting rocks, Rinku,

220
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,750
but you're going
into a warzone.

221
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,291
You all have to get tougher
if you plan to live.

222
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,416
[ALL]
Right!

223
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,416
Yes, Shachi?

224
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,375
My lord,
I feel obligated to speak.

225
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,458
I have dependable information

226
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,791
that Kurama doesn't
plan to return.

227
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,375
I know you
trust him, my lord,

228
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,125
but we have to ask ourselves--
What's best for this country?

229
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,916
Can we postpone
our plans any longer

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,333
in lieu of six fighters
that may not even exist?

231
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,458
[growls]
Military prudence, my lord.

232
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,625
Steady acquisitions--

233
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,125
That's how you've
carved out your power,

234
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,083
so why change that now?

235
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,916
We have to stay the course--

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,166
Continue what's
worked for centuries!

237
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,291
Not gamble it all on
the whims of an outsider!

238
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,625
Shachi...

239
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,416
Your devotion to our
nation's army is unrivaled.

240
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,541
There's no question about that.

241
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,083
The best compliment a
warrior can hope to receive.

242
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,416
But I need you to put
your devotion on hold.

243
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,791
Your army is of
no more interest to me.

244
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,750
[SHACHI]
Kurama...

245
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,583
You better pray
you don't come back.

246
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, one hundred
and twenty thousand.

247
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,291
[gasps]

248
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,375
I never would
have believed it...

249
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,083
Six fighters for us,
all with energy levels

250
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,625
of a hundred and twenty
thousand or higher!

251
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,333
That can't be!

252
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,541
[YOUDA] You've said you
spent some time on them.

253
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,958
But these levels
are rare feats--

254
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,791
How did you get them
all so strong?

255
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,666
Just good nutrition
and the proper exercise.

256
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,416
Nothing special.

257
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,875
Funny.

258
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,708
Why don't you say the real
trainin' she put us through!

259
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,958
Yeah, like the four
weeks locked in that cave!

260
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,666
Or balancing on spikes.

261
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,916
Or bein' buried alive
with the snakes and things!

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,583
Hmph! Hag didn't let me
shower for months.

263
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:23,041
Excellent work.
You've done as promised.

264
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,583
And so...

265
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,041
In return, I'd like to make
you my new second in command,

266
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,541
if you'll accept it.

267
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,833
Sure.

268
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,833
But...

269
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,541
Lord Yomi,
should you be so rash?

270
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,458
We don't know if we
can trust these six.

271
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,208
Where their loyalties lie...

272
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,166
That is enough from you.

273
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,916
What have you done these
past five hundred years

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,916
to further my power, Shachi?

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,833
But... our army!

276
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,583
It is true, Shachi,
by the numbers

277
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,916
you are the second strongest
fighter we have on our side.

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,958
But in brains and leadership,
you are weak.

279
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,166
[SHACHI]
What do you know?!

280
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
You speak of the
army you've maintained,

281
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,250
but what good's it done?

282
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,041
Can you name one soldier
with energy levels

283
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,416
even close to a
hundred thousand?

284
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,625
[YOUDA] There is a
dark time ahead of us.

285
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,958
A great war for power,

286
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,958
where any edge we get
could mean the difference

287
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,875
between order and bowing
to Mukuro's chaos.

288
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,750
In his short time here,
Kurama has brought six fighters

289
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,291
stronger than your
entire army combined,

290
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,125
yet you can't even
give him praise?

291
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,916
Youda, your point is heard.

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,375
Now please, draw up the papers

293
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,166
to make this change
of power official.

294
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,666
What matters here is that
our path to unification

295
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,583
can live another day.

296
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,166
[growling]

297
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,416
[SHACHI]
You worm!

298
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,791
You scrawny, conniving worm!

299
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,958
[SHACHI] Let's see your
real qualifications.

300
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,208
[SHACHI]
Eight thousand?

301
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,625
That's it?

302
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,875
And Yomi wants to put this
piddling maggot in charge?

303
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,916
I have to save this country
from falling apart!

304
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,375
Shachi... No more hiding.

305
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,083
Let's settle this.

306
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,041
[KURAMA]
Be wise...

307
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,291
A blade can't undo
what has passed.

308
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,083
And that's what
your kind never gets...

309
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Blades can undo anything.

310
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,625
What Youda said is correct.

311
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,416
Dark times approach.

312
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,833
I cannot waste effort
on your personal feelings.

313
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,083
I have acted solely
on what I think is right.

314
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,000
And my moves have been precise.

315
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,708
The only thing you can influence
now is the time of your death.

316
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,791
You're wrong again.

317
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,208
It's Shachi--
Are you getting this?

318
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,416
Of course, sir.
I hear you loud and clear.

319
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,875
[laughs]
Excellent.

320
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,958
I want you to kill that boy
you've commandeered.

321
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,375
[PARASITE DEMON] Sorry, sir,
but that I do not hear.

322
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,791
I do not serve you any longer.

323
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,291
[SHACHI]
What?!

324
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,958
[PARASITE DEMON]
Truth is, I haven't for months.

325
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,500
The information I've relayed
were lies to keep you busy.

326
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,416
Kurama is my master now.

327
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,958
You sniveling traitor!

328
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,416
After all those years
I protected you!

329
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,750
You should've known not to trust
a Parasite Demon's loyalty.

330
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,625
We've both played our cards
and my hand was stronger.

331
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,583
Now leave and let me
do what must be done.

332
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,208
Excellent work...

333
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,791
My new second in command.

334
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll put your
head on a stick!

335
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,375
[SHACHI yelling]

336
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,166
[SHACHI]
Your power's nothing to mine!

337
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,250
You don't stand a chance
with that human stink on you!

338
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:30,541
[growling]

339
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,250
What's this?

340
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,500
[yelling]

341
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,791
Time to find a
new dummy to leech on.

342
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,208
[PARASITE DEMON laughing]

343
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,625
What a dream...

344
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,500
Your power... how?

345
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,166
Fool! You should
have known your enemy.

346
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,333
Welcome, Yoko.

347
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,958
It's high time you took
control of him... for good.

348
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,166
[NARRATOR]
In the stronghold of Lord Yomi,

349
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,416
Kurama has cemented
his rank as second in command.

350
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,625
But is his old ally correct?

351
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,708
In Kurama's war of identities,

352
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,875
will Yoko be the one
to take control?

353
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,375
[YUSUKE] Well, I hope
you enjoyed Kurama hour,

354
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,625
cause it's time to swing
that spotlight back on me.

355
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,208
You know I always thought it
sucked not having a dad around,

356
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,791
but maybe I was better off.

357
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,833
I never had frothing
teeth lunging at my throat.

358
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,291
Of course, Raizen's
not my dad, exactly.

359
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,708
He's my ancestor,
which has to make me wonder...

360
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,375
Who was my ancestral mom?

361
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,166
And why the hell
would she have a kid

362
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,208
with someone who
looked like that?

363
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,833
The answers are coming,
with the origin of me,

364
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,750
next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
