All four of you combined
can't stop it...

I won't have any elitist

Ha! Then I'd say we have

Why can't I use my powers??

The psychics have

Don't count me out yet.

or understand why they
vanished in the first place.

And my best friends since way
back are drowning in a monster,

Guts like steel,
