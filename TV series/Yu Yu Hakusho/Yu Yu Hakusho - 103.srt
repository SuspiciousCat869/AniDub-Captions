[NARRATOR]
It's been nearly a year since

2
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,541
Yusuke, Hiei, and Kurama
arrived in Demon World.

3
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,791
And they have each
become firmly enmeshed

4
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,750
in its tense power struggle.

5
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,791
Hiei impressed Mukuro with
his fighting rage so much

6
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,291
that he's become her
second-in-command.

7
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,500
Kurama rejoined his former
partner in crime, Yomi,

8
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,791
who likewise, asked Kurama to
join his cause as top advisor.

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,416
Meanwhile, Yusuke has
continued to train to

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000
fulfill his vow to kill
his ancestral father,

11
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,166
the third ruler of
Demon World, Raizen.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,750
Now, the three former teammates

13
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,416
are in high positions
on conflicting sides,

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,083

an inevitable clash.

you're the same boy

throws a punch at ya, man.

I mean, with your head
so far from your body,

you leave everything from
the neck down open to attack.

You are one of the few

who has discovered that
vulnerability of mine, heh.

Even you never discovered
that about me, Seitei.

[YUSUKE]
Sorry to kick ass and run, guys,

Yeah, but that was last month!

[RAIZEN] It's been nearly
seven hundred years now.

115
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,375
The Living World was a
very different place.

Chaos and disorder reigned,

and people everywhere
lived in constant fear.

This was before
the first barrier

between the Demon
and Living Worlds,

120

and our two kinds
lived side by side.

121
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,958
It was a grand time
to be a Demon,

122
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,875
though I imagine it was a
bit rougher for the humans.

123
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,750
We terrorized them, and yet
their feudal lords were not

124
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,958
above calling upon us
to defend their lands

from the invading horde
of their own enemies.

126
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,666
[RAIZEN] I didn't care
which side a person was on.

127
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,000
They were all food to me.

128
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,791
They didn't like that very much.

But all that changed one night

she was just like the rest
of them--pale and weak.

133
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,791
Yet there was something
different about her, special.

134
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,125
Her eyes and the way
they looked at me...

135
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,875
I could see my downfall in
those eyes, but I didn't care.

00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,333

This was before modern medicine.

They would ingest deadly
poisons and contagions,

turning their own
blood into vaccines.

were quite effective,

00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,125
She had left herself
totally vulnerable.

her at any moment.

could devour her, when...

165
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,875
[WOMAN] Well, are you
going to eat me or not?

166
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,125
Allow me...

167
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,875
I have toxins coursing
through my veins.

168
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,291
One bite, and your insides
will be corroded by dawn.

169
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,708
Just act now, whatever you
decide; I don't like to wait.

170
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,500
[WOMAN]
Even a savage beast like you

171
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,208
can't handle what's
inside this body of mine.

172
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:35,583
But if you don't believe me,
come on, try, at your own peril.

173
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,083
[RAIZEN]
I couldn't move.

174
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,833
I was mesmerized by this defiant
woman standing before me.

175
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,083
[chuckles] I guess
you're not monster enough.

176
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,791
[WOMAN] You could...
always just kill me.

177
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,291
Come on...

178
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,583
You can at least do
that much, can't you?

179
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,458
Of course, once my
blood's been spilt,

180
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,958
do you honestly believe you can

181
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,791
resist taking one
taste of my poison?

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,166
So, what'd you do?

183
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,291
We made love.

184
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,208
Huh?

185
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:15,041
[laughs]

186
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,541
I had no other choice.
What could I do?

187
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,375
I told you before;
it was her eyes.

188
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,708
Not to mention, she was
the most beautiful creature

189
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,916
I'd ever laid mine on.

190
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,625
Then a few dozen
generations later,

191
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,333
I just rolled down the tube?

192
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,208
Yes, it was something like that.

193
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
How I loved her...

194
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,750
It was one magnificent night.

195
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,625
I can still feel the touch
of her skin against mine,

196
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,083
as our bodies melded
in perfect harmony.

197
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,041
Or how her fingers felt,
stroking through my hair.

198
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,208
Or the warm feeling of being
held in her tight embrace

199
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,500
through the night...

200
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,041
But in the morning, I realized
I wasn't worthy of her.

201
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,708
She had devoted her
life to saving people,

202
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,791
while mine had been
spent destroying them.

203
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,625
So I left, and I vowed never
to eat another human being

204
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,291
until I saw her again.

205
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,750
[RAIZEN] But I was
never to see her again.

206
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,625
[RAIZEN] She died soon
after, in childbirth.

207
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,250
We, the Mazoku,
lead very long lives.

208
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,291
I'd hoped that the time
would allow me to find her

209
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,666
in some reincarnated form.

210
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,833
That hope was the only
thing that kept me going.

211
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,208
But I should've known better.

212
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,000
She was far too enlightened
to return to this world.

213
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,166
[RAIZEN] And so, I haven't
eaten a human since that day.

214
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,041
In fact it has brought
me closer to her,

215
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,541
if only in that it has brought
me closer to mortality.

216
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
And who knows, maybe when
my time has come to an end,

217
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,791
the two of us can
finally be together...

218
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,208
...in the next world.

219
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,333
[RAIZEN]
Yusuke, my son...

220
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,958
Have you ever been in love?

221
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,250
Yeah, I guess.

222
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,458
Really?

223
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,208
Then you understand why
I made my sacrifice.

224
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,291
[RAIZEN] There's more
that you need to know

225
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,125
about the situation
here in Demon World

226
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,791
that I haven't told you yet.

227
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,333
[RAIZEN]
The relationships are complex.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,500
[RAIZEN]
In the past,

229
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,333
I fought with Mukuro and Yomi
merely for the sake of fighting.

230
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,333
But things have changed.

231
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,500
You could get along with Mukuro.

232
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,541
He's a traditionalist,
an isolationist who

233
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,416
likes Demon World just
as it is--divided.

234
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,291
Mukuro won't bother with
the Living or Spirit Worlds.

235
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
But beware of Yomi.

236
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,875
He speaks of unification,

237
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,208
but it's a front
for moving his army.

238
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,583
He'll take over
Living and Spirit World.

239
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,041
Side with Mukuro.

240
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,750
I don't get it. Why are you
telling me all this now?

241
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,166
Because this is
your inheritance...

242
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,625
...and your duty.

243
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,208
Shut up! You can't die yet.
It's not your time to go!

244
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,708
[RAIZEN sighs]

245
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
Lead them well, son.

246
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,208
[gasps]

247
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,125
Urameshi?!

248
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,958
[SEITEI]
Where's our king?

249
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,125
[TOUOU] What was that
explosion all about?

250
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,000
[HOKUSHIN] Master Urameshi,
where is King Raizen?

251
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,583
He's dead.

252
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,750
[gasps]

253
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,708
[GUARDS murmuring]

254
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,333
[GUARD 1]
The king is dead!

255
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,708
[GUARD 2]
Long live the king!

256
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,583
[YUSUKE] Hokushin, I need
you to take me somewhere.

257
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,500
Where, Your Majesty?

258
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,333
The house of Yomi.

259
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,791
[GUARDS gasping]

260
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,000
[YOMI] Raizen's stomach has
ceased its incessant rumbling.

261
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,791
What do you make of it, Kurama?

262
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,250
[KURAMA]
Two possibilities.

263
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,916
First, he couldn't bear
it anymore and gave in,

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,375
satiating his hunger
by eating a human.

265
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,791
Or second, he suffers no longer.

266
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,833
Meaning...

267
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,666
Meaning he's... dead.

268
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,750
[KURAMA] But so much earlier
than we anticipated?

269
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,291
I think it's far too soon for us

270
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,458
to come to that
conclusion just yet.

271
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,041
We'll wait.

272
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,666
Whatever you suggest, Kurama.

273
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,041
That's why I made
you my top advisor.

274
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,916
I am positive...

275
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,541
Raizen is dead.

276
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,583
[MUKURO] Through no one's
fault but his own.

277
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,041
A fool, he died a fool's death.

278
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,791
What will you do now?

279
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,625
[MUKURO] As promised, we'll
strike Yomi with our full force.

280
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,333
The edge of Gandara,
the land of Yomi.

281
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,791
Thanks for the escort.

282
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,791
Be careful on your
way back home.

283
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,875
What?! I can't go back.

284
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,583
By now, Yomi is surely
aware of our king's death.

285
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
And as his offspring,

286
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,833
you'll be in danger as soon
as you set foot in Gandara.

287
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,041
Well, duh! Why do you think
I wanna go in there alone?

288
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,291
As the heir to the throne,

289
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,791
you no longer
represent only yourself.

290
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,500
And I've sworn to protect
my land's new king.

291
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,125
Fine, you can tag along...

292
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,541
But let me talk, okay?

293
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,750
We wanna be as diplomatic
as we can on this.

294
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,250
Perfect time to
say that, my king.

295
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,666
And why's that?

296
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,250
We should be careful with
what we say from here on.

297
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,916
When Yomi lost his sight, he
strengthened his other senses.

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,375
It has been said many times that
Lord Yomi is capable of hearing

299
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,000
every word uttered
within his domain.

300
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,958
Really, is that so?

301
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,583
[inhales]

302
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,333
Yomi! You son of a bitch!

303
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,500
[YUSUKE]
You hear me?!

304
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,041
I'm comin', so boil
up a kettle of tea!

305
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,500
Think he heard that?

306
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,791
Quite diplomatic, sir.

307
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,500
[HOKUSHIN] By the way, Your
Highness, what is in your bag?

308
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,250
In this?

309
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,416
[HOKUSHIN] 
Yes.

310
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,958
Somehow, I have a
bad feeling about it.

311
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
[YUSUKE]
You worry too much!

312
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,583
[HOKUSHIN]
Wait! Sir!

313
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,750
[YOMI laughing]
Kurama,

314
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,583
this friend of yours
seems rather... silly.

315
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,083
Can he really be the
descendant of Raizen?

316
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,625
Yusuke has wasted no time.
He's gone to meet Yomi.

317
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,333
[MUKURO] And what do you
think the boy has in mind?

318
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,500
Knowing Yusuke, not very much.

319
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,250
He rarely thinks before he acts,

320
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,250
and yet, he always seems
to get the result he wants.

321
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,708
Most of the time, I don't
understand the things he does.

322
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,416
But I've seen the humiliation
of those who underestimate him

323
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
far too often for
me to doubt him.

324
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,583
[MUKURO]
Hmm...

325
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,625
You speak more fondly of him.

326
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,208
What's that mean?

327
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,750
[MUKURO] Sounds to me like you
might even call him a friend.

328
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,166
[HIEI]
Hmph.

329
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,541
[MUKURO] If the time comes,
will you fight against him?

330
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,041
[HIEI] I have never backed
down from any fight in my life,

331
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,041
including any brawl with Yusuke.

332
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,583
I may have let him go
the last time we fought,

333
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,791
but I have no reason
to do that this time,

334
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,958
and I eagerly await the
opportunity to beat him.

335
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,291
[MUKURO] I don't find
your words convincing.

336
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,583
Your insecurity is annoying me.

337
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,000
[MUKURO] And if it comes to your
old ally versus your new one,

338
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,458
which side will you choose?

339
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,291
The same side I'm always on...

340
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,875
the only side that
matters to me--my own.

341
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,375
If it's you versus him,

342
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll let you two fight,
and battle whoever survives.

343
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,000
[MUKURO]
Interesting.

344
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,708
I can feel it in your voice.

345
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,916
Something about what
you've just said is a lie.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,708
I just can't tell what.

347
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,416
[MUKURO] I have to admit,
he makes me a little jealous.

348
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,250
I'm sure you never pegged
me for the jealous type.

349
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,625
But we'll see soon enough
where your loyalties truly lie.

350
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,875
[MUKURO]
Change the course!

351
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,500
We're heading to Gandara!

352
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,458
Warriors, prepare for battle!

353
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,708
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

354
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,500
[NARRATOR] Raizen's death has
upset the balance of powers

355
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,041
in Demon World.

356
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,500
Now, it is up to Yusuke
to prevent total upheaval.

357
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,375
But what does he have
planned for his meeting?

358
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,083
Yomi and Kurama...

359
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,041
Mukuro and Hiei...

360
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,333
they will all once
again cross paths,

361
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,708
in the battle for
control of Demon World.

362
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,416
[thunder claps]

363
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,208
[YUSUKE] Yeah, it sucks that
the old man kicked the bucket,

364
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,375
but it sucks even more that

365
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,833
he stuck me with all
this responsibility.

366
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,000
I mean, now I've gotta

367
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,166
single-handedly
save Demon World!

368
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,500
Of course, the funny thing
about the this place is,

369
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,125
you never know when you're gonna
run into some old friends...

370
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,625
or some oddly creepy ones.

371
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,250
Or every once in a while,
a beautiful new friend...

372
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,166
with an oddly creepy one.

373
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,208
So, how am I gonna
get outta this mess?

374
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,500
Well, you'll just have to watch

375
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,750
the next episode of
Yu Yu Hakusho to find out!
