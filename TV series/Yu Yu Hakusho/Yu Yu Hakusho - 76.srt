00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,833
Then we erased their
memories of last night,

159
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,750
so they wouldn't be
burdened by the darker truths.

160
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,500
Like another human fighting
for the wrong side.

161
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,125
Kuwabara saved your life
after you tried to kill him.

162
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,666
You think your psychic pals
would've done that?

163
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,833
You owe him big.
So start talking.

164
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,416
[KUWABARA] Yeah!
Come clean!

165
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,666
Yeah, I gotta clean my socks.

166
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,958
You what?

167
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,458
Sleep talking: Sleep walking
without the bruises.

168
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,083
You don't understand.
You haven't seen what I have.

169
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,916
We should all die.

170
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,000
Clarify all, you mean
your fellow psychics?

171
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,041
No, I mean all
of us. Humans.

172
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,958
You'd all think so too
if you saw the videotape!

173
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,291
[BOTAN] What video?

174
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,541
[YUSUKE] Yeah. And say
it with more feeling.

175
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,583
It's the video they
label Chapter Black.

176
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,208
You've seen it?

177
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,500
[SEA MAN] Yes I have.
Every single minute of it.

178
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,000
[KURAMA] Chapter Black.
Amazing.

179
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,958
I'm guessing you've
heard of it.

180
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
It is legendary,

181
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,041
Hiei's wanted to get his hands
on that tape for years.

182
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,000
[YUSUKE] That good
a flick, huh?

183
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,125
It is a piece of
intelligence,

184
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,125
supposedly kept in
the deepest bowels

185
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,375
of Spirit World's
Records Department.

186
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,000
Over its millennia of existence,

187
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,041
the human race has committed
very heinous crimes

188
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,875
against others and their own.

189
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,500
This videotape
is a compilation.

190
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,833
It documents the most
unspeakable acts of all.

191
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,791
It is said to run
thousands of hours.

192
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,208
I knew well of the
tape's existence,

193
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,708
but never imagined it could
be an impetus in this case.

194
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,625
So many horrifying things

195
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,583
marching across
that giant screen.

196
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,958
You don't know
how we really are.

197
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,041
What we're capable of.

198
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,500
[SEA MAN]
I saw it all.

199
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,333
If you saw it, you'd
think differently, too.

200
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:39,083
You'd understand we're doomed.
And so we have to--

201
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,000
[YUSUKE]
Have to what, sir judge?!

202
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,375
Have to get us all
eaten the hell up

203
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
by some bloodthirsty monster?

204
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,916
That's right!

205
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,208
You're defensive cause
you don't know the truth!

206
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,833
Humanity only
seems good to you

207
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,875
because you were born
in a peaceful time.

208
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,000
But war's our nature,
it'll always come back.

209
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,958
[SEA MAN] Have you ever seen
hundreds of frightened people,

210
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,791
standing in line to
be killed in a camp?

211
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,333
Have you seen horsemen
raid and destroy a village,

212
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,541
dance on the bodies
of their victims,

213
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,708
crushing them as they
celebrated victory,

214
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,416
singing happy songs?

215
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,458
Have you seen a gigantic
bomb wipe away millions

216
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,500
who had never even
picked up a weapon?

217
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,875
Civil war,

218
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,666
where a mom is hacked
down in front of her child,

219
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,000
or a child in front of his mom?

220
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,500
And the soldier...

221
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,500
Breaking up a family
who loves each other,

222
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,083
leading them into a fire.

223
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,500
And his eyes,
enjoying the torture.

224
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,958
Come on, kid. I think you're
passed your sympathy limit.

225
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,541
[YUSUKE] And you
think you're better than

226
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,041
those people on the tape?

227
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,958
Well I know I'm not,
neither are you,

228
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,375
no human can be.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,708
[YUSUKE] What about Kuwabara?
He saved you, right?

230
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,083
And you know, last night
when he came to for a minute,

231
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,333
I asked him,

232
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,958
'Stupid, why the hell
did you save that jerk?'

233
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,458
And he said,

234
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,750
'Because, Urameshi, in his
eyes he was crying for help.'

235
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,416
I thought it was a pretty stupid
thing to say at the time,

236
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,375
but now that I see how scared
you are, I kind of follow.

237
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,416
A big oaf like
Kuwabara,

238
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,958
he's got that bully
look you must hate,

239
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,791
but he cared
about you.

240
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,083
Bet you weren't
expecting that.

241
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,041
[SEA MAN] Every night I see
them. The victims on that tape.

242
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,125
I've always seen
myself like them.

243
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,791
But then in my nightmares,
I'm the one holding the weapons.

244
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,666
You know?

245
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Like all along it's been me who
was doing those terrible things.

246
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,458
And I feel dirtier
and dirtier.

247
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,416
Like I need to make
up for something,

248
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
but I don't even know what.

249
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,458
Like I'm the bully.

250
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:54,958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

251
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,916
Perhaps we should
leave him now.

252
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,875
Yeah.

253
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,208
Clearly, he must face his own
demons before he faces us.

254
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,583
[YUSUKE] I see stuff every night
on the stupid six o'clock news

255
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,791
that pisses me off about people.

256
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,875
And that video's got
our all-time worsts.

257
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
That's gotta be a
pretty rough experience.

258
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,208
I would imagine so.

259
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,750
It's said it will
turn an average man

260
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,916
against his own kind in
five minutes of viewing.

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,250
Hell that's cheery. You may
turn me just talking about it.

262
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,250
Don't worry, Yusuke.

263
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,041
The capacity for evil is but one
ingredient in the human soul.

264
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,375
I... I hope so.

265
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,666
Still, the greatest
concern in my mind

266
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,625
is that the Chapter Black video
is in the enemy's possession.

267
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,750
It clearly has the
ability to turn

268
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,500
almost anyone to their side.

269
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,708
The footage must
be provocative.

270
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,375
I confess there was a
time even I wanted to see.

271
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,000
Was! Was!

272
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,750
[YUSUKE THINKS] Jeez,
he's making me paranoid!

273
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,041
Anyway, a more
pressing matter...

274
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,500
...you never asked me
where I went yesterday.

275
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,750
Oh yeah...

276
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,916
Truth be known, I went
to speak with Koenma.

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,458
You went all the
way to Spirit World?

278
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,416
Why didn't you just
use my briefcase thing?

279
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,000
[KURAMA] I needed to
confront him face to face.

280
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,666
He could never put
my suspicions to rest,

281
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,458
and speaking with Sea Man
has now made me certain...

282
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,750
Koenma knows the exact
identity of our foe.

283
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,333
He what??

284
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,333
[KURAMA] I've planned
a formal meeting to...

285
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
[YUSUKE] Earth to
toddler bitch!

286
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,708
You better speak now before I
forever put that pacifier

287
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,416
ten inches down
your throat!

288
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,625
[KURAMA THINKS]
Not quite what I planned.

289
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,833
[KOENMA] Hey Yusuke,
I'm glad to see

290
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,625
you've regained some enthusiasm.

291
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,166
It's good in small doses.

292
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,333
Kurama says you knew who was
behind this from the very start.

293
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,958
Why the hell haven't
you told me?

294
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,708
[KOENMA] I wasn't positive
until the video tape.

295
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,250
Only one man has a copy of that,

296
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,125
I just didn't want
to believe it.

297
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,541
Cut to the meat, pal!

298
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,083
[KOENMA] As you wish, Yusuke.

299
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,375
The name of the mastermind:
Shinobu Sensui.

300
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,166
He was the Spirit Detective of
the earth before you came along.

301
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,416
This is a photo of Shinobu
Sensui in high school,

302
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,541
when he began working for
me as a Spirit Detective.

303
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,791
That face, the one who
confronted us in the fairway,

304
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
but he looks a lot older now.

305
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,208
[KOENMA] He was gifted with
an incredibly strong sense

306
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,583
of right and wrong.

307
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,250
Perhaps too strong.

308
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,375
It was about ten years ago
when he simply disappeared.

309
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,083
In the weeks leading up to that,

310
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,791
I remember he always
asked me the same question.

311
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,416
[KOENMA] Are we
even worth protecting?

312
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,875
Then the Chapter Black video
vanished from the vault,

313
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,208
and so did he.

314
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,500
We tried to track him down,
but to no use.

315
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,375
I hoped he'd gone
into seclusion,

316
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,541
content to never be bothered.

317
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,708
But why would he
resurface now?

318
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,083
You have to be careful, Yusuke.
He is incredibly lethal.

319
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,166
I'm leaving for Human World now.

320
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,166
A detective...

321
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,666
Well I'm sure as hell
not gonna let some idiot

322
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,958
just like me be the
end of the world!

323
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,666
[SENSUI THINKS] I've given
you a chance, Koenma.

324
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,125
I've waited until you
found my replacement.

325
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,291
Now it's time to
settle the question.

326
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,125
Should human beings live or die?

327
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,958
[NARRATOR]
Shinobu Sensui...

328
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,583
At one time a Spirit Detective,
just as Yusuke is now.

329
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,208
With all the sins of
humanity as a weapon,

330
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,000
can Yusuke bring him down?

331
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,208
[BOTAN] Oh dear,
as if the tunnel

332
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,833
threatening to
unleash giant beasts

333
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,375
on the Earth isn't bad enough!

334
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,916
Koenma makes a rare trip to
Living World in his teenage form

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,958
to tell the rest
of the chilling tale,

336
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,041
of the wicked deeds,
familiar faces,

337
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,125
and a young man's
descent into madness.

338
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,416
And what about Sea Man?

339
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,583
Will he join us, or turn
back to his hatred?

340
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,208
Sensui's plan runs deep,

341
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,375
don't forget what he's
done to Elder Toguro.

342
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,916
There's still much to reveal,
as Yu Yu Hakusho continues!

343
