Tournament finals,

00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,125
that kick ass things
come in short packages, too!

158
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,083
I have absolutely no idea who's
gonna win this one, people,

159
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,791
but I can state with certainty
that it's gonna be exciting!

160
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,666
Oh my! Is it my imagination, or
has Bui's axe gotten even bigger

161
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,833
since last time he
formed it from thin air!

162
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,625
I can't wait to see how
he wields it this go round!

163
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
Serves Hiei right!

164
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,458
[KOENMA] Why's there never a
slingshot when you need it?

165
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,916
Chop the shorty
down to size!

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,208
Why don't you
start by knocking off

167
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,375
that ugly little head of his?

168
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,583
Not a bad weapon
you've got there, Bui.

169
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,208
But with all due respect, I
must say I still prefer my own.

170
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,750
No! He can't!

171
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,416
Man, look how tight
Hiei has those bandages

172
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,541
wrapped around his arm.

173
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,291
His injuries must not
be anywhere close

174
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,375
to healing for real.

175
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,958
[KURAMA] No, you've
misunderstood

176
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,416
Hiei's true motives.

177
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,083
The purpose of this particular
binding is not to repair.

178
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,625
What the hell? So it's
just there to look pretty?

179
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,208
[KURAMA]
Not exactly.

180
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,541
Why use a bandage that doesn't
make your hurting spots better.

181
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,500
[KURAMA THINKS] I'm unable
to sense your powers

182
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,083
through that binding, Hiei.

183
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,583
Is it possible you've managed
to remaster the Dragon

184
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,375
in so short a time?

185
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,500
And now, the second
match of the final round

186
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,416
of the Dark Tournament!

187
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,333
Ready, set, go!

188
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,458
[KOTO] Check out
Bui's hang time!

189
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,666
[HIEI] Your aim is as
broad as your axe.

190
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,041
Could you at least
try to hit me next time?

191
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,750
Nobody can explain
to me why the combatants

192
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,333
keep attacking the audience,

193
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,208
though it does make the
pain much more widespread,

194
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,875
and I do love that!

195
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,458
Bui certainly knows
how to involve the crowd.

196
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,875
He's certainly gotten
a lot stronger

197
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,083
since I first fought him,

198
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,291
he never could have
taken Hiei back then.

199
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,750
You see, Brother?

200
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,500
Never underestimate the power
of one's hatred for us!

201
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
If I were a betting man,

202
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,500
I'd wager Hiei starts resorting
to his desperate measures soon.

203
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,625
If?

204
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,875
Well I killed all
my betting partners.

205
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,625
I may be a small target,
but this is sad.

206
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,833
Prepare yourself for, the
Fist of the Mortal Flame!

207
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,000
Look out!

208
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,708
Game over.

209
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,458
At least you are consistent,

210
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,750
consistently foolish
if you believe this axe

211
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,583
will have any more
impact than the last.

212
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,000
But that's amazing!

213
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,083
Hiei not only stopped
the blade with his bare hand,

214
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,375
he then incinerated it to boot!

215
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,916
Uh, remind me never to
let Hiei touch me again

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,250
any time soon,
or like ever.

217
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,583
[KOENMA] Right,
I'll make a note.

218
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,583
[KURAMA THINKS] Then it is true,

219
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,541
his powers show no
sign of faltering.

220
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,625
Need has risen his abilities

221
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,583
exponentially in
this tournament.

222
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,791
He can wield the
living flame with ease.

223
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,625
Now, the only question
is whether his body

224
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,666
can bear the Darkness Flame as
well, and unleash the dragon.

225
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,333
I warned you that
was a foolish maneuver...

226
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,416
But you refused to listen,
much to your disadvantage,

227
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,250
and to my boredom.

228
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,875
And that is not forgivable.

229
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,916
Now is the
time, brother.

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,583
Sooner than
I expected.

231
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:56,125
[BUI] Sorry to bore you.
I'll remove my armor.

232
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,375
Did you hear that?

233
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,291
Bui spoke for the first
time in this tournament!

234
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,333
His timbering
voice so richly deep

235
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,291
that my two little
cat ears are tingling.

236
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,750
In fact, my whole
body's got shivers!

237
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,083
You should know two things,
Hiei the swordsman.

238
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,000
I was saving this
for someone else...

239
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,125
...and this is the highest
compliment I give.

240
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,625
I am honored.
Really, I am.

241
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,916
But are you sure
you're strong enough

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to take a direct hit
from me without any armor?

243
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,958
I'll handle it.

244
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,916
Woah, that's heavy!

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,166
And that's just one
of his arm things!

246
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,250
How did he ever manage
to fight in all that stuff,

247
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,416
let alone stand
up straight in it?

248
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,541
Opportunity knocks, Hiei!

249
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,083
If you hit him
while he's kneeling,

250
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,000
he won't be able
to fight back!

251
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,375
Hiei's an honorable person

252
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,125
and would never do
something so deceitful.

253
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,000
It's too beneath him.

254
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,583
I suppose you would
just attack a man

255
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
with his back turned to
you as well, wouldn't you?

256
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,875
Or how about handcuffs
and blindfolds, Ogre?

257
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,333
Would that be better?

258
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,166
That's like cheating!

259
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,541
Excuse me while I shrink away.

260
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,000
[BUI] Most fighters wear
armor to protect themselves

261
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,458
from their opponent.

262
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,333
But I'm the opposite.

263
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,291
I actually wear this armor to
protect my opponent from myself.

264
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,666
You see, my
powers are so great

265
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,458
I can't control
them on my own.

266
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,750
[KUWABARA] Whoa! How did I not
pick up on this guy's energy?

267
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,875
Because of his armor, 
it contains his power.

268
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,000
If it contains it, then why
the hell would he take it off?

269
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,250
No that's...
What I meant by contains is

270
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,416
that his armor keeps
his power from escaping.

271
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,458
Definition number two.

272
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,500
I call this Battle Aura, I'd
like to see you try and top it.

273
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,166
And so would I, but I
doubt I'll have to try!

274
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,125
Look out below!

275
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,958
Not bad.

276
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
[KUWABARA] Getting beat by
your own attack?

277
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,125
Man, that's got to be pretty
gosh darn humiliating!

278
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,666
Yes. All I can say after
watching that move is,

279
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,625
I'm glad Hiei
is on our side!

280
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,125
No,

281
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,750
I told you you'd have
to try and top me, Hiei.

282
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,375
Maybe now you'll begin
to take me more seriously

283
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,708
and show me the
respect I deserve.

284
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,416
[BUI] My attacks are designed
to be only as strong

285
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,625
as necessary to
take out my opponent.

286
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:24,583
As you can see, that's not
even enough to put a dent in me.

287
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,583
Take that anyway you like.

288
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,666
[HIEI] So, it takes a lot more
than that to bang you up?

289
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,875
Here comes a lot more!

290
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,583
Hey, Hiei's takin' off that
bandage you were talkin' about,

291
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,041
the one that doesn't
do what it's supposed to.

292
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,458
It seems that you misunderstood,
on the contrary, Kuwabara,

293
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,625
that binding has
accomplished precisely

294
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,833
what it was intended to do,

295
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,958
which for Hiei is similar
to Bui's armor.

296
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,500
Though in Hiei's case
it's not just his own energy

297
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,625
that's trapped
in that arm...Wait!

298
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,500
Neither fighter can
control his energy.

299
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,333
If they clash, this
stadium could crumble.

300
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,375
Once your own doom
has been unraveled,

301
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,333
I assure you there's
no turning back.

302
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,125
[NARRATOR] Is Hiei strong
enough to harness

303
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,833
the wildly destructive Dragon
of the Darkness Flame again,

304
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,000
and would it be even
enough to topple Bui?

305
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,541
Can he help
Team Urameshi clinch

306
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,458
their first point
of the finals,

307
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,416
and send them
closer to victory?

308
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,833
[YUSUKE] So it really sucks that
those stupid morons in control

309
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,125
gypped us out of a point.

310
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,375
Looking ahead to the
rest of our team's lineup,

311
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,000
and since we need
three points to win,

312
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,916
I'd say our chances at victory
definitely lie in Hiei's hands.

313
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,791
But don't hide
under your beds yet.

314
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,166
Hiei's got an awesome
weapon flying out of that arm.

315
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,458
If you thought his first
Dragon of the Darkness Flame

316
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,666
was the be-all, end-all,

317
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,541
well you better take
some calming medication.

318
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,666
He'll give it
all to win this one,

319
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,375
even if he's got to blow
up the whole stadium to do it.

320
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,958
Speaking of which,
I'd better find some cover!

321
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,625
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!

322
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:28,041
