[NARRATOR]
Finally reaching Sensui's lair,

2
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,666
Kurama mercilessly killed
the psychic Gourmet

3
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,916
to free Kuwabara,
but a surprise emerged.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,541
The elder Toguro had
actually taken over Gourmet

5
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,625
from the inside,
and sought revenge.

6
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,500
Regeneration made Toguro
unable to die,

7
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,208
so Kurama condemned him
to an eternity of pain

8
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,083
in the arms of
the strange Sinning Tree.

9
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,416
Now, with the tunnel to demon
world moments from completion,

10
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,875
the final battle begins.

[TOGURO 1 groaning]

[TORGURO 1 groaning]

Such a malignant soul
will never accept the truth.

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,208
The more he lashes
out in his mind,

16
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,166
the more painful the Sinning
Tree's effects become.

17
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,583
It hurts!

18

only your own sins can hurt you.

Uh, Kurama, if I ever did
somethin' that pissed you off,

in our path.

Right.

Your end of the world

and I trust you don't
wanna be plant food.

Give Kuwabara back to us
like you promised.

[SENSUI] Ha. No need
to get heated, Yusuke.

longer in my possession.

feature that traitor has.

Sensui can be violent,
courageous, spiritually pure,

and even fragile.

He can be a graceful

to bring anyone to his side.

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,791
I suppose I was his first step
in realizing his relationships

161
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,791
of good and evil could not
be so... traditionally defined.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,916
You mean there's all kinds
of apparitions, good and bad?

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,125
[ITSUKI] Who could have dreamed
that a hunter I admired

164
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,041
for physical prowess,
this killer of killers,

165
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,583
could also be warm.

166
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,958
Compassionate. Intellectual.

167
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,041
Open to broadening
his view of the world.

168
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,375
Yes, I admit my attraction
was not purely academic.

169
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,166
I always wished he
would become my lover.

170
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay, you can stop right there.

171
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,083
I don't think my ears
are old enough for this.

172
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,083
If you truly care for Sensui,
then help us stop him.

173
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,583
This path he's chosen
will destroy him as well.

174
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,375
[ITSUKI]
You can't save the damned.

175
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,791
Don't you see? I'm expecting
him to act terribly,

176
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,083
and hurt people.

177
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,416
Even to his own end,
there's no way to stop it.

178
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,708
Why not?

179
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,083
Because Sensui must follow
his soul's true course.

180
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,166
Drop ink on the finest
snow white paper

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,875
and it will inevitably
absorb into black.

182
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,208
Its purity demands it.

183
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,333
Tainted men have immunities.

184
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,541
Black does not absorb black.

185
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,291
Sensui's change is but
proof of his perfection,

186
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,500
and you cannot stop him.

187
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,416
The ability to
prevent this demise

188
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,291
would show purity did not exist.

189
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,041
Purity is worth the world.

190
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,833
And worth it ending.

191
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,875
[growls] You're really
making me nauseous.

192
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,000
All of your fancy lies.

193
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,000
You can't excuse him!
He's a monster, cut and dry.

194
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,541
[ITSUKI] You're not
listening to me, Kuwabara.

195
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
I'm not excusing him.

196
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,000
Then what the heck
do you call that?!

197
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,875
[ITSUKI] Sensui is indeed
becoming depraved.

198
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,083
But I must let that happen.

199
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,625
Because I know, whatever
he does to the world,

200
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,833
even if it kills us all,
is what we deserve.

201
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,666
You should know I will kill
you if I can, without remorse.

202
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,375
You will do what
you must, Kurama,

203
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,208
but whether I live or die,
the battle will not be affected.

204
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,166
My Ura-Otoko will
make sure of that.

205
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,791
You see, I'm the only
one who can control him.

206
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,833
If we kill him,
I get the first hit.

207
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,833
I'm afraid these surrounding
are making us stir-crazy.

208
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,541
Let's have a better view.

209
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,500
[KUWABARA, SEA MAN gasp]

210
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,625
Simply looking at me fills you
with fury, right, detective?

211
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,791
You know, Yusuke, if you
continue this work

212
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,541
as Spirit World's agent,
you'll eventually share my fate.

213
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,875
The things you see
grow a canker on your soul,

214
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,833
and you cannot heal the sore.

215
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,666
Do you want to know why?

216
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,125
Because the canker keeps
growing and consumes you.

217
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,875
The evil you're chasing
becomes who you are.

218
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,750
Just picture where
you were a year ago,

219
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,416
before any of your noble
detective work began.

220
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,166
Would you ever have imagined
murdering another human being?

221
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,541
Now your team's killed
three in under a week.

222
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,416
Imagine ten more years
on that steep decline.

223
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,875
Those were all set-ups.

224
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,708
You fixed it so that killing
them was our only choice.

225
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,000
[chuckles]

226
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,083
We humans can justify
anything, can't we?

227
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,708
That's how our
corruption begins.

228
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,291
That's why I like demons.

229
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,875
They make no excuses.
They accept their wickedness.

230
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,875
Just as you will, in time.

Your immorality
is your strength.

234
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,791
The moment you accept it,
your confusion will subside.

235
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,541
No longer filled
with guilt and anger

236

over what you're becoming,

237
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,541
you'll focus more
on your fighting.

238
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,666
You'll at last have your peace.

[KUWABARA] Yeah! Now that's
a statement punch!

242
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,416
[YUSUKE]
Maybe there have been times

243
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,541
when I've been pissed
and hated things,

244
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,583
but it wasn't from this work.

245
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,666
My dad's a no-show, my mom's
a lush, and school sucks,

246
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,166
but this job is the one damn
thing I've ever been good at.

247
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,666
And if all the crap in my life
hasn't screwed me up yet,

248
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,666
then neither will this.

And neither will you.

[grunts]

253
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,875
[SENSUI] You see?
That's precisely what I mean.

254
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,083
Once you've accepted
your evil nature,

255
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,458
you'll feel much more relaxed,
no matter the odds.

256
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,500
Take me, for instance.

257
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,125
If your power ranking's
a ten, mine is a six.

You beat me in all three.

And yet you're
still going to die.

262
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,916
Why is Sensui talkin' so much?

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,583
You think he's buyin' time?

264

I don't think that's it.

He's exuding as much
confidence as ever.

You're right, Kurama.

I haven't seen Sensui
this happy in a long time,

00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,500
as he's getting to kill
and prove a point.

Shut up! From now on
you're in quiet time, okay?

like I'm an old lady

You are faster, Yusuke,
but it doesn't matter.

00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,166
Reason one why you
don't stand a chance:

294
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,083
I can predict your moves.

295

predict my attacks!

298
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,250
[SENSUI]
It's not about being a psychic.

299
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,916
It's about experience.

300
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,208
When you dodged my kick,

301
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,083
I knew you'd answer
with your favorite finish:

302
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,083
a right-hand hook to the jaw.

303
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,583
Despite your speed,
my knowledge of this allowed me

304
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,500
to turn just enough
to make your fist slide off.

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,666
I played a detective
just like you, and like you,

306
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,583
decoding my opponent's
fighting style is my strength,

307
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,958
but I've been doing it
for decades longer.

00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,125
Heh.

309
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,500
So, I guess
I can't surprise you.

310
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,291
Then I guess you know this, too,

311
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
that trusting what people tell
me has never been my thing!

Yeah! Bring it to him, Urameshi!

00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,500
[growls]

316
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,500
[YUSUKE yelling]

317
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,166
[YUSUKE grunts]

318
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,583
You're up!

319
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,750
[SENSUI]
Huh?

320
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,791
Uh!

321
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,500
That's called a fake.

322
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,708
--[YUSUKE yelling]
--[SENSUI groaning]

323
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,625
Jeez.

324
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,166
Now that's a hit!

325
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,291
It's about time you listened
to me and did somethin' right!

326
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,708
Now finish him so we can leave!

327
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,250
I haven't eaten since
they kidnapped me!

328
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,500
[YUSUKE]
What's that, Sensui?

329
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,250
You forgot how to swim?
You drowned?

330
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,708
Great, we'll pack up and go!

331
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,125
You heard Kuwabara,
he's starved.

332
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,875
[SENSUI]
Good hits, detective.

333
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,208
Between that and the water,
my shirt practically dissolved.

334
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,666
[yelps]

335
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125
[KUWABARA yells]

336
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,375
Gross. Look at
the scars he's got.

337
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:06,000
Guess he wasn't lyin' about all
the fights he's been through.

338
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
[SENSUI] 
Don't you know what they say

339
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,666
about assuming, Kuwabara?

340
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,083
These wounds
aren't from enemies.

341
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,958
No one's ever hurt me that bad.

342
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,500
I gave myself these scars
as a part of my training.

343
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,625
[YUSUKE]
Great, a masochist.

344
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,208
True, though,
his body's well trained.

345
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,666
It's like punching
a tractor tire.

346
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,000
[SENSUI] Let's fight like
there's a little more at stake.

347
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,916
[YUSUKE grunts]

348
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,166
[NARRATOR] After diversions,
kidnappings, trials and tests,

349
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,416
and with the tunnel to Demon
World racing to completion,

350
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,333
the deciding fight
has finally begun.

351
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,583
The battle between
Spirit Detectives.

352
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,000
[KUWABARA] Man, Sensui's
about to rip into Urameshi

353
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,916
with powers you've never seen.

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,083
Now, let's recap.

355
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,500
Itsuki's actually
a demon with extra arms,

356
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,708
we're trapped inside
of a shadow's belly,

357
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,458
Gourmet was actually Toguro,

358
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,083
and Sensui doesn't seem
to care about his plan!

359
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,833
How's he gonna cut the barrier
and let the big demons out,

360
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,416
if he let the guy
with the sword get away?

361
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,583
Well, you better watch
the next Yu Yu Hakusho,

362
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,500
because, believe it or not,

363
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,291
we haven't gotten
to the big surprises!
