I've got the eighth battle
for you, in just a minute!

165
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,458
It's Toguro's team.

166

Yeah, let's go.

[KOTO] But before
we get to the good stuff,

168
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,666
let's take a look
at our progress so far!

169
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,333
The advancing teams from
the first seven massacres are...

00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:43,375
Urameshi Team, Dr.
Ichigaki Team, Team Masho,

171
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:50,375
Team Gokkai Six, Team Uraotogi,
Gorenja Team, and Team Kido!

172
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,250
There's only one more
slot for the second round,

173
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,041
and our next two teams
are about to paw for it!

[crowd erupts]

That's right people!

00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,041
So warm up your scream voices
and strap on your galoshes,

177
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,083
because it's a good
bet these next fighters

178
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,583
will have us knee
deep in the slaughter!

179
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,625
[SAKYOU THINKS] Yes, Toguro.

reason to sweat.

[KOTO] Ah, yes. A person who
needs no introduction.

The resident badass
of the Tournament!

Hasn't changed one friggin' bit.

185
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,541
But the defending champions

186
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,625
may not have an easy
time with this team!

187

The Spirit Warriors.

188
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
That's the team those
guys were from, huh?

Man! They're all giants!

190

[KOTO] For those

you'll notice a substitute's
fighting in the place of Rugby,

who we've been told has had
out of the ring complications.

Hello! Guess that's why
they're called Spirit Warriors!

194
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,083
Their size and power
make them quite a doozy!

Don't scare us! Where've
you been all day??

196

If you don't mind,

197
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,125
I'd like to fight against
your team single-handedly.

What are you sthaying?
Don'th you have a team?

199

Of course, but they happen
to be extremely lazy

and they don't want to fight.

You arrogant man.
Are you mocking us?!

202

Five fights in row!
You'd be exhausted!

Well actually,

204
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,166
I was hoping all five of you
would fight me at the same time.

I see! The puny man is serious!

His fame must be
affecting his head!

207

Gee, Toguro is
really asking for it.

Look at us!

Everyone on our team is
two times bigger than you.

You have size. And that is all.

Fine! If you're a fool with
a death-wish than so be it!

Five on one, right now!

Mr. Toguro! Are you
sure you agree to this!

Naturally, they're my terms.

Yeah, I really don't
think Toguro would survive

if he got trapped under
one of those stomps.

It's like gettin' hit
with a wrecking ball!

Hands Technique to finish.
