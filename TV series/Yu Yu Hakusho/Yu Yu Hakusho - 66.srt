The records do
support that, sir.

159
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,000
Toguro did not face
Kairen that day,

160
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,791
but disappeared into the
wilderness for three months.

161
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,333
The morning before
the tournament,

162
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:37,333
he reappeared in front of his
team, Genkai and the others.

163
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,666
He seemed changed.
Detached. Possessed.

164
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,708
[RECORDS GIRL] He killed
Kairen... in the final round.

165
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,166
As his prize, Toguro was made
into a demon, like Kairen.

166
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,750
I don't understand the
man's way of thinking, sir.

167
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,583
Why would he choose to become

168
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,708
like the creature
he most despised?

169
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,083
Well, that's the
million dollar question.

170
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,541
Perhaps it was guilt,
for not protecting his students.

171
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,875
Even though he'd avenged them,
it wasn't enough.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,541
The only way to atone was
to never be vulnerable again.

173
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,666
Perhaps he
wanted to become

174
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,750
the monster he already
felt himself to be.

175
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,916
Perhaps he was just afraid
of loving someone.

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,416
Perhaps he just
afraid of growing old.

177
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,750
Toguro is a complex case.
He's like an ant hill.

178
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,958
The deeper you dig,
the more tunnels appear,

179
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,250
and inside each is a
creature ready to bite.

180
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,916
Layer upon layer
of bravado facades,

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,875
contradicting desires and
intensely-wrought obsessions.

182
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,125
But, beneath it all,

183
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,791
I suspect you would
find just a normal man

184
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,041
with a wounded heart...

185
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,125
...and a broken dream.

186
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,125
[TOGURO 2] You were good
in there, Genkai.

187
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,875
Our teamwork is
even more in tune now.

188
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,791
It isn't going to
take us much longer.

189
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,625
Soon every fighter
will know of our names.

190
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,166
And then what?

191
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
[TOGURO 2]
We go further.

192
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,791
You're a
beautiful girl, Genkai.

193
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,791
Thank you.

194
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,416
I can't help but
think our human lives

195
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,750
are nothing but a cruel joke.

196
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,416
Here just long enough
to know what we want,

197
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,000
and then it erodes.

198
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,916
Don't tell me you're surprised.

199
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,458
You knew I would
choose to go this way.

200
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,833
You're right, I did know.

201
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,750
After that day on the river,
I knew how everything would end.

202
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,708
And yet I couldn't stop it.

203
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,416
You're a hopeless dimwit.
You realize that?

204
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,833
You just love to wallow in
your own ridiculous suffering.

205
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,875
Kairen is the one who
killed those kids, not you.

206
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,916
Don't you think you've
blamed yourself enough already

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,250
for not being perfect?

208
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,833
Haven't you
blamed me enough, too?

209
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,125
You trapped yourself in a body
you hated, hiding in the pain.

210
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,833
And now you want to torture
yourself again for eternity.

211
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,291
Why? Haven't we
both paid enough??

212
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,666
[TOGURO 2] You're wrong.

213
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,750
All that business delighted me.

214
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:23,500
Murdering Kairen, knowing
that I was the most powerful.

215
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
It was through
my fear of Kairen

216
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,625
that I pushed forward to
meet my ultimate potential.

217
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,666
I understood my power and
was freed from human baggage,

218
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,875
and in the larger scheme I
knew the part I had to play.

219
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,791
[TOURO 2] I'm actually thankful
for what Kairen did.

220
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,916
Liar!

221
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,416
[TOGURO 2]
Don't mourn me, Genkai.

222
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,958
Like you said. This is
the way I wanted it to end.

223
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,250
[TOGURO 2] Don't stay here
trying to figure me out.

224
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,875
You have a job to do.

225
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,791
Your apprentice, Urameshi,
he can still be stronger.

226
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,500
But he could go the
wrong way, too. Like me.

227
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,875
Maybe he'll actually listen
to you, the way I could not.

228
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
[GENKAI] You really
care about Yusuke.

229
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,666
In your own screwed-up way,
you've been teaching him, too.

230
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,958
He's like a son to me.
Maybe you think the same.

231
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,750
Don't ever feel regret
for the things between us.

232
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,500
No, Genkai. But it would
have been a beautiful life.

233
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,208
[GENKAI THINKS] You really
are a big-hearted fool.

234
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
[GENKAI] Okay, open up.

235
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,875
Remarkable.

236
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,791
What is, sir?
The age difference?

237
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,666
No, you dolt. I'm just realizing
the extent of Toguro's planning.

238
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,791
He had everything covered
before the finals even started!

239
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,958
If Urameshi wins
this tournament,

240
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,625
it's clear what
his wish will be.

241
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,750
But I'm afraid the
Tournament Committee

242
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,958
may not be in perfect
health this year.

243
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,000
The responsibility,
Koenma, might fall on you.

244
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,625
Take good care of
Genkai's body.

245
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,125
Just a friendly
piece of advice.

246
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,916
[KOENMA] On the surface, it
seemed that Sakyo was the one

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,416
pulling the strings
in the tournament.

248
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,625
But hindsight tells
us another story.

249
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,791
Toguro was the
real puppeteer.

250
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,000
[MANAGER] Ladies and gentlemen,
the final boat back to the

251
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,041
mainland will board
within the hour.

252
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,708
Please complete your check-out

253
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,750
and proceed to the
dock for departure.

254
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,708
I repeat, this is the
final trip off the island.

255
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,625
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

256
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,833
[KUWABARA] Geeze, what's
takin' those girls so long?

257
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,041
We're gonna get left!

258
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,875
Not everyone packed
just one set of clothes.

259
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,958
It's just like family vacation.

260
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,541
My dumb sister's
always making us late.

261
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,041
Prob'ly plucking her mustache.

262
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,375
Should I tell them about
your Fluffy Doll?

263
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,958
[KUWABARA]
Oh, uh, uh!

264
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,916
Hi, sis.
Enough family stories.

265
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,833
I was just tellin' 'em
how pretty you are.

266
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:52,750
You're a moron.

267
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,750
[ALL] Sorry we're late!

268
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,833
[YUSUKE] Oh look,
the tone-deaf sirens.

269
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,750
Catch.

270
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,416
Hey! Why do I gotta
carry all your stuff?

271
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,875
Of course you don't have to...

272
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,583
...but Yukina's drawn to guys
who are nice to their sisters.

273
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,958
Oh, okay! I am!

274
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Thank you, Kazuma,
that's very sweet.

275
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,000
This too!

276
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,875
No way, Botan.
You're not my sister.

277
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,333
Yes, but Yukina's
socks are in here.

00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,791
Puu!

279
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,500
[YUSUKE] You don't mind
having Puu duty, right?

280
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,500
[YUSUKE] Thanks. No one's
gonna take the champ serious

281
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416

teddy bear with a beak.

Puu!!

283
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,750
[KEIKO] Oh, we know you're cute,
Puu. He's just being a jerk.

284
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,875
[YUSUKE] You know I'm actually
gonna miss this stupid place.

285
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,041
Feels like we've
been here for years.

286
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,083
Losing someone
can do that.

287

Ix-nay on the enkai-Gay.

288
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,833
It took us all morning just to
get Urameshi out of his room!

[BOTAN]
Okay, okay!

Back to skipping detentions.

And video games!

[KUWABARA] You're...
she's really alive!

cruise with a boy before, right?

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,875
[NARRATOR]
And so it goes.

313
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,875
Finally, the champion
Urameshi Team sails away

314
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,500
from Hanging Neck Island
with all its members intact.

315
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,000
But unbeknownst to them,
a new plot is unfolding.

316
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,875
For in the rubble of the
stadium lurks a new figure,

317
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,791
determined to keep
Sakyo's plan alive.

[KUWABARA] Okay!
Back to Sarayashki Junior High

319
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,125
for adventures in learning!

320
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,041
But while Urameshi and me were
off saving everybody's hides,

321
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,833
some new street punks
have taken over our turf!

322
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,541
Nobody gives us credit.

323
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,833
Of course, after fighting
demons with giant axes

324
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,958
and swords that unleash
the screaming undead,

325
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,125
a few latch-key kids with
big egos shouldn't be problem.

326
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,666
But, like everything
with the Spirit Detective,

327
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,291
things are not what they seem!
