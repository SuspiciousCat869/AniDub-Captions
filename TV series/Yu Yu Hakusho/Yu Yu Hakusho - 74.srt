shut the door.

160
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
[SHIZURU]
Wait! Genkai!

161
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,416
What a mess!

162
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,458
Puu! Puu!

163
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,125
[KEIKO]
Yusuke.

164
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,625
[SHIZURU]
I'm telling you, girl.

165
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,875
You just focus on getting
better. Yusuke's gonna be fine.

166
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,708
[KEIKO]
Yusuke...

167
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,083
Easy, Yusuke. You don't want
to go through with that.

168
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,416
Think about your future.

169
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,375
You'll be put in
jail as a murderer.

170
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,583
Planning out the future's
never been my style.

171
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,541
[YUSUKE] I hope
you like cremation.

172
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,500
[NURSE 2]
Doctor... help.

173
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,416
[YUSUKE]
No!!

174
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,458
That's very good, Yusuke.

175
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,375
Raise that finger again
and I'll cut off her head.

176
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,166
Quite a complication...

177
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,958
You must be glad to have
an excuse not to kill me.

178
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
[AYAME]
Koenma, sir.

179
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,500
What is it?

180
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,208
I've received the latest
update on the tunnel report.

181
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,416
May I ask you why
you're out here, sir?

182
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,333
I just needed a
place to think. Shoot.

183
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,791
The tunnel's expansion
rate is not only high,

184
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,041
it's consistent.

185
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,375
It seems this psychic
never needs to sleep.

186
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,250
A combination of
stamina and might

187
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,500
that a hundred typical
psychics couldn't match.

188
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,583
That's why Sakyou tried
to dig a tunnel with money.

189
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,625
Not even he could imagine
a psychic as an option.

190
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,333
I understand this person
has tremendous powers,

191
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,375
but we still have the
Kekkai Barrier to stop them.

192
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,125
You don't think the psychic can
break that too, do you sir?

193
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,208
Surely not. No one in
existence could do that.

194
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,083
Knock on some wood.

195
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,458
[PUU]
Puu!

196
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,583
[SHIZURU]
Get out!

197
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,958
Shizuru, get out of here.
Save yourself.

198
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,708
Shut up! That disease
is making you retarded.

199
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,666
I'm already stung. It makes
no sense to try to protect me.

200
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,583
Maybe so, kid.

201
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,625
But I'm too stubborn
to admit I'm wrong now.

202
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,541
Kurama!

203
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,833
What on earth are
you two doing here?

204
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,958
Bastard!

205
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,625
Do you even know what the
guys you're helping are doing?

206
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,250
This tunnel they
want to open...

207
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,416
...it's gonna turn the Earth
into Demon World's whipping boy.

208
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,916
[Laughing]

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,458
[YUSUKE]
You think that's funny??

210
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,500
These big freaks are gonna kill
you just like everyone else!

211
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,208
I hope so!

212
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,958
What the hell is wrong
with you? You wanna die?

213
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,833
[THE DOCTOR]
Everyone goes.

214
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,958
After all these
years as a doctor,

215
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,458
that's one thing I know,
and in so many bad ways...

216
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:11,041
Dysentery, strokes, aneurisms,
I'd lost all sense of hope.

217
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,541
Then I learned the
real reason for disease.

218
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:21,250
Mankind deserves to go.
That's what they've shown me.

219
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,166
I've never had purpose
in my awful life,

220
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,750
but I'll have
purpose in my death.

221
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,166
Then just die alone!

222
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,541
[THE DOCTOR]
You bitch!

223
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,000
[YUSUKE]
Yana!

224
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,875
I... just wanted to help.

225
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,208
[THE DOCTOR] These devils.
They're everywhere!

226
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,333
They want to
ruin our dream! No!

227
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,333
What a sad puppet you've become.

228
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,333
You're not leaving now.

229
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,458
[YUSUKE] Yeah.
This is your last chance.

230
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,291
You find some way to
get unconscious

231
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,250
and call off your virus.

232
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,125
Or you die.

233
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,166
Okay, fine,
so I have lied a little.

234
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,208
There is a way to cure them.

235
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,875
But you have to
promise to let me live.

236
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,666
You better convince me.

237
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,583
Look!

238
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,083
It's the anti-virus.
Enough for everyone.

239
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
You can have it.

240
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,375
[THE DOCTOR THINKS] ] Fool. I'll
gut him as soon as he takes it.

241
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,083
Don't get closer!

242
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,500
I could read his thoughts!
He's planning to kill you!

243
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,541
Those vials are nothin'
but glucose! Sugar water!

244
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,250
No!!!

245
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,333
Your last chance just
flew out the window.

246
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,333
No!

247
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,708
[THE DOCTOR]
Devil!

248
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,875
[THE DOCTOR] Yes,
waste time. In seconds,

249
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,208
everyone
infected will die.

250
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,750
Hey, the color's wearing off.

251
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,000
Does that mean what
I think it does?

252
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,583
[people moaning]

253
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,708
[PATIENT 1] Those men.
Are they dead?

254
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,666
[NURSE 4] It was Doctor
Kamiya. I saw what he did.

255
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,041
[PATIENT 3] Somebody
call the police!

256
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,750
[YUSUKE THINKS] Damn it.
I had to do it.

257
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,500
I had to kill him.

258
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,833
[YUSUKE]
Grandma!

259
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,750
We don't have time to have
death on your conscience.

260
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,750
[GENKAI] Don't you dare question
yourself. He'll be fine.

261
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,458
You took the right action.

262
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,458
You saved countless
people's lives.

263
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,500
[KUWABARA] Hey!!
Urameshi!!

264
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,125
[BOTAN] Should I even ask why
Yana's in a nurse outfit?

265
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,916
[YUSUKE] Ah, you know.
Playing doctor,

266
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,833
and one thing led to another.

267
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,458
[GENKAI] Botan, he could
use your healing powers.

268
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
Right!

269
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Puu!

270
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,708
Well. This certainly
is a reunion.

271
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,875
[KUWABARA] Oh hey sis,
why are you here?

272
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,583
You sick?

273
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,916
Yeah, bro.

274
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,625
Sick of tracking you down.
What trouble are you in?

275
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,250
[KUWABARA] Well, uh, that's a
pretty long story, actually.

276
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,708
You know, tunnels and stuff.

277
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,708
Keiko?

278
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,375
Damn it, Puu!

279
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,875
You're like their
get-in-danger tour guide.

280
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,416
Don't you blame
this on him, Yusuke.

281
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,541
We only came because we
were worried about you.

282
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,916
[GENKAI]
We better move it.

283
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,541
This is a crime scene we
don't want to be a part of.

284
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,875
I'll stay here and make sure
Kido gets good treatment.

285
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,291
[YUSUKE] Yeah. We'll just
hope he can walk again.

286
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,541
[screeching brakes and sirens]

287
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,875
[POLICEMAN] Let's go, let's go!
Bravo team, follow me!

288
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,125
[DETECTIVE] Okay, Doctor,
let's go over this again.

289
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,166
You say you slashed
up your colleagues,

290
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,791
gave a nurse a three-foot scar,
and paralyzed a boy...

291
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,166
...because you
were helping them?

292
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,625
[THE DOCTOR] Detective, have you
ever looked in the mirror?

293
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,458
I mean really looked.
We're diseased.

294
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,041
We're suffering.

295
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,416
If you knew what's best,

296
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,875
you'd take that gun
from your little holster

297
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,666
and do yourself a favor.

298
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,041
Erasing every human, that's
the only way to save us,

299
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,750
or we'll eat and destroy until
nothing is left but piss.

300
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:34,708
Capturing me has only delayed
the inevitable. For us all.

301
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,458
[NARRATOR] Yusuke and his
team have defeated

302
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,833
the deranged human
psychic, Doctor.

303
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,791
But six still remain.

304
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,333
And the completion
of the Tunnel

305
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,208
draws nearer by the hour.

306
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,750
[KUWABARA]
Move over, posers,

307
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,791
the real man's
takin' the stage!

308
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,916
You didn't really
think I'd let Urameshi

309
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,250
do all the hero stuff, did you?

310
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,250
Hey look, there's
me beating him up.

311
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,791
Anyway, now that we've
taken out one of their own,

312
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,000
the psychics are
making a counter-push

313
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,250
to get this end-of-
