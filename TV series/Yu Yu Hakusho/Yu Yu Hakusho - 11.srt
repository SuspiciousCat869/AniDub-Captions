00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:22,291
And the first match
of the semifinals, begin!

160
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,791
What a shame for you.

161
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:42,041
Fighting two battles
in a row, both mismatched.

162
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,625
What?!

163
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,541
Everyone knows Kibano
would have defeated you

164
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,458
if not for your little trick.

165
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,583
And as for my own advantage,
well, you'll soon find out.

166
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,833
[KOENMA] This battle is looking
far from pleasant for Yusuke.

167
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,291
And if Yusuke gets beaten
and blows this case

168
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,791
I'm gonna get reamed for
making him Spirit Detective.

169
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,291
[GREEN OGRE]
Excuse me, Koenma sir!

170
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,458
What is it!

171
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,125
Phone call.

172
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,083
Can't you see I'm busy!

173
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,958
Hello, you've reached
the desk of Koenma,

174
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,708
mighty ruler
of the Spirit World.

175
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,916
I'm not here right now,

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
but would love
to talk to you later

177
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,833
if you're of any importance.

178
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,875
Please leave a message
after the beep.

179
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,750
Beep.

180
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,000
[KING YAMA] This is your father!

181
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,708
Where the hell are you?
You're in trouble, boy!

182
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,083
Wait! Dad! I was
just using the bathroom.

183
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,000
[KOENMA]
He hung up on me.

184
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,125
Sorry sir! It's not my fault!

185
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,166
Quiet!
It's always your fault, okay?

186
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,458
Could you be quiet sir?
The fight started.

187
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,458
Do you want me to hurt you?

188
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,583
[KAZEMARU] I'm surprised to find
someone else in this contest

189
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,375
who can use the Spirit
firing technique.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
Yeah, I'm pretty awesome huh?

191
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,291
[KAZEMARU] Of course,
it's nothing compared to mine.

192
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,250
Yeah good point.

193
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,791
Maybe we should agree not to use
them and just play fair.

194
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,208
Oh don't worry
I'd rather use... my fist!

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Okay, brace yourself!

196
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,166
What?

197
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,833
You can't even fight back.

198
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,541
Do something!

199
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,291
He's to tired to block a punch!

200
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,666
Don't give up Urameshi! Put
everything you got into one hit!

201
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,875
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Here's everything!

202
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,125
Oh perfect!

203
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,208
What the...?

204
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,375
Damn!

205
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,541
That would have finished
me if I hadn't dodged it.

206
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,458
I can't get that close.

207
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,458
Guess I'll have to,
fight long-distance!

208
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,208
You're, joking!

209
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,458
Shuriken Throwing
Knives, my favorite.

210
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,416
Oh, give me a break ninja boy!

211
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,166
I'm not too weak to dodge!

212
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,375
Hello! I was expecting
a more shocked reaction!

213
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,958
Did you not just see
me dodge your toys!

214
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,458
Not quite.

215
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,666
What?

216
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,625
Yusuke!

217
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,875
Those things
are behind you!!

218
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,875
Uh, oh!

219
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,791
Okay, they're like Boomerang
knives. That's a decent trick!

220
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,625
Actually they lock on
a person's Spirit's Energy.

221
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,458
And they can stay
up in the air for days

222
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,250
until hitting
their appropriate target.

223
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,291
Okay Yusuke.
Think of something!

224
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
All right.

225
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,708
Come on!!

226
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,250
[Yusuke cries out]

227
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,291
Oh perhaps I
neglected to mention

228
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,541
the gunpowder stored
in the tip of every blade.

229
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,333
They blow up on impact.

230
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,166
Even if you dodge the blades,
you can't avoid the explosion.

231
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,291
It's a done deal.

232
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,458
Yusuke!

233
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,541
How's he supposed
to get outta this?

234
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,666
It might be a good
time to tell him good bye.

235
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
I've already
done that once, okay!

236
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,625
[KOENMA] Kazemaru has
very strange powers.

237
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,041
Not unlike what a
demon would possess.

238
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,708
If he shows himself as Rando,
I'm afraid Yusuke is lost.

239
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,541
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Getting blown to pieces is

240
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,541
really going to piss me off.

241
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,500
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Not to mention letting

242
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,416
Rando win Genkai's power.

243
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,291
[YUSUKE THINKS] Guess
there's only one thing to do.

244
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,083
Make this explosion
worth something.

245
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,708
I'm a good guy Urameshi!

246
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,208
You have to listen
to me Kuwabara!

247
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,500
You have to win
the tournament now!

248
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,875
See ya!!

249
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,416
Well that's funny.
What do you think he meant?

250
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,583
I figured he wanted to win.

251
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,458
Oh dear!

252
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,583
I see, he knows he can't escape,

253
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,333
so he's decided to
kill two birds with one bomb.

254
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,416
He what? Urameshi!

255
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,750
Don't do it! Can't you think
this out a little more?!

256
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,458
Yusuke.

257
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,791
[KAZEMARU] Prepared for the
ultimate sacrifice, huh?

258
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,750
Well, he's forgotten my power.

259
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,000
You try whatever
you want, Ninja!

260
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,750
But I'm taking you with me.

261
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,916
Sorry, I have other plans.

262
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,166
[KAZEMARU]
What the...?!

263
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,333
He, disappeared!

264
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,458
You see that? He's gone!

265
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,333
Yusuke! Hello?

266
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,125
[KUWABARA] Hey, Urameshi!
Are you playing around?!

267
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,083
I'm gonna be mad if he can turn
invisible and nobody told me!

268
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,000
Only the dead can do that.

269
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,458
Then maybe he
jumped really high

270
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,000
and hasn't come
down yet or something.

271
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,500
[bubbling sound]

272
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,083
I found him.

273
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,541
Pretty clever,
hiding in the mud like that.

274
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,791
I wasn't hiding. I slipped.

275
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,083
You weren't hiding?!

276
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,625
Are you trying to tell me the
whole thing was an accident!

277
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,083
What whole thing?

278
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,750
You mean I actually
won the match?

279
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,666
[GENKAI] Kazemaru's power-up
emitted so much Spirit Energy

280
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,791
that it diverted the knives
toward him when you fell.

281
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,583
Your victory's a total fluke.

282
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,166
But then as I've said before.

283
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,666
Anything goes as long
as you can win the fight.

284
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,125
It isn't fair.

285
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,583
He's got a good point.

286
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,583
Guess this makes
up for the unluckiness

287
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,083
you had drawing lots.

288
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,000
Works for me.

289
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,833
[GENKAI]
Winner: Yusuke Urameshi!

290
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,666
Only three fighters are left.
I hope you're excited.

291
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,583
Well we've narrowed it down.

292
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,000
Kazemaru must not be Rando.

293
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,458
If he was, he would have
shown his true form

294
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,333
after being beaten.

295
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,833
Then, we've figured it out.

296
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,541
Shorin is Rando.

297
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,166
Let's move to the
second match of the semifinals.

298
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,125
It's not hard to guess.
Kuwabara versus Shorin.

299
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,416
[NARRATOR] And so the
numbers have thinned.

300
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Chinpoh, Kuroda, Musashi,
Kibano, and Kazemaru

301
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,458
have all been left
on the tournament floor.

302
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
Now Kuwabara must
face the young Shorin,

303
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,541
who by elimination must
be the demon Rando in disguise.

304
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,500
Can Kuwabara possibly be ready
for his first real fight,

305
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,916
against a creature of evil?

306
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,458
[YUSUKE] Hey
everybody, it's Yusuke.

307
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,625
Who would've thought Kuwabara

308
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,375
would be the one to
go up against Rando?

309
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,708
I mean he's strong,
but I'm the hero, right?!

310
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,541
Well at least he's
got that Spirit Sword,

311
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
because Shorin's
throwing fireballs,

312
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,583
and it looks like
he'll play a little ball.

313
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,583
The deadly,
fiery kind, that is.

314
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,625
But when things get really ugly,
you can bet I'll tag in.

315
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,083
And I guarantee one thing--
