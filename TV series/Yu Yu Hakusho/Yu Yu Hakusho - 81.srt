[NARRATOR] Former Spirit
Detective Shinobi Sensui

3
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,500
has captured Kuwabara,

4
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,833
with plans for Gourmet
to devour his abilities

5
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,208
and cut the barrier
around Demon World.

00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,708
Yusuke was hot on their trail,

7
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,833
until Sniper derailed him
with a barrage of deadly fire.

8
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,708
Unlikely aid came from Hiei,

9
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,541
who saved Yusuke
and killed Sniper.

10
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,125
Now they rejoin the others
to enter the enemy's hideout.

all the help we can get.

[KURAMA] Before we proceed,

13
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,291
let's go over what we
know about our enemy.

14
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,708
We know that there were seven
of them to begin with.

15
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,625
Yusuke took out Doctor.

16
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,750
[HIEI] And I did
away with Sniper.

17
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,833
[KURAMA] Yes. Seven
minus two leaves five.

18
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,958
And Mitarai's with us now
which means just four!

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,291
We know they'll head
back to Demon's Door Cave.

20
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,458
That's where we will go

21
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,333
to intercept them
and retrieve Kuwabara.

22
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,541
Oh we're done sitting on
our asses waiting patiently?

Your sarcasm won't
close it any faster.

26
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,041
But that's four
days earlier

27
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,291
than our team in Spirit
World was estimating!

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,541
Yeah, why do they keep
moving up the deadline?

29
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,416
It's like everyday the
tunnel's growing faster.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,958
When a psychic tampers with
the sort of power Itsuki has,

31
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,416
there is a tendency to be
overpowered and lose control.

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,666
Now that you mention it,

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,500
he did say it's going
faster than he thought,

34
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,958
like the tunnel has its
own life and wants to grow.

35
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,041
Or you could tell how fast it's
growing just by looking

36
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,833
at our fair city...
well... once fair.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,166
All the more reason for us
to storm the cave now

38
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,833
before the gateway
can expand any wider,

39
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,583
especially now that
they have Kuwabara.

40
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,416
If they can use his new-found
power to cut through dimensions

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,083
and release the higher
demons, we're done.

42
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
And while I seriously
doubt Kuwabara

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
would ever willingly
help Sensui...

44
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,166
But they don't need him to,
because they have Gourmet.

45
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,833
Right. According to Mitarai,

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,250
they are most likely going to
have this Gourmet eat his powers

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,000
so that he can then use them
to break the Kekkai barrier.

48
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,333
I saw him do it once,

49
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,958
and it was the most horrific
thing I'd ever seen.

50
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,625
He consumes their abilities
by literally eating them whole

51
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,000
while they're still alive.

52
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,291
Does he at least put somethin'
on em? Mustard? Chili?

53
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,625
No, he just eats them.

54
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,958
Once they're inside him,
their powers become his.

55
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,916
His territory exists entirely
within his stomach.

56
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,041
There goes that old
familiar wind again.

57
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,875
I think two days
is overly optimistic.

58
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,833
I guess that means it's time
for me to kick a little ass!

Before you go getting all
dimwitted and fist-happy,

61
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,083
we should send a small group
to scout out the cave.

62
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:13,250
Yusuke, Kurama, Hiei,
you'll be the first wave.

63

That way just in case
you all get killed

64
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,000
while you're down in there,

65
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,500
the rest of the world
still has a chance

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,208
of surviving this disaster.

67
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,958
We'll be the second
line of defense.

Hang back here.

Pardon me Master Genkai,

but shouldn't I go too
to show them the way?

71
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,708
Inside that cave
it's a maze,

than anyone else here.

should we trust you?

to Mr. Kuwabara than anybody.

to run a polygraph

I won't let you down!

79
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,833

last time you raced

80
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,208
into something
without thinking?

That's right.

what lessons can we take
with us from that experience

85

to this next one?

them in for questioning.

Where your team of seven
heroes must clash iron

158
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:33,083
with the evil Goblin King,
and restore peace to the town.

159
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,166
That's peculiar.

160
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
Oh yeah, of course!

161
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,458
I've seen it a million times!
That's the gate to Goblin City!

162
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,083
Goblin City?

163
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,500
A popular arcade game.

164
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,666
Uh-huh.

165
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,666
[ARCADE VOICE]
Welcome to Goblin City.

166
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,250
[YUSUKE] It's not
just any video game!

167
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,250
It's the video game.

168
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
You've gotta kill
the Goblin King

169
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,916
who's like this master
of every single game.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,083
But what's so sweet about
it is that it combines

171
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,500
all the different kinds
of games into one:

172
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,708
Sports, fighting, trivia,
puzzles, and so on.

173
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,000
The King challenges you
to different games at random,

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,958
and you've gotta beat
him at four out of seven

175
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,166
to free Goblin City.

176
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,041
Of course that doesn't explain
why it's come to life in a cave.

177
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,750
Amanuma, he is the
Game Master.

178
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,041
[GAME MASTER]
Welcome to my Territory!

179
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,875
Oh yeah, that's him all right.

180
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:29,750
[GAME MASTER] The
rules of the game are

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,250
the rules of my Territory,

182
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,125
and the rules of my Territory
are the rules of the game.

183
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,166
If his Territory is the game,

184
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,291
then we can't even
enter that door

185
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,416
unless we fit into
the game somehow.

186
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,708
And unfortunately we have
to pass through there

187
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,958
if we want to get
to where Itsuki is

188
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,416
and save Mr. Kuwabara
from Gourmet.

189
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,958
Does fitting in mean we gotta
dress up like medieval knights?

190
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,708
'Cause I left my breast
shield in my closet.

191
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,625
[GAME MASTER] I can't
see how many

192
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,208
players there are out there,

193
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,416
but your team must have seven
heroes to clash iron with me.

194
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
We got enough heroes to beat
you four times outta seven!

195
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,666
[GAME MASTER]
The rules say "seven!"

196
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,083
We have no choice but
to follow every guideline.

197
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,291
That's the only way we're
gonna get through that door.

198
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,666
Yes, it doesn't seem he's
going to be very flexible

199
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,416
with the rule that we
be a party of seven.

200
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,750
[GAME MASTER] Seven!

201
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,291
There must be seven heroes
to clash iron with me.

202
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,875
Shut up!

203
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,083
They must have guessed
we'd be cautious

204
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,958
and enter in a small
group at first,

205
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,208
and designed this to get
us all in here together.

206
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,708
I'll just follow
your light thingies

207
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,833
and run back to get
three from the outside.

208
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,708
It's too dangerous for
you to go alone.

209
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,041
We lose precious time,

210
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,625
but it's not as though we
can move any further.

211
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,916
Crap.

212
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,166
[GENKAI] Best laid plans!

213
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,916
Pity theirs were
better laid than ours.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,125
We're seven! Now where do
we stick the quarter?

215
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,458
[ARCADE VOICE]
Welcome to Goblin City,

216
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,333
where your team
of seven heroes

217
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,375
must clash iron with
the evil Goblin King,

218
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,583
and restore peace
to the town.

219
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,750
We're not in Mushiyori anymore.

220
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,041
[GAME MASTER]
You're in my Territory now!

221
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,708
Sure took ya long enough
to find seven people.

222
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,666
Sheesh, even I've
got six friends.

223
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,500
You're tellin' me that
that's the Game Master?

224
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,291
But he's just a
little pipsqueak!

225
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,708
I may be small,

226
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,083
but when it comes to video
games my talent's huge!

227
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,791
So let's play, shall we?

228
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,875
[ITSUKI] It's dilating so much
faster than I dared to dream.

229
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,500
I can hardly contain my
sense of achievement.

230
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,708
Take your time. No need to
make haste on their account.

231
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,958
The Game Master will have them
all occupied for hours

232
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,375
with his digital diversions.

233
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,166
I am but a ripple
in the pond now.

234
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,041
It determines its
own ebb and tide.

235
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,500
You better hurry
it up freakwads,

236
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,708
'cause if Urameshi and
the others are in this cave,

237
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,875
the stopwatch for your
survival time is ticking!

238
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,541
They'll put a cork in
your precious hole so fast...

239
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,791
[GOURMET]
Really?

240
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,666
You know I don't
like you very much,

241
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
and when Urameshi cuts me loose,

242
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,291
the first thing I'm gonna
do is hunt you down

243
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,791
and use my Spirit Sword to
shred you like a bank statement!

244
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,708
Pretty big words
comin' from a guy

245
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,250
who's as hard to catch
as a case of the clap!

246
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,666
That's not fair!

247
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,791
You had me outnumbered
when you caught me off guard!

248
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,583
Anyhoo, when Urameshi
gets here you're gonna be...

249
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,666
[SENSUI] That's not
going to happen.

250
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,458
Your merry band of misfits is in
the Game Master's Territory now.

251
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,583
They'll have to beat him
at his own game to get out.

252
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,166
And like I said,
that's not going to happen.

253
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,958
Games, huh?

254
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,458
[KUWABARA THINKS] I've never
seen Urameshi play games.

255
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,166
I wonder if he's any good.

256
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,041
[YANA] So, Urameshi, how do
you play this thing again?

257
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,750
You really know jack about
what normal people do, huh?

258
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,416
You see that big slot
machine-looking thing

259
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,833
over there?

260
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,500
That picks the category,
game type, and difficulty level.

261
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,375
It's teamwork. Each of us seven
heroes may play one game only.

262
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,583
We must win four games
to beat the Goblin King.

263
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,041
Who is played by me!

264
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,291
Now stop dawdling so I
can finally pull the lever

265
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,458
and we can play!

266
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,291
[YUSUKE] Chill out, kid!
Give us a minute!

267
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,083
[GAME MASTER] But I don't
want to give you a minute!

268
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,333
This is my Territory,

269
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,625
and if I say I want to
play now, we play now!

270
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm really beginning
to hate this kid!

271
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,208
I always thought if the
Goblin King possessed a kid,

272
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,500
it would be this way.

273
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,833
Never mind him. We need
to develop a strategy.

274
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,500
Now who among us has
played Goblin City before?

275
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,916
Ooh, I have! I have!
All the time!

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,083
[KAITOU]
I as well.

277
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,500
[SEA MAN] I play it from
time to time too.

278
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,708
Excellent. That's four
of us, including myself.

279
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,208
[GENKAI]
Make that five.

280
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,875
Uh, we're not talking about
Pong here, Grandma.

281
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,500
You think I been playin'
solitaire the last fifty years?

282
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,083
All right, so out
of all of us here,

283
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,791
who has actually
beaten the game?

284
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,000
Well to tell ya the truth,

285
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,291
I'm kinda hung up in
the middle somewhere.

286
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,541
I've only gotten to the ending
just a couple of times.

287
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,916
You've really gotten
that far, Grandma?

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,166
On my home system I can win
seventy-six percent of the time.

289
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,500
But I'm sure that's no
comparison with the success

290
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,583
rate of the great Suichi, is it?

291
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,250
No that's about my skill level.

292
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,333
Damn... I really did set the
game's record for sucky!

293
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,000
[KURAMA] Still, those
scores were all

294
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,708
against the real
Goblin King.

295
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,166
The Game Master must be an
even stronger player.

296
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,833
[KAITOU] Or else why would he
have chosen this game

297
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,333
to recreate in
his Territory?

298
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,125
Exactly. But before we can even
challenge the Goblin King,

299
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,125
we must defeat three
lower Goblins.

300
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,541
[GAME MASTER] Bored now!

301
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,416
I'm spinning the slots
and you can't stop me!

302
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
That's just fine.

303
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,708
[KURAMA]
Master Genkai.

304
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,708
Yeah.

305
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,125
[KURAMA]
Mitarai.

306
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,791
[KURAMA]
And Yusuke.

307
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,541
Oh, hell yeah!

308
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,500
Your group will take on
the three lower goblins.

309
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,666
Then after
