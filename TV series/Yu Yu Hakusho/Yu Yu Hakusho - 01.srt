[KID] May I have
my ball, please?

162
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
Listen kid! That's dangerous!

163
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,041
There are cars going by

164
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,041
that will splatter
you into the pavement!

165
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,458
Yeah! Mon-ster!

166
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,250
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Well if all else fails

167
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,375
I can still make kids happy.

168
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,750
Alright, now go
ahead and get lost.

169
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,875
It's not safe playing ball
around here, you understand?

170
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,125
Dammit, what's the use?

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,916
The kid can get smashed
by a car for all I care!

172
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Whoa! Watch out, kid!
Don't go into the road!

173
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,791
Hey!

174
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,000
Hey watch out!

175
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,208
[tires screeching]

176
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,416
[YUSUKE THINKS]
So that's it. I'm road kill.

177
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,000
But if that
was me down there...

178
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,625
...then who am
I up here, I wonder.

179
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,333
Could it mean--I've
turned into a ghost?!

180
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,416
[BOTAN] Bingo! Bingo!
You win the prize!

181
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,291
I didn't expect you to
figure it out so quickly!

182
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,125
[Botan laughs]

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
Who the hell are you?

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,000
When people die
unexpectedly like you just did,

185
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,208
often they can't accept
it and become ghosts.

186
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,166
You see?

187
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,833
You're not
answering my question!

188
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,291
Botan's my name the
pilot of the River Styx!

189
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,875
I take care of people like you!

190
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,875
I believe in your culture they
also call me the Grim Reaper!

191
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,458
Ring a bell?

192
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,708
A pretty girl like you?
Please, you're no Grim Reaper.

193
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,458
Well I'm not sure
if I should take that

194
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,791
as a compliment or an insult!

195
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,458
Plus if you were a
real messenger of death

196
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,208
you'd take this more seriously!

197
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,833
Like how grim can you
be when you say 'Bingo'?!

198
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,125
You're supposed to
wear a big black robe

199
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,833
and look like a skeleton!

200
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,666
Now I understand what
kind of person you are!

201
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,208
It's in my guide book!

202
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,750
Rather than be
scared or surprised,

203
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,958
you yell a lot and tell me

204
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,750
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

205
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,333
Yusuke Urameshi. Age 14.

206
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,583
Personality is impulsive
and ill-mannered

207
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,083
with a violent temper.

208
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,375
He has no respect for authority
and is a horrible student.

209
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,041
Things weren't looking
up for you, were they?

210
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,750
That's none of
your business!

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,333
[Botan laughs]

212
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,083
Alright then death lady.

213
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,333
Can you tell me what
happened to that kid I saved?

214
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,291
Like is he injured, or what?

215
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,041
You want to go visit him?

216
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,416
Mm-hm.

217
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,458
[DOCTOR] Well, we've
got the test results in.

218
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,958
He's got a few scrapes

219
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,708
but no signs of broken bones
or brain damage whatsoever.

220
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,791
[MOM]
Oh, thank goodness!

221
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,458
Look at that, he's really okay.

222
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,375
Alright Botan,
I've got no regrets,

223
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,041
so you can take me to Hell
or wherever it is I'm going.

224
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,958
[Botan laughs]

225
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,000
What's so funny about that?

226
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,625
Maybe you should
have let me talk earlier.

227
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,208
I'm not here to take you
away from this world.

228
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,750
Actually I'm here to see
if you'll accept an ordeal

229
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,833
that could give
you your life back.

230
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,708
An ordeal, really.

231
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,458
What in the world
are you blabbering about?!

232
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,583
It's funny Yusuke.

233
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
None of us were
expecting you to die today.

234
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,333
You've thrown us all for a loop!

235
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,875
Run someone with your
credentials through

236
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,583
that scenario a thousand times

237
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,875
and they never would have
saved a kid like that.

238
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,416
No one saw it coming,

239
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,333
and quite frankly we haven't
prepared a place for you yet!

240
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,916
Oh give me a freaking break!

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,333
Are you telling me you guys

242
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,791
were expecting that
little boy to die?

243
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,083
Well I wasn't
going to tell you this

244
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,375
because I knew it would
make you even more irritable.

245
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,166
But without the confusion caused
by you running into the street,

246
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,916
that boy would have
missed the car

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,333
and escaped with one less scrape

248
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,875
on his right shoulder.

249
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,500
What? But he was
headed right for him!

250
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,791
Yes, well the driver would
have veered to the left.

251
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,583
In other words your death
was a complete and utter waste!

252
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,083
Surprised? Yes I can
hardly blame you for that!

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,875
Cool your jets silly head,

254
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,666
I told you can
get a second chance,

255
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,208
don't you remember?

256
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,958
Just go through
this little eency ordeal

257
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,291
and you can be
back to life in no time!

258
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,375
You should feel special!

259
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,000
Unexpected cases such as this

260
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,208
only happen once
every hundred years!

261
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,375
You're just like the
teachers in my school!

262
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,000
No idea what's
actually going on!

263
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,958
[BOTAN]  What's that
supposed to mean?

264
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,500
I know exactly what's happening,

265
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,916
and I'm saying you can fix
it if you follow a few steps!

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come on, it's a pretty
good deal, don't you think?

267
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,833
[YUSUKE]
Maybe, but no thanks.

268
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,750
I think I like being a ghost.

269
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,000
You said yourself my life
was kind of pathetic, right?

270
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,708
Everyone's gonna be much
happier now that I'm erased.

271
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,916
My teachers will be able
to rest their big mouths.

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,083
Plus my mom'll be able
to party whenever she wants

273
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,625
and not have to worry
about where I'm at, huh?

274
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,041
[BOTAN] I'm sorry you feel that
way. At such an early age.

275
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,375
Yeah well you've gotta agree

276
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,916
there's no point in me
doing some stupid ordeal.

277
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,875
I don't guess there's any point
making big decisions in a hurry.

278
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,916
Why don't you spend some time at
your wake and think it over.

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,833
I'll come back when you decide!

280
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,916
You got worms
in your ears, lady?!

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,416
I did decide!

282
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,791
[laughter]

283
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,083
Whoa, all my
classmates are here?

284
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,875
Just like I thought.
Look at 'em laughing.

285
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,125
They probably
just came over here

286
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,250
'cause they're
getting extra credit!

287
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,333
[GIRL]
Keiko, please.

288
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,333
Yusuke. Yusuke.

289
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,791
No!

290
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,500
Is she making
all that racket for me?

291
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,333
[THUG] Come on,
let's go back. This isn't right.

292
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,833
[KUWABARA] Shut up!
Let go of me, would 'ya!!

293
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,500
What?! Kuwabara!!

294
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,666
Damn you! You think you can just
back out because you're scared!

295
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,625
[THUG] Kuwabara!
This place is for mourning.

296
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,291
I'm not going to leave!

297
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,125
Not until he comes out of
here and lets me fight him!

298
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,708
[THUG] He can't do that!

299
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,375
I'm going to beat you down,
you punk! You hear me?!

300
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,125
[KUWABARA] Who do you
think you are, huh?! Dirty punk!

301
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,291
Who am I going to fight now?!
Who am I going to fight?!

302
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,750
[THUG]
He's gone!

303
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,875
No!

304
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,916
[KUWABARA] You're supposed
to be here. For me!

305
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,083
[THUG] Come on
Kuwabara. Let's go.

306
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,208
Sorry about all that!

307
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,750
[KUWABARA] No! No!

308
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,791
Who would have guessed.

309
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,833
Did you see those scums?

310
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,708
They're just some losers
that Urameshi hung out with.

311
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,375
Too bad that car wasn't
big enough for them too.

312
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,333
[IWAMOTO]
Now, now.

313
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,541
We should be glad.

314
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,041
After a life of being worthless

315
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,416
Yusuke did something to give our
school a good reputation.

316
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,375
Well between you
and me Mr. Iwamoto,

317
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,541
I'd say he probably saved
that little kid on accident

318
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,041
while he was trying
to knock him down

319
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
and steal all his lunch money.

320
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,125
I wouldn't be surprised
by that, Mr. Akashi.

321
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,375
Even at my own
wake they knock me!

322
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,000
If I could only...!

323
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,916
What do suppose
is more disgraceful,

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,333
that boy shouting in misery

325
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,875
or you're insensitive
and idiotic words!

326
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,291
Takenaka.

327
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,250
At first I was
so surprised, Yusuke.

328
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,458
To hear you'd saved a kid
at the cost of your own life.

329
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,000
You've always acted much
more selfishly than that.

330
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,958
Darn... Yusuke

331
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,458
I don't know why I don't
feel like speaking well of you.

332
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,291
Why didn't you stay?

333
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,166
You could have made
something great out of yourself!

334
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,000
Yusuke.

335
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:39,416
[Atsuko cries]

336
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,416
[MOTHER]
This way.

337
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,291
[KID]
Yes mommy.

338
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,375
Now you should say
something to honor him.

339
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,958
Thank you for
saving me and making faces.

340
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,166
[BOY] Mommy.

341
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,333
Do you think it'd be okay if
I played with that boy tomorrow?

342
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,083
If I'm good?

343
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,250
No, son.

344
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,291
I know some people sounded angry
at him but he's really nice!

345
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,875
He made really funny faces at
me too, and he got me my ball!

346
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,125
I don't know why those
people were crying like that,

347
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,291
it was probably because they
wanted to play with him too!

348
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,125
Well, have you decided?

349
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,916
Botan, hey.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,083
Yes dear?

351
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,083
Have you ever not
known about something?

352
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,958
That seemed obvious
to everybody else?

353
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,708
That happens to us all I think.

354
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,291
So are you ready now?

355
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,625
Yeah, I am.

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,333
[BOTAN]
Good to hear!

357
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,416
Now let's not waste any
time and get this baby started!

358
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,041
Hey, where are
you gonna take us?

359
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,208
To the Spirit World!

360
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,916
To the what?!

[BOTAN]
The Spirit World!

362
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,833
We're gonna see someone who
will explain the ordeal to you,

363
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,208
and give you what you need!

364
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,208
What! What do I need?!

365
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,166
[BOTAN]
You'll see!

366
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Hey!

00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,166
[NARRATOR] And
that's the way it is!

368
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,250
After his first
day of being dead,

369
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,375
Yusuke has agreed to
undergo a mysterious ordeal

370
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,375
that could win back his life.

371
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,416
But what adventures await
him in the Spirit World?

372
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,333
[BOTAN] Hello everybody!
It's Botan!

373
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,833
We're going to
the Spirit World

374
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,708
to meet some very
interesting people.

375
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,708
Don't let that
pacifier fool you!

376
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,625
Koenma is a very wise ruler,

377
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,416
and he'll give Yusuke
his first glimpse

378
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,541
at the ordeal
to restore his life!

379
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,250
Let's just hope something big

380
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,958
and terrible doesn't
hatch from that golden egg!

381
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,416
And back in the living world,

382
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,291
Yusuke must reach
the people closest to him,

383
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,250
so they don't
get rid of his body!

384
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,666
And things get really crazy

385
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,916
when he runs into
his greatest rival!

386
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,125
It's sure to be exciting,
when Yu Yu Hakusho continues!
