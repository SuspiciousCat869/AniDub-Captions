00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,708
[BOTAN] Minds occupied
by this parasite

159
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,916
develop a need for destruction,
physical power, and murder...

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,291
It will be a disaster.

161
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,291
Well can't we tell people!
I mean there's gotta be a cure.

162
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,500
[BOTAN]
There is...

163
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,000
But ordinary people
can't see the insects.

164
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,208
The inflicted will be
seen as merely psychotic,

165
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,916
and I'm afraid a cure will not
be first on the human's mind.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,791
Then what the hell are
we supposed to do?!

167
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,791
The only way to rescue this city
is to kill the Makai insects,

168
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,625
and the only way to do that is
by destroying the whistle,

169
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,916
which the enemies possess.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,375
A whistle?

171
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,083
Without the whistle's
sustaining frequency,

172
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,500
the Makai can't live
outside of Spirit World.

173
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,333
So, how long do we have before
these beasts leave their castle

174
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,166
and come to Earth themselves?

175
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
At this point they can't.

176
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,333
For years we've had them
trapped inside the city

177
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,875
with a barrier wall.

178
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,583
[BOTAN] Now, with this
threat of insect invasion,

179
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,000
they hope to force
us to open the barrier.

180
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,916
I see. So they give you the
whistle if you open up the wall.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,583
Instead we'll make
a small breach

182
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,833
in the wall to let you in.

183
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,125
Eventually they'll find
this hole themselves.

184
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,666
And what if I'm not
able to beat them?

185
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,375
I don't think I have to
tell you what would happen

186
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,875
if all the demons from that
city were unleashed on Earth.

187
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,125
I have to be honest Botan. This
takes the record for confusing.

188
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,375
Yes, just try
and remember the basics.

189
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
You're good and
that entire city is bad.

190
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,416
Destroy the whistle
and defeat the beasts,

191
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,250
and the case will be closed.

192
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,125
Okay, I just can't
believe Koenma

193
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,916
expects me to take on a whole
freaking city of demons alone.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,750
Don't they send teams out
for this kind of thing!

195
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,125
What about
me, Urameshi?

196
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,458
Oh Kuwabara! There's
no such thing as demons!

197
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,625
Yusuke and I were just joking!

198
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,500
[KUWABARA]
Look I'm not dumb.

199
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,458
Or blind.

200
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,916
We all know I can
see supernatural stuff

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,291
a whole lot better than Yusuke.

202
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,166
And I'm not gonna
sit around my house

203
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,041
while Yusuke doesn't see things

204
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,416
and lets big monsters and
insects take over my city!

205
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,666
'Cause I'm Kuwabara
and in case you guys forgot.

206
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,416
I've got a sword!

207
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,000
Well Yusuke,

208
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,208
I guess there's no point
arguing with the eager.

209
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,000
Watch for dust.

210
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,416
[YUSUKE] Gee,
thanks for the warning.

211
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,791
[YUSUKE] Banging on the
floors of random warehouses.

212
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,708
Seems like fun to me.

213
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,916
This is where they
were supposed to put

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,166
the breach in the barrier.

215
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,666
[BOATN]
Bingo.

216
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,750
You are they gonna give us
a rope ladder or something?

217
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,625
No, jumping down
should land you safely

218
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,750
on the outer bank of the city.

219
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,791
You know you don't have
to go through with this

220
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,875
if you don't want to. No one
will hold it against you.

221
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,291
Oh, Okay! Good bye!

222
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,083
[BOTAN]
Not you!

223
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,541
The Spirit Detective doesn't
have a choice in this.

224
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,125
Kuwabara does.

225
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,500
Don't worry about me lady.

226
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,750
I sort of feel like a
Spirit Detective myself now.

227
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
And as for detectives
there's no turning back!

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
[BOTAN]
He really jumped.

229
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,250
Maybe he'll be okay alone.

230
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,125
Okay, okay.

231
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
Not yet!

232
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:13,541
Here! I'm supposed to give
you this Communication Mirror!

233
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,333
Geez! You nearly forgot
to give me this thing?!

234
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,333
Let me guess--without
it I'd probably be killed!

235
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,291
No.

236
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,750
It's not a weapon, it's
just a Communication Mirror,

237
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,916
so I can keep in contact with
while you're on the other side.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,333
Yeah yeah, leave me on my own

239
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,750
while you go do
other things... Oh no!

240
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,875
What's the matter now, Yusuke?

241
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,583
Keiko! I just dumped her
off at the movie theater!

242
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,291
Yusuke you brat!

243
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,375
Hey Botan, tell you what,
why don't you go take care

244
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,541
of things with her and
I'll go down here.

245
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,791
Now wait!

246
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,416
Yusuke! I don't want to do that!

247
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,208
[thunder]

248
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
Oh damn!

249
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,916
[YUSUKE] Well,
I guess this is the place.

250
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,291
[muffled grunts and groans]

251
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes, we've found a treat!

252
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,125
What, are those things?

253
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,375
I'm not exactly sure,
but they're not friendly.

254
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,916
We will dig in.

255
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,250
[Kuwabara cries out]

256
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,458
Urameshi!
There's too many of 'em!

257
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,833
And I'm not sure but I
think they want to eat me!

258
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,875
I'm coming!

259
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,125
This is gonna be pretty lame

260
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,541
if we get killed before
we reach the stupid castle!

261
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:59,500
[Fugaki cry out]

262
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:08,791
That worked... whatever it was.

263
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,333
[KURAMA] It seems
you could use some help.

264
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,000
[HIEI] If those nothings
were too much for you,

265
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,666
we're going to have
some serious trouble.

266
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,666
[thunder]

267
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,875
[YUSUKE] Well, well,
well! The thieves!

268
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,250
Hello.

269
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,166
Well, what are you doing here?

270
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,916
Even that fool Koenma knew it
would take more than human power

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,916
to kill the Saint Beasts.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,583
By aiding in this mission,

273
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,833
Koenma has assured us

274
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,875
we can clean our
slates in Spirit World.

275
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,666
I guess Koenma
heard me complaining.

276
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,291
Hey Kuwabara, let me
introduce you to these guys.

277
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,666
That's Hiei,
and his name is Kurama.

278
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,875
A pleasure.

279
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,666
Well I don't have
a clue what going on,

280
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,333
but it sure is nice
to have a helping hand!

281
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,500
Helping is not the right word.

282
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,833
Koenma may regard us
as equals but I do not.

283
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,125
Once inside the castle I
suggest you let us do the work.

284
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,375
As far as I'm concerned
we're baby sitting.

285
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,916
Listen you puny jerk-face,

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,291
I'm gonna have to beat you up

287
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,500
if you keep talking
down to us that way!

288
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,333
Let's avoid fighting.
You're not worth it.

289
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh that's it!!

290
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
But you, Detective,
are a different story.

291
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,708
I plan to take
my revenge on you,

292
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,708
so consider this fair warning!

293
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,333
You wanna ignore me, huh?!

294
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,000
Hiei, we must face
this current business

295
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,250
before you start your own.

296
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,583
Don't worry three-eyes,

297
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,250
if we survive this
I'll be glad to take you on!

298
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,833
Now is this a
perfect team or what?!

299
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,125
[GENBU] What a strange
group of visitors.

300
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,166
No match for us, of course.

301
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,916
[SEIRYU]
Master, what shall we do?

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,166
[SUZAKU] Byakko is correct.
They are no reason to worry.

303
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,291
Look at them fighting
one another already.

304
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,416
They'll never even
pass the front gate.

305
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,208
[Suzaku, Seiyu, Genbu laugh]

306
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,416
[YUSUKE] Wow now
this place homey.

307
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,750
[KUWABARA] So I guess were
just gonna walk right in?

308
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,333
Any prize that's worth having
usually requires a risk.

309
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,875
I say we make 'em come out here

310
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,833
and fight us up front like
they're not a bunch of sissies!

311
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,875
Your sense of
strategy is amazing.

312
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,208
Are you talkin'
to me, runt-boy?!!

313
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,333
Let's go.

314
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,583
Stupid dwarf.

315
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,333
[EYE BAT]
Welcome to Maze Castle.

316
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,750
Whoa, it talked!

317
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,583
[EYE BAT] Those who enter
Maze Castle must be tried

318
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,833
by the Gate of Betrayal.

319
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,833
What do you mean tried? 

320
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,916
Urameshi.

321
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,666
Why did you have to ask?

322
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
The ceiling!

323
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,541
[EYE BAT]
Heavy, isn't it?

324
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,375
Sensors in the corridor
are most intelligent,

325
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,250
and a complex
assembly of gears

326
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,375
adapts the ceiling's
weight precisely

327
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,833
to the strength of its victims.

328
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,750
[EYE BAT]
Of course, there is a catch.

329
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,791
Just enough lee-way remains
for one person to escape,

330
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,416
leaving their friends to
be crushed by the weight.

331
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,666
Damn it!

332
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
[EYE BAT] But decisions
must be made quickly.

333
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,416
Not even the four
of you combined

334
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,625
can hold the ceiling for long.

335
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,750
Insist on teamwork,
and everyone will be crushed.

336
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,875
Only by turning
against your friends

337
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,250
will one of you
be able to escape.

338
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,708
Only the traitor among you
deserves to enter Maze Castle.

339
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,041
That's why it's called
the Gate of Betrayal, you see?

340
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,958
[Eye-Bat cackles]

341
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,000
Boy I'd like to get my
hands on that bat-thing!

342
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,500
Stay focused on the weight
or you'll kill us all!

343
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,916
Oh sure blame me!

344
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,250
I bet I'm holding up a
lot more weight than you are!

345
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,708
Shut it Kuwabara!

346
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,958
Well I'm not about to die

347
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,125
for the sake of
you worthless humans!

348
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,333
Don't you even
consider it, Hiei!

349
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,333
Oh man! I knew we should
have played some trust games.

350
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,875
[NARRATOR] How can this
unwilling troupe of fighters

351
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,125
survive such
an impossible trap?!

352
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,625
Will one betray the others?

353
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,416
Or will the
gate crush them all?

354
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,333
[YUSUKE] Okay some how
some way we'll all escape

355
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,750
from the gate of betrayal.

356
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,916
But deep down you
probably knew that.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm not to sure about
this next one though.

358
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,958
When Kurama faces
one of the saint beast

359
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,166
and he's using a... rose?

360
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,375
This beast is made of solid
rock and he can do it all

361
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,583
but Kurama's got a few
surprises of his own.

362
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,750
It's going to be
an unbelievable fight--

363
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,625
let's just hope the castle
doesn't crash down too.
