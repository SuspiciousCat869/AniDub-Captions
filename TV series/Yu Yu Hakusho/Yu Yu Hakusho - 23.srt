00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,083
He'll no doubt feel the
need to execute everyone

160
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,291
including the servants
and the family dog!

161
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,500
[KOENMA] The family dog
will indeed be unfortunate.

162
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,375
But the humans.

163
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,375
Well it's a serious crime
for demons to take human life

164
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,458
no matter what
the circumstances.

165
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,375
You know that.

166
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,208
It's best not to worry.

167
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,291
Even if Hiei is
heading for the compound,

168
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,416
I'm confident he
will work with Yusuke.

169
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,625
I'm surprised
you're so calm, Kurama,

170
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,708
since if Hiei does harm
you'll be punished with him.

[nervous laughter]

172
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,250
[KOENMA] Well, you'd
better come tuck me in.

173
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,416
We'll record the rest on tape.

174
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,583
[BLUE OGRE] Yes sir.

175
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,625
[SURGEON] Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

176
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,958
[SURGEON] The fusion between
you and the Jagan Eye

177
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,875
will be much more
painful than you imagine.

178
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,958
I have to lock
you down to the table

179
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,958
to keep you from
ripping out your own eyes.

180
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,250
I have earplugs for myself.

181
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,041
I won't say a word. Just do it.

182
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:54,416
Everyone screams. The only
question is, what will you say?

183
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,125
Yukina!

184
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,875
[BOTAN] Did you hear something?

185
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,791
[YUSUKE] No, would
you get up Kuwabara?

186

[thunder]

187

All of the members
of the Black Black Club

188
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,333
have been notified
of the meeting, sir.

189
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,791
[NARRATOR] Black Black Club:

190
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,000
a secret society hand-picked
by Gonzou Tarukane,

191
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,208
known for their
wickedness and influence

192
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,583
in the criminal underworld.

193
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,041
How ya doin' boys?

194
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,750
Must admit I'm surprised
to see all five of ya

195
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,375
on such short notice.

196
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,500
I for one would meet
even on my deathbed.

197
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
Well said!

198
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,708
This is our only
means of entertainment!

199
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,333
Yeah, world's
gotten too clean

200
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,125
to have fun
anywhere else!

201
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,916
[TARUKANE] Well fun, gentlemen,

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,583
is exactly why I
called you today.

203
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,208
Let me cut to the bone here-

204
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,833
As we speak, intruders
are heading toward my house.

205
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,500
So let's start a betting
pool on if they make it.

206
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,500
Or if my security beats them.

207
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,208
Well that would hardly be
a challenging proposition,

208
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,541
Tarukane.

209
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,625
We have no reason to
believe that these intruders

210
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
could survive your demons.

211
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,916
Wait--let me give out more
information before you decide.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
Hit it!

213
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,541
The situation is
really quite simple, sirs.

214
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
There are three intruders.

215
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,416
They are walking through the
forest toward our stronghold.

216
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,208
Twelve from the Apparition
Gang are moving to stop.

217
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,208
Come now, they're children.

218
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,166
I don't know why
you're so anxious

219
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,083
to give away money Tarukane,

220
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,333
offering a gambling pool

221
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,875
where the odds are
so ridiculously stacked.

222
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,000
[CLUB MAN 1] Have you gone mad?

223
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,541
Let's get on with the
bidding. You got two choices.

224
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,291
Pick either the demons
or the intruders to win.

225
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,166
Sakashta will
show you the stakes.

In the event of a win

227
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,875
Mister Tarukane will pay
double of what you bid.

[TOGURO 2] News has been
circulating recently about

234
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,375
two humans boys with
extraordinary spirit energy.

235
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,791
It is said that they have
defeated the Four Saint Beasts

236
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,291
as well as the
human-hunter Rando,

extremely powerful demons.

There is a very good chance
these intruders are those boys.

00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,666
And if they are...

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,208
The first group of fighters
in my Apparition Gang

241

will suffer most unpleasantly.

Tell me you're not
gettin' cold feet!

246

I will wager five billion

That's absurd!

Yes, absurd!

A trio of human misfits can't
take on twelve different demons!

In normal circumstances, no,

251
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,625
but I have a
certain little hunch.

252
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,625
I've heard a rumor
about two boys who have

253
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,333
been hunting down demons.

254
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,791
And I believe it's
a risk worth taking.

Where'd he get that
kind of information?!

him better in the next round!

[CLUB MAN 3]
Me too!

317
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,291
[CLUB MAN 4]
Yes. Same for me.

318
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,375
Twenty billion on
the intruders this time.

319
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,083
[All] What??

320
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,916
[CLUB MAN 4]
Twenty billion? On those humans?

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,916
[CLUB MAN 3] Yeah,
that's Sakyou for 'ya.

322
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,375
Doesn't know when to quit!

323
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,958
Obviously that man is not
thinking with his brain.

324
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,333
No one's askin' for
your opinion, broad!

325
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,083
Just go do your stuff!

326
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,416
We'll take care of them.

327
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,375
[BOTAN] What a waste
of a gorgeous home!

328
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,625
What's going on?

329
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,416
Sounds like a
friggin' war zone!

330
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,333
Don't be alarmed, boys.

331
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,125
Those poor intruders must
have met up with my land mines.

332
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,208
Yusuke! Kuwabara!

333
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,708
Oh please!

334
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,458
Bingo!

335
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,958
Who are these people??

336
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,916
Hello there intruders,
my name is Miyuki.

337
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,208
How'd you like a fight?

338
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,416
[NARRATOR] The boys have barged
into Tarukane's stronghold.

339
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,750
But can they defeat
the demon Triad,

340
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,833
the Toguro Brothers,
Tarukane, and save Yukina??

341
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,083
[YUSUKE] Don't let that glossy,
purple lipstick fool you!

342
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
This girl isn't
out for a good time,

343
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,625
unless, of course, it
includes stringing me up

344
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,125
and swinging me around like
I'm a giant Yusuke piñata!

345
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,208
And Kuwabara keeps yelling--

346
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,625
[KUWABARA] Don't hit girls!

347
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,916
[YUSUKE] But even if I do find
a way to take her down,

348
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
she's only the first
of the Demon Triad!

349
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,375
We still have two more
powerful demons to face!

350
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,916
It's buy one battle
and get two free,

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,791
on the next jam-packed
episode of Yu Yu Hakusho!
