00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,416
[NARRATOR] Former Spirit
Detective Shinobu Sensui

2
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
is in his final stage of
opening a tunnel to Demon World,

3
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,625
and ending the human race.

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,791
Current Spirit Detective
Yusuke Urameshi

5
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,125
is the only one
who can stop him.

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,833
In a cave deep below the city,
the battle has been intense.

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,708
But the gap between
the detectives' powers

8
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,416
has proven too great.

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,166
Just as Yusuke seemed to find a
detour around Sensui's defenses,

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,583
Sensui underwent
a transformation,

11
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,250
not of the body,
but of the mind.

12
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,166
He in fact has seven
different personalities.

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,958
Kazuya, the cruelest and
most violent of them all,

14
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:14,000
has emerged to send Yusuke to a
place he's been once before:

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,625
his grave.

16
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,291
Get it, Koenma?

17
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,000
Just stay back.

18
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,208
Shut up, you little shit!

19
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:36,250
[KUWABARA] No! Get that gun
away from him, you wack-job!

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,500
We can't even help him!

21
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,208
I can't take it!

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,291
But you don't have a choice.

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,041
As you see, I haven't lied.

24
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,000
This specter's belly
is a separate reality,

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,166
and we are trapped inside.

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,875
The only way to transfer out
of it is through my power,

27
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,541
which I'm sure
you'll never possess.

28
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,208
You... traitor!

29
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,458
[KUWABARA grunts]

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,250
What's that for?!
I'm gonna smash him!

31
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,916
Why don't you think a little.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,875
Ituski's the only one
who can free us.

33
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,916
Kill him, and we'll
be trapped here.

34
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,708
[KOENMA]
Please, Sensui.

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,583
Doesn't humanity have
enough sins already?

36
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,916
This ain't a sin.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,166
It's just the first step

38
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,875
in pushing justice and
order into the universe.

39
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,041
If it makes you feel better,

40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,333
we can just call it
capital punishment.

41
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,000
[KOENMA]
No! Don't do it!

42
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,833
There's nothing much I like
better than brains on a wall.

43
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,875
[SENSUI]
Huh?

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,333
[YUSUKE]
Spirit Gun!

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,208
[YUSUKE groaning]

46
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,375
[KOENMA grunting]

47
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,958
[YUSUKE]
Shoulda' been his head.

48
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,166
[BOTAN]
What's that?

49
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,708
Yusuke's Spirit Gun.
There's no mistaking it.

50
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,125
Must've fired the big one.

51
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,000
You think it was enough
to have defeated Sensui?

52
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,583
I'd like to say so.

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,583
A blast like that was enough to
cut down Toguro at top strength.

54
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,541
But Sensui's signal
still feels the same,

55
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,500
and after that shot, Yusuke will
be as good as a toy pistol.

56
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,875
Heh. I didn't realize you
still had so much energy left.

57
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,333
You nearly caught
me by surprise.

58
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,583
Yeah? Well, imagine
my surprise, pal.

59
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,125
I had a whole mental picture
of what you'd look like

60
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,166
as a heap of charcoal.

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,250
The look really suited you, too.

62
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,750
[KOENMA]
No! Get up!

63
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,458
[SENSUI laughing]

64
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,208
[KOENMA]
Bad time for laughter, Sensui.

65
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,458
Do you really think

66
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
I'll let you go on like
this one moment longer?

67
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,458
[KOENMA]
I'm no human.

68
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,875
I don't have their limitations.
I'll stop you whatever the cost.

69
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,541
[laughing]

70
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,625
[KOENMA] Since I helped make
you, I'll give you warning.

71
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,166
Stop this plan before
I am forced to act.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,708
"Helped to make me."

73
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,500
Yeah, you got no idea
how right you are.

74
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,458
It's just freaking hilarious.

75
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,083
Can't get me if you
don't know what I am.

76
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,083
[KOENMA]
What do you mean?

77
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,541
I know you enough.

78
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,416
Nah, you know that
goody two-shoes Shinobu,

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,916
but you don't got
the smallest tip-off on me.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,583
So, let me give you
the first peak.

81
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,666
Name's Kazuya, and Shinobu's
taking a little nap right now,

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,416
which was my idea.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,291
I show when the other
six can't handle it.

84
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,333
[KOENMA]
Hold on, the other six?

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,625
That's right,
it's a party in here.

86
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,208
And don't get me wrong,
some may rub me the wrong way,

87
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
but we see enough in common.

88
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,666
We all sprung
this plan together.

89
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,958
All seven of us.

90
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,250
So, that is what he meant.

91
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,833
The thought Murota read from
his mind was misinterpreted.

92
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,500
By seven, we assumed he meant
the psychics he recruited.

93
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,833
[SENSUI] Let's dig
a hole. Each one of us.

94
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,708
Seven graves will be
a decent start.

95
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,958
We assumed Sensui
cared for his team,

96
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,625
but, in truth, the seven
were his own personalities.

97
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,166
The psychics were expendable.

98
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,708
He planned to be sole
survivor from the start.

99
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,125
That's correct.

100
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,916
As his partner from
the naïve years,

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,833
I'm the only one who realized,
but I can take care of myself.

102
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,791
It was the night of
the raid when it began,

103
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,166
when he learned his murders
as humanity's defender

104
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,916
could not be justified.

105
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,750
[ITSUKI] The guilt was
too much for Shinobu,

106
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,166
so Kazuya was created

107
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,166
to take responsibility
for these deplorable acts.

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,125
[ITSUKI]
Yet, as the plan fermented,

109
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,458
he saw violence
would not be enough.

110
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,708
He needed to recruit help
through lies and manipulation.

111
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,208
More sins Shinobu
could not face.

112
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,083
So, Minoru appeared: the orator.

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,208
[ITSUKI]
And so it went.

114
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,833
At every moral crisis that stood
in the way of Sensui's plan,

115
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,500
a new personality would
be forged to do the work.

116
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
It solved the paradox
of how one can punish,

117
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,166
if doing so requires you
to commit the very same sins.

118
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,583
This way, his core soul could
remain morally undefiled.

119
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,041
Of the seven personalities,
one of them is a girl.

120
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,625
She has a beautiful mind,

121
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,375
capable of the most delicate
and loving thoughts and poetry

122
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,083
that I've ever heard spoken.

123
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,791
She would talk to me
in the dead of night,

124
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,375
always crying, venting sorrows,
that, if not expressed,

125
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,208
would've killed Sensui
from a broken heart.

126
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,375
Besides Shinobu,
I favor her the most.

127
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,416
Sometimes I think we're in love.

128
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,541
What are you saying?!

129
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,875
No, don't answer. I don't wanna
catch your crazy disease!

130
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,750
[KOENMA]
I don't doubt you, Kazuya.

131
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,916
I honor your true existence, and
I admit I can't relate with you.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,291
Call Shinobu. Please,
I need to speak with him.

133
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,333
Ha!

134
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,166
Hey, Shinobu. You awake yet?

135
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,000
Shinobu!

136
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,125
[laughs] He's sayin' he
don't wanna talk to ya.

137
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,458
He sayin' he hates you too much.

138
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,458
[KOENMA] But he pays
attention to what I say,

139
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,125
doesn't he, Kazuya?

140
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,583
Shinobu, listen to me.

141
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,250
This isn't the answer
you're seeking.

142
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,458
It's not too late to stop--

143

[SENSUI]
Sorry, princie.

144
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,500
But you're wrong about that.

145
00:08:55,583 --> 00:09:03,416
[DEMONS grumbling]

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,125
The calming period is
over, it's stabilized.

147
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,666
Face it, little prince,
we've all chosen our fate.

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,375
[KOENMA]
Then so have I.

149
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,666
[NARRATOR]
The Mafuuken,

150
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,833
also known as the Conscious
Ring, or the Wicked Seal.

151
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,500
When fully powered, it is
the strongest defensive spell

152
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,333
in all of Spirit World.

153
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,208
For centuries, Koenma has
transferred his Spirit Energy

154
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,083
into his pacifier, the vehicle
for his Mafuuken spell.

155
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,291
A precaution for darker times.

156

When released,
the Mafuuken will create

ensnare the encroaching enemy.

158
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,875
Far more powerful than
the Kekkai between worlds,

159
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,750
it specializes on demons,

160
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,125
and can even trap
the S-Class with ease.

161

[growls]

162
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
If I engage this Mafuuken,

163
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,416
it will first seal
the precious tunnel

164
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
that you've poured
your life into creating.

165
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,875
Then, I'll trap you
inside the net,

166
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,583
and you'll never move again.

167
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,625
[SENSUI]
Huh?

168
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,291
I've kept this thing
between my teeth

169
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,083
for most of my existence,
giving it my Spirit Energy.

170
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,541
It was for humanity's next dark
day in a few hundred years.

171
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,500
Yet, you give me no choice
but to use it now.

172
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,083
Well, you're just as
stupid as Shinobu says.

173
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
You can't use that fancy
weapon on little old us.

174
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,541
Who's gonna save the humans
in that supposed dark time now?

175
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,083
We must handle each new
dilemma as it comes to us.

176
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,750
If your plan is
allowed to continue,

177
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,791
in a few hundred years there
will be nothing left to save.

178
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,583
This way your
conspiracy will end.

179
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,166
You're finished, Sensui,
unless you plan to kill me.

180
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,333
My, my. You really
ain't screwin' around.

181
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,791
You should consult
with your other sides.

182
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,833
Are you really ready
to be damned?

183
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,458
Because surrender and torment
are your only choices.

184
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,333
We'll chat it over.

185
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,458
[KOENMA] If only I could
rearrange the gears

186
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,625
turning in your head. I don't
want to use this on you.

187
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,208
Please, return to
the Sensui you were.

188
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,083
[KOENMA] If there has
ever been a human destined

189
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,166
to be Spirit Detective,
it was you.

190
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,333
You were born with
incredible powers,

191
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,000
and an obsession for making
things right... and just.

192
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,791
[KOENMA]
It was my fault.

193
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,000
I was too eager
to close the case.

194
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,208
How could I not have
known how you would react

195
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,375
when you saw the
darkest vices of man.

196
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,750
When you realized
your life's work

197
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,750
of protecting humans from demons

198
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,500
was not a crusade of pure
justice, but a study in gray.

199
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,875
[SENSUI yelling]

200
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,083
[SENSUI]
It is a war waged against evil,

201
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,916
yet the evil is within.

202
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,750
[SENSUI] How else can I justify
what I've done but to continue.

203
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,291
Then, shouldn't all humans die?

204
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,500
[KOENMA]
But there has never been a light

205
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,250
that did not cast a shadow.

206
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,500
Darkness, by its nature,

207
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,125
must always be
entwined with good.

208
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,833
And I must take the burden
for what you are now.

209
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,291
I exposed you to that truth

210
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,083
your idealistic mind
can't understand.

211
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,916
So, if you continue this battle
for unearthly principles,

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,708
if that's what you decide,
then I will go with you.

213
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,750
[KOENMA] I'll trap myself
in the net with you,

share the pain of being trapped
without movement for eternity.

215
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,000
It's the least I can do.

216
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,166
[KOENMA]
Please, Shinobu. Come around.

217
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,375
We've come to our choice.

It's unanimous
between all seven.

That's because he is.

314
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,791
In his reality, Shinobu has
never committed a crime.

315
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,291
He knows his other
sides have done wrong,

316
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,791
but he's separated from it,

317
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,958
able to blame them and
grieve for what they've done

318
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,625
while realizing it's necessary.

319
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:02,041
Such a complex side. I guess
that's why I like him the most.

320
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,000
What? That doesn't make sense.
If this side's so darn pure,

321
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,333
how did he get away
with hurting Urameshi?

322
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,583
Not that it matters.
Just goin' by this new name

323
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,958
can't make him
any stronger, right?

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,458
Don't worry, Urameshi!

325
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,166
Whoever he says he is, it's
all part of the same Sensui!

326
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,833
You can take him out!

327
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,958
[YUSUKE] I sensed it that first
time I met him in the city.

328
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:32,250
He's been hiding somethin'. His
curve ball. And now I can tell.

329
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,958
He's finally ready
for the wind up.

330
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,833
Definitely somethin' more than
the rest of his peanut gallery.

331
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,291
This is gonna be fun.

332
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,750
Be honest. Are you still
strong enough to face me?

333
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,500
A funny thing about that.

334
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,458
I did a little power
inventory, and it turns out

335
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,875
I have exactly enough to
cream your face into the wall.

336
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,833
Oh? You mean you really
believe that's possible?

337
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:08,875
[laughing]

338
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:21,375
[laughing continues]

339
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,125
[NARRATOR] At last, Yusuke comes
faces to face with Shinobu,

340
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,333
the original and
purest personality

341
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,625
in Sensui's fractured mind.

342
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,708
What does Shinobu have that
his other sides do not?

343
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,375
And how can Yusuke defeat him

344
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,041
with the tunnel's completion
only minutes away?

345
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,083
[YUSUKE]
Two words: holy crap!

346
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,208
I've been calling Sensui's
secret a curve ball,

347
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,000
but cannon ball's more like it.

348
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,916
And while the cave sides are
giving me deep-tissue back rubs,

349
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,458
Koenma's powering up
in ways we've never seen,

350
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,125
determined to unleash
this Mafuuken

351
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,625
and spend the rest of eternity
trapped with Sensui,

352
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,958
but I won't let that happen.

353
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
So, while my team's stuck
in a ghost's stomach,

354
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,291
and thousands of
demons count down

355
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,375
to all-you-can-eat dinners
at the human buffet,

356
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,791
I'm gonna show you moves
like you've never seen.

357
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,166
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
