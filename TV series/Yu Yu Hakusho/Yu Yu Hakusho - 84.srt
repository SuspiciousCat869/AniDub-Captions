00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Whatever you say.

159
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,041
[YUSUKE THINKS] Kurama
hasn't looked that serious

160
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,666
since the two of us took on
those stupid ninjas.

161
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,583
What Captain Appetite said
really must've pissed him off.

162
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,500
But how can he win, when this
guy can read his thoughts?

163
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,958
[GOURMET THINKS] That's weird.
He's not thinking anything.

164
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,250
He took out Gourmet
so quickly!

165
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291
I didn't see the whip
'til it was all over!

166
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,916
[YUSUKE THINKS] Mental note:

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,666
Never tell Kurama he's
letting his fox side down.

168
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,791
Rely on impulse, and not even
your thoughts can betray you.

169
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,041
Now come out, Toguro.

170
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,958
Did you think I
wouldn't notice?

171
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,166
I could smell your stench
since we entered the cave.

172
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,291
[Toguro 1 laughs]

173
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,708
Good, Kurama. It seems
your powers have improved

174
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,291
even in your human form,

175
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,583
though the red hair isn't
nearly as pretty the silver.

176
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,750
[Toguro 1 laughs]

177
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,333
Guess he missed his
Toguro vaccination.

178
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,083
Gourmet must've eaten him
to take on his powers.

179
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,541
Right, little Sea Man.

180
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,291
But much to fatty's
disappointment,

181
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,083
I'm the one who got
the run of the ship.

182
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,458
Then this entire time...

183
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,083
Yes, I play a real
good game of pretend.

184
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,291
[TOGURO 1] The fantastic
tale starts months ago,

185
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,541
when a man driven to insanity
by a whore and her student,

186
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,833
hurt his dear old brother.

187
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,958
I regenerated
slowly in the sea,

188
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,208
sending out a special energy
wave that only powerful,

189
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,833
and how should we say,
evil beings could hear.

190
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,125
I was resigned to
wait for years,

191
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,375
but my rescue was
surprisingly quick...

192
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,250
A human of all things.

193
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,083
But he said he could
give me my vengeance.

194
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,416
Isn't that how you
remember it, Sensui?

195
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,666
When Toguro told me about
the many achievements

196
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,166
of the new Spirit Detective,
Yusuke Urameshi,

197
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,750
I could feel the hands of the
universe tugging at my arm.

198
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,125
[SENSUI] In the trial
against humanity,

199
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,833
the defense now had
an able attorney.

200
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,916
At last, I could begin...

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,875
The sentencing.

202
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,333
Sensui gathered up a bunch
of these new psychics

203
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,625
for his plan, including
this brainless lump.

204
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,000
You see we both agreed

205
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,000
my regeneration
was taking too long.

206
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,916
I needed another body.

207
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,375
So, Sensui let
this ogre take me,

208
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,583
making him think that I
was the one being betrayed.

209
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,750
Merciless, really...

210
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,291
The poor ape had no idea
what he'd swallowed.

211
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,375
I'm like a cockroach
with a brain.

212
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,958
The best was when he
realized what was happening.

213
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,375
That's when he became afraid...

214
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,791
Fear is pleasure
enough from the outside.

215
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,541
But I felt his
terror from within

216
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,625
as I slowly took him over.

217
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,291
It was palpable!

218
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,125
[Toguro 1 laughs]

219
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,666
[TOGURO 1] A fear so
thick I could eat it!

220
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,041
That is enough.

221
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,541
You've survived
for far too long.

222
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,333
And now it ends.

223
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,291
Uh oh, the fox
thinks he can finish me!

224
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,166
But I am better
than before!

225
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,791
Yes--recovering from what
brother did to me

226
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,291
has made me stronger!

227
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,500
Now I can regenerate
from anything--

228
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,375
even if you pierce
my brain and my heart,

229
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,791
I'll still survive!
I'm invincible!

230
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,916
[YUSUKE THINKS] Great.
A Toguro brother who can't die.

231
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,166
 And he's got the power of two

232
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,250
other psychics chipping in.
I'm optimistic.

233
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,791
Thanks to this lard I can
absorb any power I want!

234
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,875
I'll start with yours!

What?!

236
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,708
Let me guess,
he brought roach spray.

237
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
No you fool,
it's a smoke screen.

238
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,625
One of his older tricks.

239
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,541
[YUSUKE] Well, it's
definitely working.

240
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,541
[SEA MAN] But, how will
we know if he needs help?

241
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,708
[TOGURO 1 THINKS] You've
regained your calm now, Kurama.

242
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,291
That prized calm, that normally
makes you such a deadly foe,

able to keep your poise
and outwit anyone.

But now, with poor

it will be your doom.

246
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
[TOGURO 1 THINKS] You were so
angry during that decapitation

247
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,708
that you acted on impulse.

248
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,916
But now you're back to
your usual strategies,

249
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,916
so I can read along.

[KURAMA THINKS]
Hide myself in the smoke.

Keep my distance with
the aide of his smell.

Always stay behind him.

I'm sorry... Was that
supposed to hurt me?

like mine, is it fox?

Either he's beating the
hell out of Kurama,

or someone's found
where's he ticklish!

That's it,
I'm goin' in.

If it pisses off Kurama,
he can sue me.

And what does that mean?

I'd sure like to know
who he's screaming at.

Why won't you die??
Damn you fox!

00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,125
It's the Sinning Tree.

282
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,416
[YUSUKE] The Sinning Tree.
Sounds a bit heavy.

283
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,708
It ensnares your mind with
hallucinations of wickedness,

284
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,416
while it sucks away your life.

285

Wow, that's freaky.

He still thinks he
fighting you, even now,

287
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,583
when he's all wrapped up?

[KURAMA]
Yes.

289
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,833
But how did you get
him hooked up on it?

290
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,166
I used my Rose Whip to
plant the seed inside him

291
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,583
when I took off
Gourmet's skull.

[HIEI] Clever.

00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,166
The smoke screen wasn't only
to mask your whereabouts.

296
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,166
It was a catalyst for the
tree's hallucinations

297
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,875
to take effect.

298

I didn't want to leave
things to chance.

00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,875
[NARRATOR] Kurama's anger
has sentenced Toguro

315
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,958
to an eternity of suffering,

316
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,625
forever chasing
his foiled revenge.

317
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,791
But the tunnel to
Demon World is opening.

318
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,083
Can Yusuke's team still
save the human race?

319
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,625
[YUSUKE] Okay,
Earth's code red.

320
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,333
You've only got time to
watch one half-hour show

321
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,458
before you're eaten.

322
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,833
Which one do you choose?

323
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,791
And yes, that is a
giant face on the floor.

324
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,583
But Sensui's let Kuwabara go.

325
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,291
He says that special sword
wasn't first on his list,

326
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,500
neither was the tunnel,

327
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,416
though I think it's
too late to stop that.

328
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,250
He's got some real
head-case issues,

329
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,500
and the only cure is a show
down between Spirit Detectives.

330
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,166
Just as long as
he doesn't kill me.

331
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,875
'Cause I've done that once,
and it kind of sucked.

332
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,041
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
