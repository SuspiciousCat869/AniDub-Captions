00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,208
And... so soon!

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,625
Watch me carefully.

162
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,541
It's complicated.

163
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,958
So what's this special
technique he's so proud of?

164
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,791
I don't know
but it must be good.

165
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,791
As much as he's
building it up.

166
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,583
This... Is the strongest
alcy ever made...

167
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,041
It's called Ogre... Killer.

168
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,375
Oh yeah people
that's some strong stuff...

169
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,666
Take a sip of that and you'll

170
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,250
wake up in jail
the next morning,

171
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,333
in the arms of a hairy demon
you really don't want to know.

172
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,791
And he's definitely
taking more than a sip!!

173
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,541
What?

174
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,041
This Ogre Killer...

175
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,375
I take it's not something you
drink for nutritional value.

176
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,166
No sir, not if you consider...
The liver damage.

177
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,041
[KOENMA THINKS]
This one worries me...

178
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,833
Drinking it as if to reach
some darker beast inside of him.

179
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,583
Something very
strange is happening.

180
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,541
The entire stadium is
being eclipsed by Chu's aura.

181
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
What is
happening to him?

182
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
Don't know. It
just feels weird.

183
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,750
The entire audience
can only wait in a hush

184
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,541
as Chu reveals his technique.

185
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,416
Dare we hope for
something truly horrific?

186
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,166
[throwing up]

187
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,166
Tell me he didn't!

188
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,250
Oh brother! I need to start
telling Chu to bring a bucket

189
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
or something when he
uses his special technique...

190
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,333
Happens every time!

191
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,750
I can't believe apparitions pay
money to see this filth...

192
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,250
Hey! Hey! Surprise time is
over! Get off the ground!

193
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,625
Sorry Koenma sir,
my horn got stuck.

194
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,458
I wonder if vomiting was
Chu's secret technique?

195
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,541
Need anything Chu?
A wet towel maybe?

196
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,208
He may feel pretty
terrible now, but actually

197
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,500
Chu's becoming invincible.

198
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,791
His secret technique isn't
the drink, of course.

199
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,500
It's his true form the
drinking brings out.

200
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,375
Better get off me, ugly!

201
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,125
Shut up!! I don't
care how popular you

202
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,666
and your friends are
getting around here,

203
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,458
I'm still the boss of this turf.

204
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,666
And I'll knock you flat on your
ass whenever I'm in the mood!

205
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,458
Wanna bet?

206
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,916
[goblin thugs laughing]

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,625
[CHU] That crap's awful!

208
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,000
Who the hell are you?

209
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,916
Say how'd you pick
this place, kid?

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,666
Their terp smells like piss...

211
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,958
Guess I'll have
to drink it in bulk.

212
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,583
That's enough! Guys,
get rid of this scum!

213
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,916
You better try me all at once.

214
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,958
Hell of a party!

215
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,083
[RINKU] He beat the
whole gang in one shot.

216
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,916
And now that he's powering up

217
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,583
you'll be just another
chalk mark on his wall.

218
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,208
[CHU] By the way, doll.
You sure smell great.

219
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,375
Yeah? Must be
the shampoo.

220
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,083
[CHU]
Now back to the biz.

221
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,125
Suddenly he's sober again...

222
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,791
Alcohol does not affect
him in the normal way...

223
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,166
Somehow it serves
him as a catalyst.

224
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,875
How odd... So the chemicals in

225
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,625
those drinks actually
bring out his energy.

226
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,833
[KOTO] Chu proves resilient
after his hacking spell--

227
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,833
ready to fight again!!

228
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,708
I think you should
act more excited, kid.

229
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,291
After all it's what
you've been waiting for.

230
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,000
Now we're definitely
in for some action!

231
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,125
Chu is revealing
an entirely new attack!

232
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,500
I can't tell exactly what it is

233
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,000
but heads will
definitely be rolling!

234
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,250
Hey what is that stuff?

235
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,083
His energy, you lump.

236
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,500
He's creating
his finishing move.

237
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,250
If you look closely and
I bet you can see

238
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,500
alcohol actually
mixed in with his energy.

239
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,750
Whoa! That blast he's holdin'

240
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,208
looks a lot like
Urameshi's spirit gun.

241
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,583
And approximately
equal in force.

242
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,166
What? Don't you think we
should tell Yusuke that?

243
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,583
Time for us to test our powers!

244
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,958
I was waiting for the invite!

245
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,125
Yusuke already knows.

246
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,625
[CHU] See you
on the other side!

247
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,250
Spirit Gun!!

248
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,833
My! The two fighter's energies
are actually duking it out!

249
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,750
Get 'em Urameshi's energy!!

250
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,750
It's a draw.

251
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,416
Look at 'em!

252
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,750
They're charging each
other at the exact same time!

253
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,625
My gosh!

254
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,875
They're not even bothering
to block those headshots!

255
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,375
This is pure offense.

256
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,083
They gave up fighting with
their brains a long time ago.

257
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,416
Now it's simply a matter of
who can endure the most pain.

258
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,000
It's impossible to count
how many punches have landed!

259
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,166
Or to tell who's winning

260
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
or in fact anything
significant at all!

261
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,166
I don't even
know why I'm talking!

262
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,833
Bad move.

263
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,750
Now I have you!

264
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,375
This is it!
Finish that idiot, Chu!

265
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,625
This time Chu's spreading his
energy into a much larger blast.

266
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,666
It's amazing, how much
control he has over the size.

267
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,416
It is, and by the sheer volume

268
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,000
Yusuke won't be able
block it with his Spirit Gun.

269
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,250
Try not to
sound too worried.

270
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,916
[CHU]
One last go!!

271
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,541
Dammit!

272
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,583
He's off-balance.
He can't defend!

273
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,083
[HIEI THINKS]
Do something Yusuke. Hurry!

274
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,875
Just get out of the way!!!

275
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,083
Oh, Yusuke!

276
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,583
[CHU THINKS]
There's nowhere to run.

277
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,750
And it'll take more
than your little bullet

278
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,541
to stop this train.

279
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,750
Yeah! You did it Chu!
You beat him!

280
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,166
No one can get
away from that blast!

281
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,833
[YUSUKE] Spirit Gun!

282
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,791
Double!!

283
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,000
What?

284
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,500
[CHU]
Double?

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,375
It's breaking through!

286
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,083
Careful Urameshi!
His blast is still goin'!

287
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:42,875
Too late.

288
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,916
Double devastation!!

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,625
No way man! He hit him!

290
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,333
They're all gone!
They've been disintegrated!

291
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,291
Don't say that Kuwabara! I
don't care if it's true or not!

292
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,166
No trace of either warrior
can be found! Nothing!

293
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,958
Not even a little pile of ashes!

294
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,458
Has this fight
truly ended in a draw?

295
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,041
Up there!!

296
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,791
Unbelievable! Both
of them have survived!!

297
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,666
Well they've burned their skin,
shortened their breath,

298
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,166
and somehow lost their shirts-

299
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,916
altogether I'd call
it a successful fight!

300
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,041
With that two for one shot

301
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,833
you've used up all
the ammo for your Spirit Gun.

302
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,875
Maybe you can round
up enough energy

303
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,166
to swing your little dukes,

304
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,500
but that's about it, right?

305
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,166
Pretty much defenseless.

306
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,208
I can barely lift my arms.

307
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,375
[Chu chuckles]

308
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,625
[Yusuke chuckles]

309
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,208
Can you hear them?!

310
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,791
They're laughing at
their own helplessness!

311
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,125
It seems the strain of battle
has driven them into hysteria!

312
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,208
What is he doing?
Finish that stupid kid!

313
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,458
They're at the end of their
line. I know how this will end.

314
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,916
In a tie?

315
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
No, that's not
what he means.

316
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,125
This battle,
determines everything.

317
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,083
They'll refuse to give up.

318
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,875
Mate, I know a way we
can finish this for keeps.

319
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,416
I'm all ears.

320
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,791
[NARRATOR] What are
Yusuke and Chu planning?

321
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,500
Both exhausted,

322
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,166
both with nothing
but their fists.

323
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,291
Will the end of
this team battle truly be,

324
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,208
a fight to the death?

325
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,791
[KURAMA] When Yu Yu
Hakusho continues,

326
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,166
the end of the arduous team
battle will fast approach,

327
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,958
as Yusuke and Chu
agree to a bout

328
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
with deadly finishing terms.

329
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,541
With a pair of daggers
driven behind their feet,

330
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,666
they will be forced into
close fist-to-fist combat.

331
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,416
And whoever is knocked
beyond the daggers

332
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,083
will accept the
penalty of death.

333
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,041
All eyes in the stadium
will be on the center ring,

334
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,000
as these two perfectly
matched opponents

335
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,208
fight desperately
for their lives.
