[KURAMA] Kuwabara.
What are you doing?

160
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,916
[HIEI] We've cleared
a path to the entrance.

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,791
Quit fooling around.

162
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,083
[mindless groans]

163
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,416
They never end!

164
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,791
Let's, not waste
more time.

165
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,291
[Yusuke screaming]

166
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,125
[SUZAKU] Your friends
are drawing closer.

167
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,416
I'll have to speed up your
torturing to deal with them.

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,666
[GENKAI VO] Hello! Moron!
You can't give up like this!!

169
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,916
[YUSUKE THINKS]
But, Keiko.

170
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,875
[GENKAI VO] Oh give the girl
some credit. She's not dead.

171
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
Dammit?!

172
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,375
[SUZAKU] Must I
do everything myself?!

173
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,583
That girl will die, no matter
how long I have to wait!

174
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:06,333
[Yusuke laughs]

175
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,083
You! You think this is funny?!

176
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,916
Then let me teach
you some manners.

177
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,000
[SUZAKU] It's rude for
the dying to laugh!

178
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,250
[Yusuke screams]

179
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,041
[GENKAI VO] Don't you remember
one speck of your training!

180
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,750
[YUSUKE THINKS] Get out
of my head you old bitch!!

181
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
I can't think right now!!

182
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
[GENKAI VO] That's your whole
problem you idiot!! Remember!!

183
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,750
Focus your mind on
the business at hand!

184
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,875
You give up on everything

185
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,583
because you can't
commit to anything.

186
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,083
Let me guess,

187
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,875
did you pick up that cute
saying from a fortune cookie?

188
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,958
I am trying okay! But you're
working me to death here!!

189
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,083
Approaching death is
the key to your training.

190
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,416
What?!

191
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,333
It is called training
under critical condition.

192
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,291
You must push your body all
the way to its breaking point.

193
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,625
Only then will you reach
beyond your physical limits.

194
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,500
[GENKAI VO] Power like this
must be earned, slacker.

195
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,708
I know that's a
new concept for you.

196
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,875
All your life you've
gone the easy way.

197
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,041
So you were born with a talent
for fighting. Who cares.

198
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,583
You never worked for it.
It was easy.

199
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,958
You've always quit any time

200
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,541
the answer wasn't served
on a silver plate.

201
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,291
Shut up, shut, UP!!!

202
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,666
I don't have to listen to you!!

203
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,541
Look at all the
energy you still have!

204
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,083
Shows you're doing your
training like everything else.

205
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,541
Half-assed!!

206
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,083
You people are all alike!

207
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,958
Tryin' to take control
of me and tell me how I am!

208
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,375
You're wrong!!

209
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,375
Yes, kill me to
avoid your problem.

210
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,875
It's time you bit the bullet

211
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,333
and started caring
about something

212
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,416
with all your heart and energy.

213
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
But you can't care about it

214
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,125
if you're always
holding yourself back

215
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,000
in case it doesn't work out!

216
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,041
Concentrate on what's
important, Yusuke.

217
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,875
Then commit to it all the way.

218
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:19,375
Okay... but what's important?

219
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,583
[YUSUKE THINKS]
I've come all this way,

220
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,958
but what's the big deal?

221
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,708
Goodbye, Yusuke.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,583
[YUSUKE THINKS]
I mean, what's it gotten me?

223
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,708
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Why do I care?

224
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,500
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Because, they need me.

225
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,958
[SUZAKU] Be sure to
hold him tightly.

226
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,500
[MURUGU] Wait, wait, Suzaku!
Let me get a better view!

227
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,583
This is for my
friends you jerk!!

228
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,125
[Yusuke cries out]

229
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,708
Did I miss something

230
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,666
or did you just get
five times more powerful?

231
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,666
Life is a drag, isn't it?

232
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,375
[NARRATOR] His friends.
His mother. Keiko.

233
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,333
Remembering all the
people who count on him,

234
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,333
Yusuke has risen again with
powers never before seen.

235
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,833
As the tower battle
races to its end,

236
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,250
the Spirit Detective will give
every ounce of strength he has.

237
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,583
But will that be enough?

238
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,458
[YUSUKE] That's right.

239
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,375
I'm back on my feet and ready
to bury this Saint Beast

240
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,416
in what's ever left of
his own stupid castle.

241
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,458
But even though I've got
bigger, badder powers

242
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,125
and a whole new
reason to fight,

243
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,000
it's still seven against one!

244
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,625
And that's not easy!

245
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,125
Kuwabara and the others

246
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,083
are cutting their way through
veggie-heads to get to me,

247
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,125
while Keiko's got to do
all the zombie running

248
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,791
when Botan gets knocked out!

249
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,208
It's the grand finale of our
mission against the Beasts,

250
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,833
and I'm giving it my all!

251
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,583
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
