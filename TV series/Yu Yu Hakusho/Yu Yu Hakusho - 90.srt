but they aren't the ones
we need to worry about.

52
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,708
There are Demons of
far greater strength

53
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,875
and intelligence, lurking in
the depths of Demon World.

Laying low and waiting
until they know it's safe

55
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,416
for them to pass
through to this world.

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,708
And then...

57
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,583
...they'll unleash a
terror more destructive

58
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,916
than any weapon man
has ever forged.

And that is how
the world will end.

60
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,208
But, what about
the Kekkai Barrier?

61
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,625
Won't that keep the
really bad Demons

62

from escaping?

63
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,958
I thought that's why they
wanted Mr. Kuwabara's power.

64
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,666
So they could use it to break
the net that's in their way.

65
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,875
But since that never happened...

be intact, right?

his friend's death.

anything that rash!

Fortunately, the brains
in Spirit World only made

00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,541
this net to filter
out Demon Energy.

95
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,625
That's why I passed
through unscathed

while Hiei's attack burned
out when it hit the net.

we supposed to fight him?

99
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,833
But you and your friend
should take some consolation

100
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,291
in the fact that this Kekkai

101
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,791
is only sensitive to the energy
of A or S-Class Demons.

102
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,875
[SENSUI] Which means, that
in killing your friend,

103
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,708
I've awakened the potential
you've both dreamed of.

the thanks I need.

[NARRATOR] The Special
Defense Force. The SDF.

160
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,375
Revered by citizens of
Spirit World and feared

161
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
by denizens of Demon World.

162
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,166
Their mission, primarily
a peace-keeping one:

163
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,708
patrolling the occupied
territories of Demon World

164
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,000
and terminating any Demon
who gets in the way

165
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,583
of Spirit World's expansion
of the controlled zone.

166
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,375
[NARRATOR]
In the rarest of times,

167
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,416
the King may deploy SDF troops

168
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,166
to Living World if a Demon
poses a major threat

169
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,916
to the human population.

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,541
However, their presence on
Earth is quite conspicuous,

171
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,208
and thus, very rare.

172
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,250
[KING YAMA]
Believe me, I do not enter into

173
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,125
such decisions lightly.

174
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,125
Every casualty grieves me as
though it were my own child.

175
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,583
But the cause is righteous,
and this action, necessary.

176
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,125
[BOTAN] I've never seen
the SDF mobilized.

177
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,458
I hope they can give Yusuke and
Koenma the backup they need.

178
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,500
[BLUE OGRE]
I want my mommy!

179
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:15,166
[DEMONS growling]

180
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,458
[DEMON A]
Look at those C-Class trash,

181
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,291
clamoring for a
piece of human flesh.

182
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,708
They give all of us
Demons a bad name.

183
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,083
[DEMON C] Haven't those
short-lived cretins

184
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,958
ever heard of overpopulation?

185
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,333
From what I hear, the streets
up there are paved with people!

186
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,125
[DEMON B]
Speaking of which,

187
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,166
shouldn't we get in line?

188
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,833
[DEMON A]
Like lambs to our slaughter?

189
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,208
I don't think so.

190
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,958
Why's that?

191
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,375
For all we know, this
could just be another

192
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,791
of Spirit World's
Demon-eradicating trap.

193
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,291
Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,125
[gasps] There's four powerful
beings heading this way.

195
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,375
Two of them's got Demon Energy,
one's Spirit Energy,

196
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,208
but the last...

197
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,708
[gasps]

198
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,500
[DEMON B] I don't know what
kinda energy he's got,

199
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,833
but it's a lot,

200
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,041
and I don't really wanna
stick around to find out!

201
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,166
[DEMON A]
You heard him, guys.

202
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,708
Let's not be the
Welcoming Committee.

203
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,416
[DEMON C]
Catch 'ya on the flipside!

204
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,625
Where's he takin' us now?

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,208
What's that thing?

206
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,625
The exit.

207
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,000
[SENSUI]
So this is Demon World.

208
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,541
I hope...

209
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,166
...that I will find what
I'm looking for here.

210
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,458
[SENSUI] I need to see where
they live, Mr. Itsuki.

211
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,208
I need to breathe their air.

212
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,416
I will find a way
into the Demon World.

213
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,666
They don't deserve you...

214
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,500
How can you protect the
humans from themselves?

215
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,458
Make amends and fight on
behalf of the demons!

216
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,000
No, kill the Demons!

217
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,416
Fight the real enemy!

218
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
The Demons are the enemy!

219
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,208
[SENSUI] The depths of my soul
are rooted in dark thoughts.

220
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,250
But then, we all have
darkness and light in us.

221
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,666
If we are all light
on the outside,

222
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,333
there is nothing but
darkness underneath.

223
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,375
There comes a time when the
darkness must come to light.

224
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,125
Hey, has anybody noticed

225
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,083
that we're falling
very, very, very fast?!

226
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,500
Hiei, do you know where
in Demon World we are?

227
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,625
Yes, I believe I've been
to these parts before,

228
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,458
and if I'm right,
then we're rather lucky.

229
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,666
It's the Forest of Fools,
just low-level Demons

230
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,458
who won't present any
kind of challenge to us.

231
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,750
I know we're about
to die and all,

232
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,208
but I really hate it
when you guys ignore

233
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,458
what I have to say!

234
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,458
[KUWABARA screams]

235
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,000
Hold on tight.

236
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,000
[yells]

237
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,833
Fox, then a butterfly;
is there any animal

238
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,916
you can't metamorph into?!

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,291
I haven't turned
into a butterfly...

240
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,125
This is merely the
leaf of a plant,

241
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,958
doubling as a glider.

242
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,000
Look at that cocky punk,
just free-fallin'

243
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,291
without a care in the world--

244
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,916
but I'll betcha he
wishes he had somethin'

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
to catch him now!

246
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,708
[gasps]

247
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,666
What did he do?

248
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,583
[SENSUI] You begin to see
what my Sacred Energy

249
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,291
is really capable of.

250
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,625
I don't have a bag of
tricks or packet of seeds

251
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,125
and I don't need them.

252
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,416
I can fly without
any roots attached,

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,083
without even the
help of my maker.

254
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,375
That's why they
call me Black Angel.

255
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,166
If we lived in
less cynical times,

256
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,166
the gift I'm preparing for
the world might've been

257
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,333
labeled for what it
really is: a miracle.

258
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,375
You think you can scare us
with that holy one crap?

259
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,125
Does he really believe
we'd turn around

260
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,458
after all we've been through?

261
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,833
Who cares what he is
as long as he's dead.

262
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,083
I admire your electric
enthusiasm, Hiei,

263
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,083
but I don't wanna hurt
these beautiful woods.

264
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,541
You mind if we finish
this fight over there?

265
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,458
Oh, I see. The Plateau
of the Beheaded--

266
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,541
a fitting battleground, indeed.
Come to think of it,

267
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,125
it's giving me some ideas.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,916
I got some of my own.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is not something
I usually do...

270
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,333
Fighting opponents who I know
have no chance of beating me.

271
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,250
But I'm making
exceptions for you,

272
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,916
to offer some modicum of peace,

273
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
that you at least tried to
avenge your friend's death

274
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,958
before your own.

275
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,708
Oh, come on now! Is that
supposed to impress us?

[KUWABARA] Am I the only one
not doin' a costume change?

280
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,166
The great thing about this armor

281
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,083
is that it not only
strengthens my defenses,

282
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,250
but boosts my offense as well.

283
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
You can't stand up to me!

284
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,250
I'm a living, breathing,
sentient tank!

285
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,916
Well, I think you
might want to consider

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,250
spinning your turret around.

but not strong enough.

[growling]

319
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,791
[NARRATOR] Even though they
have him outnumbered,

320
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,666
Sensui has Hiei, Kurama
and Kuwabara overpowered

321
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,708
on the battlefield
of Demon World.

322
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,125
This is one foe they may
not be able to defeat,

323
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,500
but they'll die before
they ever give up.

324
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,333
Yusuke's death
hangs over them all.

325
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,791
A reminder of what
they're fighting for.

326
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,541
But will they be
joining him soon?

327
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,708
[BOTAN]
Whew, this is way too much drama

328
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,458
for one afternoon, as the war
intensifies on all fronts.

329
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,833
In Demon World, our boys
try their hardest

330
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,500
to beat Sensui, but this guy
doesn't even need a Band-Aid!

331
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,125
On the surface, Puu
shows signs of life,

332
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,166
but what does that
mean for Yusuke?

333
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,541
And back in the cave, the SDF
arrive with special orders

334
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,250
that will turn everything
we know upside down:

335
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,708
And don't think that's
the last surprise!

336
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,416
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho.
