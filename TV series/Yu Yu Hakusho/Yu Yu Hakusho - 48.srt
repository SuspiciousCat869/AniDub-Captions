as a way to sneak additional
players into their rotation.

158
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,500
Um, and that's against
the rules, isn't it?

159
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,041
Even if this woman is the one
substitute they're allowed,

160
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,291
she cannot
enter the ring

161
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,291
unless the one she
replaces is already dead!

162
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,625
That is what
the book says.

163
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,458
I demand to see proof of
their team member's death.

164
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,875
Otherwise I am forced to ask
for their disqualification.

165
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,625
Okay, let
me see here.

166
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,333
They're cheaters!
They've broken the rules!!

167
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,291
The penalty for
cheating is death!!

168
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,916
Yeah, he's right!

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,125
String 'em up!

170
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,875
Let's send a message
to these human filth!

171
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,208
Kill 'em!!!

172
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,041
Well, this is a
little unexpected.

173
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,583
The legality of
the Urameshi Team

174
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,791
has been called into question,

175
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,083
and the bloodbath's been delayed

176
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,416
in the hopes of some
kind of group lynching!

177
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,541
Kill 'em all!!

178
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,708
[KOTO] A replay of
Team Urameshi's fight

179
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,958
against the Dr. Ichigaki Team

180
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,333
is now on the jumbo-screen!

181
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,000
This was the first time
we saw beneath the mask,

182
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,875
and as we see, it was
definitely a much younger girl!

183
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,916
I've just received word
from the Tournament Committee.

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,625
They are reviewing the
situation as we speak

185
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,833
and ask for your patience as
they come to a final decision.

186
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:02,375
And in the meantime,
as your--groovy broadcaster--

187
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,250
I'll be panning the
audience for your opinions.

188
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,708
How do you call it?!

189
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
What about you, sir?

190
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,875
What was the question?

191
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,583
[KOTO] The two different
fighters under the mask?

192
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,458
How do you think
it should be called?

193
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,875
Ah yes of course!
There's really no question.

194
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,833
The younger girl
is far more attractive.

195
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,916
Kay.

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,916
What about you?
Any thoughts on this?

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,666
The Old Man and
the Sea, Hemingway.

198
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,750
[KOTO] Perhaps we should just
sit and be quiet, instead.

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,166
I don't see what's
so hard about it--

200
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,958
First we had the
hot young Genkai.

201
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:38,208
And now we've got
the old one. It's easy!

202
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,250
They're the same?

203
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,458
[KOENMA] Yusuke must have
completed his final test,

204
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,958
which means the bulk of
Genkai's energy is now in him.

205
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
Genkai can't return
to her younger form

206
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,916
because she
doesn't have the power.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,333
Sir, if that's true

208
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,125
you need to hurry and tell
the Tournament Committee!

209
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,541
They're probably
going to disqualify us!

210
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
[KOENMA] Holy smoking
ogres, you're right!!

211
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,208
I am the owner
of the team aren't I??

212
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,041
Koenma sir, may I ask what
you're doing in the corner?

213
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm getting ready!

214
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,291
[BLUE OGRE] But aren't we
kind of in a rush?

215
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,416
This is the Committee
we're talking about!

216
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,666
They're serious high rollers !

217
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,375
You don't think they'll
listen to a baby, do you?

218
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,583
No way.

219
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,041
[KOENMA] Let's go
makes a difference.

220
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,291
[KOTO] Alright people!

221
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,208
I've received the final
word from the committee!

222
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,833
[KOENMA]
Oops!

223
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,000
This is crazy, kinda
feels like an award show.

224
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,000
Well anyway, I'll just
go ahead and read here.

225
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,916
By the authority of
the Tournament Committee,

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,875
in unanimous decision, the
Masked Fighter's eligibility,

227
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,958
and Team Urameshi's
future, is ruled.

228
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,583
[KOENMA] Move over!

229
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,125
No problem! The fight
between Shishi Wakamaru

230
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,375
and the Masked
Fighter will continue!

231
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,833
Are you serious?!

232
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,541
They would never say that!

233
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,083
It's Koto! She sided
with Yusuke last time!

234
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,833
She cheated! She read it wrong!

235
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,166
Human--

236
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,958
sympathizer!

237
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,416
My goodness-- where do you guys
get these things to throw at me?

238
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,875
Let's execute her
with the rest of 'em!

239
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,000
[TOGURO 2]
That isn't very polite.

240
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,208
It's Toguro!

241
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,166
Oh man, you don't think
he heard us, do you?

242
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,541
Just shut up, hear
what he has to say!

243
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,208
[TOGURO 2]
Team Urameshi did not cheat.

244
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,625
I wanted you all to know that.

245
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,958
To understand why, you merely
have to know who that woman is.

246
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,916
While employing the
technique she's so fond of,

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,208
the body of the user does
a most impressive thing.

248
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,541
Its cells return to the moment
when they were strongest.

249
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,625
The young girl
you saw before,

250
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,250
and the old woman there
now are the same person.

251
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,916
The human psychic who
created the Spirit Wave.

252
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,208
It's been such a long time since
we've talked, hasn't it Genkai.

253
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,500
[DEMON 2]
The Genkai?

254
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,583
[DEMON 3] But, why would such
a legend hide behind a mask?

255
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,375
Hold on, did I
miss something here?

256
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,333
Why does Toguro act
like he knows her?

257
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
You're the renowned
psychic Genkai--

258
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,666
so fate smiles on me after all.

259
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,500
I won't have to wait for Toguro
before I get my celebrity!

260
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,541
You seem like just
an old woman to me,

261
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,583
but your name is known
by nearly every apparition.

262
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,666
And now I will be famous too,
as the one who killed you.

263
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,000
I won't dally around
with you any more.

264
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,708
We'll need to give
an appropriate death!

265
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,708
That weapon...

266
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,125
The Banshee Shriek--I think it's
such a lovely name for a sword.

267
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,500
It has the power to
beckon lost demon souls

268
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,250
into the ring with us.

269
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,875
It should be the perfect way
to make myself a reputation.

270
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,208
I've seen a sword
like that before,

271
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,416
and I don't believe he
understands the danger of it.

272
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,375
It has more power than he does.

273
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,416
It should be pretty close.

274
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,416
We better not have missed it
because of your little detour.

275
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,375
Hey, I just
went the way I felt!

276
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,208
I'm sure they're fine, anyway--
Hiei was all fired up.

277
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,458
Hiei--He's the quiet one with
the gifted eyes, isn't he?

278
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,416
The one who didn't want
to play cards with us all.

279
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,791
Oh sure, if by gifted
eyes you mean freakish!

280
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,875
Why you all
interested in him?

281
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,458
Listen, don't start thinking
he's cool or anything.

282
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,750
He's scary and he'll
bite off your head!

283
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,166
[YUKINA]
Oh.

284
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,958
Take that back, Kuwabara!

285
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,250
That's no way to talk
of a perfectly decent guy!

286
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,875
Decent guy? That's not
what you said before!

287
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,666
Uh--you must be confused.

288
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,500
I've always thought
Hiei was a swell person,

289
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,583
and you should too,

290
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,875
especially since
Yukina happens to be...

291
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,625
Yes, tell them
I'm her brother.

292
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll rather enjoy
torturing you to death.

293
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,250
[KEIKO] What's wrong
with her, all of a sudden?

294
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,500
[KUWABARA] Maybe
she ate some bad meat.

295
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,958
Who knows, maybe
I ate it too.

296
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,958
My stomach's felt squirmy
ever since we started walkin.

297
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,500
[KUWABARA]
Hey! Urameshi!

298
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,291
Is he okay?

299
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,250
You--

300
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,083
It's all right, you guys.
He's just sleeping.

301
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,083
[KEIKO THINKS] You gave
us a real scare, Yusuke.

302
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,541
[KUWABARA] Okay,
what is it with this guy?

303
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,250
At first he doesn't
show for our match,

304
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,958
and then he's
daydreamin' under a tree!

305
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,708
Oh, look at those cuts! Gross!

306
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,166
But what in the heavens
could have happened to him?

307
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,375
Something very painful--

308
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,500
something that
made him stronger.

309
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,791
Thanks a lot,
misses psychic reader.

310
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,375
Well okay guys, we better
get to the stadium.

311
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,541
Pretty important
fights, you know.

312
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,125
[KEIKO] Puu--
I didn't even see you!

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,458
Did you take care
of our favorite boy?

314
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,875
Fatso.

315
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,708
[crowd noise]

316
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,791
Sounds like another
match is gettin' started.

317
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,916
[GENKAI THINKS] If I convert

318
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,625
everything I've got
left into energy blasts,

319
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,250
I'll have three shots.

320
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,500
That's all. I
better not waste them.

321
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,916
Are you ready?

322
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,541
[GENKAI THINKS] I have
to survive this fight.

323
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,291
And face him once more.

324
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,083
[NARRATOR] As reunited
friends return to the

325
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,125
stadium with Yusuke on arm,

326
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,958
Genkai will fight with
her identity revealed,

327
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,708
and her power
already given away.

328
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,041
[YUSUKE] Once upon a time,

329
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,958
I compared this guy's
team to a boy band

330
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
and he made a nasty face at me.

331
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,458
Well now the nasty's
in full swing,

332
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,791
and I'm just thinking
the boy band thing

333
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,166
fits better than ever--

334
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,958
he's even got a
fancy light show!

335
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,000
Granted the lights are
actually evil demon souls

336
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,708
wanting to devour my mentor,

337
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,083
but hey, every group's
got their own spin, right?

338
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,041
Anyway, you need
to check this one out,

339
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,875
as the old grandma who can
change into a hot chick at will

340
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,875
takes on the
fame-crazed front man--

341
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,000
Without her energy
uh, no thanks to me.

342
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,375
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho.
