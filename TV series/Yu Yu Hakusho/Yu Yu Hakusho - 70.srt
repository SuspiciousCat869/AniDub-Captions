00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,875
you even think about doing
anything to the detective.

160
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,208
You don't follow me do you?

161
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,875
Whoever is being impersonated
is currently in our prison.

162
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Mr. Urameshi isn't
the only one at risk.

163
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,250
And for those of you
lacking in manners,

164
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,708
that means if anything
should happen to me,

165
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,666
the other person we've captured
will promptly be killed.

166
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,916
It seems your group has
thought of everything.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,125
Let me guess.

168
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,958
If I don't find the
fake one in ten minutes,

169
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,708
you'll kill the
real one.

170
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,625
Uh oh, nine left.

171
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,041
[KIDO]
You're wasting time.

172
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,666
I suggest you get started.

173
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:28,666
Don't rush me!

174
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,583
Let's see, what's the best
way to weed out a fake?

175
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,791
Kuwabara, what's your blood
type and when were you born?

176
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,416
Figures, you have to
suspect me first off!

177
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,958
Oh, get over yourself
and answer me!

178
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,416
Okay Mr. Crabby-pants,

179
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,166
but do you even
know my birthday

180
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,916
and my blood type
in the first place?

181
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,791
I guess I don't.

182
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,333
This is pathetic.

183
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,333
Kurama, now tell me your mom's
name and how old she is.

184
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,791
Her name is Shiori,
she is forty years old,

185
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,125
and she will be
married in the fall.

186
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,833
That's great! Tell her
congratulations for me!

187
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,708
Hey, am I invited
to the wedding?

188
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,041
Only seven minutes.

189
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,791
All right, Botan!

190
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,416
Prove to me who you are by
telling me your boob size.

191
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,833
Have you lost your
mind completely.

192
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,625
You and I both know I've never
told you anything of the sort!!

193
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,666
You told me when we were on the
roof of the school, remember?

194
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,208
You just made that up!!!
You disgusting pervert!!!

195
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,000
Damn it! And she almost
fell for it too.

196
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,791
This stupidity is
making me nauseous.

197
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,958
Fine, we'll go to you.

198
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,875
What's your little
sister's name?

199
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,250
[YUSUKE THINKS]
I bet he's the fake.

200
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,125
You know her well enough.

201
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,708
I refuse to play
this nonsense game.

202
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,291
[YUSUKE THINKS] Nope,
that's definitely Hiei...

203
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,125
bad attitude and all.

204
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,500
Hey that's weird...

205
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,708
I didn't know you had
a little sis, Hiei.

206
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,125
I bet she's a
pint-sized pain

207
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,333
in the you know what
just like you.

208
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,541
Probably ugly, too.

209
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,500
[HIEI]
I will kill you.

210
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,083
I forgot Kuwabara doesn't
know the relation.

211
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,250
Huh?!

212
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,125
So everyone knows
about her except me?!

213
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,833
Well, basically.

214
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,250
Why didn't you punks
clue me in earlier!!!

215
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,083
It's complicated.

216
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,208
Well, what are you
looking at me for?

217
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,583
We don't have time
to talk about this!

218
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,500
Aw have a heart Kurama,
tell me what her name is.

219
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,333
Five minutes left.

220
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,208
I'll talk to you
about her later!

221
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,291
Okay, you better
mean it!!

222
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,291
Any day now, Urameshi!

223
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,250
Get off me, I'm going
as fast as I can!

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
[YUSUKE]
Um, guys?

225
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,833
What's the deal with the
stupid looking name tags?

226
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,833
If a certain someone
had paid more attention

227
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,583
when I was explaining
their tools to them,

228
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,291
they'd know that these
are your Megiru Seals!

229
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,625
Oh yeah, I forgot,
sorry about that.

230
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,583
Ya know, sometimes I think
you might be the imposter.

231
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,166
Wait, that's the only one
who can remove the seal

232
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,208
is the one who put it on, right?

233
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,083
Yes, because both
humans and demons

234
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,250
have their own
unique energy print.

235
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey that's it!!

236
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,750
I see, the imposter
cannot remove the seals.

237
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,500
All right, ready?

238
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,666
[ALL] Ready.

239
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,708
This is rather troubling.

240
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,333
What the hell?!

241
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,875
This smells
fishy, guys.

242
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,208
But this is impossible,

243
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,125
these things are supposed
to be fool proof.

244
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,125
So there was never an
imposter to begin with.

245
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,416
He's been bluffing
the whole time!

246
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,333
Good guess, but I
assure you there's a fake.

247
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,666
Yanagisawa's
power is copy,

248
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,541
and that is why your
seals don't work.

249
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,291
He has the ability to copy
not only someone's appearance,

250
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,000
but their voice, their
mannerisms, their memories,

251
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,208
and yes, even this
so-called energy print.

252
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,375
He could copy
your own mother

253
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,083
and you would never
tell the difference,

254
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,041
not even with your
little magic stickers.

255
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,375
Bastard.

256
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,333
From what my watch says,
your time's run out.

257
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,083
In a few moments,
I'm going to release you.

258
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,958
Then, it will be
decision time.

259
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:19,291
I want you to approach the
person you think is the imposter

260
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,583
and hit them as hard as you can.

261
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,750
Are you insane!?

262
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,125
Sorry champ, but that's the
only way to disarm Yana's power.

263
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,250
He has to be hit so hard that
it knocks him unconscious.

264
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,041
And of course, if you
choose the wrong person,

265
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,708
I'll have your
captive friend killed.

266
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,250
So try to be smart, okay?

267
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,875
What's your deal, what do you
get out of doing this to us?

268
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,916
I was wondering
when you'd ask that.

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,291
You've made a lot of
friends and enemies, Yusuke.

270
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,333
And now, we're doing one
of them a special favor.

271
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,875
Now make your pick.

272
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,500
You only have thirty
seconds to choose.

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I could just order the
hostage to be killed

274
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,666
and save you the trouble.

275
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,166
You have fifteen seconds.

276
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,000
[YUSUKE] Enough! I've decided.
Just don't take this personally.

277
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,958
I hope I'm RIGHT!!!

278
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,625
Uh oh!!

279
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,458
Wow, you actually
figured it out.

280
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,416
How did you know that the
imposter was Kuwabara?

281
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,541
I chose him because I
know that he's used to me

282
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,333
pounding his face in,
if nothing else.

283
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,791
Besides, Hiei and Kurama are
too smart and untrusting.

284
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,083
They'd never just walk
right into your trap.

285
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,500
Yes, or scream
the word Hot.

286
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,916
Now that still
left me Botan.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,708
And if you dirt
bags were low enough

288
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,916
to take advantage of
the only non-fighter,

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,791
it wouldn't matter if I lost.

290
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,250
Even if you killed me,

291
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,291
I would come back from the
dead and drop kick your ass,

292
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,916
so Kuwabara was the safest bet.

293
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,083
My hero!

294
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,750
I must say, you're
quite impressive.

295
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,583
The game is over!
Now cough up Kuwabara!!

296
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,125
And he better
not be injured!

297
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,166
[KIDO]
Kuwabara is just fine.

298
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,458
And I will return him to
you in the very near future.

299
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,833
But first off,

300
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,250
I'd like to introduce to
you the master of this plan.

301
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,291
I can't believe it.

302
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,916
Why would you do
something like this?

303
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,375
Tell me you crazy old hag!!!

304
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,500
[KIDO]
I'm sorry!

305

Forgive me,
I failed you master.

Cool it with the
theatrics all right Kido?

307
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,875
If we're being honest here,

308
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,125
I was counting on
you screwing it up.

309
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,541
You never cease to
surprise me Genkai.

310
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,416
I thought you might have
been behind this little ruse.

311
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,166
This doesn't
make any sense!

312

Why don't you
explain it fox-boy,

313
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,791
'cause I'm
obviously going nuts!!

314
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,875
She was trying to teach
us a very valuable lesson,

315
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,875
a lesson about perception.

316
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,375
Yes, and it's a lesson
you must learn very well.

317
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,166
I guarantee this won't be the
last time you come in contact

318
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,750
with individuals who posses
the power of Territory.

319
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,833
Kurama, when did you
realize it was Genkai?

320
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,166
When we had reached the
top of the stairs.

321
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,708
If they had truly used their
resources, wanted it more,

322
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,041
we most definitely would
have been defeated.

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
Give me a break!

324
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,625
But there was an
ulterior motive here

325
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,083
and I realized that
whoever orchestrated this

326
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,416
was trying to tell us
something about ourselves,

327
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,583
that would require someone
who knows us well,

328
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,250
and meant no harm.

329
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,000
You still haven't
given us a reason.

330
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,666
You haven't
sufficiently explained

331
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,083
what you're trying
to accomplish

332
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,041
just by rubbing their
powers in our faces.

333
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,208
The four of you are
well trained fighters.

334
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,083
However, as three of
you have found out,

335
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,416
there will be instances
when your physical strength

336
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,958
will not be able to help you,
so you must depend on your mind.

337
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,875
If you had used that lump
three feet above your ass

338
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,083
you might've held
on to your soul.

339
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,583
[GENKAI] Make that
two feet for you.

340
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,458
Are you for real,

341
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,208
you actually let those
jerks steal your soul?

342
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,166
Show some skill!

343
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,583
Oh? And what
about you, dimwit?!

344
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,041
Ah, come on, I wouldn't
have been caught

345
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,916
if I had known about
that shadow thing.

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,125
Are you foolish enough to think
that one of your enemies

347
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
would just hand over
that information!?!

348
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,208
If an enemy captures you
you're as good as dead,

349
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,125
if you remember anything
then remember that.

350
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,083
Time out, Grandma.

351
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,291
You keep saying enemy,

352
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,541
but these scrubs aren't
actually bad, right?

353
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,208
So who the hell are they?

354
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,458
Go on, inform them Kido.

355
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,250
Yes master.

356
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,750
Kaitou, Yana and I,
we all went to her compound

357
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,666
for advice when we
developed our powers.

358
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,833
That's where we learned about
you, Yusuke, and your team.

359
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,750
The truth of it is,

360
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,333
we've only had these new
abilities for about a month.

361
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,583
Same as all the
other new psychics.

362
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,000
New psychics?

363
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,750
The cause of which is
our greatest threat.

364
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,000
You're making
me nervous.

365
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,166
I assume some of you
have already noticed

366
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,458
the demon insects flying
through the city.

367
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,375
You don't mean...

368
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,833
Someone is carving out a
tunnel to the Demon World.

369
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,000
Sakyo's plan from
the Dark Tournament

370
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,541
was not buried with him.

371
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,000
What, Sakyo plan?

372
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,791
[KUWABARA] Yeah.
Genkai just filled me in.

373
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,750
Apparently Koenma found
out and never told us.

374
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,916
Sakyo wanted money so he could
drill some doomsday tunnel.

375
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,416
But more importantly, we've
answered the question...

376
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,250
Boxers or briefs.

377
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,250
Would you be serious
for second!

378
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,166
It's not my fault that idiot
stole my clothes! Jeeze!

379
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,708
But how could this be?

380
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,875
I thought Sakyo died when
he blew up the stadium.

381
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,375
[GENKAI] He's dead.
We're sure of that.

382
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,458
And now he's rolling
in his grave,

383
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,041
because someone continued
his plan without him.

384
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,291
It just keeps going,
doesn't it?

385
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,208
[NARRATOR]
The truth is out.

386
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,708
Yusuke's kidnapping
was a mere precursor

387
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,250
to their next great trial.

388
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,041
Who has followed in
Sakyo's footsteps,

389
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,041
and what tragedy awaits
if this tunnel is made?

390
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,416
[YUSUKE] Okay. If anyone's ever
had questions about Demons,

391
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,625
or Demon World,

392
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,250
or what happens when a
crazy guy unleashes

393
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,166
shopping-mall sized
beasts on the earth,

394
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,500
you're gonna hate yourself
for the rest of your life

395
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,458
if you miss
this next episode.

396
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,333
Koenma's laying
out all the secrets

397
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,666
he's kept since the first
time I got hit by a car.

398
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,833
Plus, you'll get a glimpse
of the kick ass new villain,

399
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,333
and a certain frightening
head in a fish tank.

400
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,791
Sound exciting?
Well of course it does!

401
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:20,666
Just watch my friggin' life,
next time on Yu Yu Hakusho.

402
