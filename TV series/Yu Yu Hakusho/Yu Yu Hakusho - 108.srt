Having seen the fiercest
showdowns ever presented

in a tournament arena, all

00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,625

round two will bring.

[KURAMA] Oh, I'm fine. And don't
worry, I'm taking my vitamins.

16
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,333
Well, I just wanted
to apologize

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,333
for being so selfish
all this time.

18
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:37,166
I've been doing a lot of
thinking about the future.

[KURAMA]
Yes.

I'll be home in a
couple of weeks.

of Group B in the second round

31
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,208
of the main tournament is
a very interesting pairing.

00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,250
Kurama, the former military
chief of staff of Gandara

At this time we would ask

came to see me,

I observed that your lack of
hesitation in betraying me again

wasn't surprising.

It was as if you were
calculating something.

You see, you seem to make
many of your decisions

based on a future that
may or may not be.

instead of just one thing.

have taught me much.

all of the pain of the past.

what you are truly capable.

[DEMON GROWD cheers]

67
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,583
[KOTO] According to the
information I have here,

68
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,333
Shigure is a chiropractor
in the Demon World.

69
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,333
Mr. Youda, do you know exactly
what this job entails?

70
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,583
Yes. The Demon World
Chiropractor is what is known

71
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,625
widely as a 'doctor of
darkness.' He specializes

72
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,375
in the manipulation
of demons' abilities.

73
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,666
He also has a vast knowledge
when it comes to implanting new

74
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,833
abilities in demons
using a secret method

75
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,291
originally developed
in the demonic arts.

76
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,375
This intense operation, however,
cannot be executed without

77
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,916
the surgeon's ability to cut
precisely at one-seven

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,375
hundredth of
one millimeter.

79

With precision like that
in the operating room,

80
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,500
you can simply imagine
his agility with a sword.

Can you tell us which
abilities Shigure

82
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,875
has installed in which demons?

83
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,500
No...

84
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,916
that is a violation of doctor,
patient confidentiality.

it stays interesting.

Underestimating an opponent is
the first step towards defeat.

I also consider a battle
more like chess, Kurama.

It is when you fail to see your
adversary's moves in advance

that the game can
quickly turn on you.

to this answer.

Based on my keen sense
of observation,

Kurama had a detachment
with his feelings inside.

00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,250
his demon energy increases...

163
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,750
Considering that Yoko
Kurama is the true version

164
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,708
of this fighter, it is natural
for him to resort back.

165
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,000
I believe he has been
biding his time,

166
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
waiting for this transformation.

167
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,666
So you would call
this a strategic move,

168
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
not just a coincidence?

169
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,000
[KOENMA]
They're wrong.

170
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,666
--[JORGE] Hm?
--Uh? About what?

171
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,125
[KOENMA]
I don't believe it's strategy.

172
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,625
[KOENMA] I wonder if Kurama
tried to transform.

173
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,083
Interesting.

174
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,416
[yells]

175
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,583
[KURAMA] I meant to follow
through with my original plans.

176
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,833
I was going to leave Human World

177
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,791
as soon as I regained
my demonic powers.

178
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
But from that day...

179
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:41,791
From the day I became
Suuichi Minamono...

180
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,750
[KURAMA'S MOTHER]
Suuichi, are you all right?

181
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,583
You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

182
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,958
[KURAMA]
No, mother...

183
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,833
[KURAMA] I loved her as
if she were my true mother.

184
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,291
[gasps] This doesn't make
sense. It's my wish.

185
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,541
Yeah? Well it doesn't make
sense rescuing your mom

186
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,541
so she can spend her whole life
mourning the death of her son!

187
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,250
[KURAMA]
Hiei...

188
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,791
Yusuke...

189
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,291
Kuwabara...

190
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,500
Everyone.

191
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,541
I want none of you to miss me,
as I leave this form behind.

192
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,916
[KURAMA] Never again
will I be Yoko Kurama.

193
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,916
[KURAMA] I cannot betray
my true self any longer.

194
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,791
[KURAMA gasps]

195
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,750
Why have you stopped fighting?

196
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,333
[SHIGURE]
What are you doing?!

197
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,333
[SHIGURE gasps]
Hmph.

198
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,791
[KOTO]
What is he thinking?!

199
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,750
After taking the upper
hand in the battle

200
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,833
following his transformation,
Kurama has suddenly

201
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,208
de-formed back into his
less powerful self!

202
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,916
And now he's just waiting
there, completely unguarded!

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,541
So, your struggles
are internal.

204
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,291
I could help you.

205
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,708
And all you would have
to do is ask me, Kurama.

206
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,791
I don't need a butcher to
improve my fighting abilities.

207
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,625
I only need to learn greater
degree of discipline.

208
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,583
Kurama... Why are
you doing this?

209
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:48,083
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
we walk away from this battle.

210
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,833
[KURAMA]
Uh?!

211
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,750
[screams]

212
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,583
[gasps]

213
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,208
Kurama!

214
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,041
[KURAMA grunts]

215
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,708
[SHIGURE]
Are you ready to concede?

216
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,083
Because it looks like
you've had enough.

217
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,250
[chuckles]

218
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,541
What are you trying
to prove, Kurama?

219
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,791
When he throws
that thing again,

220
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,625
you spring forward and
hit him at close range.

221
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,458
That's the way you win this...

222
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,708
Up close and personal.

223
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,166
In that condition, he wouldn't
stand up to another attack

224
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,708
from anyone, much less
Shigure and his blade.

225
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,750
I hate to say it,
but this fight is over.

226
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,333
Kurama... Make a move!

227
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,208
[panting]

228
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,791
What is in your mind?

229
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,291
Uh?!

230
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,208
[KURAMA grunting]

231
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:59,458
I planted seeds of the Okunenju
here a long time ago...

232
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,541
You can never plan
too far in advance.

233
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,916
There's no way you can
unearth the Okunenju

234
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,625
with the amount of power
you have left in that form.

235
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,125
I will not resort to using Yoko.

236
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,833
[yells]

237
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,250
[KOTO] I have never
seen this kind of oddity

238
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,041
in the arena before! If I'm
to understand this one,

239
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,583
Kurama must have planted
the seeds for this Okunenju root

240
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,125
thousands of years ago with
the knowledge that he could

241
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,791
revive the roots if
necessary in the future.

242
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,708
[KOENMA]
Very smart.

243
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,625
He can get the roots
around the back of Shigure

244
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,291
and take the upper hand.

245
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,000
That's hoping he still has
the strength to control them.

246
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,291
Nice little trick.

247
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,708
[YOMI]
As always, so innovative.

248
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,458
[SHIGURE grunting]

249
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,916
[panting]

250
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,541
Not a problem. [grunts]

251
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,083
I'll finish this battle
a swordfighter,

252
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
and walk away proud.

253
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,833
[KURAMA yells]

254
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,291
[SHIGURE gasps, growls]

255
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,666
Get out of there.

256
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,375
[YUSUKE whimpers]

257
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,458
[BOTAN gasps]

258
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,916
[yells]

259
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,458
[SHIGURE gasps]

260
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,375
[SHIGURE whimpers]

261
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,708
[SHIGUIRE]
I concede.

262
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,125
[KURAMA]
Accepted.

263
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,958
I must admit...

264
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,208
These are some of the
most beautiful flowers

265
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,916
I have ever seen.

266
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,250
Yes.

267
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,291
Cherish them.

268
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,375
[gasps]

269
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,375
Shigure, what are you doing--

270
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,750
Ah!

271
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,875
[SHIGURE] A true swordsman
can never lose twice.

272
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
This is the only way.

273
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,833
The honorable way.

274
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,291
[KOTO] Shigure has
admitted defeat,

275
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,958
and thrown himself from
the staging area.

276
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,416
He will be remembered
with reverence.

277
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,208
[KURAMA groans]

278
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,125
[KOTO] Kurama has passed out
right at his moment of victory.

279
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,208
Can we get someone out
there to check on him?

280
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
Wait! I see something!

281
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,458
You got better eyes than me.

282
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:00,291
[sighs]

283
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,833
Y-Yomi...

284
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,208
[YOMI]
Kurama.

285
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Have you forever deserted
yourself as Yoko?

286
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,166
Oh, no...

287
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,625
I never leave anything behind.

288
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,875
I never have.

289
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,791
[YUSUKE]
Kurama!

290
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,916
[laughs]

291
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,708
[KOENMA] Mukuro and Hiei
have long been considered

292
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,416
the loners of Demon World.

293
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,791
But next time, only one
of them will advance

294
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,416
to the next round because
these loners have to face off

295
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,083
in the ring. They
each have deep scars

296
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,666
inside that no battle
can ever heal.

297
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,000
But I doubt that will
stop them from trying.

298
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,541
The problem with this bout is
that neither of these fighters

299
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,666
faces an opponent in the ring...

300
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,916
All they can ever
face are themselves.

301
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,875
See who advances next time,
on Yu Yu Hakusho!
