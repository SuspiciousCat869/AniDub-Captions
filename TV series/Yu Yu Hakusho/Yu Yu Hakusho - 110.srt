156
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,333
to just take a
punch in the face.

157
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,625
Well...

158
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,625
That's why I'm here,
to make dreams come true.

159
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,041
[YOMI] It's that impetuous
spirit that does it to me.

160
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,083
You care to guess...

161
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,791
what my next urge is?

162
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,791
I'll take a stab.

Wait. Something's wrong.

00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,458
[YUSUKE]
I don't feel any of this.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,958
And Yusuke goes down!

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,583
[YUSUKE]
What's wrong with me?

170
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,958
I feel like I'm not alive,
but not dead either.

171
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,500
Like my body's just... empty.

172
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,083
I've never seen Urameshi

173
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,208
with such a lifeless
look in his eyes before.

174
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh sure. 'Twas a
biggie what hit 'im,

175
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,375
but I know he's survived
worse than that!

[YOMI]
Mm, mm, mm.

177
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,000
And which one of us is
playing a game now, Urameshi?

178
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,375
I know that weak blast
couldn't have done this.

179
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,583
No, there's something else
draining all the passion

180
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,416
out of you now.
What could it be?

181
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,291
It just hit me...

182
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,833
I don't know what I'm
fighting for anymore.

00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,875
You insolent child!

[YUSUKE groaning]

186
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,250
This was your idea,
that you set in motion!

187
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,958
I don't get it.

188
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,208
Yomi's giving Yusuke
a relentless pummeling,

189
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,875
but Yusuke's just taking
it like a lifeless rag doll!

[yells]

195
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,333
I have given up everything
I thought was important

196
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,208
to fight in this
tournament with honor.

197
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,208
You made me do that. You
can't just take it back now!

[YOMI yells]

199
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,208
[YUSUKE] I've spent most of my
life fighting, and being angry.

200
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,500
And for what?

201
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,416
I gave all I had against
Toguro, and Sensui.

202
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,750
But... it was for their reasons.

203
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,458
They wanted someone strong
to take their lives.

204
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
But what's my reason?

205
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,875
What's all this
been building up to?

206
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,208
What if I'm not angry now?

207
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,833
Am I just looking for
someone to take my life?

208
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,208
For good?

209
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,500
[RAIZEN] Oh, quit feeling
sorry for yourself, kid.

210
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,333
[YUSUKE]
Raizen?

211
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,125
You knew before, but you've
lost sight of it, since.

212
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,666
[YUSUKE]
I knew what? And when?

213
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,833
The reason you returned to
this world in the first place.

214
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,458
Even though it meant deserting
the only person you loved

215
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,666
more than yourself.

216

[YUSUKE gasps]

217
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,791
I can't ever be satisfied
until I figure out what that

218
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,666
other part of me is and I
don't care where it takes me.

You haven't changed.

220

[YUSUKE] I'm serious.
Three years and I'll be back...

I'm going into high school.

222
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,500
A lot could happen in that time.

223
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,958
You came to reconcile
your identity.

224
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,833
And though I'm gone, you've yet
to determine what part I play.

225
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,291
And what your purpose is.

to her until I do!

Wow! Another shocking reversal!

231
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,458
Just when it looked like
Yomi was about to end it,

232
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,500
Yusuke sprung back
to life and unleashed

233
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,833
a bone-shattering
wallop of his own.

234
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,333
Suddenly, he's covered
with the mark of the Ma-zoku,

235
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,833
and like I always say,

236
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,541
nothing goes together like
rippling muscles and tattoos!

237

Ha. Well will you
take a look at this?

238
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,250
You prob'ly should've stopped
hitting me, 'cause now you've

239
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,125
woken up the part of Raizen
that lives on in me.

240
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,083
And he gets grumpy first
thing in the morning.

You don't know how
pleased I am to hear that.

As much fun as it is
sparring with you,

wished I could defeat.

we both have something
in common after all.

up my ancestral dad.

Yusuke just shot off his Spirit
Gun at point blank range!

253
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,291
Or since he used Demon Energy,

254
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,916
should I say his Demon Gun.
Whatever the case, I love it!

Against all odds,
Yomi has managed to escape

258
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,625
the brunt of Yusuke's Demon
Gun entirely unscathed,

259
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,000
with some sort of last
second force field!

Demon Energy Absorbing Wall...

261
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,291
As you've seen, both now
and in my fight with Shura,

262
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,291
it is invincible to any attack.

263
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,791
We'll see!

264
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,666
It's no use.

[YUSUKE]
Then you don't mind if I try!

266
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,541
Undeterred, Yusuke continues
firing shot after shot,

267
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,833
but to no avail! He may
as well be firing blanks.

I don't know what Yusuke
thinks he's doing,

but at this point he's just
exhausting his energy supply.

Of course!

He's mixing his Spirit Energy
together with his Demon Energy!

A potent combination

277

that only someone of Yusuke's
odd origin could make.

312
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,500
And the fate of three
worlds must be resolved.

313
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,583
[YUSUKE] I may be getting off
on the thrill of the fight,

314
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,916
but that doesn't make hurtling
through a forest of trees

315
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,500
any less painful.

316
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,166
Anyway, like days off of school,
TV shows, and all good things,

317
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,458
my fight with Yomi
has to come to an end.

318
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,916
Along with the Demon
World Tournament.

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,166
And then we have to find out

320
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,208
what happens with
the rest of all our lives!

321
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,625
I'd tell you how the
whole thing ends,

322
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,750
but, of course, I'd
have to kill you then.

323
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,791
And then you wouldn't be
able to see it for yourself

324
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,083
on the next to last
Yu Yu Hakusho.

325
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,458
So don't miss it.
