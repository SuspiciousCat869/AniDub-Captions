I'll turn this sword on you!

And I'm not stopping

being stubborn you dope!

Let me take over!

190
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,500
There's no way you can beat
all four of those beasts

After all that, he's finally
had enough sense to retreat,

In the end the fool runs away.

stabbing it once I got

a monster-beast shish kabob now.

they're chained up

starts calling for his mommy?

fighting better than Yusuke!
