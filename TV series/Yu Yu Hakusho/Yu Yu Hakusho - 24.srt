That was weird.

Can you sense where
this guy is hiding?

161

Nuh-uh, he's too fast. It
feels like he's all around us.

You okay?

163
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,958
Let's run!

[INMAKI]
Yes, the old cat and mouse.

166
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,333
Botan, take this next corner!

167
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,208
[BOTAN]
Right!

Okay! He's here!

Shot gun!!!

172
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,125
Kind of a cheap move when
you don't even have to aim!

173
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:40,666
What??

174
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,083
[INMAKI]
What?

175
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,458
When there was
only one direction

176
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,250
you could come from it was easy!

177
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,583
I just had to sense your
Spirit Energy round the corner.

178
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,791
And taking my cue
from Kuwabara here,

179
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
I just fired a
major Shotgun blast

180
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,541
to cover the whole
stretch of the hallway.

181

Clever, huh?

Yeah! Pound 'em Yusuke!

Now Koenma sir,

186

you do remember that
if Yusuke beats the Triad

187
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,083
I get to eat your sugarcoated
strawberry rice cake, right?

188

[KOENMA]
I quit this bet.

But sir!

190

Everyone knows if you quit a bet

191

you have to swallow
a thousand needles!

Oh I forgot!

[Gokumonki laughs]

196

The name's Gokumonki,
third demon of the Triad.

197
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll write it
on your gravestone!

198

Are you sure you
won't hit your friend?

199

Yes, good question!

Ah, dirty trick!

Very good!

What the hell was that?

205
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,416
I was afraid of hitting Botan!

206
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,458
I must've held
back too much energy!

207

Can you get up?

You don't have the nerve to
attack me as long as I have her!

Shoot!

Unless you have another plan,
I'm going to start the crushing!

What a win, sir!
Did you see that?!

217
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,583
[KOENMA] Well of course I did!
Don't ask silly questions--

218
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,583
Obviously I did a good
job selecting Yusuke!

219
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,625
What happened to my sugarcoated
strawberry rice cake??

220

My goodness! I must have
accidentally eaten it just now!

221
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,583
You see I get so very
excited when Yusuke wins

00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,333
that my hand just starts
throwing things in my mouth!

You really
think I'm stupid.

Get ready Tarukane!
We're coming to get you!

[TARUKANE THINKS] ] I never
dreamed they'd be this strong!

227

[CLUB MAN 3] I'd say that wraps
up our bet with the demon Triad!

228
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,291
Yes, and it appears
I've won again.

229
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,916
Perhaps you should
quit now, Tarukane.

230
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,041
That brings my winnings
up to fifty billion.

231

Speak for yourself, Sakyou.

232
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,500
You may have raked in a fortune,

but the rest of us haven't been
so lucky! We gotta keep playing!

Sakyou seems to have the
inside track on these fights.

00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,583
I say we all bet on

and make back all of our money!

only one more bet!

Yes brother, now it's
finally our turn to fight.

Who will win the final
battle, the intruders,

241
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,458
or the Toguro Brothers?

[TARUKANE THINKS] Only I know
the Toguro's true power.

243
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,666
They'll bet a few
billion on the intruders,

244
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,083
and I'll make my money back!

All eyes are on you,
Sakyou. What's the call?

[SAKYO]
Sixty six trillion,

two hundred million on
the intruders' victory.

That's unheard of!

It's more than Japan's
Gross National Product!

It's more than
any country's product!

But by my calculations.

That is your Gross Product

if you include the

but he could do it!

262
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,541
[CLUB MAN 3] And that
means he has to accept the bet!

we're saving my love!!

316
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,125
Hurry!

317
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,666
[YUSUKE] Ooh! A basement!

318
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,083
So this is her filthy prison.

319
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,000
I, can't believe
they would be here!

320
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,500
[HIEI THINKS] Yukina
hold on, I'm coming.

321
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,708
[YUSKE] What are these things?

322
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,583
[BOTAN]
Disgusting, I'd say.

323
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,000
Come on guys! We don't
have time for that!!

324
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,125
The door's closing.

325
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,291
Hurry!!

326
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,375
I take it we
have one more fight.

327
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,875
Forget it.

328
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,833
Their total Spirit Energy
couldn't hurt a wingless fly!

329
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,458
[KUWABARA] There she is!!

330
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,750
Don't worry. We're
coming for you soon!

331
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,916
Both the brothers are fighting?
I feel sorry for Yusuke.

332
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,708
Are you sorry,
for the rice cake?

333
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:33,583
Welcome, try not to be
too hard on us--We're fragile.

334
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,166
[NARRATOR]
Everyone seems to know

335
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,041
the Toguro Brothers' reputation.

336
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,500
Except for the two boys
about to fight them.

337
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,000
Can Yusuke and Kuwabara
overcome this strange pair?

338
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,958
And what exactly is the
secret behind their power?

339
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,583
[BOTAN] What a fight!

340
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,625
We've got two demon brothers
versus two human friends,

341
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,041
punching it out over
an ice apparition who,

342
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,333
let's not forget,
is Hiei's sister!

343
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,333
But before Hiei crashes
the party--which he will--

344
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,250
You'll be amazed at how
the Toguro Brothers fight,

345
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,250
giving a whole
new meaning to teamwork!

346
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,250
Our side is clearly outmatched,

347
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,250
but Kuwabara's emotions
will unlock a level of power

348
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,000
he's never reached before!

349
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,958
Don't miss this dynamite
episode of Yu Yu Hakusho!
