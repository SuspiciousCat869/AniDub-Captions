00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,750
I should warn you that my sword
knows many impressive tricks

158
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,083
beyond the Chorus
of a Thousand Skulls.

159
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,250
Surround us with
The Cage of Hell!

160
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,958
Run! Run as fast as you like!

161
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,916
You'll run out of
breath before you get out!

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,750
There's no escape
for you this time!

163
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,708
He's taken the disenfranchised
cries of the dead

164
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,333
and materialized them
into an enclosure.

165
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,416
It's one hell of a cage
match-- to the death!

166
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,250
Idealists like you who fight
for justice make me retch.

167
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,916
Stardom is the
purest fuel for strength

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
and that's how
it should always be.

169
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,833
You softies are only
crowding the room.

170
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Where'd you get the impression

171
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,833
I'm some kind of
crime-fighting hero?

172
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,791
I thought you were
familiar with my past.

173
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Yes, like every other
apparition in this stadium

174
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,750
who cares one
inkling for history!

175
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,833
And the choice you're famous
for is an insult I will replace!

176
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,833
I will be a big star!

177
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,750
And I already am
one, pretty-boy.

178
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,666
Pay attention,
you'll learn something.

179
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,958
Shut up!

180
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,125
You're worth
nothing to me alive!

181
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,583
I'll slice you in half, human!

182
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,250
That's hard core!

183
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,666
I thought she
was drained.

184
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,791
Where did she
get all this power?

185
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,083
You're back?

186
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,833
Spirit Reflection Blast!

187
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,583
She knocked Mr. Pompous
flat on his patoot!

188
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,666
[SHISHI WAK.]
How?

189
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,958
I can't afford to
waste my own energy,

190
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,791
so I borrowed some of yours.

191
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,750
I hope you can understand.
I am a very busy old lady.

192
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,666
How could you do such
a vindictive thing to me,

193
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
you second rate thief!

194
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,208
The energy in that attack was
mine, and it was destined to--

195
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,833
to earn my greatness!

196
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,958
Don't you... Don't you realize
what I am supposed to become?

197
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,625
[KURAMA THINKS] Perhaps
I could learn something

198
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,541
from Genkai as well.

199
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,458
It'll take more
than parlor tricks

200
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,000
to keep a consummate
champion like me down!

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,625
The Chorus of A Thousand Skulls!

202
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,458
No! This can't happen!

203
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,791
Apparently Shishi
had a lot more energy

204
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,916
than we first
gave him credit for.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,375
Had is right.

206
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,958
Little good it's doing him
now that Genkai's claimed it.

207
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,166
It's good to see her again.
Man, she's somethin' else!

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,416
Yeah! Kick some demon butt!

209
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,250
Give it back!

210
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,958
Die!

211
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,333
Spirit Reflection Blast!

212
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,791
[SHISHI WAK.] Cheating thief...

213
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,375
...you really don't
fight for justice.

214
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,166
No, I fight to get what I need
for myself, and always have.

215
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,958
I attack whoever
stands in my way.

216
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,083
It just so happens that a
great deal of those people

217
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,875
happen to be demons.

218
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,750
I think I may have
fallen in love.

219
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,916
If things had turned
out differently for us,

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,625
and if you still looked
like this all the time,

221
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,541
we could've been
together, once.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
[GENKAI] Aren't
I a lucky one?

223
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,791
She's as I remember.

224
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,958
After watching that
exhibition, Karasu,

225
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,583
tell me Genkai is not
worthy of her legend?

226
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,000
She makes tactics useless.

227
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,958
The only way to crush
her is absolute force!

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,666
Woo hoo, way to go girl power!

229
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,500
What's it like bein' a
young gal in a mostly male--

230
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,875
Oh, never mind. Good job!

231
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,875
The winner of the
match is Genkai!

232
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,333
[boos]

233
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,625
[JURI] That victory gives Team
Urameshi a strong 4 to 1 lead

234
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,916
in this Semi-final round!

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,875
One more win and they advance!

236
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,583
And there's only
one man left standing

237
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,791
on Team Uraotogi to stop them!

238
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,958
And he's barely
standing.

239
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,916
That's right.

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,125
He's supposed to be the great
white-haired hope for us all?

241
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,208
[DEMONS] First the old lady,
then the old man.

242
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,750
When did this become
the senior center?

243
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,041
I'd say break a leg,

244
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,083
but I'm scared he
might take it seriously.

245
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,916
I'm more worried
about his hip.

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,708
That's fine. Mock me all you
want you fair-weather demons,

247
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,916
but I can break both
a leg and a hip.

248
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,541
Just as soon as we can determine
to whom they'll belong.

249
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,958
[Onji chuckles]

250
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,375
[ONJI] I can see
no reason to cast the

251
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,666
die for my team, do you?

252
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,541
Kinda lacks
the suspense.

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,625
So if you don't mind, I'll
just give your die a solo roll.

254
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,916
Well, what have we here?

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
Team Urameshi's die
calls for Kuwabara

256
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,458
to step into the ring now,

257
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,583
but the poor fellow is
stranded in another dimension.

258
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,041
Let's roll again!

259
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,750
[KUWABARA]
Not so fast, referee!

260
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,458
You've come back to us!

261
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,750
See, I never got
lost anywhere for long.

262
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,833
Oh my! We thought you were
a dead-and-gone for sure.

263
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,250
I guess the "Cape of No Return"
is a misleading name.

264
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,708
Ladies and gentlemen
and other stuff,

265
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,416
Kuwabara returns!

266
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,041
[crowd boos]

267
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,625
Well, is this a tough crowd!

268
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,208
I've seen funeral
parlors more happenin'!

269
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,875
[ONJI THINKS]
It's far from over.

270
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,458
With that big
mouth as my opponent,

271
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,083
I know exactly
the attack to recycle.

272
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,916
As acting captain it's my
job to end this with dignity.

273
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:14,750
[KUWABARA] So let's get
ready to rock and roll! Yee-ha!

274
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,666
Did you hear that jackass?!

275
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,666
If he's has to act
lame over the speakers,

276
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,375
he could at least not use
our family name. Idiot!

277
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,500
Wait, Shizuru!

278
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,708
[BOTAN]
Oops!

279
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,958
[BOTAN] Come on, Yukina.
Hurry, let's go!

280
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,250
Wait! Don't leave me here!
What am I supposed to do?

281
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,208
Oh, you know.

282
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,375
Don't they teach
you kids anything

283
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,125
in health class anymore?

284
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,625
What do you mean?

285
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,291
Look around, the birds
the bees the flowers the trees!

286
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,000
I am not that kind
of girl, Botan!

287
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,541
I know a nosy, diary-reading
kitten who says otherwise! Meow!

288
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,875
We'll leave you alone
to figure it out.

289
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,291
Be careful Keiko!

290
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,000
Bye!

291
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,916
[KEIKO] Guys! Don't go
in there without me!

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,083
He's not even conscious!

293
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,833
[KEIKO THINKS]
He's gotten taller.

294
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
Hard to believe
that not too long ago,

295
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,708
we were arguing
about silly little things

296
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,875
like a his uniform.

297
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,458
I guess we've both
really changed a lot.

298
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,916
Um, excuse me!

299
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,541
[KEIKO THINKS] Oh Yusuke,
we're gonna be okay.

300
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,875
Aren't we?

301
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,625
[NARRATOR] And so
Yusuke rests, at peace after

302
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,625
his arduous ordeal, oblivious
to his team's standing

303
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,416
in the Dark Tournament.

304
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,708
[NARRATOR] Kuwabara definitely
has something to prove,

305
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,291
as the only member
of Team Urameshi

306
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,750
to lose a match
in the semi-finals.

307
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,958
Onji is the one remaining
obstacle to advancing,

308
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,500
but is there more to him than
his wrinkled skin suggests?

309
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,916
The sixth match of the Dark
Tournament's semi-finals!

310
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,458
Kuwabara against Onji!

311
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
[NARRATOR]
Shishiwakamaru was the

312
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,291
acting leader of Team Uraotogi,

313
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,750
but it seems the secret
weapons each member employed

314
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,041
came from this old man.

315
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,250
Can Kuwabara finish the
round and recover his dignity,

316
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,541
or will he be doomed
to further humiliation?

317
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,250
[YUSUKE] Hey guys. Sorry
for being MIA for a while,

318
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,583
but you gotta admit
I deserve a nap

319
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,541
after the stuff
Genkai put me through.

320
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,791
Of course, I could beat a time
capsule like Onji in my sleep,

321
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,250
but I'll bet Kuwabara
wishes Yukina weren't watching.

322
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,875
Nothing worse than getting
the runaround from some old guy

323
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,208
in front of a girl you like,

324
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,750
not that I'd know
anything about it.

325
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,250
So don't miss the next episode,

326
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,125
because while Kuwabara
doesn't want to know

327
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,541
what Onji's hands are doing,

328
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,250
I'm sure you sick-os
will love it.

329
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,916
That's next time
on Yu Yu Hakusho!
