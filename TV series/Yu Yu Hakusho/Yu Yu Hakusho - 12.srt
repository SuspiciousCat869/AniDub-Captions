That is right,
isn't it master?

Yes, if it's misused.

162
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,125
Of course I wouldn't
ever use it that way,

163
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,625
but it's great to
know the potential.

Not so fast, you freak.

165

You have to beat me first.

166

And in case you didn't know...

a Spirit Detective.

Let the final match begin.
Shorin versus Yusuke.

169
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,666
[KOENMA] Their power
charts are well matched.

170
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,000
You better win Yusuke!

171
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,791
Well, I see your
Spirit Energy

172

is recovering
nicely on this hill.

Ready?

174
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,125
The first one is for Kuwabara!

175
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,541
And I've still
got ninety-nine more.

176

One for every psychic
who's life you stole.

His Spirit Power scored a 155,

179
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,041
but it must've
increased to over 200

180
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,750
to make that kind of impact.

181
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,208
You better stand...

182
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,375
I'll feel bad hitting you
if you're glued to the ground.

Of all my techniques
I enjoy this the most.

188

Congratulations.

189
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,333
I once knew of a fighter

190
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,333
who made quite a name for
himself with this attack.

191
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,333
It creates a vacuum
around the opponent,

192
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,083
and causes air
to escape violently

193
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,166
from their body through
cuts in the skin.

194
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,166
And with as many battle
wounds as you have,

195
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,000
Yusuke, it
should be very painful.

196
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,791
Ouch.

197
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,750
Now that's surprising.

198
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:17,291
Most would pass out from the
pain, shall we try it again?!

No. Just mad.

[Yusuke cries out]

I don't know
where he got the will

204
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,458
to endure that kind of pain,

205
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,083

into the eye of the tornado!

[YUSUKE]
I got him.

And he wasn't
joking about the pain.

You got him good Yusuke! He'll
probably be out for a week!

Well, that's what happens
when you piss me off.

like that, Gramdma?

Yes, Mr. Urameshi, you

They tend to know things.

For example, that I am a demon
who will not be destroyed.

that I must kill you all,

How will I choose
to torture you?
