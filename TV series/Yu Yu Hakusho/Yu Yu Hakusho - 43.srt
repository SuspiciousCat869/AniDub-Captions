Hello.

158
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,291
Guess you guys have
the same idea we do

159
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,625
about scoping out our
competition for the semi-finals.

160
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
Had the same idea.
The fight's over.

161
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,916
What?!

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,541
[KOTO] And so, the first
match of the semi-finals

163
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,375
will see Team Urameshi facing
off against the unbeatable,

164
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,083
indefeatable, beyond
believable Team Uraotogi!

165
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,583
That is unbelievable.

166
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,250
I mean I can't believe
we missed the entire fight

167
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,291
just because I took a
couple of extra minutes

168
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,750
to brush my teeth.

169
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,208
It was an impressive
sight to behold.

170
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,041
Though I'm sure your
minty fresh breath

171
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,541
was well worth the delay.

172
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,458
What is that
ridiculous appendage

173
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
growing out of
your head all about?

174
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,291
It's just a puberty thing okay?

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,583
So Kurama. How's the
wound treatin' you?

176
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,125
It will be fine. I will
be fighting again tomorrow.

177
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,583
Seems it's not as bad
as you made us think.

178
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,583
Compared with your energy
loss, no it seems it's not.

179
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,666
Hey! I've got an idea, you guys!

180
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,791
Ask Yukina to use
her healing power!

181
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,875
She's amazing! As
soon as she touches you,

182
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,166
you'll feel better than
you ever have before!

183
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,833
She's pretty, too!

184
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,500
She's actually partly here

185
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,500
to look for her
long-lost estranged brother...

186
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,625
I'm gonna help her look for him

187
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,750
just as soon as we
win this tournament.

188
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,583
Yukina's brother. Yes,
sounds like a noble cause.

189
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,416
We should assist
her too, Hiei.

190
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,208
Yeah you could
even lend an eye!

191
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,458
Will you shut up?

192
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,416
Wait, huh? What's
going on here?

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,458
Am I missing something, what
aren't you guys telling me,

194
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,750
uh, what do you keep
laughing about anyway?

195
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,000
Just what Hiei said

196
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,833
about this ridiculous
thing on my head--right?

197
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,958
I heard him say that.
It wasn't that funny.

198
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,875
Hello! What's your problem?

199
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,541
[CROWD] It's Team Toguro!

200
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:51,833
[CROWD CHANTS]
Toguro! Toguro!...

201
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,416
I think he pointed at the human!

202
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,875
Just can't wait
to kill him, can he?

203
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,333
[TOGORO 2 THINKS] You and me...

204
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,166
A fight to the death.
Soon enough, Urameshi.

205
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,916
[MASKED FIGHTER]
At least your act is tough.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey! I work
hard at it!

207
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
No! This can't be.

208
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,583
How could I have
missed it for so long?

209
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,375
They must've shielded their
energy from detection.

210
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,708
I feel so, light-headed.

211
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,166
We can't compete
with these guys, Urameshi.

212
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,166
What are we gonna do?

213
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,541
[KOTO] Sorry for
the delay folks.

214
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,416
We weren't prepared for the
last fight to end so-- abruptly.

215
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,708
But now, get ready to watch as
Team Gorenja takes on Team Kido.

216
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,000
We can only hope
it'll be half as brutal

217
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,791
and twice as long
as the last match.

218
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,166
[KOTO] Momorenja's a lot
tougher than she looks,

219
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,791
if you can even
keep an eye on her.

220
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,541
Oh! That's the most blood
I've seen in quite some time!

221
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,458
I hope you didn't miss that
one, people! It was crucial!

222
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,291
I'm just saying it's not
that big a deal, Kuwabara,

223
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,041
and us bitching about
it isn't gonna help.

224
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,708
You probably feel
their powers now

225
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,541
'cause your
senses got better.

226
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,708
Come on, Toguro's the guy

227
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,500
who made us come to
this stupid tournament.

228
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,333
None of us thought it
was gonna to be a joy ride,

229
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,833
but we can beat him okay!

230
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,625
[SHISHIWAKAMARU]
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

231
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,958
Don't you think you all are
forgetting about somebody?

232
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,291
No one of real importance.

233
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,625
Huh? Who's that?

234
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,416
My guess would be
freak show rejects.

235
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I am Kuro Momotaro.

236
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,833
Makintaro.

237
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,833
Uraurashima.

238
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,500
Shishiwakamaru.

239
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,833
And you can just call me Onji.

240
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,958
If you guys are looking
for us to go easy on you,

241
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,166
you're wasting your, and more
importantly, our, precious time.

242
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,875
No, it's the exact opposite.
We want a good fight.

243
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,083
We will be famous,

244
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,458
but we're going to need more
than two minutes of exposure

245
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,750
for us to get that way.

246
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,500
Arrogant little prick,
don't you think?

247
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,916
You can say that again!

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,583
If you want to be famous why
don't you start a boy band--

249
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,000
you got the look down.

250
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,666
We'll get ugly soon enough,
Urameshi! Just you wait!

251
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,250
[laughing]

252
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,250
Those guys aren't
even worth two minutes.

253
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,375
Their powers are nothing

254
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,291
compared to what
Toguro was giving off!

255
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,791
We could always
wear blindfolds.

256
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,083
At least that way
would be amusing.

257
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,000
[MASKED FIGHTER] Pride is
for the weak, Yusuke!

258
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,750
[YUSUKE]
Leave me alone!

259
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,500
Stop looking at me like
that, you masked freak!

260
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,541
If you've got something
to say, say it!

261
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,208
[MASKED FIGHTER]
It's quite simple, really.

262
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,708
If the leader of
Team Toguro is...

263
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,208
Toguro.

264
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,916
Then the leader of Team Urameshi
should be Yusuke Urameshi.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
The question I'm posing is,

266
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,125
do you have what it takes to
beat Toguro all by yourself.

267
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,875
Yusuke Urameshi?

268
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,791
[KUWABARA] Guys, guys. Break it
up. Let's just try to get along.

269
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,458
Kuwabara's right can we please
talk this through peacefully?

270
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,875
[YUSUKE] You think you should
lead this team instead of me?

271
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,166
[MASKED FIGHTER]
If necessary. Follow me.

272
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,375
[YUSUKE] Yeah, let's
take this outside!

273
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,666
Yusuke don't be stupid!

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,291
[HIEI]
Let them be.

275
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,625
They will have to
settle this themselves.

276
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,166
Yeah. That's what
we're afraid might happen.

277
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,125
Those two are so
strong and so mad

278
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,208
they'll probably settle
this all the way to the death,

279
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,375
and that's no good.

280
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,250
It's a shame but there's
nothing we can do.

281
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,666
And even if there were
anything that could be done.

282
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,125
It's hardly our place to
interfere with their affairs.

283
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,958
How can you possibly
say those things?

284
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,166
Can't you see they could
tear this team apart?!

285
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,666
And none of you can even
be bothered enough to care!

00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,750
Where the hell
are you going?

287
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,250
So that's it?

Listen, I understand

00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,708
if you're getting second
thoughts about punching me,

290
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:58,041
but that doesn't mean we have
to go on a stupid nature walk.

[MASKED FIGHTER] I'm not going
to fight you, Yusuke Urameshi.

Okay, now I'm interested.

296
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,083
[KOTO] Team Gorenja
are proving themselves

297
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,583
a force to be reckoned with,

298
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,166
as Akarenja refuses to stay
on the ground long enough

299
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,583
for her opponent
to take a healthy shot!

300

[KOENMA]
I'm bored, Ogre.

301

I just don't have the
attention span for this.

that about, sir?

311
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,708
[SAKYO] Is something wrong?
You're missing the match.

312
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,791
Neither one of those teams
is worthy of me fighting them.

313
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,166
Let alone watching.

314
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,958
[SAKYO] I admire
your elitism.

315
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,416
Word has it

316
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,708
that there's been quite a
bit of unpleasant commotion

317
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,375
over at camp
Team Urameshi.

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,041
Then the Masked Fighter
has set into motion

319
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,666
the final stage of
her plan for Urameshi.

320
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,666
It is about time.

321
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,041
An absolutely lovely
beheading, Kirenja!

322
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:26,583
That means your team is
moving on to the semi-finals!

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,125
[MASKED FIGHTER] I know, I know.
Don't start with me, slacker.

324
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,625
I should have told
you from the start,

325
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,666
but I had my reasons for keeping
my true identity a secret

326
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,291
at the tournament
for as long as possible.

327
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,125
But now is the moment
I've been waiting for.

328
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,333
Then it really was you,
Genkai! I knew it! But wait.

329
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,583
Who was that beautiful young--

330
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,208
[GENKAI] Watch it, kid.
I can still destroy you.

331
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,291
But seriously,
where's your stand in?

332
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,708
You're looking
at her, boy.

333
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,708
Okay I don't understand.
How's that work?

334
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,541
There's no way you
are gonna get this

335
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,125
without a visual demonstration.

336
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,041
See that over there!

337
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,625
[YUSUKE] A big rock? Yeah,
that explains everything.

338
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,083
[GENKAI] Just shoot it with
your Spirit Gun at full power.

339
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,291
But you still haven't
answered my question yet.

340
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,458
Don't make me slap
you upside the head!

341
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,625
Just shoot the damn thing.

342
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,250
Oh all right.

343
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,333
Hag.

344
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,833
I still don't see
how this matters.

345
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,875
Spirit Gun!

346
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,333
Totaled! Are you
happy now, grandma?

347
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,708
I can never tell what's worse.
Your aim or your pride in it.

348
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,000
Give me a break! That was
the perfectest shot there is!

349
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,791
Why don't you show this
young whippersnapper

350
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,500
how it was done
in the olden days?

351
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,541
Gladly, you
patronizing jackass.

352
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,916
What are you doing?

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,416
That boulder is just a little
bit bigger than the one I shot.

354
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,875
Pay attention, slacker.

355
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,458
You've been brought to this
Tournament for one reason.

356
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,333
Toguro knows what
you're capable of.

357
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,250
It's time that you
understood it too.

358
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,500
That was incredible!

359
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,041
My Spirit Gun can't
even compare to yours.

360
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,083
[GENKAI] When you channel your
Spirit Power to its maximum,

361
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,708
the body's cells shift and
you take on the form you had

362
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,625
at the moment you were
most powerful in your life.

363
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,166
In my case, I was a
swinging twenty-something.

364
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,375
Yours is right now,
you just don't know it yet.

365
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,083
That's why
we've come here.

366
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,958
It's time for you
to take the final test

367
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,666
and reach your graduation.

368
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,500
Why do I get the idea that
this isn't gonna be easy?

369
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,291
[NARRATOR] Unmasked at last,

370
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,583
the psychic Genkai
prepares to mentor Yusuke

371
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,250
in one final lesson,

372
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,625
more difficult
than any he has faced.

373
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,333
What is this test,

374
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:49,291
and can Yusuke pass it in time
to defeat the dreaded Toguro?

375
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,125
[YUSUKE] Hey guys. So Genkai
was The Masked Fighter

376
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,458
--anybody see that coming?

377
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm not gonna be the one
that says I told you so,

378
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,416
but I will say I
knew it all along.

379
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,291
Now, you'd think nearly a year
of training would be enough,

380
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,291
but oh no, this last test

381
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,666
is supposed be unlike
anything I've had before,

382
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,166
and with a slave
driving fossil like Genkai,

383
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,250
that says a lot.

384
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,166
Rainy caves, buried in blood,

385
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,500
screaming in pain,
blacking out--

386
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,750
and that's just the start!

387
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,666
You'll want to see
where this one goes, guys,

388
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,916
next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
