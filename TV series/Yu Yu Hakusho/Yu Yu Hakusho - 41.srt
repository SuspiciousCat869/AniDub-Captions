00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,708
They're up to something.

161
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,000
Tournament Committee,
please clarify.

162
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,125
Why have you
interrupted this fight?

163
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,958
Yeah, more importantly why'd
you make me look like a fool?

164
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,791
Upon reviewing the
film of the last fight,

165
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,541
it has been discovered that
Koto delayed her ten count

166
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,666
significantly during
Yusuke's first ring out.

167
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,666
Since when do we
pay attention to that?

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,833
Therefore, by complete
and unanimous decision.

169
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,875
They tell me to delay.

170
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,708
The fight between Yusuke and Jin
has been ruled a double loss,

171
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,750
and therefore Yusuke
is ineligible to fight

172
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,666
for the duration of the round.

173
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,291
Well that's just the
biggest crap job

174
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
I've ever heard in my life!

175
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,291
Yusuke landed
right in front of us.

176
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,583
Do you remember him being
out for more than ten counts!

177
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,750
No!

178
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,458
They always take
their time on the counts!

179
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,833
Yes it was no
longer than usual.

180
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,416
[KURAMA THINKS]
Kuwabara is badly injured

181
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,791
and I've lost a fight.

182
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,583
Hiei and the Masked
Fighter are ineligible.

183
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,083
If Yusuke is ruled out as well.

184
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,291
Our team is out
of the tournament.

185
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,291
[DEMON 3] Who cares!
Urameshi is out!

186
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,541
How can this be over?
I didn't even get to start.

187
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,833
[YUSUKE THINKS] We're dead
if we lose this match now.

188
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,375
[Risho chuckles]

189
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,083
My condolences.

190
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,041
Why are you
waiting, Koto.

191
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,000
Bestow our team
with the victory.

192
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,041
As an experienced officiator.

193
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,291
And as a lover of this
tournament, I must object!

194
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,500
[SPEAKER] There will
be no more deliberation.

195
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,291
Ah come one!
Get on with it!

196
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,625
[Butajiri laughs]

197
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,583
Who needs ninjas, I beat this
whole damn team myself...

198
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,375
The only hard part now
is figuring out which

199
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,916
of my tricks I liked the best...

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,625
The medical tent
capture or those

201
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,500
rulings against
Yusuke and Kurama!

202
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,750
[crash]

203
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,458
I don't like the
way you play, Butajiri.

204
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,375
Risho!

205
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,333
This deceit has
gone too far.

206
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,500
Don't you see we'll make a
mockery of their sacrifices.

207
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Gama willfully gave his
life so that we could win.

208
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,541
Not cheat our way out!

209
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Spare me your
romantic drivel, Touya.

210
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,083
He fought for the light.
Now we're going to enjoy it.

211
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,625
But honor.

212
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,666
Nonsense!

213
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,541
We must always keep our
eye on the final goal, Touya.

214
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,583
That's why I am the leader.
And you are the grunt.

215
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,791
And now, as for you Koto,

216
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,041
do you really think it's wise

217
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,791
to be on the human's
side in this stadium?

218
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,791
Keep the resistance,

219
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,625
and I have a feeling you won't
be officiating much longer.

220
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
What? But this is my show!

221
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,458
You know you seem really anxious
to intimidate everyone but me.

222
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,750
What do you think that means?

223
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,041
Come on.

224
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,458
Detective.

225
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,416
Don't waste your time
trying to change their minds.

226
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,125
Fight by their
meaningless rules

227
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
and you'll be
pulled down with them.

228
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,333
There's only one real
law of the Dark Tournament.

229
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,791
The strongest man prevails!

230
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,458
I've retrieved enough
energy to rip my way out.

231
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,500
Let's show this entire stadium
a new definition for victory.

232
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,541
[YUSUKE] They're gonna
kill us anyway,

233
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,125
so we take on every
freak 'til no one's left.

234
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,625
That sounds good to me.
I'm already about to go off.

235
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,041
I can't hold him off any longer.

236
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,125
The enchantress chords
holding my power--

237
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,958
His energy's tearing
them apart...

238
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,291
A couple more minutes
like this and there

239
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,083
won't be any of them left!

240
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,708
Uh, I don't want to sound
like a traitor or anything,

241
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,791
but maybe we
should cheer for Hiei.

242
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,916
Uh-huh.

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,125
That a way Hiei!

244
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,416
Don't stop now!
Keep your energy exploding!

245
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,625
Tear those evil chords apart!!

246
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,875
I'll assume
you're saying that

247
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,875
because you want
him to escape, sir.

248
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,666
Look at it this way.

249
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,708
If demons did have toilets,

250
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,541
would you really
want to sit on them?

251
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
That's a very
good point.

252
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,708
Hey.

253
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,583
What's up, Shizuru?
You sense something?

254
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
Go in the stadium
and find Botan for me.

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Bring her right back here
with you as quick as you can.

256
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,708
Just tell her I
said it's important.

257
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,083
Sure!

258
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,000
Before I start blabbering,
your name is Yukina, right?

259
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,041
Yes, I'm sorry, do I know you?

260
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,791
Not yet, but I've got a brother
who won't shut up about you.

261
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,708
So then, are you
Kuzuma's older sister?

262
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,666
Yeah, nice to meet you.

263
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,333
I absolutely hate to
see such a good competitor

264
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,750
go out of the games

265
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,416
without the chance to
inflict pain on someone! But...

266
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,125
Due to Yusuke's ineligibility,

267
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,625
and as there are
no other members

268
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,375
on his team available to fight,

269
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,750
and as Team Masho
still a has a competitor.

270
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,125
By forfeit, the
winner of the round is--!!!

271
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,958
[KUWABARA]
Wait right there!

272
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,208
We still got one
more fighter on our team.

273
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,166
What the hell's he means?

274
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,375
Where? Where is he?
Where's the other fighter?

275
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,083
Who could he be
talking about sir?

276
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,166
Where? Where'd he go?
Where is he? Is he over here?

277
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,458
[KOENMA THINKS] What's running
through that brain, Kuwabara?

278
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,916
You better not
be talking about me.

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,541
Would you shut up!!!

280
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's go!!

281
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,625
You're kidding me.

282
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,666
The boy can't even walk
without doubling over!

283
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,833
As the team trainer I must
say this is a ridiculous idea!

284
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,166
Interesting.

285
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,416
Pointless.

286
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,625
Well at least it's not me.

287
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,000
Now that that's established,

288
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,583
what the heck
is Kuwabara thinking?

289
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,416
[BLUE OGRE]
Koenma sir!!

290
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,166
Now Botan is
running off somewhere!!

291
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,916
[KOENMA] Ogre! Who gives a
hissy-fit about her right now!!

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Let's just keep our cool and
watch Kuwabara get massacred.

293
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,000
I can handle this you guys!

294
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,791
Remember, that lady
from the medical tent

295
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,583
took Hiei and the Masked Fighter
off, and said I was okay!

296
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,541
[YUSUKE] Stupid! Cause
she's not a nurse!!

297
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,416
Don't confuse the issue!

298
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,625
The point here is that
I'm still eligible to fight!

299
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,041
And I'm the only one!

300
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,750
Yes. But eligible and
able are two different words.

301
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,500
You shut up, shrimp!

302
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,750
See you're in no shape!

303
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,541
I'm going Urameshi! Unless
you want to kill me yourself!

304
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,791
I know these
guys are cheating us.

305
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,916
I know you're angry, and heck,
I know what happens if we lose.

306
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,708
But if you and Hiei
go on some tirade

307
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,625
destroying people
'till you get your way,

308
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,458
you'll be just like them.

309
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,375
Let's win this
thing clean. Like...

310
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,583
Like men.

311
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,208
How touching.

312
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,708
Bite my ankles, shorty!

313
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
I swear I'll make
you cry to your mom!

314
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,375
If you have a
mom that is.

315
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,166
[KURAMA THINKS] To think they
could one day be in-laws.

316
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,791
[KEIKO]
Hey! Over here!

317
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,916
[BOTAN] I hope this
is important!

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,166
I was in the middle
of a great speech!

319
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,625
Botan?

320
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,250
[BOTAN]
Oh, Yukina!!

321
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,875
Nice to see you!

322
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,291
[BOTAN] All the way from
the Ice World, huh?

323
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,750
That's one doozy of boat ride!

324
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,375
Can I assume you came
here to cheer on Kuwabara?

325
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,583
Yes, and Yusuke
too of course.

326
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,125
I still feel so grateful
to them for helping me.

327
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,166
I've been studying
in healing powers too--

328
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,833
I hoped I could
help them some.

329
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,833
Why, aren't you
the sweetest thing!!

330
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,833
But, there is
another reason I came.

331
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,708
Oh? Well
spill the beans!

332
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,375
The truth is I--
Have an older brother.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
[BOTAN THINKS] Oh dear!

334
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,500
She didn't find out about
Hiei already, did she?? 

335
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,041
[YUKINA] But I don't
know who he is.

336
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,125
All I know is that he's
a skilled martial artist.

337
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,041
I thought that
this tournament

338
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,250
would be the best chance
I had of finding him,

339
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,125
and so I've been allowed
to stay in the human world

340
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,250
for a while to look.

341
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,791
Is that right?

342
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,041
Well I'm sure we're all more
than happy to help you search.

343
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,541
Isn't that right Botan?

344
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,416
[BOTAN THINKS] Oh! I thought
Shizuru knew from the video!

345
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,916
Don't worry.
Just play along.

346
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,291
[KEIKO] It can't be that hard.
Do you have any clues?

347
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,875
Maybe a picture
of him or a letter?

348
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,500
No, nothing at all.

349
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,750
But, I have this strong feeling
that he's very close to me now.

350
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
[BOTAN THINKS] Alright, so
the only people who know

351
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,000
are Shizuru and me.

352
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,625
Oh and Koenma and Kurama.

353
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,083
Oh and Yusuke.
And Hiei obviously.

354
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,333
That's a lot of people-- But
Keiko deserves to know, right?

355
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,791
[HIEI] You talk, you die.

356
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,375
[BOTAN THINKS] It doesn't help
that I'm a blabbermouth

357
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,875
and he's a telepath!

358
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,291
Oh, no! It's Kuzuma!

359
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,416
He's not in the ring is he?

360
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,916
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

361
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,708
A crummy ruling's put
Yusuke out of the picture

362
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,041
and Kuwabara's gone in
so we wouldn't forfeit!

363
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,291
Now it's just Risho and
him and he's all injured

364
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,916
and I don't know
how he's gonna survive!

365
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,125
I can barely see!

366
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,208
Is there anything we
can do to get closer?

367
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,000
Excuse me, boys.

368
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,875
Back off! We were here first!

369
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,750
Step aside, or I'll turn
your balls into jelly.

370
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
[KOTO]
What fantastic will!

371
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,583
The visibly hammered fighter
has limped into the ring,

372
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,166
preventing his
team's elimination!

373
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,625
But can this haggard boy

374
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,625
possibly hope to compete
against Team Masho's leader?

375
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,458
We men go down with honor!

376
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,083
Fighters, please
report to the center!

377
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,041
Right.

378
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,625
It's dismal,

379
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,666
but at least it will buy us
time to consider our options.

380
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,500
He's killing himself!

381
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,958
Well, now here's the type
of fight I don't mind

382
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,250
keeping my hands out of.

383
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,125
[KUWABARA THINKS] It's not often
a guy gets a chance like this.

384
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,625
Maybe they'll name
a city block after me.

385
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,666
Your heroics
are quite misplaced.

386
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,583
All you'll win is a grave.

387
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,333
Just keep talkin', cheater!

388
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,666
I'll just make
it more tough on you!

389
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,833
Final fight and for the win!
Kuwabara versus Risho! Begin!

390
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,791
[NARRATOR] The fate of the
team lies in the hands

391
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,625
of the hopelessly
injured Kuwabara.

392
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,250
Will Yusuke and the
others be able to watch,

393
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,666
as their chance for
survival dwindles away?

394
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,291
[KUWABARA] Okay, so maybe
I've got a lot on my hands,

395
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,250
and not much
strength in my spine.

396
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,833
But there's more than just
my teammates counting on me,

397
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,333
and I'll be darned

398
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,250
if we're gonna endanger
them all by losing,

399
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,166
while I just sit on the side!

400
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,125
There's decisions that kids
make and decisions for men,

401
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,541
and somewhere down in me

402
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,708
I'll find the reason
to draw that line.

403
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:14,041
So when Risho unveils
his super big powers,

404
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,125
I'm gonna be right
there to take it.

405
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,291
It's the next
big Yu Yu Hakusho,

406
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,208
and missing it just
wouldn't be right.
