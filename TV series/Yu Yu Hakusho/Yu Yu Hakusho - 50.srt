00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,250
I don't know who you are,
but you're no old man.

157
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,375
And in case you
haven't noticed,

158
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,666
I'm not the
kind of person

159
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,458
who will underestimate
you based on false age.

160
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,041
You've got a pretty
sharp eye there,

161
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,083
for such an ugly,
worn past-its-prime body.

162
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,583
You're the first to notice.
I even masked my own Energy.

163
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,166
You see, disguise is
one of my favorite hobbies.

164
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,708
To be brutally honest,

165
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,541
there are few things I find
more repulsive than old people.

166
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
That moth-ball smell
that hovers around them

167
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,583
makes me absolutely retch.

168
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,041
That's why I chose this getup.

169
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,291
I thought wearing the skin
of something I abhorred

170
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,625
would all the more fuel my rage.

171
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,666
Now...

172
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,583
Fallaces sunt rerum species

173
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,541
tamquam alter idem
flamma fumo est!

174
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,458
[Onji laughs wickedly and it
transitions to another voice]

175
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,291
Thank goodness! Free at last!

176
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,041
A few more minutes
smothered under that mask,

177
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,125
and I might've
got real wrinkles!

178
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,958
I plan to die while
I'm still handsome,

179
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,875
before I show any
signs of aging.

180
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,541
It's the price
artists have to pay.

181
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,458
A harsh fate to accept.

182
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,208
My image is my
greatest masterpiece,

183
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,625
and that is how I plan to live
on as a legend eternitus!

184
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,166
I'm relying on all of you,
the fans, that witness my art

185
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,291
to recount it throughout the
generations and keep me alive!

186
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,375
Ladies and gentlemen,
feast your eyes on

187
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,458
the master of a thousand
faces and tricks,

188
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,750
the one, the only, the
Beautiful Suzuki!

189
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,583
Of course I'd hate to
ruin a piece of art, Suzuki,

190
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,958
but I have no
holdups with you.

191
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,416
You're a piece
of trash.

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,458
Never refer to
me by my name alone

193
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,125
without placing
"beautiful" in front of it,

194
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,208
or you won't live to
repeat your mistake.

195
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,416
"Beautiful" is a word
made just for me

196
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
and we two shall never part!

197
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,041
Fruitcake!

198
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,333
This idiot makes
Kuwabara seem smart.

199
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,166
I admit, I'm embarrassed
listening to him.

200
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,166
[KOENMA] If he's not the Joker,
I don't know who is.

201
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,541
Can you tell me if I
will find true love?

202
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,041
Well, the decrepit Onji
has transformed into Suzuki.

203
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,083
With an odd, better
make that interesting

204
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,541
wardrobe selection on his part.

205
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,000
That was freakin' sweet!

206
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,625
I've already told you to put a
"beautiful" in front of my name.

207
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,500
It's very important.

208
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,208
Why I like the way this
cracked walnut thinks!

209
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,500
But he's nuts, sir.

210
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,166
Oh, who's to say
who's nuts these days?

211
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,875
From now on, you will
only address me as

212
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,958
"Pretty" Koenma,
understand!

213
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,458
I think "pretty" really brings
out the sparkle in my eyes.

214
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,958
And I just finished
telling mother

215
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,000
my job couldn't
get worse.

216
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,333
For somebody who wants
to be known by the world,

217
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,500
you sure hide behind
a lot of masks.

218
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,291
You must be compensating
for something abysmal.

219
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,500
The greatest legends are
all shrouded in ambiguity.

220
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,833
It seems the imagination is
more captivated by the unknown.

221
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,458
People are simply more inclined
to build up in their own minds

222
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,916
that which they cannot see,

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,125
or which have
multiple incarnations.

224
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,708
[SUZUKI] Look at how they fear
the Devil and revere God.

225
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,250
With mystery comes
colossal power!

226
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,875
And that power
will be mine.

227
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,833
In a thousand years
they'll worship me,

228
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,333
and each will have a unique
vision and they'll say,

229
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,666
"The Beautiful Suzuki,
he looked like this!"

230
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,166
And another will say,

231
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,666
"No, he looked like this!"
"No, like this!" "Like this!"

232
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,125
And each vision will be]
grander than the last

233
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,333
and I will live in forever!

234
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't get
what's so funny.

235
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,000
I thought clowns made
everybody else laugh.

236
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,291
[SUZUKI] Let it be sung
throughout the land

237
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,500
that upon my victory
at this tournament,

238
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,833
I'll first eradicate the
elderly from the world,

239
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,291
in honor of the
soon-to-be-late Genkai.

240
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,583
And then, I shall strike down
all who refuse to worship me,

241
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,541
the Beautiful Suzuki!

242
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:59,083
And that will be that.

243
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,875
Go back to the circus!

244
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,708
Obey this, asshole!

245
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,416
I'm not a fan
of insubordination.

246
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,125
This wacko's serious
about this domination stuff.

247
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,791
This sucks. Now we can't
root for either of 'em.

248
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,583
For once they're
showing taste.

249
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,458
[SUZUKI] I guess I
fired 'em up!

250
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
So, um, you think
you might be ready?

251
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,333
Yes, let's shut
this jerk up!

252
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,750
Right! Let the battle begin!

253
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,125
You're feeling so confident

254
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,333
because you managed
to defeat my front man.

255
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,500
But while I did teach him
everything that he knew,

256
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,416
I didn't teach
him everything that I do.

257
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,125
Don't even think
of using that same

258
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
energy-borrowing stunt on me.

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,208
For that to work, you have to
lock onto its exact wavelength,

260
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,083
and as you're no
doubt discovering,

261
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,833
I can disguise
that as well.

262
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,083
You're frustrated!

263
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,791
You can sense how I
have so much energy,

264
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,416
but you can't hone in on it!

265
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,000
Marvel at my art as
I unleash my palette!

266
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,833
I call this one Rainbow Cyclone!

267
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,583
Ha!

268
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,208
[Suzuki laughs insanely]

269
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,250
Oh Genkai!

270
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,250
It seems Suzuki,

271
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,916
I mean it seems the
Beautiful Suzuki

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,708
has blasted Genkai with his
gorgeous Rainbow Cyclone.

273
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,375
And he didn't just
knock her to the wall.

274
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,958
He knocked her right
smack through it!

275
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,166
[Suzuki laughs]

276
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
[SUZUKI] It's truly a
spectacular attack.

277
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,083
Not only is it lethal,
but it's killer to look at!

278
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,833
All those vibrant colors
are so lovely, aren't they?

279
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,458
Though I'm sure
Genkai didn't think so

280
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,875
as they plunged
through her heart

281
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,250
and blasted her
into that wall!

282
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,000
You! What are
you waiting for?

283
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,916
Oh, right, out of the ring.
I'll start the count.

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,916
One...

285
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,083
[SUZUKI] What a
tragedy it's over.

286
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,750
I had nine hundred
ninety-nine more faces

287
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,500
and nine hundred ninety-nine
more tricks I wanted to use!

288
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,791
[JURI]
Five...

289
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,416
Genkai's emerged from
the rubble unharmed.

290
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,583
There's not even a scar or a
deep bloody gash on this woman!

291
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,458
Not that that makes
the Beautiful Suzuki's

292
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
beautiful attack
any less beautiful.

293
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,083
Forgive me if
I'm not impressed.

294
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,291
I know, you play
by higher standards,

295
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,125
but at least give
me credit for the nose.

296
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,166
If I'd had more time,
I would've taken that big,

297
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,041
ugly grin off your face too.

298
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,375
But when'd
you do that?

299
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,083
Naturally my eyes could follow
every inch of Genkai's movement.

300
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,208
I saw the
whole thing too.

301
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,958
Kuwabara!

302
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,916
And only five hundred
seconds too late to matter.

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,458
[KUWABARA] Hey, where's
that guy I was fighting?

304
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,625
I wasn't done yet!

305
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,916
So which is
more humiliating,

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,416
losing to an old
man or to a clown?

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,916
A clown, definitely
worse to a clown!

308
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,166
Hey!

309
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,541
You lost a nose.
Who cares?

310
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,083
I've ripped off vital
organs that were real!

311
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,166
But I feel so
naked without it!

312
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,125
[GENKAI] Stop your
whining, you joker.

313
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
I put my whole body through
hell to make it strong

314
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,458
enough for my Spirit Wave Orb.

315
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,416
And you're crying about
some nasal accessory.

316
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
You're not a real fighter.

317
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,375
I sure as hell won't waste what
little Spirit Energy I have left

318
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,958
on your half-assed routine.

319
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,416
Why, it won't take more than
these two bare, wrinkled fists

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,666
to knock that
sissy make-up

321
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,708
right off your face
and onto the concrete,

322
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,375
right next to
your rubber nose.

323
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,416
So come on, kiddo.

324
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,250
No matter what you throw,
I promise not to use any weapon

325
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,208
other than my own muscles
to pound the beauty out of you.

326
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm not scared of an old lady.

327
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,458
If you're not using your Spirit
Power then neither will I!

328
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,916
Toguro's got nothing on me!

329
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,166
Welcome to the Body of
Steel Muscle Explosion!

330
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,666
Will you just look at these
magnificent washboard abs?

331
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,458
Watch me now as I
rhythmically flex my pecs!

332
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,916
Featherweight.

333
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,416
Let me tell you what
your problem is, Suzuki.

334
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,583
You didn't say
"Beautiful" before my name?

335
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,166
Admittedly you
have talent.

336
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,250
You helped scrounge up a
team of third-rate demons

337
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,041
and found weapons
suiting them well enough

338
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,666
to get them to
the semifinals.

339
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,000
You know more about
arsenals and techniques

340
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,708
than anyone I've met.

341
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,583
But like a true idiot you
forgot all about your strength.

342
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,833
[GENKAI] You're
nothing but surface.

343
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,583
A souped-up car without
an engine to move it.

344
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,166
You're even weaker
than your front man.

345
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,625
Wow! She's amazing!

346
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,208
And the fact that
he's substandard

347
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,750
doesn't help him much.

348
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,250
You see?

349
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,291
[GENKAI] You just don't
have what it takes!

350
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,416
That's enough.

351
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,333
Oh, I forgot to look at that
so called beautiful face of his.

352
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,500
You okay?

353
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,416
It seems Beautiful Suzuki,
who has a remarkably firm tush,

354
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,583
is pretty much incapacitated,
making Genkai the winner!

355
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,250
Genkai's great!

356
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,000
She is cool.

357
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,375
[FAN] Don't look now,
it's the humans.

358
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,250
Can you believe we
made it to the finals?

359
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,125
You guys were all super!

360
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,541
I got a kick out of
watching you fight, Kazuma.

361
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,333
Why, thank you Yukina.

362
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,750
It's nice to see someone
appreciates my strategy.

363
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,958
See there was no one worth
wasting my energy on,

364
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,125
so I had the bad guys
reveal their weaknesses

365
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,416
so Genkai could knock 'em down.

366
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,041
More like you made a big mess
and Genkai cleaned up after you,

367
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,583
like someone always does.

368
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,125
Hey, that stung!
You take that back, sis!

369
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,375
Just the truth, bro.

370
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,416
Well no one cares!

371
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,250
Actually, I'd like to hear it.

372
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,791
Stay out of this, shorty!

373
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,333
Now children,
behave!

374
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,875
[GENKAI]
I'm leaving.

375
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,250
[KURAMA] It took all
of us working as a team

376
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,291
to make it this far.

377
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,625
[HIEI] Not him!

378
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,166
[KUWABARA] I fought just
as many fights as you did!

379
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,375
[HIEI] And lost them both.

380
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,125
[KUWABARA] Oh yeah?
Well you weren't the one

381
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,541
who had to go spinning
through outer space...

382
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,208
[TOGURO 2] Greetings old friend.
I have to talk to you soon.

383
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,375
I know you do.

384
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,250
[NARRATOR] With
Yusuke still recovering,

385
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,625
his team has advanced to the
Dark Tournament's final round.

386
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,458
But what can Toguro and
Genkai have to discuss?

387
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,916
And will the team be prepared
for their final challenge?

388
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,916
[YUSUKE] Last round,
here we come!

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,166
Pretty sweet, right!

390
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,875
And once the other, very
quick semi-final's over,

391
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,166
we'll know which team
we're gonna fight,

392
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,333
Team Toguro or Team...
Yeah right.

393
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,375
Anyway, you're not
watching for the outcome.

394
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,583
You're watching to see
the sickly powerful things

395
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,791
those bad guys
can do to people.

396
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,208
Oh, I see I'm not the only
captain playing hooky from--

397
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,291
Hey wait! What the hell are
those two talking about?

398
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,416
I leave my teacher and
rival for one minute

399
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,625
and well you better watch.

400
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,125
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
