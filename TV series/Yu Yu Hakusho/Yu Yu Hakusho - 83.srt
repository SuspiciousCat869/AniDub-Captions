Pardon my ignorance but
what's Three-Seven mean?

64
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,708
It's a test of your
spatial reasoning,

00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,875
mathematical prowess,
and hand dexterity, it's fun.

00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,500
Various combinations
of the numbers

67
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,708
from zero to seven drop and
you must arrange them

68
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,083
so that the sum of three numbers
vertically or horizontally

69
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,000
is equal to seven,
eliminating those blocks.

70
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,666
You can also get rid
of blocks by,

71
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,416
as the title suggests,

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,833
lining up three
sevens in a row.

The object of the game

is to clear as many
blocks as possible,

75
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,458
which becomes
increasingly difficult

76

as they fall at
faster speeds.

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,875
If the blocks fill up all the
way to the top, you lose.

00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,416
[YUSUKE] You can go ahead
and call me a dimwit, but...

157
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,250
Let me just ask
the stupid questions.

158
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,833
If Kurama's got this all
figured out, why'd he tell the

159
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,000
Game Master instead of
keeping it to himself?

160
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,958
And why'd he wait 'til it was
too late to stop the round?

161
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,041
Sensui had a
strategic reason

162
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,291
for not telling Amanuma
he would die in real life

163
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,333
if he died in the game.

164
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,125
Young people are stupid
about life and death.

165
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,625
They think
they're invincible,

166
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,833
too young to die,

167
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,375
so they're not consumed
with the fear of it.

168
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,416
That's why armies
recruit teenagers.

169
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
That's why Koenma
recruited you.

170
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,208
Hey I resent that...

171
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,833
I know I can die 'cause
I've done it once

172
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,916
and lived to tell about it!

173
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,333
[GENKAI] I don't
have time to show

174
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,041
how you've proved
my point.

175
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,125
Sensui didn't want
the boy thinking

176
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,875
of the possibility of death...

177
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,958
...however he counts on
us to figure it out

178
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,458
and think of nothing else.

179
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,166
It fits into Sensui's pattern.
Testing our moral limits.

180
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,375
Seeing if we will
justify the kill.

181
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,000
[YUSUKE]
Well we won't, will we?

182
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,833
[GENKAI] Kurama has. That's why
he told the boy the truth.

183
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,000
To make him weak.

184
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,583
It's a dirty trick but
Kurama knows what he must do.

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,625
[YUSUKE THINKS] Is that true?

186
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,416
[GAME MASTER THINKS] Mr. Sensui
doesn't care if I die...

187
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,208
No! He's the only one
that does care about me!

188
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,041
Way to go kid. You're doing
quite well with that game.

189
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,291
You want to play with me?

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,958
Sure I guess, but I'll
warn you I'm real good!

191
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,000
We'll see about that.

192
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,875
You were great back
there Mr. Sensui!

193
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,958
You're way cooler
than other grown-ups.

194
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,291
You gotta show me how you
did that thing in level six!

195
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,916
Sure, but wouldn't you rather
play with kids your age?

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,708
Well, they're all dummies

197
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,541
who'd rather play
sports than video games.

198
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
And then between work
and yelling at each other

199
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,666
my parents are always
too busy to play with me.

200
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,708
You know Amanuma, there are
games more fun than arcades.

201
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,208
Come on, what could ever be
more fun than Goblin City?

202
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,750
I'll show you...

203
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,541
...after we've come to know
each other a bit more.

204
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,375
Can't you give me
one small hint?

205
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,791
Let's just say it
takes interactive gaming

206
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,458
to the next dimension.

207
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,625
[GAME MASTER] You'll really
make all this go away?

208
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,416
[SENSUI] Yes. But I can't
do it without your power.

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,458
[GAME MASTER] Look, I may
be good at video games,

210
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,166
but I don't know
about any power.

211
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,208
[SENSUI] It'll be awakened soon.

212
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,708
You have the gift to
become a great psychic

213
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,833
and I think
when you do,

214
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,458
you should help
me rid this world

215
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,000
of all those stupid people who
infest it like the plague

216
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,666
like your teachers and your
classmates and your parents.

217
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,333
You do want to make
them pay, don't you?

218
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,333
For the way they've
treated you?

219
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,875
[SENSUI] You have
nothing to worry about.

220
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,625
I'll protect you.

[GAME MASTER THINKS]
He said he'd keep me safe.

222
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,541
I have to trust him.

223
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,833
But what if he was just lying
like every other grown-up?

224
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,958
They all lie, why should he
be different? But he is!

225
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,625
He's fun and he cares
about what I have to say!

226
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,708
Unless that was just
all an act and...

227
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,583
Man he just missed a
pretty easy Three-Seven!

Suichi's under his skin.

229

[GAME MASTER THINKS]
Okay, focus. Just focus.

230
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,416
Three plus two plus
what equals seven?

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,166
Three plus two plus what?

232
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,708
Plus what? What?

233
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,250
What?!!

234
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,666
What game would you most like
to create in your Territory?

235
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,250
That's right I got you the game
cartridge for Goblin City!

236
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,041
You can play that when
Urameshi gets here.

237
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,833
Nobody can beat you at
Goblin City, except maybe me!

238
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,916
Nobody can beat you at
Goblin City, except maybe me!

239
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,041
I'm not up on this
game's strategy

240
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,291
but that's the
opposite of it, right?

241
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,416
Yeah that's bad.

I can do to get outta this?

Anything?

246
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,541
Is there not a way to
shut down this Territory

247

and void your power?

248

No I've tried that!

249
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,833
It's impossible

You left so urgently

What happened in

Wait!

What signal and
what should I do?

If there's an earthquake
in two hours

359

that means that the
Kekkai has been broken
