00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,625
[NARRATOR]
For six months,

2
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,791
Hiei has trained in the
dungeon of Mukuro's stronghold

3
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,958
under the eye of
the tyrannical ruler,

4
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,291
one of the three vying
for power over Demon World.

5
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,000
Now that Hiei has
become strong enough

6
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,000
to slay the A-Class Demons,

7
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,458
Mukuro called forth
a tougher foe.

8
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,000
Shigure, the infamous
surgeon of Demon World:

9
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,750
The very surgeon that implanted
Hiei with his Jagan Eye.

10
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,875
Can Hiei survive?

11
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,583
Does he even want to?

12
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,625
[SHIGURE]
I agreed to perform the surgery

13
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,708
on the condition that
he would never reveal

14
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,375
his true identity to anyone.

15
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,708
[MUKURO]
Yes?

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,416
[SHIGURE] But I'm willing
to nullify our contract,

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,750
if you defeat me.

18
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,041
I thought I had made
myself perfectly clear.

19
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,791
I have no intention of
revealing myself to anyone.

20
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,250
Intentions can be changed, Hiei.

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,916
[MUKURO] Enough. We must get
back to the matter at hand.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,375
The fates of your very lives
are now hanging in the balance.

23
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,375
[MUKURO]
It's the beauty of battle.

24
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,250
One man's fragility juxtaposed

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,583
against another
man's strength...

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:02,000
Now is the time to
determine which man you'll be.

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,416
[MUKURO]
Proceed!

28
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,083
[HIEI]
I must strike quickly.

29
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,125
If I do not, my chances
of survival are grim.

30
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,041
[MUKURO]
Judging by their weapons,

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,791
Shigure is sure to
have the upper hand.

32
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,541
[HIEI] Yet, I am
fighting without purpose,

33
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,166
falling back into a life
of meaningless killing,

34
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,666
a life of dishonor
and cowardice.

35
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,583
[HIEI] There is no more dignity
in this sort of existence.

36
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,083
So I must find honor in death.

37
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,666
Rui...

38
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,666
I know that you
and Hina are close friends

39
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,583
and this is difficult for you,

40
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,750
but you must do this
for her own good,

41
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,416
and yours, and ours.

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,000
This Imiko--this boy of fire--
will slaughter us all.

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,375
I can't.

44
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,250
Do not pity the beast.

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,583
You killed my son! No!

46
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,000
[RUI]
When you come back,

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,666
seeking the revenge
that you and we deserve,

48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,250
please kill me first.

49
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,833
It's the least I can offer to
atone for what I am about to do.

50
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,333
[HINA]
My baby!

51
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,041
[HIEI] My mother's tribe
called me Hiei the Imiko,

52
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,208
the cursed child
of the Glacial Village.

53
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,041
[BANDIT LEADER] Back to the
campsite to count our spoils!

54
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,708
[BANDIT A]
Hey boss... look!

55
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,708
Huh?

56
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,250
Since when has
your dirty laundry

57
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,041
been any concern of mine?

58
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,208
It ain't no laundry,
boss, it's a baby.

59
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,875
He was floatin' in the river.

60
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,375
Imbecile!

61
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,625
What do you expect me to do
with him, change his diaper?

62
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,208
Nah, look a little
bit closer, boss.

63
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,500
Hey, what you
holdin' there, fella?

64
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,791
[BANDIT LEADER grunting]
Give it to me, you little twerp!

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,125
[yells]

66
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,041
Sharp teeth there,
you little rodent.

67
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,166
[HIEI] That bandit was
to become the closest thing

68
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,208
I had to a father.

69
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,958
[DEMON A]
Come on, Hiei!

70
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,708
[DEMON B]
Yeah, hand over the necklace!

71
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,041
[HIEI] Even as a child,
I found tremendous pleasure

72
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,416
in spilling my enemies' blood.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,541
Their screams of agony
were my music box.

74
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,000
Once I realized my
mother's frozen teardrop

75
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,791
was highly valuable,

76
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,500
I would purposely wear it
in clear sight of everyone,

77
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,833
hoping their greed would
entice them to challenge me,

78
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,125
thus giving me opportunity
to take another life.

79
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,750
I suppose I wanted to prove
that my mother's people

80
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,791
were right to abandon me.

81
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,125
[HIEI] For years,
I spent every waking moment

82
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,500
looking for my next kill.

83
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,625
I started to wonder
if finding my mother

84
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,291
and the glacial village
mattered at all.

85
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,416
[HIEI] It wasn't long
before my former life

86
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,416
started to become a faint shadow

87
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,333
on the outskirts
of my consciousness.

88
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,875
[BANDITS chatting, laughing]

89
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,458
It's Hiei!

90
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,416
[HIEI] The bandits, whom I had
come to look upon as family,

91
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,750
soon grew weary of
my murderous habits,

92
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,875
and once again,
I found myself shunned.

93
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,083
[HIEI]
In my solitude,

94
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,250
I found myself gazing into
my mother's stone for hours,

95
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,958
finding that I would be taken
over by a strange calm,

96
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,250
and the desire to
find the home of my birth

97
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,000
began to churn up
inside me again.

98
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,625
[HIEI] As I set out to
find the Glacial Village,

99
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,416
I was faced with new opponents,

100
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,208
each one trying
to take away my stone.

101
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,458
[HIEI] Eventually,
one of them succeeded.

102
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,416
[choked yelling]

103
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,333
[HIEI] I hadn't realized
until that moment

104
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,625
how important it was to me,

105
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,625
and I knew I had
to do whatever it took

106
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:32,166
to find not only my mother's
village, but her stone.

107
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,708
[HIEI]
I'm looking for Shigure.

108
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,000
I was told he could
give me a Jagan implant.

109
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,916
[HIEI]
Did you hear what I said?

110
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,708
A scrawny little
groundling like you

111
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,750
isn't cut out for
that kind of suffering.

112
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,125
Now... run along.

113
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,000
[yelling]

114
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,875
I'm sure that I can handle it.

115
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,166
[SHIGURE] All right, you've
proved your tolerance for pain,

116
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,916
but there's one more condition.

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,833
I will only
agree to operate on those

118
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,291
who have lived a life
that holds my interest.

119
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not about
to waste my talents

120
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,791
on some insufferable child,

121
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,500
so you had better have
a decent story to tell.

122
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,041
So let's hear it.

123
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,291
You may regret this
after I'm finished.

124
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,250
In fact just thinking about it
makes me sick to my stomach.

125
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,208
[SHIGURE] Are you sure you
want to go through with this?

126
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,500
[HIEI screaming]

127
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,500
[HIEI] I have never before
or since experienced

128
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,583
the level of flesh-searing pain

129
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,500
that was inflicted
on me that day.

130
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,166
And what do you
call that monstrosity?

131
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,041
It's called the
Phosphorous-Ring Sword,

132
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,791
made from the bones
of the wild oxen

133
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,791
that roam through the
forests of Demon World.

134
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,416
[SHIGURE]
What are you doing?

135
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,291
[HIEI]
I have what I came for,

136
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,041
and now I'm leaving.

137
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,541
[SHIGURE chuckles]

138
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,791
[SHIGURE] The Jagan
operation has drained you

139
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,208
of almost all your energy.

140
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,291
If you attempt to
brave the woods now,

141
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,500
you will most
certainly be killed.

142
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,333
[HIEI]
That's not your concern.

143
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,625
Stay. I'll show you how
to use that sword of yours.

144
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,458
Why should I?

145
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,375
If I had just had
a Jagan implanted,

146
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,458
I would want to survive
long enough to use it.

147
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,708
[HIEI] I'm not sure
why I decided to stay.

148
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,916
I suppose deep down
I knew he was right.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,666
A night alone in those woods
would have been the end of me,

150
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,875
and at the very least I could
steal his fighting technique.

151
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,500
I never thought
our paths would meet again.

152
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,375
[HIEI]
And still, it seems fitting

153
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,875
that I should
die by his sword.

154
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,333
[HIEI groaning]

155
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,333
A noble end.

156
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,750
[MUKURO]
Exquisite!

157
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,833
[SHIGURE]
Incredible!

158
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,958
He's going to
sacrifice his own arm!

159
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,208
[HIEI gasps]

160
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:57,000
[yelling]

161
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,916
[SHIGURE]
I've got you!

162
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,916
[SHIGURE]
A noble end.

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,791
[HIEI grunting]

164
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,541
[HIEI]
Simultaneous death--

165
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,791
The highest honor one
fighter can give another.

166
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,750
[MUKURO]
Hiei.

167
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,333
I shall congratulate
you with a great prize.

168
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,833
The prize you
have searched for.

169
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,833
[MUKURO]
It was given to me years ago,

170
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,500
another tribute from
a land I conquered.

171
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,875
Now the tear is
finally where it should be,

172
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,750
with the child
for whom it was shed.

173
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,750
You've more than earned it.

174
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,083
The only thing that I've
earned in this life is death,

175
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,291
and I gladly welcome it now.

176
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:30,333
Hiei... there is no need
to rush to your death.

177
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,291
Death will find us
all soon enough, trust me.

178
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,333
Now tell me the rest.

179
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,291
[HIEI]
Once I had fully recovered,

180
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,833
I immediately resumed my
search for the Glacial Village.

181
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,875
And with the
assistance of the Jagan,

182
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,625
I found it in
a matter of days...

183
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,000
[HIEI] The home of my birth,
and my banishment.

184
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,708
[HIEI]
I had been away for so long...

185
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,833
I had all but forgotten
what it looked like.

186
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,541
[gasping]

187
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,958
[HIEI] My mother's people
were a gloomy, timid race.

188
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,333
It seemed as if ice was
pumping through their veins

189
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,000
instead of blood,

190
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,500
like their spirits
had been frozen.

191
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,083
And they were incapable of love.

192
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,833
My impulse to kill faded.

193
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,916
They were already dead.

194
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,541
[ELDER WOMAN]
Rui, you must look after things

195
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,000
while I am gone.

196
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,083
[RUI]
Yes, Elder.

197
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,125
I won't let you down, I promise.

198
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,750
[ELDER WOMAN]
I shall return on the solstice.

199
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,750
[RUI]
Have a safe journey.

200
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
[HIEI]
Rui...

201
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,875
The ice apparition that
threw me into the great forests

202
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,541
of the Demon World.

203
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,083
[thud]

204
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,125
[HIEI] Don't be afraid...
I won't hurt you.

205
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,958
I'm looking for a woman
I used to know named Hina.

206
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,333
[HIEI] Rui led me to a tomb, and
told me that Hina, my mother,

207
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,375
had committed suicide years
after one of her children

208
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,416
had been exiled.

209
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,708
Hina also had a younger
daughter that she named Yukina,

210
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,708
and she was the most gentle,
beautiful baby

211
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,458
that any of us in the
Glacial Village had ever seen.

212
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,291
A few years ago,
she suddenly disappeared,

213
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,333
without so much as a word.

214
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,708
And none of us has
ever heard from her since.

215
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,750
[gasps]

216
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,041
[gasps]

217
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
[RUI]
Wait a minute!

218
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,750
Hina was your mother,
wasn't she?

219
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,541
You're the one, aren't you?

220
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,791
I'm so sorry for
what I've done to you.

221
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,583
[crying]

222
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,375
[HIEI]
After learning about Yukina,

223
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,166
a new search began.

224
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,750
I knew I would never be able
to rest until I found her.

225
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,458
[HIEI] I sensed that she was
somewhere in Living World.

226
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
[HIEI]
Once there, I became acquainted

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,708
with a Demon named Kurama
who had taken human form.

228
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,291
[HIEI]
Together with Kurama and Gouki,

229
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,500
I stole one of the
Artifacts of Darkness

230
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,916
belonging to Spirit World.

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,833
[YUSUKE]
Couldn't help but notice

232
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,250
there's no rain falling here.

233
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,000
[HIEI] That's how I first
became involved

234
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,416
with the Spirit Detective.

235
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,541
After that,
things began to change.

236
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,791
[SEIRYU]
Now you end!

237
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,250
[SEIRYU roars]

238
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,708
[HIEI] Tarukane's compound is
where I finally found my sister.

239
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,708
In truth, I had
seen her once before,

240
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,916
but had been too
afraid to get close.

241
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,666
Not surprisingly, she had
no idea who I was.

242
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,333
And as far as I
could control it,

243
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,041
I intended to
keep it that way,

244
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,083
just as long as I could watch
her, and know she was safe.

245
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:43,958
[HIEI]
Dragon of the Darkness Flame!

246
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,708
[HIEI] In time, I grew weary
of fighting for Living World.

247
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,541
Then a messenger
was sent inviting me

248
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,583
to come back home to fight.

249
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,708
A new shot at a purpose.

250
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,041
[YUKINA] If you happen to come
across someone in Demon World

251
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,333
who carries a stone like mine,

252
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,625
would you please
give this to him?

253
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,500
[HIEI] It wasn't the
stone that I had spent

254
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,000
so much time looking for,

255
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,500
but as I looked at Yukina, I
realized that it didn't matter.

256
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,083
My life's purpose had now
been fulfilled by her gift,

257
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,583
and I knew that anything
else that lay ahead of me

258
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,291
would be empty.

259
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,708
[yelling]

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,333
[yelling]

261
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,666
[yelling]

262
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,083
[HIEI] There was nothing
left for me to do

263
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,166
but end my journey.

264
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,000
[MUKURO]
Yes, Hiei, now I see.

265
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,000
Out of all the
fighters I've trained,

266
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,375
you've been the only one
to submit your consciousness

267
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,916
to mine so fully...

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,333
And it feels the most like home.

269
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,833
[MUKURO] The stones
you carry are mysterious.

270
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,750
I feel the power they exude
could purge me of the hatred

271
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,916
that has led me
to horrible crimes.

272
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,125
In fact,
I know the one I carried

273
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,625
saved me from being consumed.

274
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,166
I was born into slavery,
and in that time

275
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,916
I was robbed of many things,
including my spirit.

276
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,833
And it was replaced
with a bitter gall

277
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,583
that has destroyed
everything around me.

278
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,166
Without that stone, my heart
would have withered away,

279
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,791
leaving a dark
and unfillable void.

280
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,291
I understand now why you were
so desperate to get it back.

281
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
Now as I promised...

282
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,000
Here I stand,
hiding nothing from you.

283
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,666
Gaze upon me.

284
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,750
I will show you this
and so much more.

285
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,208
[MUKURO]
Now live.

286
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,041
You are not yet ready
to search for death.

287
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:35,291
Hiei... your place
remains here with me.

288
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,166
Touch my consciousness.

289
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,250
And you will not be empty.

290
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,708
[NARRATOR] A new alliance,
forged in common pain.

291
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:49,041
In time, Hiei will become
Mukuro's greatest warrior.

292
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,833
[KURAMA]
And now, my journey begins.

293
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,791
As Yusuke and Hiei have been
forced to confront their demons,

294
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,333
so, too, will I...

295
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,375
In the fortress of Lord Yomi,
third ruler of Demon World,

296
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,791
and my former ally in crime,

297
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,791
hospitality is only a front:

298
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,416
cruel plots lie in wait, and
traps are ready to spring.

299
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,583
The sins of my past
must be confronted,

300
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,833
as one thousand years
of fates and ambitions

301
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,333
between Yomi and myself collide.

302
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,958
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho.
