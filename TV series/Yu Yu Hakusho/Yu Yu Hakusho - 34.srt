00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,833
Team captains, please
decide the terms for battle.

159
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,583
Isn't this mysterious.

160
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,583
Both of our teams
are missing two members.

161
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,666
What do you say... we fight
with the people we have.

162
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
Winner is the best of three.

163
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,666
What about you?

164
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,125
Don't the ugly pointy-eared
trolls like to fight, too?

165
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,208
Only when we have to, boy.
I prefer the managing position.

166
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,125
Never any reason to do the work

167
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,541
when you can watch
somebody else do it for you.

168
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,666
Hence the guinea pigs.

169
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,041
So it's true.

170
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,958

capable of producing

is far greater than
that of an apparition?

173
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,208
A fierce monster of power
locked within you all!

174
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,125
It's only the human conscience

175
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,166
that will keep
this power at bay.

176
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,541
Take away free will and
the monster will say hello.

177
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,041
How 'bout "ass-kicking"?
Do they say that too?

178
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,500
Every genius has his critics.

Mock me all you want!

It'll be a different story when
you're the one I'm controlling!

[DR. ICHIGAKI]
Let's make this interesting.

188
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,666
Your power fascinates me.

189
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,625
If my team wins I
get to use your body.

190

[YUSUKE] Why not?

191
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,458
And if my team wins we
get to rip off your face.

192
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,333
Yes, I can live with that.

And the blind fall

effortlessly into my trap.

195

Without Kurama or Hiei here,

my chance at victory

197

is calculated at
exactly 98 percent!

198

[MASKED FIGHTER]
We have one more condition.

199
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,625
We combine the three matches
into a six-person battle royale.

200
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,458
One fight determines it all.

201
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,750
Perhaps.

202
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,791
Hold on little guy.

203
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,708
You mean all three of us

204

fighting their three in the
ring at the very same time?

205
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,000
[DR. ICHIGAKI THINKS]
That drops their chances

to just point-zero-five percent!

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,625
I will accept. Your masked

[Dr. Ichigaki laughs]

[DR. ICHIGAKI THINKS]
The unscientific mind

210

can be so amusing!

211

They themselves
ask for a situation

that yields me a 99.95
percentage of victory!

Yes. A hard bargain, I said.

The Spirit Detective's
body will soon belong to me!

Kill Urameshi! Team-up on him!

Tear off his fingers!

And shove 'em down his throat!

218

Damn. Well, at least the
fans are getting creative.

219
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,666
[KUWABARA THINKS] That masked
guy made a pretty good call.

220
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,791
With us all fighting together
we can watch each other's back,

221
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,416
especially while Yusuke

tries to get his
Spirit Gun workin' again.

223
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,291
But I still can't
figure out these fighters.

224
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,458
Ichigaki said they've
turned into monsters,

225
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,666
but something about
them still feels--

These three competitors.
I met them before.

[MASKED FIGHTER]
Their instructor, Mitamura,

229
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,250
was a famous martial artist.

230
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,958
He said training good character

231
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,083
was more important
than physical skill.

232
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,125
I was always struck by his
student's respect for life.

233
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,458
They would never kill,
no matter what.

234

That explains it.

The weird feeling
I'm getting from them--

236

it's like a
whisper in their guts.

They don't want
to be fighting here!

They're being forced to murder
while their minds just watch!

Pardon?

Do you think that there's
something wrong with Kuwabara?

It's difficult to explain.

There're some
very strong emotions

yourself. What's going on then?

Is it something
between him and Yusuke?

No, it's from the other team.

00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,208
So if we can't
sense all their energy,

315
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,666
how are we supposed to win?

316
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,208
[MASKED FIGHTER] Sorry. I
don't have all the answers.

317
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,916
[KOTO] Get ready
for more spills!

318
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,250
The Ichigaki Team is
poised for another round!

319
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,875
[YUSUKE THINKS] All right,
Spirit Gun!

320
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,500
You can come back
when ever you're ready!

321
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,500
What the hell?

322
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,125
And that was using
my left arm, Kurama.

323
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,708
I'm sorry,
I used my right.

324
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,416
Next time I'll
use my left to be fair.

325
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,583
Would you like to try us next?

326
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,125
Thanks, but I'd rather not.
Death gives me the shivers.

327
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,083
Gatasubal is what
we like to call him.

328
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,166
One of the doctor's
earlier projects.

329
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,291
Part demon, mostly machine, no
feelings. No pain and no fear!

330
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,291
Go Gatasubal!
Destroy those two low-lives.

331
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,291
[HIEI THINKS] Not a scratch!

332
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,750
Gatasubal's whole body

333
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,375
is covered with a special
formula of hybridized metal.

334
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,583
Combining the hardest steel
with actual living cells--

335
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:08,208
No substance in the
whole world can break it!

336
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,208
Maybe I can't kill the beast.

337
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,958
But at least I
can still kill you!

338
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,916
[Hiei cries out]

339
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,291
Hiei!

340
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,291
[M-5 laughs insanely]

341
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,416
[M-5] See the genius
of the doctor's work!

342
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,083
It has no feelings
or thoughts to distract!

343
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,416
It thinks only of the kill!

344
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,916
I can appreciate that.

345
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,000
Hiei! Don't!

346
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,416
Kurama!

347
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,666
[M-5 laughs insanely]

348
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,500
[M-5] Excellent Gatasubal!
Now kill the other one, too!

349
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,333
[M-5] What's wrong with
you! I said kill!

350
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,416
[KURAMA] You were
wrong on two counts.

351
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm wrong? What do you mean?
What just happened?

352
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,833
Even the hardest
substance can be broken.

353
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
When crashed into itself.

354
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,833
And the ability to feel
pain is not a weakness.

355
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,500
It's a strength. Pain tells
a creature its vulnerabilities.

356
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,750
And not to expose
them to attack.

357
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,208
Your robot is dead...

358
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,875
[KURAMA] And so,
I'm afraid, are you.

359
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,125
Okay!

360
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,208
Forget this!
I can't watch this way!

361
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,416
Wait! Botan!

362
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,833
[YUSUKE THINKS] I'm so
tired of falling on my ass!

363
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,416
There's got to be
something I can do here!

364
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,666
Excellent. Like always.

365
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,833
[NARRATOR] In a fight
where their odds of victory

366
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,541
are calculated at
point-zero-five percent,

367
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:47,125
what can Yusuke's team possibly
do to escape with their lives?

368
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,375
[BOTAN] Hello everyone,
Botan again.

369
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,208
Don't expect the
odds to improve much,

370
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,166
when the
fight against the

371
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,291
mind-controlled humans rolls on!

372
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,583
As if the teamwork

373
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,875
of the three blank-faced
fighters wasn't enough,

374
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,500
Kuwabara suddenly
refuses to fight!

375
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,791
Sensing the inner torment
of these transformed men

376
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,833
and overcome with sympathy,

377
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,000
he instead makes
a desperate plea

378
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,916
for their humanity to arise!

379
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,208
And while Kuwabara
pays for this risk,

380
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,625
an unloosed cloth

381
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,000
gives a first glimpse at
the fighter behind the mask!

382
