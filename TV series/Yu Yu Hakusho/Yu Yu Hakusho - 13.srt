00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,875
[NARRATOR] Spirit Detective
Yusuke Urameshi

2
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,000
has gone undercover
in the Genkai Tournment,

3
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,875
to stop the
evil demon Rando

4
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,666
from stealing
Genkai's psychic powers.

5
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,541
After discovering
his true target

6
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,958
has been fighting in disguise

7
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,416
as the young Shorin,

8
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,416
Yusuke went to great pains
to put Shorin on the ground.

9
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,125
It seemed he'd
solved the case.

10
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,583
But now Rando has dropped his
disguise and shown his true,

11
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,125
monstrous form.

12
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,958
The final fight begins.

13
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,916
So that's Rando.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,958
[KUWABARA]
Urameshi.

15
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you ready to fight yet?

16
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,916
'Cause I'm ready
as soon as you are.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,833
Even when losing consciousness
that boy has a one-track mind.

18
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,458
[BOTAN THINKS] Be brave, Yusuke.
At least for Kuwabara's sake.

19
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,833
This is always the hardest part.

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,166
Choosing what
technique to use first.

21
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,291
[RANDO] Like a drooling
boy in a candy store.

22
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,000
Perhaps you can give
me a good suggestion.

23
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,000
Shut your mouth.

24
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,791
And here's the kill!

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,875
So there.

26
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, crap.

27
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,541
This battle isn't
going to last very long

28
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,833
if only half of you
can still throw a punch.

29
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,125
[YUSUKE]
What?

30
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,291
Those punches had
absolutely no Spirit Power.

31
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,166
You've gone dry.

32
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,833
[KOENMA]
What is Yusuke thinking?

33
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,541
Without the strength of Spirit
Energy behind his attacks,

34
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,458
He couldn't
hurt the ghost of a fly,

35
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,500
let alone an expert
human-hunter like Rando.

36
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,583
The only problem, of course,

37
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,541
is a serious
shortage in his supply.

38
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,375
And a very high demand.

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,791
Alright, I've just thought of
the perfect technique for you.

40
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
Well, how pretty.

41
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,166
What, is it?

42
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
That is life-force thread.

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,083
An archaic form of
materialized spirit energy,

44
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,958
no doubt taken from
a very ancient psychic.

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,458
Damn it!

46
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,416
That's no good.

47
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,458
I can't move.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,583
[RANDO] Needless to say, I could
crush you in an instant,

49
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,083
but I'd rather
test my techniques.

50
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,333
It's been such a long time.

51
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,458
This thread is
connected to my own energy,

52
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,875
and no human
efforts can sever it.

53
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,833
Yeah, I noticed.

54
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,500
[YUSUKE] Seems kind
of boring that way.

55
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,666
Yes, I shall have to
add more excitement.

56
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,541
[Rando laughs]

57
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,291
[RANDO]
How's this? Better?!

58
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,208
[Yusuke cries out]

59
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,500
Is this boring you?

60
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,541
Or is this?

61
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,833
What about this?

62
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,750
Or this one?

63
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,375
Or this? Or this? Or this or
this or this or this or this?

64
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,791
[Rando laughs]

65
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Tell me how it feels human!
I'm dying to know!

66
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,625
Goodness,

67
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,416
Yusuke truly can't keep up
this beating much longer.

68
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,708
Genkai, you
have to do something!

69
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,208
Rando's only going
to come after you next!

70
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,375
I won't.

71
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,708
Whoever wins this
fight is the one I teach,

72
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,333
and it would be wrong to
interfere with the selection.

73
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,250
I'm getting old now.

74
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
My powers have to
be carried forward,

75
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,000
even if they
must stay for a while

76
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,041
in the hands of the wicked.

77
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:54,916
[BOTAN]
Listen to yourself!

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,333
If Rando gets your techniques

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,583
there's no telling how
many people he'll kill with it!

80
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,250
Innocent lives that you
will be responsible for!

81
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,833
There are things
you do not understand.

82
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,416
[BOTAN]
Like what?

83
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,958
Progress is what must prevail.
It's a story I cannot change.

84
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,500
No, you're wrong.

85
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,833
There, you see?

86
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,500
It's amazing how indestructible
these threads are.

87
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,791
[Rando laughs]

88
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,500
So how do you feel?

89
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,083
[YUSUKE]
Why do you keep asking?

90
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm hanging upside down from a
tree! Take a guess! You freak!

91
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:48,125
Ooh, hostile.
We're not there yet.

92
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:56,625
(Chanting)

93
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,666
Why do I get the feeling he's
not just doing that to be cute?

94
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,291
Hey, what's cooking?

95
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,666
What the hell are those?

96
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,833
[RANDO] I brought them from
the depths of Spirit World.

97
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,791
They're called Hate Fish.

98
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,375
Hate fish?

99
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,083
And through another technique
I've created a Trainer Demon.

100
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,583
They're controllable
and very fierce.

101
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,250
Watch!

102
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,416
As you can see
they're very hungry.

103
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
And the demon
could defend himself.

104
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,416
Imagine if he had been tied up.

105
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,916
[RANDO]
But enough about that.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,291
I want to try a move I
learned much more recently.

107
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,833
The Spirit Gun!

108
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
How can he--?

109
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,000
That's it! That's the look!

110
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,333
You have surrendered
to your fear.

111
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,041
That move,
he must have learned it

112
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,333
simply by watching
Yusuke perform it just once.

113
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,625
It was also several
times more deadly.

114
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,375
[GENKAI] This creature's
adaptability

115
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,875
and knowledge of the
human spirit is incredible.

116
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,666
[BOTAN]
It's awful.

117
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,083
[GENKAI] If he
does learn my power,

118
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,541
he will no doubt take it
further than I could ever go.

119
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,916
The fear-screaming
from a victim's eyes.

120
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,208
[RANDO] Increased
power is wonderful,

121
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,125
but it's the fear
that makes me hunt.

122
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,083
You have shown me that fear.

123
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,750
Now die.

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,333
Yusuke!!

125
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,458
[YUSUKE]
Yusuke Urameshi. Age 14.

126
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,625
Survived by his
mom and everybody.

127
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,958
After going through a big ordeal
to get back his life back,

128
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,958
Yusuke had a brief second chance
until he was eaten by a fish.

129
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,208
That's right! No heroic death!

130
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,125
No fighting evil
villains. Fish food.

131
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,916
This is dumb!!

132
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,875
Yes, eat all you want
my precious Hate Fish.

133
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,291
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Hate Fish...

134
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,500
What a stupid name.

135
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,375
It can't be...

136
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,458
You fool! At least
pull him from the water!

137
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,166
Whose is that?

138
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,125
A soul?

139
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,333
[YUSUKE THINKS] Okay.
Here we go again.

140
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,833
[KUWABARA] Urameshi!
Hey, I'm talking to you!!

141
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,416
[YUSUKE]
Kuwabara??

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,583
So are you giving up already?

143
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,541
Oh man, you are
a freakin' disgrace!

144
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,166
I can't believe
I've spent so much time

145
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,166
trying to defeat such a coward!

146
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,875
Now get up there and fight!

147
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,875
I can't even move!!

148
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,375
Lame excuse!

149
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,375
You're only stuck because
you can't see your own energy!

150
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,875
You're an idiot!

151
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,875
Hey, watch it.

152
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,666
Go ahead and die with
your tail between your legs.

153
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,500
Maybe they'll make
me Spirit Detective

154
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,000
because I'm not such a wuss!

155
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,791
[Kuwabara laughs]

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,958
No way!

157
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,916
[YUSUKE]
Dumb Kuwabara!

158
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,208
[YUSUKE]
This is my job!

159
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,291
[blast]

160
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
That's Yusuke's energy!

161
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,250
All he needed
was a good insult.

162
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,041
So much Spirit Power couldn't
have come from that boy.

163
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,083
His crippled friend
must have transferred

164
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,000
the last of his energy to him.

165
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,083
Oh well, it matters not.

166
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,916
Just more time to practice
my favorite techniques.

167
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Though... I still love
the idea of killing

168
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,708
you with your own attack.

169
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,000
Now...  come out!

170
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,875
Yusuke... you will
have to breathe soon.

171
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,958
[YUSUKE] Funny thing
about swamps.

172
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,666
They're just always
connected to another one!

173
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,250
Don't talk Yusuke!
Just shoot him!

174
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,083
And as for my
Spirit Gun technique.

175
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,250
You're doing it all wrong!

176
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,833
Does he have enough strength?

177
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,125
Oh?!

178
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,708
You hold too much back.

179
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,958
[YUSUKE]
Spirit Gun!

180
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,666
Sure you can
use it more than once.

181
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,333
But you lose the
good old stopping power.

182
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,500
Good shot!!!

183
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,041
Do you still
think I'm a fool

184
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,375
for not taking him
out of the fight?

185
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,250
[YUSUKE] Please be dead.
I don't have anything left.

186
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,541
Ten cheers for our
Detective extraordinaire!

187
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,458
-Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
-One! Two! Three! Four!

188
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,125
What's that?

189
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,708
Where? What's what?

190
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,583
[YUSUKE]
Give me a break.

191
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,208
[RANDO]
You have caused me pain.

192
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,958
I do not like that.

193
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,083
Well, this boy's attack
injured me more than I thought.

194
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,208
I barely have the
energy to destroy him.

195
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,625
Even though it looks like
I can't move right now,

196
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
I'm very dangerous.

197
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,833
There's no point in
either of us bluffing now.

198
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,791
Both our bodies are exhausted,
and our spirits are weak.

199
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,916
But I'll still succeed.

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,958
Because I can reduce your body
and crush your puny bones

201
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,041
like I did with
your ridiculous friend.

202
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,250
[YUSUKE THINKS]
He must've gotten me good.

203
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,916
I can't even tell
if he's talking.

204
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,458
We've already
suffered with Kuwabara.

205
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,541
I can't bare to watch it again.

206
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,583
(Chanting)

207
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,541
Reduction!!

208
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,291
[Rando chuckles]

209
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,875
Soon the world will be
a much bigger place for you.

210
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,750
And you will be afraid.

211
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,250
I will make certain of that,

212
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,333
even if it means ripping
apart your fingers one by one.

213
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,375
It's not right...

214
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,208
[RANDO] How have I been
the one to shrink?

215
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,875
You're the slave
of your own technique.

216
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,458
Yes but how?

217
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,958
It is physical law that
the imbalance of matter

218
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,500
created by that
technique must be relieved.

219
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,708
If there's no victim,
then the user goes boom.

220
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:32,083
Are you blind?!
That boy was cleary my victim!

221
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,500
[GENKAI] Yes. But his
body must know that.

222
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,708
As with any spoken chant,

223
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,791
the victim is affected
only by hearing it.

224
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,791
In this way it enters the brain
and reprograms the cells.

225
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,875
All a reasonably
intelligent fighter has to do,

226
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,416
is cover his ears.

227
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
But if I didn't know
it then how could he?

228
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,208
Are you okay?

229
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,541
Why is everything
so freaking quiet?

230
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,083
[YUSUKE] Swamp algae
in my ears, gross.

231
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,458
Swamp algae?

232
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,458
You know the mechanics
of your stolen techniques.

233
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,583
But without training you'll
never know how to use them.

234
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,166
Shut up hag! All I have
to do is reverse the chant--

235
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,291
[Yusuke laughs]

236
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,541
Come on now. You really
think I'm gonna let you do that?

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,875
Even at that size I don't
have the energy to punch you.

238
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,333
But I guess at this point
we can let gravity take over.

239
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:45,250
And that, boys and girls,
is my Super Elbow Drop.

wait until tomorrow

Well done, Yusuke.

247

In addition to defeating
a notorious crook

248
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,833
and earning some
training for yourself,

249
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,875
you have also shown
that I was completely correct

250
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,875
in choosing you as Spirit
Detective, because I am perfect.

253
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,416
Remember how you said
not to bother you

254
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,958
while you watched the fight?

255
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,750
Well it's caused a
little bit of a back-up.

256
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,833
Oh, have mercy.

257
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,708
[BOTAN] I should take
Rando back to Spirit World

Oh darn, I was really hoping
I could keep him as a pet.

260
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,208
You should take Kuwabara.

Now that I've
finished working on him.

[GENKAI] No dim-wit,

make a complete recovery.

Whoa, that Spirit Wave
technique sounds pretty cool.

[GENKAI]
I'm glad you approve,

267
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,791
since you'll be training for the
next six months to learn it.

Nah! I'll have to get
back to you on that old lady!

What? You still remember?

272

Well of course! You think all
this was community service!

273
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,500
Sorry Yusuke, but
you're not allowed to go.

The entire purpose
of that tournament

275
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,708
was to choose my student.

276

Do you really think
after all that mess

277
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,958
that I'd let you have
a choice about it?

278
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,666
But my ticket.

Yes you'll need to have
