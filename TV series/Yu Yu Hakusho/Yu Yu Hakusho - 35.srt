Therein lies the

They don't have to listen
to me or anyone else!

[YUSUKE THINKS] It's just like
an energy bomb in his hand!

[YUSUKE THINKS] You know,
it's a hell of a lot easier

But, I don't understand.

00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,791
How can a person's
ability to sense energy

333
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,083
attacks increase
midway through a fight?

This isn't in my calculations!

No worries, let me just
refigure the equation here.

Fifty-two point
seven two five percent?

338

[KURAMA] Percentages
are for poker, fool.

339

You can factor strengths
and stamina doctor--

I'll give you that.

341

Lucky for you guys I'm pretty
good at avoiding my feelings.

Otherwise I'd be getting
sick on myself right now
