157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,750
And as for you.

158
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,416
Uh... why are you
staring at me like that?

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Beautiful lady...
will you be my wife?

160
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,958
I'm a strong and fearless man
and I'll be good to you.

161
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,625
Are you boys happy
with disqualification?

162
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,166
If so, stay where you are.

163
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,000
So he's Koenma's boy.

164
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,375
I didn't know I was
attracting celebrities.

165
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,708
You may begin! Fight well!

166
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,250
[fight sounds]

167
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,291
[GENKAI] Winner: Shorin!

168
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
[SHORIN]
Just, barely escaped.

169
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,875
KOENMA]
That boy is too modest.

170
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,666
Sure he lacks
fighting experience,

171
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,625
but he still had
a decent advantage

172
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,291
in two out of three categories.

173
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,416
[GENKAI] On to the third match!
Kuwabara versus Musashi!

174
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,000
Try not to get
killed, Kuwabara!

175
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,791
Don't worry, I have
to beat you before I die!

176
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,208
Don't you think
he's a bit mismatched?

177
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,916
Well he's never
been as tough as me,

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,666
but he does have
a lot of determination.

179
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,833
I just hope that's
enough to win.

180
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,666
I'll give you one last
chance to walk away, kid.

181
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,833
After that I'll have to consider
you an obstacle in my path

182
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,916
and I won't hesitate
to cut you down.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,375
[KUWABARA] I'm not
going anywhere, old man.

184
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,791
I may be a kid,

185
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,125
but I've been fighting
on the streets my whole life.

186
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,541
Plus, I've got powers.

187
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,875
In fact I can see
you right--huh?

188
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,916
Wait a minute.
At least I saw you.

189
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,833
Before.

190
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,208
What happened?

191
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,666
It's a trick!

192
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,416
Where are you?

193
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,333
I know all about
your Spirit Awareness, kid.

194
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,083
[MUSASHI] But I too have a
power. I can mask my own energy.

195
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,125
So I can't see you.

196
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,375
And unlike you, I'm used
to fighting in the dark.

197
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,125
[KUWABARA]
You!!

198
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,250
[fighting sounds]

199
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,291
Be careful Kuwabara!

200
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,083
Stop yelling so much!
It makes you easy to find!

201
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,250
[KUWABARA]
Will you guys shut up!

202
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,875
I'm trying to concentrate,
and you're not really helping!

203
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,250
There isn't any use.

204
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,250
In the dark I can
strike you a hundred times

205
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,666
and you'll never
be able to block.

206
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,083
Beat me up all you want old man,

207
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,291
your sissy little punches
don't hurt me at all.

208
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,333
It's just crummy chump change
compared to all the days

209
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,875
Urameshi rubbed my
head into the concrete.

210
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,041
It's true, I've
punched him quite a few times.

211
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,833
Then you leave
me no choice.

212
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,291
A big stick?

213
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,166
[MUSASHI] Now is no
time to play the fool, kid.

214
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,500
This is a wooden sword

215
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,250
carved from an ancient tree
and cleansed in a sacred stream.

216
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,291
It's a conduit
for Spirit Energy.

217
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,125
The perfect weapon
for striking down evil!

218
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey! I'm not evil!

219
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,333
[MUSASHI]
Shibattou Shining Sword!

220
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,250
He actually broke the sword!

221
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,958
[MUSASHI] His Spirit Power
must truly be strong.

222
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,958
You haven't
gotten rid of me yet!

223
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,333
What kind of
evil creature are you?

224
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:18,708
No one has ever survived my
Shining Sword Attack. Oh well.

225
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,458
I'm confident you won't
live through a second strike.

226
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,333
[KUWABARA THINKS] I gotta
find a way to defend myself!

227
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,333
Why couldn't he
crack off a longer piece!

228
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,208
What is that?

229
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,125
I--I don't know!

230
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,375
[MUSASHI]
What are you?

231
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Materialization.

232
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,375
What the hell's that?

233
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,375
[GENKAI] Normally, Spirit
Energy cycles through the body

234
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,250
and is very hard to control.

235
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,666
But when his
life was endangered,

236
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,083
he instinctively used
his high Spirit Awareness

237
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,666
to manipulate his
energy into a solid object.

238
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,291
In this case, into a sword.

239
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:24,750
[Kuwabara breathes heavily]

240
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,333
[KUWABARA]
Pretty cool.

241
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,125
But how am I
supposed to turn it off?

242
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,291
[GENKAI THINKS]
I suspected this would happen.

243
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,750
Guess he just needed that wooden
sword's focusing power

244
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
to give him an extra push.

245
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,583
[GENKAI] Winner: Kuwabara!

246
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,250
I guess Kuwabara won't be so
easy to beat from now on, huh?

247
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,458
Well at least he's still ugly.

248
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,083
You better not
lose before our fight.

249
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,625
[YUSUKE] Please. Like I'd miss
a chance to beat you up.

250
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,250
Let's not waste my time.

251
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,916
The fourth match is
Kibano vs. Dim-wit.

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,041
I think that's you.

253
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,625
And I thought my
name was Yusuke.

254
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,083
May the strongest man win.

255
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,000
[KUWABARA] What are
you waiting for Urameshi?

256
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,166
[KIBANO] Have
you decided not to fight?

257
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,583
Oh no. I was just
praying for your mortal soul.

258
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,875
[BOTAN] Yusuke!
Stop clowning around!

259
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,708
Moron!

260
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,041
Hey!

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,375
[GENKAI] Any more delay
and I'll take it as a forfeit!

262
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,375
Gee! Something tells me

263
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,583
you're still mad about
that grandma comment...

264
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,333
You really need to
enjoy life more, old lady.

265
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,708
[YUSUKE] Yup.
It's dark, all right.

266
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,166
But at least the
other guy is in the same boat.

267
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,666
[KIBANO]
You're wrong about that.

268
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,083
I can see exactly where you are.

269
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,291
Give me a break.

270
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,833
You're Awareness
isn't any better than mine.

271
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,375
Only weirdoes like
Kuwabara can see in the dark.

272
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,708
[KIBANO]
You stepped backward.

273
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,458
Fine. Good guess.

274
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,333
[KUWABARA] Watch out for him!

275
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,166
He's got some sort
of mask on his head!

276
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,125
My own invention,
it blinds my sensory organs.

277
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,208
All the brainpower normally
concentrated on sight, sound,

278
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:39,333
and smell is redirected
to sensing a person's spirit.

279
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,958
I've even installed
a targeting device

280
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,916
to direct my
senses to a single point.

281
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,583
Now let's see.

282
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,416
Yes, you have
a very unusual aura.

283
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,791
As if your body has
been through great danger.

284
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,125
Perfect, that'll
make you easier to find.

285
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,750
See? It's very useful.

286
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,500
[YUSUKE]
Okay, I heard that!

287
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,250
[YUSUKE]
Hey! Did I hit you?!

288
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,291
[KIBANO]
Sorry.

289
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,416
I've got you!

290
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,375
Yeah!

291
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,291
Don't celebrate
just yet.

292
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,583
[Kibano laughs]

293
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,500
What!!

294
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,333
[KIBANO] You found me
by my voice, no doubt.

295
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,458
But your hearing will
never be accurate enough

296
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,958
to give you a
decisive blow.

297
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
This punk's not playing fair.

298
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,000
That helmet is protecting
his head from attacks.

299
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,458
Even the best kind of armor
should have a weak point.

300
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,916
But I'm scared Yusuke is going
to have a tough time finding it.

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,250
He can't even see his
own hand in front of his face.

302
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,458
[BOTAN THINKS] Yusuke, how are
you getting out of this one?

303
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,458
Here's another technique.

304
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,458
Uh-oh.

305
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,625
[KUWABARA] Something weird's
happening to Kibano's muscles.

306
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,000
[BOTAN] What?

307
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,333
[GENKAI] It's a basic
enhancement technique.

308
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,958
He's pulling in Energy
from the matter around him.

309
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,125
It gives a quick
boost of strength.

310
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,000
Darn it, where is he?

311
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,083
I'm right here!!

312
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,791
[KIBANO]
Big Arm Bomber!!!

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,958
[NARRATOR] Will this be the
end of the fight for Yusuke?

314
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,958
Will we witness
his first defeat?

315
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,208
With Rando
lurking in the shadows,

316
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,958
we have to hope
the Spirit Detective

317
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,000
can continue his case.

318
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,708
But how will he fight,
when he can't even see?

319
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,791
[KOENMA] Yo, this is the
great Koenma speaking.

320
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,583
Yusuke's case
gets very desperate

321
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,708
when Kazemaru shows
he's an expert

322
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,083
at the deadly
Ninja Throwing Star.

323
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,000
Of course,
that's the semi-finals.

324
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,375
First he's got
to figure out a way

325
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,291
to stop the
energy-pumping Kibano

326
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,958
from flattening
his skull into a pancake.

327
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,041
How can Yusuke
fire his one-shot

328
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,625
Spirit Gun in absolute darkness

329
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,500
and actually hit the target?

330
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,375
I'm not sure,
but I hope he is.

331
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,208
Because Rando
is getting closer!

332
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,916
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!

333
