[TOGURO 1] Let me take
the rest of you at once.

159
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,166
If I lose, we'll
forfeit the match to you.

160
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,708
Fine, we'll take it!

161
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,291
You'll pay for your pride,
you sickly little creature!

162
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,791
Well now, this promises
to be an exciting end!

163
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,833
Toguro offers to face
the remaining three

164
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,250
in a winner-takes-all match!

165
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,875
[DEMON 1] The older
one's gonna fight!

166
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,416
[DEMON 2] Alone?
I thought he was

167
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,250
helpless without his brother!

168
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,666
Begin!

169
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,791
You know what to do!

170
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
Keep your heads and
use the strobing effect!

171
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,041
Our teamwork has never
been overpowered!

172
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,958
Here we go!

173
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,333
We all saw Team Gorenja

174
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,375
employing this move
earlier on in the tournament.

175
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,625
And it's nearly impossible
to defend against!

176
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
With the onslaught of
convincing false images,

177
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,125
twenty fighters seem
to be going at once!

178
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,916
The opponent doesn't
know who to hit!

179
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,166
Gorenja Batallion!

180
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,250
[Toguro 1 chuckles]

181
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,375
Unfortunately for you...

182
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,958
I'm well equipped for
fighting the larger groups.

183
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,416
[DEMON 3] Did you see that!

184
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,833
[DEMON 4]
I love these guys!

185
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,708
Well, both still
alive after all that.

186
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,833
You really did earn your
place in the semi finals.

187
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,625
As a reward for your
impressive endurance,

188
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,500
I promise to spare
one of your lives.

189
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,250
So which one of
you wants it more?

190
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,375
Don't be a fool.

191
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
You have no
choice but to kill us.

192
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,916
If not we'll get just stronger.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,083
Until one day we'll
kill you instead!

194
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,791
He's only speaking
for himself!

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,125
Spare my life, I'll
do anything that you ask!

196
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,250
[Toguro 1 chuckles]

197
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,416
The decision is made.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,083
In the demon world there
is no place for grovelers.

199
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,083
Bui and Karasu said
the same thing as you

200
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,291
when they challenged
us and were beaten down.

201
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,541
They were much prettier then.

202
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,708
[KARASU] Kill me now.
That's your only warning.

203
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm sorry,

204
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,375
but your time of death is no
longer your decision, Karasu.

205
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,541
You belong to
the Toguros now.

206
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,791
And until you can argue
you will do as we require.

207
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,333
Brother's come to quite
prefer people like you

208
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,750
to fight on our side now.

209
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,458
No loyalties to confuse.

210
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:38,000
Also, their desire to kill us
keeps them motivated to improve.

211
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,166
Brother would find
you perfect for us.

212
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,500
That's why I
swore to spare you.

213
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,083
[Toguro 1 cackles]

214
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,333
However brother's
not here at the moment,

215
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,541
and we have one most
important difference.

216
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,250
I always hate
keeping my promises.

217
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,625
[Toguro 1 laughs insanely]

218
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,125
We've both been
waiting for this.

219
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,875
[JURI] That's it
for the semi-finals!

220
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,000
Please join us two
days from now at noon!

221
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,541
[DEMON 5]
That fight was so short!

222
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,750
[PURPLE MOHAWK DEMON]
Yeah. I never know if

223
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,041
Team Toguro's good,
or the others just suck.

224
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,875
Hey--check it out.

225
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,958
[GREEN MOHAWK DEMON] How'd you
like the competition, Kurama?

226
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,625
Look at him!
It's a dead man walking!

227
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,083
[KURAMA THINKS]
I must find the secret

228
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,416
to causing that transformation.

229
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,875
[KARASU] You're the only
one who watched?

230
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,000
Your team must
be very confident.

231
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,708
Either that,
or in denial.

232
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,541
Yes. Accepting the
truth would be easier.

233
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,958
The finals will come and
the four of you will die.

234
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,625
Just four?

235
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,166
[KARASU] Yes of course.
One of you dies today.

236
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,708
[KURAMA THINKS] I only
let him go for a second,

237
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,625
and he's completely vanished.

238
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,583
I can't sense him at all.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,916
[KARASU] Your hair is a
bit damaged, Kurama.

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,333
Human bodies
are so frail.

241
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,791
I know you fear what
my touch could do to you.

242
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,625
And yet, maybe you
also want to know it.

243
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,666
[KURAMA] Get away!

244
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,541
[KARASU] No need to get
upset. It's just a game.

245
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,333
[KARASU] As a fighter,
I like you best, Kurama.

246
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,208
And when I like something,
I like to take it away.

247
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,083
It gives me a certain feeling,

248
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,708
like pondering
unanswerable questions.

249
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,833
You don't reach
the result you want,

250
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,625
and you're swept
with an empty despair,

251
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,708
that makes you feel alive.

252
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,000
[KARASU]
Save your fight for me, okay?

253
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,416
[KURAMA THINKS]
I cannot win this way.

254
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,875
You've gotten old. It's bizarre.

255
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,958
You haven't
changed a single bit.

256
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,666
[GENKAI] Fifty years
I lived in solitude.

257
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,500
Hoping I could
avoid this situation,

258
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,125
and never have
to see you again,

259
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,916
and do you realize
how close I was?

260
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,416
But in my twilight years

261
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,250
you have to get tangled
up with my apprentice,

262
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,666
and pull me along.

263
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,916
Why did you bring him here?

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,458
My association with
Yusuke is separate.

265
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,916
It just so happened that
you had to be involved-

266
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,041
though I confess seeing
you was a bonus to my plan.

267
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,333
[TOGURO 2] You used
to be so beautiful.

268
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,416
I remember. There are faces a
person looks at to feel at ease.

269
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,791
For a while you were mine.

270
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,708
So why did you put that mask on?

271
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,041
Did you not want me to see you

272
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,958
in your younger
appearance again?

273
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,875
Cut the sentimental crap!

274
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,875
I wore that mask

275
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,500
because I didn't
want to be stalked

276
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,416
by one of the hundreds of demons
who wants my head on their wall.

277
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,708
Due almost entirely
to your behavior.

278
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,583
And thank you so much for that.

279
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,666
You're considerably
weaker now.

280
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,583
You've given away
your orb, am I correct?

281
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,500
Yes, all my power
is with Yusuke now.

282
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,833
Well then, it's time
for us to end our chapter.

283
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,875
Hey, you're up
in time after all!

284
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,916
[KUWABARA] Uh, you okay
Urameshi? You have a nightmare?

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,833
Genkai, where did she go to?

286
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,125
Oh, I don't really know that.

287
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,333
She did say for you
not to follow her, though.

288
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,208
You idiot!

289
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,208
Hey, Urameshi!
Tell me what's going on!

290
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,625
[YUSUKE THINKS] Come on!

291
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,500
Eternal youth and power.

292
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,416
I see the committee did
a great job on your request.

293
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,291
A decision you
should have made too.

294
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,583
You could still have your youth.
It's most disturbing.

295
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,791
Looking at your face.
This hag you've become.

296
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,041
The man that I had
so much respect for

297
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,083
has lowered himself
to an ordinary thug.

298
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,291
You think I like seeing you?!

299
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,250
Honestly I can't stand it!

300
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,083
Fair enough.

301
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,916
That is precisely
why one of us has to go.

302
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,333
Goodbye, friend!

303
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,750
You sold your soul
for a crappy fantasy.

304
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,791
I should have killed
you when I had the chance!

305
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,583
[NARRATOR] Yusuke and Toguro's
teams have earned their spots

306
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,208
in the Dark
Tournament's final round.

307
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,500
But the first of its battles

308
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,416
will take place
outside the ring,

309
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,041
as former allies move
to settle a very old score.

310
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,041
[YUSUKE] Genkai, do you
realize what's going on?

311
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,666
She gave all her power to me,

312
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,916
when she knew Toguro was
gonna face her at the end.

This whole time
my stupid self

314
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,916
thought this was
all about me and him,

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,958
but there's a fifty
year story behind it,

316
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,875
and now she wants it closed.

317
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
Am I giving it a way?

318
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,500
Well I don't give a damn.

319
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,958
My teacher's walkin' into
a fight she can't win.

320
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,791
And nothin' is ever
gonna be the same.
