[burps]

161
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,458
Doesn't matter how many die.
Each team's allowed

162
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,625
only one alternate fighter...

163
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,000
Rokuyukai can fight
with Rinku and one alternate

164
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,291
if they find one.

165
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,958
You sure about that?

166
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,583
I am a walking rule book!

167
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,625
My entire life is this
Tournament! Of course I'm sure!

168
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,208
Yeah!!!

169
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,500
That means I can fight
these last two boys myself.

170
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,625
I think that's really ripper.

171
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,166
Thanks for everything, shela!

He looks like a clown,

174
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,541
but there's something
dangerous there.

175
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,208
Everyone must be worried.

176

[KOENMA]
I love squid.

177
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,625
His spirit power's
a lot less than Zeru's,

178
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,000
but for some reason
I got a creepy feeling.

179
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,708
Watch out, you guys.

180
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,583
What could you be worried about?
He's the alternate fighter.

181
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,250
And secondly, he's a lush.

182
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,791
I don't know.

183
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,750
[HIEI THINKS] The fool may be
right. Something is foul.

184
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,541
Even when he
killed his teammates,

185
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,541
I couldn't feel his strength.

186
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,291
I was hoping he'd show!

187
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,250
Now you'll see the true
engineer of the Rokuyukai Team!

188
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,625
Let's go, you sooks.

189
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,708
I wanna get a good brawl in
before my fun wears off!

190
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,291
In that case, they better
all fight me at once!

191
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,583
So, who's gonna take him?

192
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,708
It hasn't been very long

193
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,000
since all three of
us fought our matches.

194
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,916
Guess we could draw
straws or something.

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,958
Hurry up!!

196
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,125
Chu seems extremely
impatient!

197
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,666
What'd you say?

198
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,666
I only say it as I see it.

199
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,166
Don't go on confusing
me with big words!

200
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,500
Just get me a fighter!

201
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,375
Right!!

202
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,041
Pretty tail she's got, that one.

203
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,250
Think I might
fall in love with her.

204
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,125
Urameshi Team,
present your combatant!

205
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,750
Well we still have
that Masked Fighter guy.

206
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,791
Come on man,
it's your turn!

207
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,458
If you can't give me someone
I'll have to disqualify!

208
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,000
No no, hold on a second!

209
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,500
I guess I'll have to
take control of this fight!

210
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,333
Unless of course I can
get Urameshi to wake up!

211
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,791
That's weird, where'd he go?

212
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,375
Well that's unexpected.

213
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,708
Indeed.

214
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,875
Waking up from
the smell of alcohol...

215
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,666
can't help but feel
a touch of home.

through your clever
trash-talk long enough!

And I'm ready
to kick some asses!

Great way to make
friends, Yusuke!

It's perfect! Tell 'em, kid!!

you're ready to fight!

When I told him
of the tournament,

233
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,416
his powers were
far from impressive.

234

Let's see how three
months of training paid off.

235

Gee, that's intimidating.

236
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,958
Never heard so many voices
hate one person so much!

But can you really be surprised!

238
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,500
Yusuke's become something of
a boogeyman for the apparitions.

239
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,416
Yeah, I guess he has beaten

a bunch of their
bad-guy role models.

241

But I've been helping Urameshi!
Why didn't they scream kill me?

242
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,791
Perhaps because you lost!

243
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,666
Hey now! They didn't
know that before the fight!

[KURAMA THINKS] Yusuke,
you must be cautious.

245
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,500
[KURAMA THINKS] Hiei
would never admit it,

246
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,333
but attempting
the Darkness technique

247
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,583
is not something
he ever desired to do.

248
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,625
So my Jagan Eye
may not be natural.

249
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,333
But it does give me
exactly what I need!

250
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,708
[KURAMA THINKS] In truth,
he had no other choice.

251
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,125
[KURAMA THINKS] To defeat
Zeru's substantial power,

252
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,541
Hiei had to
unveil the technique.

253
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,250
And it has cost him dearly.

254
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,958
[HIEI] I assume just
my right arm will do.

[KURAMA THINKS] The Dragon
of the Darkness Flame

256
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,000
is not meant to be controlled.

257
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,750
He may never be able
to use that arm again.

258
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,166
[KURAMA THINKS] If this
Chu is the true team leader,

259
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,750
as I suspect he is,

260
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,083
then his powers must be
even greater than Zeru's.

261
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,666
[KURAMA THINKS]
Please Yusuke. Be wise.

262

Eww... Please,
don't call me that.

Um, okay, I just wanted
to set the record straight

before we get this thing going!

267

Right, basically it's
that I'm a really ace person,

is paper rock scissors!!!

What the hell is he saying?

00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,041
Uhh... Let me try to translate
for the drunkard here.

272
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Earlier this morning,

273

through paper rock scissors.

275
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,208
Chu lost pathetically
and became the alternate,

276
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,000
but he wants you
to forget all that,

277
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,000
because he is number one!!!

278
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,458
Yeah!!!

279
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,208
No need to thank me-
that's why I'm here!

280

Wow, she's a really
perceptive person, isn't she?

281
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,583
Oh no, Chu is gonna
start acting dopey again!

282
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,625
I can feel it!

283
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,958
I'm strong okay!

284
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,791
Do you even get what
I'm trying to yab to you?

285
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah stupid, I understand!

286
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,583
It's not too difficult you know!

287
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,041
You were scared
to fight me before,

288
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,083
and you're blaming
it on some dumb game!

289
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,833
Nah! That's not right!

290
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,416
Didn't you hear what
the foxy was saying?

291
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,041
Paper, rock, sissors.

292
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,333
[GREEN DEMON] Oh, come on!

a pathetic drunk!!

a pathetic drunk huh?

Take that back!
I am NOT a substitute!

298
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,583
I meant to do paper,

299

but my hands got
stuck on scissors.

300

Damn thing could
happen to any bloke.

301
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,500
Right then--now you figure
it all out perfectly, don't you?

302
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,500
Hey! That's my drink!

303
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,208
Come on! At least
let me stretch my muscles!

304
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,666
Nah... this is plenty great.

305
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,250
You don't think I can
fight either. Do ya'?

306
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,125
Well let me tell
you something mate...

307
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,791
I'm... I'm like a master
at drunken fighting.

308
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,625
Sui-ken technique, that's the
official name I think.

309
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,500
You get distracted
by my irregular moves.

310
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,791
Crap of craps
it's bright out here!

311

Listen to this
joker--he's insane!

312
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,833
Well I know from
school seminars

313
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
drunk driving kills people--

314
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583
Maybe drunk fighting's
kinda the same thing.

315
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,250
This is embarrassing.

316
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,625
Yeah wobbly, give me a break...

317
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,666
So the tipsy fighting
thing might be weird

318
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,291
but I've still
heard of it before.

319
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,625
You better have somethin else
to make this a real challenge.

320
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,041
I didn't come all this way
just to babysit a drunk.

321
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,333
Then wait a minute...
You won't yabber that

322
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:16,125
once I hit my groove. 'Course,
I got to stumble into it first.

323
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,500
Watch his movements.

324
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,333
I know. He's beginning.

325
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,666
[NARRATOR] One obstacle
stands in the way

326
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,458
of defeating
the Rokuyukai Team.

327
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,791
Can Yusuke overcome?

328
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,416
Or could Chu's growing power
and bizarre fighting style

329
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,583
permanently seal the
Spirit Detective's fate?

330
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,583
[BOTAN] Hello everyone.

331
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,458
The Dark Tournament
is truly gearing up,

332
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,416
when the battle against the
Rokuyukai and Urameshi Teams

333
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
jumps into its finale!

334
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't forget, we haven't
seen Yusuke in action since

335
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,708
his three months of training
with the psychic Genkai,

336
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,291
and I'm sure he'll need every
one of his learned lessons

337
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,583
to handle this
strange drunken threat.

338
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,375
Will Chu get a hangover? ?  I
leave that as a cliffhanger!

339
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,583
It's going to be a struggle only
the bravest can overcome,

340
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,291
when Yu Yu Hakusho continues.
