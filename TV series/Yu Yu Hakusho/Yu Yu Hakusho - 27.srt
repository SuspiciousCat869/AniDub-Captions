161
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,708
They're all gonna
gang up on him

162
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,708
and he's trapped
himself in a corner!

163
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,833
Patience.

164
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,291
Attack!!!

165
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,666
I get to keep his head!!!

166
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,166
Only if you get there first!

167
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,958
Holy crap!

168
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,500
He got everyone up
there with one blow!

169
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,791
I guess that explains why
Yusuke can sleep so peacefully

170
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,791
on a boat full of demons.

171
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,750
[KUWABARA THINKS] Whoever
that little guy is,

172
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,458
Yusuke must've
taught him the Shotgun!

173
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,666
I'm sorry to say
that the sixteenth team

174
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,458
will have to be a human one!

175
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,291
Yusuke Urameshi's team!

176
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,000
Good job little man!

177
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,708
So how bout you let us see
under those bandages now!

178
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,958
Hey! What's this?

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,541
You really think we care
about fighting by the rules!

180
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,541
There's only one way to find
the best team on this boat.

181
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,625
Wouldn't you know.

182
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
I think they stole my idea.

183
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,541
We'll have to make them
pay very dearly for that.

184
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,916
Of course.

185
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,791
Hey!

186
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,416
Now I'm mad!

187
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,625
What kind of wimp
do you take me for!

188
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,291
Rose Whip. Thorn-Wheel!

189
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,791
This kill will make me famous!

190
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,458
Urameshi!!

191
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,375
Now die!!

192
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,375
Come on! You can't
scare me, Grandma!

193
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,250
I'll knock you
back to your grave!

194
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,166
That's a relief.
He's finally awake.

195
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,375
[HIEI]
No, fool.

196
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,583
He's sleeping.

197
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,583
Right now?

198
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,750
Quit you stupid old lady!

199
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,958
Even in his slumber Yusuke
is reliving his training.

200
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,500
His preparations
should make us all jealous.

201
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,208
[KUWABARA THINKS] Hmm,
Urameshi said Grandma

202
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,750
in his sleep right there.

203
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:50,458
That's what he calls Genkai.
Hey! Maybe that guy's Genkai!

204
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,083
They are about the same size.

205
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,875
But she wouldn't fight unless
she had her own reasons.

206
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,541
What are you mumbling?

207
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,958
He's trying to talk in
his sleep when he's awake.

208
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,708
Oh hey, what happened to
the fight we were just in?

209
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,000
[KURAMA] Everyone's dead.

210
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,458
[CAPTAIN] Blast these
scurvy-ridden pests!

211
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,583
Old Sakyou was right!

212
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,250
They were far too
strong for these wimps!

213
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,708
I'll just have to
wait for the Tournament

214
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,541
to see them struck down!

215
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,041
So I take it that's
Hanging-Neck Island.

216
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,375
This is going to
be wild you guys!

217
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,041
Everybody make sure
not to leave me!

218
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,750
[KUWABARA] Are we
really staying here?

219
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:13,541
[music playing]

220
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,083
[KUWABARA]
Wow!

221
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,541
Well it's definitely
better than the pirate ship!

222
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,625
The best of the
evening, gentlemen.

223
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,875
The hotel has
been expecting you.

224
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,291
Please, follow me.

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,458
I got a bad feeling
'bout the people in here.

226
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,750
I never trust grown-ups
dressed that fancy.

227
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,916
For some reason, I thought
they'd be bigger.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,791
Be nice to them Caroline,
they're about to be dead.

229
00:16:48,875 --> 00:17:00,833
This is going to be a very
intriguing year.

230
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,916
I can't sit here
anymore! I'm going!

231
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,041
Forget this moronic paper work!

232
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,208
Where you
planning to go sir?

233
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,500
Where do you think?!
The tournament of course!

234
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,875
But you have to keep stamping
sir! It's very important work!

235
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,000
A trained monkey
could do this job.

236
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,833
Koenma sir!
You're irresponsible!

237
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,916
It's really a pity
you feel that way.

238
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,041
I was just about
to take you with me.

239
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,166
Ciao, Ogre.
Guess I'm going alone.

240
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,875
Wait Koenma sir!!!

241
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,708
[TOGURO 2] Urameshi's
team has checked in.

242
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,916
[SAKYOU] I've spoken with
the ship's captain.

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,541
The other apparitions onboard
were no match for them.

244
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,833
Were you really expecting
it any other way, Sakyou?

245
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,000
[SAKYOU] Their first true test
will come soon enough.

246
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,166
I've arranged for Urameshi's
team to fight Team Rokuyukai

247
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,958
in the very first
match tomorrow.

248
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,375
[TOGURO 2] Rokuyukai...

249
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,083
Well, that should
be interesting.

250
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,416
[KUWABARA]
I gotta hand it to them.

251
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,000
They sure know how to
make things pretty!

252
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,958
I haven't seen this much
rich stuff in my whole life!

253
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,166
[door opens]

254
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,416
[BELLHOP] Your evening
coffee, gentlemen.

255
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,541
Compliments of the hotel.

256
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,791
Careful, those fancy guys
might be trying to poison us.

257
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,083
Does that really
make sense Kuwabara?

258
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,416
Why would they bring us
all the way here to poison us?

259
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,750
The organizers
want to see us fight.

260
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,416
They'll save their murder
attempts for tomorrow.

261
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,333
You guys can talk
your logic all you want.

262
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,083
I'm sticking with
the trusty old aluminum.

263
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,041
[KURAMA] Why is there only one
coffee cup on the table?

264
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,958
[KUWABARA] That's the one I'm
not drinking, remember?

265
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,666
Duh, we had this conversation.

266
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,666
Yes, so there should be two.
One for you and one for Yusuke.

267
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,208
Wow, you think Urameshi
can drink in his sleep, too?

268
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,500
How did you get in here?

269
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,166
He--He must have been hiding in
the room before we even got in!

270
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,291
Fibber fibber! I came through
the door after you got here!

271
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,625
Isn't that what good
boys are supposed to do?

272
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,458
Oops, I guess I did
forgot to knock though!

273
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,166
So you guys are the guests
aren't you? You're so lucky!

274
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,083
Oh, my name's Rinku by the way.

275
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,833
I'm on the Rokuyukai team that
you're fighting tomorrow!

276
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,000
Is that so?

277
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
[RINKU]
I wish I was a guest.

278
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,916
They don't have to go to all
the boring opening ceremonies

279
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,333
or meetings about the rules!

280
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
You just show
up here and fight!

281
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,583
Guess you don't have to
learn about all the prizes

282
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,583
and final round stuff when
you're gonna be dead soon!

283
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,250
[KUWABARA THINKS]
What is this kid?

284
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
He talks about death
like it's a toy!

285
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,500
Somebody told me the guests

286
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,250
would be special
so I got excited.

287
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,000
But you don't
look special at all!

288
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,875
Maybe I'll even
beat you no-hands!

289
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,666
[ZERU] Don't you think
you're talking too much?

290
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,750
What? Who is he?
Somethin's wrong.

291
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,833
I didn't sense
either of 'em coming!

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,166
Hey there Zeru!

293
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,041
I was just saying
how-dee-do to our enemies!

294
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,375
[ZERU] Enjoy your last
night with the living.

295
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,958
Let's just say that tomorrow

296
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,750
will see you strongly
resembling your coffee cup.

297
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,666
What?

298
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,750
[ZERU] Did you see their fifth
man sleeping on the couch?

299
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,958
He never moved.

300
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,125
[RINKU]
So?

301
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,791
I can't figure out if it's

302
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,958
because he knew we
wouldn't attack him tonight,

303
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,250
or if he simply--
wasn't afraid of us.

304
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
I think he's
 just an idiot!

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There must be something
different about that boy.

306
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,000
We will see.

307
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,791
[ANNOUNCER] Welcome,
humans and demons alike,

308
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,375
to the glorious
Hanging-Neck Island!

309
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,208
Now let the Dark
Tournament Begin!!

310
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,250
[crowd cheers]

311
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,958
[NARRATOR] The day of the dark
tournament has arrived.

312
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,583
Yusuke Urameshi's team will
battle the Rokuyukai team

313
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,833
in the opening match,

314
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,291
with Yusuke still
locked in a deep slumber!

315
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,041
How will this
ten-man battle be fought,

316
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,708
and what will the outcome be?

317
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,833
[BOTAN] Hello everyone,
Botan here.

318
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,750
While I'm delivering
Shizuru and Keiko

319
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,291
to Hanging-Neck Island,

320
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,708
the first fight of the Dark
Tournament is getting underway!

321
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,708
And with Yusuke still asleep,

322
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,750
Kuwabara has to
take the first match

323
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,541
against that
strange little boy.

324
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,250
He's got some exciting new
tricks with his Spirit Sword,

325
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,041
but it may not be enough!

326
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,291
Especially when defending
against eight deadly-Yo-Yo's?

327
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,125
It's guaranteed to be a fight
of a whole different color,

328
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,125
when Yu Yu Hakusho continues!

329
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,875
