00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,333
But what about heroism
sir? Determination?

159
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,750
[KOENMA] Save it for
your storybooks.

160
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,916
It's much better to
dump it all on Yusuke.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,208
Running like a baby is perfectly
brave if the odds are too tough.

162
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:53,916
Yes sir!

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Is that so, Koenma?

164
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,875
[KOENMA] Hey! What's with
that tone in your voice?

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,041
Oh nothing sir.

166
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,458
Did you just roll
your eyes at me??

167
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,041
I think you rolled your eyes!!

168
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,291
I know you're not disagreeing
with the super almighty Koenma!!

169
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,333
Gee, I'm glad Kurama has more
of a spine than you do, sir.

170
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,541
[KOENMA]
Say something, Ogre?

171
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,333
Uh nothing sir! Nothing!

172
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,500
That hit was not
enough to beat you.

173
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,083
I know that you stayed
down intentionally

174
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,291
in yet another
attempt to buy time.

175
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,750
I don't suggest
you trying it again.

176
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,208
[KURAMA THINKS]
His wits match my own.

177
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,458
Unless I can find a
way to my energy soon,

178
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,416
he'll bleed me to de--

179
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,250
Perhaps.

180
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,166
[KURAMA THINKS] This seal is
powered by Gama's blood.

181
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,541
Perhaps my own
will disengage it.

182
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,125
[TOUYA] Now, now, don't
underestimate Gama's abilities.

183
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,500
It will take much
more than smearing

184
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,250
to get rid of that seal.

185
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,125
Rose whip!

186
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,291
I see, you've noticed
inklings of your energy

187
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,291
inside your blood.

188
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,750
Only one problem.

189
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,166
To release enough to beat me

190
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,125
you'd have to
bleed yourself dry.

191
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,083
[TOUYA] Gama's seal won't
wear off any time soon.

192
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,833
Admit it Kurama, I'm holding the
end of your life in my hands.

193
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,958
I sure know that
facial expression!

194
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,041
Pure, lovely,
excruciating agony!

195
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,875
And yet, he's
still trying to get up!

196
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,291
He's determined
to take some more!

197
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,208
[KURAMA THINKS]
Touya's right again.

198
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,833
These drops won't
get me anywhere.

199
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,416
There must be another
way to reach my power...

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,375
I have to win.

201
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,333
He's back on his feet!
The fight continues!

202
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,125
[TOUYA THINKS]
This doesn't make sense.

203
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,125
No one could survive all those
direct hits from my ice attack.

204
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,458
Not unless...

205
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,458
You really are
dangerous, aren't you?

206
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,541
I haven't been
making direct hits.

207
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,583
You've been blocking your
vital points with your own body.

208
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,500
[TOUYA] You must be very old.
Experienced, perhaps, as I am.

209
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,791
More alike than
you know. Now tell me...

210
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,291
This new life
on the outside.

211
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,833
What do you truly
plan to do with it?

212
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,708
The world will know.
Just as soon as we get there.

213
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,833
Don't assume.

214
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,375
[TOUYA THINKS] Could it be?
He still plans to win this.

215
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,083
He's been delaying me after all,

216
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,625
letting me
believe I was winning.

217
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,791
And all the while,
thinking of some clever plan.

218
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,166
I can't allow this to continue.

219
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,500
Wow people!

220
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,375
Touya's created
a sword out of ice!

221
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,125
It's the barbaric finish
we've been waiting for!

222
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,375
Kurama!

223
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,416
Ooh! That head
just nearly flew off!

224
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,375
A rather lucky
move, my friend.

225
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,666
Let's see how long
you can keep that up.

226
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,416
[KURAMA THINKS] The slightest
mistake and I'll be killed.

227
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,916
I can't afford to
postpone any longer.

228
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,708
Tell fox-girl you give up!
I swear I'll take it from here!

229
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,833
Urameshi knows he can't
beat four guys in a row!

230
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,083
If Kurama loses
we're dead meat!

231
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,958
Just tell me when it's over!

232
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,041
[KURAMA THINKS] No more
delaying the inevitable.

233
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,416
It's time I take
my responsibility.

234
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,166
And make my stand.

235
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,666
Son a freakin' bitch, Kurama.

236
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,791
Don't get up!
Let me take him!

237
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,250
Are you trying to
get yourself killed??

238
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,833
Go Touya finish him off!

239
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,583
[KOENMA] Why do I get the
feeling our most intelligent

240
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,791
fighter is going to do
something incredibly stupid?

241
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,875
Strange--almost as if Kurama's
taking this fight. Personally.

242
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,750
Let me do what I must Yusuke.

243
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,458
I'm going to end your life
in one blow. Prepare yourself.

244
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,416
It seems that I've gotten
to know you quite well

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,000
in such a short fight,
and I rather like you.

246
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,125
Let's not have this
slaying ruin our friendship.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,250
My thoughts exactly.

248
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,791
Now, you shouldn't have run.

249
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,500
I can't guarantee a
painless kill that way.

250
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Kurama!

251
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,291
Farewell!

252
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,541
But how? Your energy
is locked inside of you.

253
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,708
How could you
manipulate your Death Plant?

254
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,958
Insane, you actually
sowed the Death Plant seed

255
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,583
into your own body??

256
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,250
It was my only option.
My power is locked inside.

257
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,708
By inserting the
seed into my open wound.

258
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,041
The plant could
enter my bloodstream

259
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,041
and take root in
my imprisoned energy.

260
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,708
[TOUYA]
You really are something.

261
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,166
[KOTO] Unbelievable turn around!
I'll take a ten count!

262
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,083
Now it's my turn!

263
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,791
He really did it.

264
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,291
Like the saying:

265
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,708
they can cut your skin, as
long as you break their bones!

266
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,500
Two!

267
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,041
[DEMON FAN 1] Get your
butt off the floor, Touya!

268
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,625
I thought you guys were Shinobi!

269
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,000
Kurama's okay from
doing that, isn't he?

270
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,250
There's a killer plant
growing through his body.

271
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,666
What do you think?

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,416
What is this!

273
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,666
I lay everything on a platter
and they still botch it up!

274
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,375
Can't believe I gotta do
everything for these filth.

275
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,750
We won! We won! We won!

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,083
You see Koenma sir!

277
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,958
There is something to
be said for not giving up!

278
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course there is!

279
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,250
I've been saying
that this whole time

280
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,875
and you've been disagreeing.

281
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,708
Not what I remember.

282
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,666
You know you've been
very unpleasant lately, Ogre.

283
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,250
Maybe after the tournament

284
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,291
I'll have to assign you to the
Lake of Fire cleaning crew!

285
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,916
Ah, ah! Wait sir, I don't
think you have time

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,250
to mess with that now!

287
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,416
Look down there! Yeah I
think Touya's getting up!

288
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,375
Why didn't you tell me!!

289
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,208
[KOTO] Five!

290
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,333
Six!

291
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,875
Seven!

292
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,541
Eight!

293
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,833
Nine!

294
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,625
Ten!!!

295
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,083
Kurama wins!

296
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,208
Please update the score board!

297
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,166
You have won
the match I admit.

298
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,416
Please. Kill me!

299
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,625
I will not.

300
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,708
You never answered. What do
you plan to do with this island.

301
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,375
If you get it?

302
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,625
Who cares!

303
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,875
I too have spent years
in shadow. Interesting.

304
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,666
How unexpected,
regret can appear.

305
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,291
That's what this light does.

306
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:44,666
I only wanted to know if you
could make your life better.

307
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,708
Nobler.

308
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,625
Than mine has been.

309
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,833
Kurama!!

310
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,625
[YUSUKE THINKS] No he can't.

311
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,416
Nobler? Than Kurama?

312
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,625
What did he mean?

313
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh Shizuru, is he?

314
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:13,458
About time they got ridda one
of 'em! Only four more to go!

315
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,041
Oh God.

316
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,125
Wait people! Kurama
still has a faint heartbeat!

317
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,916
It appears he's
slipped into unconsciousness

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,750
while still on his feet!

319
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,250
Can anything kill this guy?

320
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,583
So finish him off!

321
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,541
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere!

322
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,958
And hey fox-girl,
just so we're clear.

323
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,666
The rest of the
fights are all mine!

324
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,750
[BAKKEN]
Not so fast.

325
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,041
What??

326
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,958
You forgot something.
He's standing in the ring.

327
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes, it looks to me like he's
volunteering to fight again.

328
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,250
Oh give me a break! Kurama's
not even conscious anymore!

329
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,541
I'm taking this fight!

330
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,208
Alright uh, Team Captain
decides! Yusuke versus Bakken!

331
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,333
--It's perfectly fair!

332
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,583
[SPEAKER] Correction: The next
fight will be Kurama vs. Bakken.

333
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,750
What??

334
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,833
[SPEAKER] A fighter
standing in the ring

335
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,833
cannot be removed
against his will.

336
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,791
As will cannot be determined
here, the fighter remains.

337
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,833
[RUKA] Don't think
about it, Hiei.

338
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,416
Unless of course,

339
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
you want to try another close
encounter with my force-field.

340
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,125
Looks like you're not
needed anymore, kitten.

341
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,250
Now that the ref
is out of the picture

342
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,750
we can really have some fun.

343
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,625
He's hitting someone who's
completely defenseless!

344
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,583
Clearly not the honor-code type.

345
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,875
You look so peaceful
with your little flowers.

346
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,500
Kurama's definitely
down, Bakken.

347
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,666
Step away so I
can start the count!

348
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,666
You again?

349
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm just going
to do my job, okay!

350
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,500
[KOTO] One!

351
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,250
You must think
you're a comedian.

352
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,625
Nobody who humiliates my sect

353
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,333
and gets to slip
away in a ten count.

354
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:25,041
Six, seven, eight, nine, and...

355
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,791
Say ten!

356
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,375
Oh look, he's
on his feet again.

357
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,791
I guess that means
he wants more!

358
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,458
[YUSUKE] Stop the fight!!

359
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,083
[NARRATOR] Kurama's selfless
acts and corrupt rulings

360
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,166
by the Committee have
pitted the unconscious fighter

361
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,083
in a whole new match.

362
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,291
What will the outcome be?

363
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,458
[YUSUKE] Hey guys,
you know what's coming.

364
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,666
I'm pissed and
I'm gonna get drastic.

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,541
Maybe it's against
these dumb rules

366
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,583
to step in during
somebody else's fight,

367
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,791
but with a little
persuasion from my Spirit Gun

368
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,666
I'll at least get that
meat-head to take me on next.

369
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,208
I can't say whether Kurama
will survive or not,

370
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,958
but either way I'm
gonna even the score.

371
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,000
There's three more
members on Team Masho,

372
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,541
and I'm the only one
left who can take 'em.

373
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,541
Chances aren't great,

374
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,208
but I'll promise one thing.

375
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,250
If I go, I'll
go out with a bang.

376
