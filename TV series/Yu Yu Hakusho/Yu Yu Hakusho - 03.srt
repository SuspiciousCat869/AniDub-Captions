You're pretty tricky Kuwabara,

158
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,791
but I promise this
isn't over yet.

159
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,583
Dude! What's wrong
with your face?

160
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,750
Those brats from Kazanega
got the best of me.

161
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,250
But I never hit
them back Okubo.

162
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,083
You should have fought.

163
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,083
It's nothin I can't take.

164
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,625
[AKASHI]
Kuwabara.

165
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,791
Are those new bruises today?

166
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,000
I got piled on by those guys
you said were harmless

167
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,416
but I didn't touch 'em!

168
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,916
I'm so impressed.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,875
But I talked to some of the
other teachers yesterday

170
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,958
about our arrangement and they
said I was too easy on you.

171
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,958
What??

172
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,916
I was just as surprised as
you are but they were convinced.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,125
So in addition to not
fighting you must all

174
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,458
score fifty percent or higher

175
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,833
on the Physical Science test.

176
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,916
Hey! You can't just
keep adding conditions!

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,875
I'm afraid I just did.

178
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,166
And if one of you fails,
Okubo's job goes out the window!

179
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,958
Please, we can pass that
test easy if we study a little.

180
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,375
I got like a forty-five on my
last Physical Science test!

181
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,083
No worries here!

182
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,833
I scored a fifty-seven.
How 'bout you Okubo?

183
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,500
Yeah I got a thirty-nine so if

184
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,666
I try a little
harder I'll be good.

185
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,958
We're gonna be okay, right
Kuwabara? What did you get?

186
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,458
Uh I got uh...

187
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,125
A seven!

188
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,333
Well what do you know.
Kuwabara is stupider than I am!

189
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,875
What did you make
on your last test?

190
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,583
I got a twelve!

191
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,166
[KUWABARA] Don't worry, fellas!
We've got plenty of time!

192
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,041
If I study all night,
there's maybe a chance!

193
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,375
Not a chance in hell.

194
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:50,375
There are two types of
volcanoes, cone shapes and uh--

195
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,916
Hm. How do
you say that word?

196
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,750
At least it looks like he's

197
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,416
thinking hard
over there, right?

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,416
If he thinks too hard with
that bruised head of his,

199
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,416
it might just explode.

200
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, I'm worried.

201
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,625
Hah! Even if Kuwabara studies
until he's blue in the face,

202
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,458
he still couldn't score more
than thirty points on this.

203
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,833
[KUWABARA] Let's see.
One of these is gotta help.

204
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,791
Are you telling me he's
gonna spend money

205
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,916
on something for school?

206
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,791
And what is the thug of

207
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,208
Sarayashki Junior
High reading?

208
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a good thing
we found you.

209
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,000
We can pay
you back for the

210
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,458
incident at
the baseball field.

211
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,958
That's fine!

212
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,416
But I'm not going to fight you
so just beat me up all you

213
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,708
want and go on back
to your own turf!

214
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,583
Trust me,
that's no problem.

215
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,666
Come on, tough guy!

216
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:05,750
[sounds of fighting
and groaning by Kuwabara]

217
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,208
[MIYAMOTO] Oh, dude!
You're hideous!

218
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,083
[OKUBO] Seriously. Maybe
I can get a different job!

219
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,041
[KOMADA] Tell us who did this!
We'll slaughter them!

220
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,458
Oh don't worry
about it Komada.

221
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,791
I've been missing my daily

222
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,666
beatings with Urameshi
gone anyway!

223
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,208
He's gone mad.

224
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,166
Enough about my dumb old
bruises. Let's get to studying.

225
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,458
If the moon causes gravity,
and gravity causes waves--

226
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,958
[BOTAN] He sticks to
his goals like glue.

227
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,625
I can say he's got
more guts in him

228
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,416
than anyone else I've ever
rammed into the pavement.

229
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,500
It's a good thing I came
over to check on him.

230
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,541
He's fallen asleep
in the final inning.

231
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,208
Hey Kuwabara! Kuwabara!

232
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,333
Wake up and study dufus!
Your test is tomorrow!

233
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,333
Seems he's out for good.

234
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,625
Guess I'll have to
show up in his dream.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,333
Urameshi! You've come
back for a fight, huh?

236
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,708
Well I'm gonna make
cat food out of you!

237
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,625
Hey! Whoa
whoa whoa whoa!

238
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,541
You've got to
pass this test first!

239
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,541
Gimme! I was just studying
this before you showed up.

240
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,750
Why is the
color of blood red?

241
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
Because of all
the red blood cells!

242
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,541
They color it!
That's easy!

243
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,666
But what's the pigment?

244
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,541
Hemoglobin! I forgot!

245
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,541
And what causes
your blood to clot?

246
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,500
Uh, platelets.

247
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,166
Yes, good, good.

248
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,250
And sulfur in the
atmosphere makes acid rain.

249
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,125
[THUG 1] Hey look.
There goes Kuwabara.

250
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,166
I heard he doesn't try
to fight back anymore

251
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,625
when people attack him!

252
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,750
I say we go have
some fun with him!

253
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,291
[THUG 1] Buddy, you're speaking
my language! Come on!

254
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,625
Hey you! Kuwabara!

255
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,750
We wanna have
a word with you!

256
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,458
Oh great, there's no way
I'm wasting that whole night

257
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,666
of questions and answers

258
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,875
cause these lame-o's
make him miss the test!

259
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,916
Anyone who touches
him is dead meat!

260
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,125
Hey! Why the
hell are you stopping?

261
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,375
I don't know man,
I got a bad feeling.

262
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,833
Why don't we turn back.

263
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,250
What are you psychic? Let's go!

264
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,125
I warned you!

265
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,916
[YUSUKE]
I keep forgetting!

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,875
[girls giggling]

267
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,250
Oh I know!

268
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,625
[THUHG 3]
Out of the way!!

269
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,833
[YUSUKE]
I'll get you jerks!

270
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,625
Misako! Are you okay?

271
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,250
Hey I know her from school!

272
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,708
[YUSUKE THINKS] Botan
said people get closer to the

273
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,375
Spirit World
when they're asleep,

274
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,083
and she just fainted!
Maybe I can--

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,916
Misako, you okay?

276
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,208
Where are you going?!

277
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:09,958
Get him!

278
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,875
Yeah!

279
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,083
Just wait till I catch you!!

280
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,333
You should've listened.

281
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,125
And you should
go to school, girl.

282
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,625
As soon as
I knock you out!!

283
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,708
Don't you know there's
a test today?! Moron!

284
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,791
I feel better! Kuwabara.

285
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,291
[Yusuke laughs]

286
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,416
Somebody help me!

287
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,541
Man I'm positive I studied this.
But I can't remember.

288
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,833
Kuwabara, just try to
remember what you dreamed.

289
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,458
Hey! I got it!

290
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,791
Guys! I just took the test
and I cleared fifty points!

291
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,916
How'd you already
get the results?

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,708
I copied down my
answers on scratch paper

293
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,250
so I could check 'em in the
textbook after I was through,

294
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,000
and I've already
looked over it four times!

295
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,083
I scored fifty-three big ones!

296
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,375
Then you saved me!

297
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Wow Kuwabara
you really licked 'em!

298
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,791
Naw, it was nothing.
Just a promise between men.

299
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,916
Don't get modest now Kuwabara.
Tell 'em you're the big cheese!

300
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,166
This can't be right!

301
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,166
[AKASHI THINKS]
That garbage-brain actually 

302
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,250
scored more than fifty points!

303
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,208
If that brat had only missed
one more question!

304
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,166
Now he's thrown the
whole plan into the sewer!

305
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,916
Let me show you a
different method of grading.

306
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,833
You see Mr. Akashi, there really
wasn't an answer written there.

307
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,416
You've made a mistake.

308
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,166
[AKASHI]
Yes, I see.

309
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,250
No! That's wrong!

310
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,333
And what's really painful
is that you were so close!

311
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,791
But I'm afraid a promise
is a promise young man.

312
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,250
I'll go notify
Okubo's employers.

313
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,750
But I checked it.

314
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,291
Oh well. I guess there are
many things you can't do right.

315
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,458
[KUWABARA THINKS]
I know this isn't right!

316
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,625
I checked all the
answers myself!

317
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,583
[KUWABARA THINKS]
I-I don't believe it!

318
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,833
That no good teacher
erased my last answer!

319
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,083
Who does
he think he is?!

320
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,333
I'll show you!

321
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,916
Kuwabara, stop!

322
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,250
I don't know if you can hear
me but I'm gonna say this!

323
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,375
Just remember Okubo! All
the poundings you took for him!

324
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,416
Punch this teacher
and all that's erased!

325
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,000
Kuwabara!

326
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,541
It would've been worth getting
hit just to see you expelled.

327
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,791
But either way the test score
is marked down as forty-eight.

328
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,958
I've got the power,
you see?!

329
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,375
[Akashi laughs]

330
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,833
[MR. TAKENAKA] Find
something funny, Mr. Akashi?

331
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,583
[AKASHI] Did you see
that Mr. Takenaka?

332
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,125
That hoodlum
nearly rang my neck!

333
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,250
Yes, and I think if someone
had corrupted my answer sheet

334
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,458
the way you and
Mr. Iwamoto did to that boy,

335
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,583
I would have
wrung your neck too.

336
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,833
But wait! I don't
know what you mean!

337
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sure that you know how
precious the Honor System

338
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,541
is at this Junior High,

339
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,750
so I'd appreciate it greatly
if you didn't lie to my face!

340
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,041
Now, you're going to
correct that score immediately!

341
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,500
Of course!

342
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,500
[OKUBO]
Kuwabara!

343
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,833
They're going to let me
keep my job for good!

344
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,416
Mr. Takenaka said that everyone
scored higher than fifty points!

345
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
You're kidding me!

346
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,666
Oh Kuwabara,
I didn't realize it till now

347
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,291
but I was really scared I'd
be living in the streets!

348
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,708
I'm so happy!

349
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,458
Then it was worth it.

350
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,083
I tried to stop him from hitting
that teacher as a reflex.

351
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,958
I didn't think
he'd hear me!

352
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,625
Kuwabara didn't really hear
what you said to him, you know.

353
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,000
Say what?

354
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,583
They can't hear words
unless they're asleep.

355
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,041
But you can communicate
feelings to living people

356
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,041
when you're on the
same emotional wavelength.

357
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,583
See. You reached
Kuwabara with your feelings.

358
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,291
Hey! Give me a break!

359
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,833
Everything's going fine and
then you have to get mushy!

360
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,041
You don't have
to be embarrassed.

361
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
Shut up will you! I think he
can hear us talking about him!

362
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,833
Don't worry Yusuke,

363
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,208
he definitely can't
see us or hear us,

364
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,083
though there's a good
chance he can feel you

365
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,625
after what you
went through together.

366

Thank you, man.

367

You talking to ghosts
again Kuwabara?

[KUWABARA] Uh?
No, just listening to the wind.

everybody! It's Koenma.

You know,
ruler of the Spirit World!

Well Yusuke's about
to be in some real trouble!

372
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,750
Imagine a big fire
starting in your

373
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,375
house while you're
barely-alive body

374
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,375
is still sleeping inside, and
then you'll know what I mean!

375
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,208
Will these flames devour
Yusuke's hopes of revival

376
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,583
before his mysterious
Spirit Beast can hatch?

Keiko's running
in to save him,

378
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,041
but when the house caves in
she'll become a victim herself!

379
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,166
It's going to be hot, and
the finale will blow you away!
