I didn't mean it!

159
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,041
[BAKKEN]
I'm so sorry!!

160
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,125
Hey! Calm down buddy!
You're embarrassing me here!

161
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,583
Cheer up Bakken.
Your brain's just small.

162
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,833
It's not your fault
you can't remember

163
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,000
all those things
you did to Kurama.

164
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,500
So, I'm gonna
refresh your memory

165
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,500
by using your
body as an example!

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,291
See first you jumped in and
grabbed him a little like this.

167
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,625
And then--

168
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,250
Out of the ring!
Naturally I'll take a ten count!

169
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,875
One!

170
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Two!

171
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,416
Three!

172
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Four!

173
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,833
Five!

174
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,333
Six!

175
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,750
Seven!

176
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
Eight!

177
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,458
That's a pretty good fight.

178
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:13,083
Ten! And the
winner is Urameshi!

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,083
How you doin'?

180
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,791
I'll survive.

181
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,166
Sorry I couldn't finish
the first three of them

182
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,291
as I planned.

183
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,750
[YUSUKE] Shut up.
How are the wounds?

184
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,333
My injuries from Team
Masho are nothing

185
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,541
compared to this Death Plant.

186
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,500
It will take a
great deal of energy

187
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,000
and concentration to remove.

188
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,458
I suppose we really do
reap what we sow, right?

189
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,625
Listen, just get
some rest okay.

190
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,583
These last two guys are gonna
be fish meat pretty soon.

191
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,916
Be cautious with them Yusuke.

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Whatever plans the Shinobi
have for this island,

193
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,000
they want it very badly.

194
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,083
And these last two members are
without a doubt the strongest.

195
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,500
[HIEI THINKS] Perfect.
Just a little bit more...

196
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,583
[MASKED FIGHTER THINKS]
Now this is something I

197
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,958
didn't count on...

198
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,875
Hiei's right arm is improving!

199
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,250
Ironic.

200
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,666
The type of energy Ruka's
exerting into this medical tent

201
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,208
actually has a healing
effect on his wound.

202
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,625
Ruka must've
sensed it too late.

203
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,958
She knows that if she
cuts back her force field,

204
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,666
Hiei will overcome her.

205
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,625
All she can do now is
hold on for dear life,

206
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,916
and pray Hiei's power
doesn't increase any more.

207
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,375
[crowd yelling]

208
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,333
Finally Jin's ready to fight!

209
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,708
He's going to tear
Urameshi into pieces!

210
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,041
Might as well give up
now, Spirit Detective!

211
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,166
No one beats the wind master!

212
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,458
[KOENMA] What is the big
hip-hurrah over this Jin guy?

213
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,375
How scary can moving air be?

214
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,875
Is he a master of fire or
darkness or something, too?

215
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,375
No sir, just wind.

216
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,166
[KOENMA]
Groovy.

217
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,916
But Koenma sir,

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,541
this is still an extremely
dangerous fight for your team.

219
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,083
I'm not sure feasting
now would be appropriate.

220
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,166
[KOENMA] I guess you're
right. We'll wait.

221
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,125
I've been looking
forward to this one.

222
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,291
I can assure you
we all have, Sakyo.

223
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,458
Jin's gonna hang
this boy up by his toes.

224
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,750
My first three demons
were the chump-change

225
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,958
compared to this guy.

226
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,541
[CROWD CHANTS]
Kill Yusuke! Kill Yusuke!

227
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,750
Lucky eyes you got.

228
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,666
Damn it, I can't believe the
ruckus they're washing up

229
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,875
you can't even make a thought!

230
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,666
Ah course I wouldn't mind
if it weren't for the ears.

231
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,708
See they're all
pointy up and wiggling,

232
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,125
unlike they were before.

233
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,875
Get in that way when
I'm happy or excited,

234
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,041
and I haven't been
either in a very long time.

235
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,041
But saw biggy flying
up all the way high

236
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,125
and past "whew" almost lost it!

237
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,833
Well didn't you hear me?

238
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,083
I'm talkin' about the way
you knocked away Bakken's fog

239
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,125
and then took him
for a first class ride

240
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,083
on your fists, you know.

241
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,291
I never did like that guy.

242
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,125
The wind around his
pores was pretty stinky.

243
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,125
Actually, I'm kind
of glad you waxed him.

244
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,083
Oh, don't tell Risho
I told you that, huh?

245
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:43,083
[both laugh]

246
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,750
Why's he laughin'
with the bad guy?

247
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,708
You're a crazy bastard,
you know that?

248
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,416
You went and got
me all in a good mood,

249
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
and I was about to
use my anger at Bakken

250
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
to pound you into the ground!

251
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,583
[JIN] Nah, don't lump
me in with biggy.

252
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,208
He was just a jerk.

253
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,750
Going in bearing a grudge is no
way to start fight so it says.

254
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,333
You'll never have any
cheering up that way.

255
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,708
Just good old fight to
find the strongest guy is all.

256
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,833
I guess you weren't kidding

257
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,458
about the wind
master thing, huh?

258
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,875
[KOTO] Wow! Hold onto
your hair, people!

259
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,333
Jin is unleashing his power!

260
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,958
He's floating several
inches off the ring floor,

261
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,166
supported by his terrific wind!

262
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
And I haven't even
started this match yet!

263
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,708
Here we go, Jin. I can't
say my ears are pointing up,

264
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,375
but I'm looking
forward to this challenge.

265
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,708
[JIN] That's the spirit.
Let's have some fun then.

266
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,416
If I lose my
whole team's screwed

267
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,875
and if I win I
have to fight again.

268
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,041
Yeah, that sounds like fun!

269
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,500
[KOTO] Match four!
Yusuke versus Jin! Let her rip!

270
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,208
Oh wow! Jin easily
dodged Yusuke's attack

271
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,708
by shooting
straight up into the air!

272
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,833
But, he doesn't
seem to be stopping!

273
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,916
So this is what
the wind in the

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
big bright and open
feels like, huh?

275
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,708
[JIN]
I always wanted to know.

276
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,958
Could really all be ours.

277
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,250
Might be worth having
the old Shinobi job

278
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,041
with a place like this.

279
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,500
[KOTO] Don't worry people,
I can still just barely see him!

280
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,875
He's the size of a tiny gnat!

281
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,458
[YUSUKE] Hey, come on!
You've got a fight to lose!

282
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,000
Sorry Urameshi,
but I'm getting my prize!

283
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,791
[KOTO] Hold on.
Where'd he go? Wait!

284
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,833
He's using the sun
behind him as a blinder!

285
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,833
He's coming down fast!

286
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,125
Let's do this.

287
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,000
[KOTO] Hold on a second!

288
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,875
Jin's deliberately
avoided hitting Yusuke!

289
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,750
What could be going
through the wind master's head?

290
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,458
Damn he's fast'!

291
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
[YUSUKE]
What's he doing?

292
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,750
Nothing to be in a
fuss for Urameshi.

293
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,958
Man's just got to get in
right spirit before he fights.

294
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,833
Don't you think it so?

295
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,125
You know one of these days

296
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,291
I'm gonna fight someone who
talks like a normal person!

297
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,125
Okay, heard that loud and clear.

298
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,791
Keep punching like
that and we'll enjoy this.

299
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,708
[NARRATOR] Jin, the Wind Master,

300
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,375
is now revealing
his incredible powers,

301
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,333
while the team leader Risho
still waits in the wings.

302
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,583
Yusuke is the only one
still able to fight.

303
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,375
Can he stand up to them both?

304
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,166
Hello everyone, it's Botan.

305
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,375
The big battle against
Jin is cranking up,

306
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,208
and our one of a
kind Spirit Detective

307
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,625
is certainly going
to have his hands full.

308
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,416
How can Yusuke
fight a person who,

309
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,083
in addition to having
powers that rival his own,

310
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,375
also has that even rarer trait--

311
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,250
a personality that
Yusuke actually likes?!

312
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,416
It's going to be a fight

313
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,666
where friend and
