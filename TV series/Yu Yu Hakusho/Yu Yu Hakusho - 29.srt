strings! That's cheating!!!

158
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,791
[KOTO]
Ten!!

159
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,666
Come on.

160
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,875
And Rinku's the winner! The
Rokuyukai Team gets a point!

161
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,333
[KUWABARA] No, no,
no, no, no!

162
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,625
Hold it, jerks!

163
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,916
That wasn't a
fair move! Let's go!

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,125
Whoa-you run on
batteries or something?

165
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,083
I beat you--just please go away!

166
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,833
That was fairly innocent.

167
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,625
It's rare to see both
fighters still standing.

168
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,083
I assure you it
won't happen with me.

169
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,625
This isn't over, kid!

170
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,541
Meet me behind the hotel
when the tournament's done!

171
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,083
[RINKU]
Go away!

172
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,125
What is he talking about?

173
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,125
Junior High
boy stuff.

174
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,000
[RINKU]
'Scuse me!

175
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,416
Used so much power and
didn't even get the kill.

176
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,083
[ROTO] He forgets what makes
this tournament dark.

177
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,416
[KOTO] Ooh! The next competitor
has already stepped up!

178
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,375
Please, I'll handle this one.

179
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,416
[ROTO THINKS] I can
tell this will be exciting.

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,250
Kurama.

181
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,541
Considering the stakes we can't
afford to take any chances.

182
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,250
Don't leave the ring
with him still alive.

183
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,666
Naturally.

184
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,958
[YUSUKE] I don't know
if you want to fight him.

185
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,833
Be careful Kurama.

186
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,750
What is he talking about?

187
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,250
Yes, it's simply
time I stepped in!

188
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,083
Um, are you sure
you can do that?

189
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,416
We will deal with the rest
of their team. You relax.

190
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,291
Hey, I'm not out of this yet!

191
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,666
If Yusuke doesn't wake up,
I'll take the last guy.

192
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,208
We'll pray that
that doesn't happen.

193
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,041
[BOTAN] Alright boys
I'm here!

194
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,291
Now let's whip
this team into shape!

195
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,791
Hey--How'd you get here?

196
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,791
[HIEI] Leave, before
you hurt yourself.

197
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,500
Well that's a
jolly thing to say

198
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,333
to someone who's
going to help you win,

199
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,875
don't you think?

200
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,750
You mean you're like
the replacement fighter

201
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,416
for Urameshi?

202
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,083
No, silly.

203
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
Tada!!!

204
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,958
In addition to
Detective's Assistant

205
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,375
and Pilot of the River Styx,
I'm also a licensed trainer!

206
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,416
I'll be looking
after you all

207
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,416
and making sure you stay
in tip-top shape for fighting!

208
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,625
Oh great! Then
maybe you can help me

209
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,291
nurse this wound here see I--

210
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,541
[BOTAN] Spirit World to Yusuke!
Wake up! Come on, now!

211
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,375
None of that will work.
The boy is determined.

212
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,833
[BOTAN] Well--at least I'll
get him out of the way!

213
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,166
You know, that Rose Whip
he's got must be ten feet long!

214
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,416
Where's he stash it?

215
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,083
All the ways I can think
of sound kinda painful.

216
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,541
Kurama simply
carries a normal rose.

217
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,333
By manipulating it
with his Spirit Energy

218
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,458
it's transformed
into a whip.

219
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,750
Even weeds can turn into
a deadly weapon for Kurama.

220
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,750
Second fight--Roto
versus Kurama--begin!

221
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,416
I know you've been spending
years in the Human World.

222
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,125
We all do what he must.

223
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,291
I only hope you didn't--say--
get attached to one of them.

224
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,583
This red-haired boy. I don't
think he's really human.

225
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,958
That's funny--
why'd you say that?

226
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,375
For example, be
mournful of their death.

227
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,708
What is your point?

228
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,541
He's clearly no
match for Kurama.

229
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,791
What a joke of a round.

230
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,500
It's a pity you
couldn't have taken him

231
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,583
and let Kurama deal
with the little child

232
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,000
and his yo-yos.

233
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,625
Hey you watch it, shrimpy!
I just got cheated is all!

234
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,125
He can't even
hit the bastard!

235
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,333
But Gondawara.

236
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,291
I thought with the
support of those dirty fans

237
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,708
a team could beat anyone.

238
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,750
Maybe even
upset my Toguro.

239
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,541
I hope you didn't wager too
much of your money on that.

240
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,875
Your skills weren't
enough for this tournament.

241
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,708
Say your last words.

242
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,583
I have your human mother,
Kurama. Or should I say--Suichi!

243
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,458
What happened?

244
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,875
He's bleeding--
you said no match!

245
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,333
Stupid cheater.
I hate him.

246
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,666
Little Stupid.

247
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,291
You sure you're asleep?

248
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,166
Allow me to introduce
my little button.

249
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,041
When I press it, a signal will
be sent to my demon brother.

250
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,083
He's been tracking your
mother for some time, you see.

251
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,791
And he's very anxious
to bite her head off.

252
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,500
So you understand.

253
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,458
[ROTO] No fighting back!

254
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,083
Oh honestly,

255
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,166
do you think throwing
a pebble at my face

256
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,541
is the best thing to
do in this situation?

257
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,375
You've been warned!

258
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,916
With a push of this button

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,333
your mother will meet her death
in a very unsightly manner!

260
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
Now fold your
arms behind your back

261
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,041
and let me hit you as I please!

262
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,375
Oh yes! That's much better!

263
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,666
I love the posture
of forced submission.

264
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,416
Why train hard to be the best
when you can hold one of these?

265
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,625
Mysterious!

266
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,041
Kurama has become totally
obedient to his opponent!

267
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,333
What's wrong Kurama?!
Let him have it!!

268
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,125
Quiet.

269
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah, that's beautiful! Roto
has somehow hypnotized him!

270
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,041
Who gives a damn! When do we get
to hear the bones break!

271
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,750
Gee, that's so lame! Roto always
uses that dirty trick of his!

272
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,916
Yes, and he always wins.
That's the goal, remember?

273
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,166
I guess so.

274
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,375
You want to try. I can
see it in your pretty eyes!!

275
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,666
I know what you're thinking-

276
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,625
what if I can quickly
cut off that left arm of his?

277
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,708
But what if his severed finger
still presses the button?!

278
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,708
What is that crude doing now?
Just finish the fight!

279
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,125
This is not for
his personal amusement.

280
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,750
Fortunes are on the line!

281
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,333
A loss would make
it two to zero!

282
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,708
Yes Ogre, I know.

283
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,166
Kurama remains
absolutely motionless!

284
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,125
What is the cause? Has he
lost his willingness to fight?

285
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Why don't
you answer her?

286
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,750
Tell the crowd the truth.

287
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,791
Tell them you refuse to fight
for the sake of a human tramp!

288
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,541
It's brutal! It's violent!
It's wonderful!

289
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,875
Roto is punching him

290
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,041
like a side of meat
and there's no retaliation!

291
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,583
Dammit!

292
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,500
I hate that look!

293
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,000
Despite all I've done

294
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,125
you still have that look
like you're superior to me!

295
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:37,458
[ROTO]
Stop... that... look!

296
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,916
It doesn't matter anyway.

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,791
Because I am the
one with power now.

298
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,333
I would like you to lick
the scum off of my boot.

299
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,875
I just can't seem
to keep it clean.

300
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,250
And after you've wiped
the whole thing clean.

301
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,875
I will decapitate you and
spare your nasty mother's life.

302
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,875
And since you
care about her, Suichi,

303
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,416
it's really your only choice!

304
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I will not.

305
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,416
What??

306
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,125
Go ahead, press
it now if you wish.

307
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,416
In the end your
true character emerges.

308
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,208
You're nothing special!
Nothing high class!

309
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,000
Just a selfish demon
like all the rest of us here!

310
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,041
[ROTO] Look at me like I'm dirt!
But in the end it's a lie!

311
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,041
You think only of yourself!

312
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,208
[KURAMA]
Push it!

313
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,166
I will!

314
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,916
I can't move!

315
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,666
Fighting on the strength of one
threat is a very risky gamble.

316
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,083
What if I truly didn't care?

317
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,250
Or what if I could
just make you immobile?

318
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,791
[KOTO] It's hard to tell
what's happening now!

319
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,333
But it's clear
Kurama has control!

320
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,041
[KURAMA] I've sown the seed of
the Death Plant in your body.

321
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,250
And it's had plenty
of time to take root.

322
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,666
[ROTO THINKS]
The pebble!

323
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,208
It was a distraction,
so I wouldn't notice the seed!

324
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,583
I feed it with my energy.

325
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,875
I have but to will it,
and it will instantly bloom.

326
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,083
I'm afraid there
won't be anything left

327
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,625
of your evil life after that.

328
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,166
Wait Kurama!
You don't have to do this!

329
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,083
I never would've actually
pushed the button! I swear it!

330
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,333
[ROTO] I'm just a low-class!
I don't know any better!

331
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,208
Come on! You believe
in mercy, don't you?

332
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,166
No.

333
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,083
What irony.

334
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,250
Such beauty, sprung
from such an ugly soil.

335
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,125
[KOTO] Well, that one's
definitely over!

336
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,208
The score is tied at one!

337
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,750
[HIEI]
What a fool.

338
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,208
So intent on proving himself
he couldn't notice your moves.

339
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,041
Don't worry
about his demon friend.

340
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,416
He vanished the
moment Roto died.

341
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,875
Then you knew.

342
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,666
What a relief.

343
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,666
Yes.

344
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,791
Okay, enough secret-glancing
stuff! What just happened!

345
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,041
Yes! Do tell!

346
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:25,916
It's passed.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,500
Agreed.

348
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,541
That isn't very
friendly of them!

349
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,333
Those demons think
they're so darn cool!

350
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,166
[NARRATOR] And so
concludes the first two matches

351
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,666
of the Rokuyukai
and Urameshi Team battle.

352
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,833
The score is even at one.
What will happen next?

353
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,625
[YUSUKE]
I swear!

354
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,500
Doesn't anyone appreciate
that a guy's gotta sleep!

355
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,541
The next fight is coming,

356
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,250
and it's gonna
be an ego contest

357
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,375
fit for a high
school locker room!

358
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,875
Zeru, the team leader,

359
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,333
gets angry with waiting and
steps into the ring himself.

360
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,791
And that means
fire balls to the roof!

361
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,416
But Hiei's ready
with the Jagan eye open,

362
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,833
and he's drawing on a dark,

363
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,458
dragon energy
never unleashed before!

364
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,500
Explosions are
pretty much guaranteed!

365
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:21,541

episode of Yu Yu Hakusho!
