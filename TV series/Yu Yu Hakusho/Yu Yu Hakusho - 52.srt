will be mandatory.

157
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,875
Toguro talks most excitedly
about this tournament.

158
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,541
He feels it will be
the most competitive yet.

159
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,083
A Shinobi sect and
an extremely creative doctor

160
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,791
have already made their bids.

161
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,875
And with the
controversial apparitions

162
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,750
Kurama and Hiei joining Yusuke,

163
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,541
his team could
be formidable;

164
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
though Toguro feels
without a strong fifth member

165
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,916
they will not live for long.

166
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,458
[FEMALE REP] But as
you said, Master Genkai,

167
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:16,000
the choice is yours.

168
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,375
[GENKAI] When an old teammate

169
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,041
traps you into a tournament
after fifty years,

170
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,666

171
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,041
I knew I would die here.

172

[YUSUKE] Hey, you're
not makin' any sense.

173
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,833
What are you
saying-old teammate?

174
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,083
You can't mean
you and Toguro!

175
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,083
[ANNOUNCER] Winners of the
Dark Tournament! Team Toguro!!

Please, name your prize!

177
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,458
[YOUNG TOGURO 2]
You will turn me from a human

178
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,916
into the highest class of demon.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
A kind that lives for
centuries and whose body

180
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,416
will practically
never age.

181
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,666
A kind with
strength absolute.

182
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,708
It's the truth Yusuke.

183
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,625
That was my wish fifty years ago

184
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,416
when my team became
the champions

185
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,958
of the Dark Tournament.

186
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,416
Suffice to say your teacher

187
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,750
didn't exactly
agree with my choice.

188
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,750
Yusuke!

189
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,125
Hey, try and save your energy.

190
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,500
Damn it, Yusuke.
Listen to me.

191
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,916
Every one has
to fight with time.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,916
To find their place
before their inevitable death.

193
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,125
Toguro, he ran
away from that fight.

194
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,041
Don't you ever do the same,

195
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,375
no human is ever
a one man show.

196
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,208
Every decision that you make...

197
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:47,583
Will affect the countless
people who care about you.

198
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,250
Do you understand?

199
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:58,208
You can't be a...
cocky kid anymore.

200
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:04,250
You have to...

201
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,666
I have to what?

202
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,708
Genkai has been finished.

203
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,000
Her energy is completely gone.

204
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,166
[KOENMA] She's dead.

205
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,333
Oh, Genkai.

206
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:47,083
[Botan begins to weep]

207
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,416
[TOGURO 2] You have no more
reason to mourn for that woman

208
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
than I do, Yusuke.

209
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,833
She died a
long time ago.

210
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,750
Decades before
you were even born.

211
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,958
A fighter only has two
choices in their life.

212
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,625
Either die or get stronger.
And Genkai chose the former.

213
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,333
Ever since she
abandoned her potential

214
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,375
and hid herself like
a frightened animal

215
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,875
in that mountain compound.

216
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,500
She's been nothing
but a walking corpse.

217

[YUSUKE]
Shut the hell up.

218
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,625
You think you know everything,

219
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,958
but you don't have a
friggin' clue!

220
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,875
Don't fear
the truth Yusuke.

221
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,041
All I did was clean
up the filthy mess

222
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,708
that she left behind.

223

[YUSUKE] You don't know
anything about her!!!

[TOGURO 2] Very
impressive, Yusuke.

229
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,166
But your heart clearly
wasn't in that fight.

230
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,125
[Toguro 2 laughs]

231
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,250
[TOGURO 2] At last,
I will be able to do battle

Oh, what's wrong
with you now, Puu?

[PUU]
Puu.

really wrong with Botan, too.

[Botan weeps]

Darn it, where's Urameshi?

that huge energy I felt!

Use the Spirit Wave to
float on top of the spike.

[GENKAI] Good. Now we'll hold
this for twelve hours.

in blocking energy attacks.

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Careful. This could kill you.
