the one in control.

157
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,708
What's with Toguro's
muscles all of a sudden?

158
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,458
They've deflated like a
beach ball on the rocks.

159
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,750
Lots a crazy things I seen
but this one takes the prize.

160
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,208
Urameshi's attack
was powerful.

161
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,166
Perhaps this is what happens
when Toguro is injured.

162
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,416
I am afraid that
a ferocious wolf

163
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,625
is laying in wait underneath
that placid sheep's façade.

164
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,750
I know.
It's written on his face.

165
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,833
At last Yusuke,
you've done as I've asked.

166
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,166
I've waited a long
time for this moment.

167
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,166
Now destiny has
rewarded my patience.

168
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,833
Wow! The Earth is quaking!

169
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,750
Now this is shaping up
to be the kind of fight

170
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,791
where some legends are made
and others are painfully broken!

171
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,708
Toguro's power up is
like a solar eclipse,

172
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,458
you should not
stare directly at it,

Oh no! I hope Poo's
barrier can hold!

175

It's hard to tell if Toguro's
lost control of his power,

176
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,750
or if he's attacking
the crowd on purpose.

Hey! What the?

Who the heck is
turning off the lights?

179

Be careful, Yusuke.

This is it.

of those muscles, genius.

Urameshi! This is your chance!
Finish him off.

189
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,666
Do it while you can, before
he reaches full power!

190
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,791
[YUSUKE THINKS] I, I can't move.

191

It's not fear that's holding
me back though, it's curiosity.

192
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,541
I just need to
know what he's got.

193
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
So that's full power.

194
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,708
It's more than I hoped.

195
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,500
Are we certain he
doesn't get stronger?

196

Poor Yusuke. He doesn't
stand a chance.

197
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,250
Watch it Shizuru!

198
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,125
How can you say something like
that? Yusuke will win this one!

199
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,750
You'll see. He'll win it,
just like all the other times.

200
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,625
[KOTO] Well, after much
anticipation and buildup

201
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,791
Toguro has finally
revealed his full power.

202
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,833
And may I just be the first to
say that I'm not the least bit

203

disappointed in the
grand unveiling.

204

everybody go?

[KUWABARA] You know, I was
kickin' myself pretty hard

to feel this guy's power.

I guess that's what
makes it gambling.

212

It's too bad, really, that
Yusuke didn't have enough time

with Genkai before she
gave him her power.

214

a couple too many.

missing in your eyes.

going to get heavier!
