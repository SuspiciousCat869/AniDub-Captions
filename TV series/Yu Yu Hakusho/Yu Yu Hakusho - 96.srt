1
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,291
[NARRATOR]
After walking away the survivor

2
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,166
from a life or death
battle with Sensui,

3
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,416
Yusuke returned to
Living World only

4
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,416
to find the day-to-day grind
to be much more unfulfilling

5
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,875
than he expected.

6
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,833
Following Genkai's advice,
Yusuke went to visit Kuroko,

7
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,916
the first Spirit Detective.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,625
Here, Kuroko displayed her knack

9
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,833
at savoring the
routines of daily life.

10
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,375
And as Yusuke was beginning
to learn a few things,

11
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,500
three strange visitors appeared.

12
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,208
[HOKUSHIN] We have come here
on a mandate from Demon World.

13
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,041
I have come to tell
you your destiny,

14
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,375
and take you to the place
where you actually belong.

15
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,416
The place where I belong?

16
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,166
So you guys came here
from Demon World?

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,333
That's true.

18
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,166
[YUSUKE]
Oh, I get it.

19
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,750
They must be kickin' out
all the rejects, right?

20
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,458
No.

21
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,500
Don't be rude, Touou.

22
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,750
See, you come in here,

23
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,166
saying you're from Demon World,

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,083
but you got the spiritual
presence of piece of gum.

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,083
How can I blame
your lack of trust,

26
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,583
having never set eyes on us?

27
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,041
According to the standards
set forth in Demon World,

28
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,500
These two behind me, Seitei
and Touou, are both A-class.

29
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:02,208
And I, Hokushin, am what
would be considered S-class.

30
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,500
You are an S-class?

31
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,583
[HOKUSHIN]
I am.

32
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,833
Okay, well, I must be
the idiot here

33
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,541
because I had it in my head

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,333
that the tunnel between
Demon World and

35
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,083
Living World had been
sealed off for good.

36
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,250
[YUSUKE]
Although...

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,000
...I shouldn't be surprised
when the story changes anymore.

38
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,166
Now, S and A class spirits
can enter Living World?

39
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,958
No, that's not quite
what's happening, Yusuke.

40
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,041
[HOKUSHIN]
In fact,

41
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,291
we came here without using
the dimensional distortion.

42
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,250
We are here by a much
easier and discreet way.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,166
And that is?

44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,500
[KUROKO] I don't
mean to be rude,

45
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,416
But there's more than
one person in the room.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,916
Could you back it up a
step and explain for us?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,833
Well, it's just that it's
kind of a long story

48
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,208
and I don't want to bore you.

49
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,625
I'm hardly bored.

50
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,666
And since I did bother to
ask you to explain, maybe

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
--Right.
--you'd be polite and do it.

52
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,666
In my day, I never
heard anything

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,083
about a tunnel between
worlds and S-class ghosts.

54
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,916
It's been more than
ten years since

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I retired from your
position, Yusuke.

56
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,958
I think too many things
have changed since then.

57
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,083
[laughs] Right.
Back to business.

58
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,958
Now tell me who you are
or I start knockin' heads.

59
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,333
[HOKUSHIN] It's actually
quite simple, Yusuke.

60
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,583
A time ago, fear grew of the
consequences if the S and

61
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,875
A class spirits were allowed
through to the Living World.

62
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,666
Therefore, the Kekkai
barrier was erected,

63
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,000
allowing only Demons lower
than D-class to pass through.

64
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
All we had to do to get here

65
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,416
was alter our power to a
level lower than D-class.

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,041
[YUSUKE gasps]

67
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,666
[gasps] What the hell is that?

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,291
This is an organic device

69
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,500
that all but disables
our demonic power.

70
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,833
It must be worn until our
return to Demon World.

71
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,041
There are other ways to
enter the Living World,

72
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,708
but the rules forbid us.

73
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:18,416
This device, however, has no
rules written against it.

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,375
This is what we must endure in
order to visit the Living World.

75
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,958
We have these placed on us,
but, like all things,

76
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,791
they are only temporary.

77
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,208
So, you put a gross
thing on you to get here.

78
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,208
Now, tell me what
this has to do with me.

79
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,541
There is someone
residing in Demon World

80
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,625
who has requested to have an
audience with you, Yusuke.

81
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,666
[SEITEI]
Hm.

82
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,583
[HOKUSHIN] Of course, I am
speaking of your ancestor.

83
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,916
You're saying,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,416
He sent you here to escort
me back to Demon World,

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,541
is that more like it?

86
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, it is.

87
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,791
[YUSUKE] Like they say,
"The fool hunts for misfortune."

88
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,125
I'd love to get my fingers
around his throat!

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,875
So the old bastard
is still alive, huh?

90
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,625
Yes, of course he is.

91
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,791
[YUSUKE] He's still got
some power left in him?

92
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,666
[HOKUSHIN]
Yes, Very much.

93
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,041
Fine! Let's go, now!

94
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,125
I'm gonna follow up on my

95
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,250
"fingers around
his throat" idea.

96
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,916
You needn't hurry. Take the
time to hear our words first.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,875
We limit our time in and
out of this place because

98
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,125
we abide strictly by the
rules of Demon World.

99
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,458
And to these rules,
we make no exception.

100
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,000
If you do return
with us, Yusuke,

101
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,500
it is then that you
will become one of us.

102
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,375
[YUSUKE]
I'm not following you.

103
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,000
To see your ancestor,
to return with us,

104
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,916
you must become
as one of us.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,833
No one we bring back
to the Demon World

106
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,833
can be an outsider.

107
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,083
All these rules...

108
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,500
I didn't know Demons
thought so logically.

109
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,458
These are the written
rules of our territory.

110
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,708
And our territory
is no different

111
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,291
from the other two that
exist in Demon World.

112
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,083
So there are three of 'em?

113
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,583
You believe that there is no
order to be had in Demon World.

114
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
This is quite true,

115
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,791
but for Demon World, the chaos
that reigned was the best law

116
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,500
to be laid, because
it put everything

117
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
into its natural place.

118
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,625
But recently the times... they
have been changing drastically.

119
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,791
[HOKUSHIN] The struggle
between three Demons

120
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,625
has been shaking our
world to it's foundation.

121
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,500
Just three?

122
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,875
That should be over in no time.

123
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,125
Those are true words.
It should've ended.

124
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,250
The problem exists in that these
three battling Demons are the

125
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,833
three kings with the ruling
power over all of Demon World.

126
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,791
Their hatred for each
other runs very deep,

127
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,500
for several reasons.

128
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,041
But the one issue that brought
about this falling out

129
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,791
is the issue central to
all living things, food.

130
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,958
All three of these Demons

131
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,291
find the satisfaction to
their hunger in human beings.

132
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,208
[HOKUSHIN] One day, one of
these Demon kings spoke...

133
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:33,041
[RAIZEN] I think we should stop
all this feeding on humans.

134
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,500
[HOKUSHIN] But one of the other
kings objected immediately...

135
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,833
[GHOST B] I can't stand to
have anything but human.

136
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,333
And you won't believe it,

137
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,625
but I've already taken steps
to curb my appetite of them.

138
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,833
[HOKUSHIN]
But the third one said,

139
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,500
without a thought
to the contrary...

140
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,833
[GHOST C] We should
eat as many as we want.

141
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,750
They multiply like they're
fighting extinction as it is.

142
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,833
[HOKUSHIN]
It was always this way.

143
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,916
Three Demons in constant
disagreement with one another.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,875
And considering that each
kings' strength was comparable,

145
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,000
the balance among the
three was barely stable.

146
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,875
If two of the Demons
were to fight

147
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,583
and only one emerged alive,

148
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,833
the third would be waiting
in the wings for the single,

149
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,708
unguarded moment.
The moment of victory.

150
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,541
Therefore, they continue
to push in a stand off

151
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:19,041
that has lasted, at this point,
for over five hundred years.

152
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,458
Five hundred years?!
How have they not gone crazy?

153
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,208
Because these three
Demons share the ability

154
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:30,166
to ground their emotions
in caution and patience.

155
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,291
Recently, the balance of
power has been shifting.

156
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,416
The spirit who had
the dissenting opinion

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,583
about feeding on humans
is on the brink of death.

158
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,958
That spirit is the
king of our territory,

159
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,583
the master of war,

160
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,375
Toushin Raizen.

161
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,916
This is your ancestor, Yusuke.

162
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,500
His illness is caused
by severe malnutrition.

163
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,041
Our king hasn't eaten anything
for nearly a thousand years.

164
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,666
He continues to reject the food

165
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,958
no matter who tries
to get him to eat.

166
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,666
We do not understand why he
stopped consuming humans,

167
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,833
knowing it would risk his life.

168
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,875
[SEITEI]
Mm.

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,916
[HOKUSHIN]
However,

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,875
if all of this turmoil
is our King's decision,

171
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,416
we shall obey his every order
to the letter and to the end.

172
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,458
Great. So what do you
want me to do about it?!

173
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,000
If our King dies, then
we shall fight for him.

174
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,208
But in our current conditions,
we are not strong enough.

175
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:36,166
Your ancestor is aware that you
have been to Demon World once.

176
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,333
I remember.

177
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,041
And thank you for
opening an old wound!

178
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,208
[HOKUSHIN] I understand
he had felt at the time,

179
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,083
your power was not great enough.

180
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,666
However, he foresaw you would

181
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,541
become a savior to
us in the fut--

182
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,708
[YUSUKE]
I don't like it.

183
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,916
[gasps]

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,458
[YUSUKE]
You sound desperate.

185
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,708
I bet you'd take
help from anybody.

186
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,000
You know you don't have a
chance at coming out on top,

187
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,041
so you're just
clutching at straws.

188
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,041
To be honest with
you, that is true.

189
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,333
I could not come anywhere
close to the power

190
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,916
of the King and the other
two, and neither could you.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,958
You are far weaker
than I am, right now,

192
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,791
but this, I am sure,
you already know.

193
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,500
This is the reason why we
want you to train yourself

194
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,958
in Demon World.

195
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,583
Something... isn't clicking.

196
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,208
But I can't put
my finger on it.

197
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,500
You're not jerking my chain.
You're telling me the truth?

198
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,291
You must trust us with
what we have spoken.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,916
[YUSUKE] Hmph. There
is one part of your story

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,916
I don't have to trust, but
I can find out on my own.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,875
It won't take much
time out of your day

202
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,166
to see who's
stronger between us.

203
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,416
Like to try, Yusuke?

204
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,208
Now, that's more like it.

205
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,833
[YUSUKE]
I hope you don't think

206
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,791
I'm going to pull
any of my punches.

207
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,875
That is what I would expect.

208
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,000
[KUROKO]
Wait a second, you two.

209
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,625
You can't do this
inside our house.

210
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,958
It's just that

211
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,333
the kids are upstairs
trying to get some sleep.

212
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,583
Don't worry, they can sleep.
We'll take this outside.

213
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,125
Let's go.

214
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,166
[HOKUSHIN]
Hmph.

215
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,833
That was neat!

216
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,041
Have you ever thought of
including a story like that

217
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,458
in one of your books?

218
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,500
That? I don't think so.

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,541
Something like that is
just way too unrealistic.

220
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,500
You think Yusuke will be okay?

221
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,750
[KUROKO]
He'll be fine.

222
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,500
He's an effective
Spirit Detective.

223
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,125
Not to mention, he has the
blood of a Demon World king

224
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,750
coursing through his veins.

225
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,208
Yeah, but didn't it
kind of seem that

226
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,541
blood is just what
those three are after?

[KUROKO gasps]

[KAYKO] I can read you
like a book, Kuwabara.

I know you're hiding
something from me.

[KUWABARA] I told you,
I don't know anything!

Well, I called Yusuke earlier,

232

but he still hadn't
come home yet.

233
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,000
He's missing classes and we've
got mid-terms coming up.

234
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,083
Has he gotten himself
mixed up in another case?

235
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,458
I would expect you to be
honest with me if he has!

[KUWABARA sighs]
No, Kayko.

237

I'd be with him if it was
a case, you know that.

to the preparation
for mid-terms!

over me about studying hard

anything about Urameshi.

want to be in your shoes

if I were less than

I cannot remove this until
I return to Demon World.

leave it and still beat you.

Were I back to my S-class level,
I would have forgone the knife

313
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,000
and could have strangled you
to death with relative ease.

314
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,958
But at most, now I'm
only capable of this.

315
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166
Now you're just being a prick.

316
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,958
I am simply practicing
basic psychology.

317
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,875
Finish the battle
quickly and efficiently,

318
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,500
illustrate an example
of my power,

319
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,583
and my opponent feels defeated.

320
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,750
Although, that has
yet to happen.

321
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,166
So, are you convinced?

322
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,708
Not one bit!

323
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,666
Well, then.

324
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,625
You will just have to come
with us to Demon World.

325
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,166
There I can remove this from
my chest and prove to you...

326
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,333
...that I have not lied.

327
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,791
We can fight for as
long as we wish there,

328
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,583
and you will come
to accept defeat.

329
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,125
That's some mouth on you!

330
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,000
And you're not gonna trap
me into your dirty game.

331
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,458
Dirty game?

332
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:26,250
You can't admit your defeat.
Sounds like a sore loser.

333
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,625
Losing a fight is
something I can handle.

334
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,291
I was talking about
your "BS" story.

335
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:31,916
--[TOUOU growls]
--[SEITEI] Hm.

336
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,750
[HOKUSHIN]
My story?

337
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,833
[YUSUKE] Yeah, I had a
feeling something was off

338
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,333
when I was listening
to you earlier.

339
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,333
And I think I just
now figured out why.

340
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
Would you care to explain it?

341
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,250
You said that my ancestor,
the king of your territory,

342
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,791
was the kind of spirit that
feeds on human beings.

343
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,291
That I did.

344
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,291
[YUSUKE] You also said it's
been about a thousand years

345
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,666
since your king
stopped eating,

346
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,333
and because of
this malnutrition,

347
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,541
he's busy these days
knocking on death's door.

348
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,416
Again, you are correct.

349
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,166
And that three of
you came here to

350
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
abide by the wishes
of your dying king.

351
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,541
All true, but you
have yet to speak

352
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,333
of the story's "dirty" part.

353
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah, but I have a question.

354
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,500
I want to know why
you eat human beings.

355
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,250
[BOTH grunt]

356
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,458
Maybe you need a
minute to answer?

357
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,583
[HOKUSHIN] Heh. No.
You have done good work.

358
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,041
One time I fought a Demon
that ate human beings

359
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,500
and I never forgot the stench.

360
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,333
The same stench
of rotting flesh

361
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,125
that came out of your mouth
when you got close to me.

362
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,166
[HOKUSHIN gasps]

363
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,875
I don't know what you're
up to Hokushin, but nothin'

364
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,958
gets on my nerves more
than a deceptive stranger.

365
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,791
You liar!

366
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,708
Now stand your ground!

367
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,541
Please, wait one second.
Let me explain myself.

368
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,750
I cannot say--

369
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,416
--[YUSUKE yells]
--[HOKUSHIN grunts]

370
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,583
[BOTH gasp]

371
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,416
[HOKUSHIN grunting]

372
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,583
[YUSUKE] And that was
me taking it easy on you.

373
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,583
I'll decide whether
or not to kill you

374
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,750
after I've heard
your real story.

375
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,750
Now! You start talking
or I start punchin'!

376
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,583
[NARRATOR] As Yusuke's
ancestor, a Demon king,

377
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,458
is locked in a life
or death struggle,

378
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,041
these three messengers have
been sent to bring Yusuke

379
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,541
back to Demon World.

380
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,208
But it seems as if Hokushin's
words have been laced with

381
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,666
half-truths and even lies.

382
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,416
Can Yusuke trust any of
what he has been told?

383
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,125
And if so, will a
journey to Demon World

384
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,166
reveal Yusuke's true destiny?

385
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,666
[YUSUKE] As if telling a guy
that his ancestral father is

386
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,000
some kind of people-eating
Demon isn't enough to ruin

387
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,333
an appetite, I can't shake
the feeling that these

388
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,791
three Demon World lackeys are

389
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,083
still hiding something from me.

390
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,166
Anyway, one thing
I know for sure,

391
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,375
something huge is
about to go down.

392
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,416
And I already
know I'm in for it.

393
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,583
I just don't know who's
gonna take the news harder;

394
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,750
Kayko or Kuwabara!

395
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,041
Oh well, somebody's
got to tell them.

396
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:14,875
Here goes nothing!

397
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,041
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho.
