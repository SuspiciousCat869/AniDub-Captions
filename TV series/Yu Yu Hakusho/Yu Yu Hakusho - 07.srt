[VILLAGE MAN 1] Little girl!
Little girl!

159
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,708
Look! She's waking up!

160
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,750
[LITTLE GIRL]
Momma!

161
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,458
Nearly lost my head to
get that one artifact back.

162
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,916
I'm scared to think what
two more of 'em will take.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,375
Hey Yusuke, can't you just admit

164
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,125
it'd be easier to
lean on my shoulder?

165
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,041
Right, can't you admit it'd
be embarrassing?

166
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,958
What's up?

167
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,666
[YUSUKE THINKS]
One of them is here.

168
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,541
If they try to fight me,
I'll be meat on a stick.

169
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,625
[YUSUKE THINKS]
There! It's Kurama!

170
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,791
[KURAMA THINKS] Don't worry.

171
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,416
I have no intention of fighting
you, nor do I intend to flee.

172
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,375
In fact I need
to ask you a favor.

173
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,500
Are you crazy?

174
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,041
Give me three days.

175
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,416
After that I'll gladly return
to you the Forlorn Hope.

176

[YUSUKE]
Ouch!! Okay!!

177
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:45,083
Gee, more alcohol and
I'd need a designated driver!

178
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,583
You know this could
be a trap, Yusuke.

179
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,083
It seems a little too easy.

180
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,875
It's no coincidence that he
asked for three more days.

181
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,625
By then, the moon
will be completely full,

182
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,125
and the powers of the Forlorn
Hope will reach their maximum.

183
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,500
When that happens,

184
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,541
the mirror will reflect
the strongest desire

185
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,291
of whoever looks into it,

186
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,416
and it is said that the
desire will be granted,

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,625
though the user must
give something in return.

188
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,916
Only a few people know
what that something is.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,875
Getting our mirror
may be pointless

190
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,125
if his wish destroys the earth!

191
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,708
But it sounds like he can do
all that by himself, right?

192
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,791
Why would he go out
of his way to meet me?

193
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,416
That's a tough one.

194
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,500
I don't know. Something tells
me I should trust him, Botan.

195
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,291
What in the world
are you saying?

196
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,125
Let's not forget that
his dear old teammate

197
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,125
tried to rip
you into little bits!

198
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,416
When I was walking up, they were
having some sort of argument.

199
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,666
And I don't have a clue why,

200
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,750
but Kurama told the
other two he was leaving.

201
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,541
Sorry, I must withdraw
from this alliance.

202
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,125
Somethin' in his eyes.
He looked more sad than evil.

203
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,208
I wish I knew
more about this guy.

204
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
Yusuke, I've made
us some dinner!

205
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,583
Will you be eating with us
Botan? There's plenty of food!

206
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,083
Oh yes that'd
be lovely! Thank you!

207
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,416
Can't you knock, Mom?

208
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,583
We were in the middle of
an important conversation!

209
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,583
Hey what kind of
conversation can't

210
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,750

Well, uh--It's not
what you think, Mom!

thought she was your girlfriend!

And please be careful, okay?

217
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,791
Right, right I'll be
walking on eggshells.

since you brought
a friend with you.

You'll never get
well without nutrition.

Yes of course.

230

It's just hard to remember
all these things, Suichi.

231

[KURAMA] Well try hard. I need
you to get well quickly.

[YUSUKE THINKS] Suichi?
I thought his name was Kurama!

233

Suichi is the name I've
taken in my human form.

234
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,750
That woman is
my mother, sort of.

235
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,500
My father passed away years ago.

236
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,625
For fifteen years
she has brought me up,

237
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,416
while I have deceived her.

238
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Sorry. I'm not following.

239
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,250
My truest name
is Yoko. I was a fox.

240
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,458
A Spirit Fox, gaining
the powers of a demon

241
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,458
over the hundreds
of years that I lived.

242
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,958
In time I became bored,

243
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,875
and passed my hours learning the
art of breaking codes and seals.

244
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,958
Ancient treasures
were my favorite sport.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
But fifteen years ago
I made a careless mistake,

246
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,250
and was badly injured
by a strong pursuer.

247
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,500
With the last energy I had,
I escaped to the living world

248
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,000
and became the child
of a proud human family,

249
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,000
knowing that if I could
withstand humanity

250
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,375
for ten years,

251
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,500
my spirit energy would
have time to safely recover.

252
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,750
Then, I would escape
without a trace.

253
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,583
I take it something went wrong.

254
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,291
My mother fell ill.

255
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,125
I know it might sound foolish
but I couldn't leave her.

256
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,708
Considering what
she had done for me.

257
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,750
That's when they appeared.

258
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,333
Hiei had somehow tracked
me down, needing my expertise.

259
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,458
And I remembered the
powers of the Forlorn Hope.

260
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,166
Did you know in some species
a child eats its mother?

261
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,875
Let me use the Forlorn Hope
to save the woman's life.

262
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,500
Then I'll accept my punishment.

263
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,250
But why would a monster
do that for a human?

264
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,583
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm guilty.

265
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,541
Maybe I feel like
I am one of those

266
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,750
mother-devouring creatures.

267
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,833
I've caused her great pains.

268
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,125
It's hard raising a child
who thinks you're inferior.

269
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,708
I feel I broke her spirit.
Like maybe,

270
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,291
in some way,
I caused her disease.

271
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:28,166
Why are you telling me all this?

272
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,291
Maybe I just needed
someone to know.

273
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,666
Besides I could tell that
you would trust me.

274
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,166
Suichi! It's your mother!

275

[DOCTOR] She's fallen into
what we call the critical stage.

To be perfectly honest,
your mother is about to die.

Probably tonight. We'll do
what we can. Suichi, I'm sorry.

279
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,333
I have no choice.

280
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,208
You'll use it tonight?
Is that what you mean?

281
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,541
I heard you had to
dish out something

282
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,333
to the Forlorn Hope
in order to make it work.

283
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,541
So do you know
what that something is?

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,625
Yes... life.

285
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,333
Life? What does that mean?

286
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,958
Just like it sounds.

287
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,250
The one who makes the wish at
the same time loses their life.

288
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,375
That's why it's called
the Forlorn Hope.

289
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,083
You should get a dictionary.

290
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,083
Don't you think Yusuke
needs to know that?!

291
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,583
Well it's not
like he's using it.

292
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,000

I ask you to wake from

293
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,666
your sleep and hear my plea.

294
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,250
Reflect my greatest desire,
so that you can make it true.

295
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,291
[FORLORN HOPE]
The happiness of this woman.

296
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,708
Is that what you desire?

297
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,833
It is.

Hey! Can't you hold on a second

299

so we can work things out?

I mean there's gotta be
some other way to do this!

No. There is not.

his wish, isn't that right?

This doesn't make
sense! It's my wish!

Yeah? Well it doesn't make
sense rescuing your mom

315

so she can spend her whole life
mourning the death of her son!

that didn't make a whole
lotta' sense what I just did.

The point was to stop
the whole sad mom thing,

but my mom would have been sad.

Not only is she out
of the critical stage,

it seems she'll make
a full recovery.

turn Keiko into a monster.
