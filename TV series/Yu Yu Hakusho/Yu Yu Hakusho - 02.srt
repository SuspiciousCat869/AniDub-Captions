00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,833
and I have to take
care of this egg, and then--

159
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,833
Yusuke.

160
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey are you hearing me?
This is important!

161
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,708
You're heavy.

162
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,208
I need you to take care
of my body until I come back.

163
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,291
You've gotta tell
them not to cremate me!

164
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
And tell my Mom not
to waste her life away

165
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,958
'cause we're going to be fine!

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,583
Well I guess that's it Keiko.

167
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:50,708
I'm coming back I don't
want to see you cry anymore.

168
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,625
Oh Yusuke!

169
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,166
But he was, I thought,

170
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,708
was all that really
just a dream?!

171
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,083
No I'm sure I felt him.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Atsuko?

173
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,833
Hey are you in there?

174
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,416
Hi Keiko.

175
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,083
Hello, Atsuko.
Did I wake you?

176
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,416
I just had the strangest
dream about Yusuke.

177
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,125
Yusuke was living in some
other world full of Ogres

178
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,000
and he kept knocking them down
until he became their leader.

179
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,000
That sounds
like him, doesn't it?

180
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,625
I dreamed too.

181
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,583
[ATSUKO]
Oh? Was it like mine?

182
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,416
Then maybe it was true.

183
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,791
Yes, maybe.

184
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,916
[BOTAN] This dream your mother
had seems to give her comfort.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,708
And Keiko doesn't
want to take that from her.

186
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,625
Well while she's being comforted
I'm gonna be a barbecue!

187
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,291
Botan! Is there
any other way

188
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,333
to communicate
with living people!

189
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,916
This dream business
isn't going to cut it!

190
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,583
I wonder.

191
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,958
Geez! You're killing me!

192
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,208
I mean call me crazy

193
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,541
but I'd think that as
the messenger of death

194
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,625
you'd know how to do this!

195
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,041
Well if the dream
communication isn't working

196
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,958
there's always the final method!

197
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,708
You always this vague?

198
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
Under the final method
you talk to Keiko

199
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,291
by taking control of
someone else's body.

200
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh right, I've seen
that in movies and stuff.

201
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,916
You mean like a possession?

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,083
Yeah, sort of.

203
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,625
Can I do it with anybody?

204
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,208
Well no, there are some rules.

205
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,833
First, you have to know them,

206
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,625
and second they have
to be unusually

207
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,333
aware of the supernatural.

208
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,833
In that case I'm screwed.
There's no one like that.

209
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,416
Something the matter, Kuwabara?

210
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,541
Do you think
we're being followed?

211
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,166
I'm feeling a chill.

212
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,166
Gee, maybe it's the flu.

213
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,250
I doubt it.

214
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,291
It's just the tickle
feeling kicking in.

215
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,750
The tickle?

216
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,250
That's what we call it when
Kuwabara starts detecting

217
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,000
the presence
of ghosts around us.

218
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,125
[KUWABARA] Yeah... It's true.

219
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,833
I've had the tickle ever
since Kindergarten.

220
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,000
Voices chase me home at night.

221
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,166
Scary old women whisper
things to me in my dreams.

222
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,541
Sometimes they're nice.
Usually they're not!

223
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,625
I think it's 'cause they know
I'm kind of a natural leader.

224
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,166
What a surprise.

225
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,541
That goof actually
has a purpose.

226
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,875
The ghost-monster is behind
me man, it made a noise.

227
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,250
Are you sure?

228
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,375
Is it the scary old
lady with the axe again?

229
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,625
No it sounds more like
a puny low-level ghost,

230
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,041
like a haunted
raccoon or something.

231
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,541
I'll show you puny, you- !!

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,375
You can forget it Botan!

233
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,708
There's no way I'm taking
control of that lame-brain!

234
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,625
Here's my
impression of Yusuke...

235
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,916
..."look at me I'm burning!"

236
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,958
Ready?

237
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,666
Good.

238
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,083
What's wrong, man?

239
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,000
You look a little pale.

240
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,875
Earth to Kuwabara!

241
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,208
All right, he's ready
for the taking!

242
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,750
Okay.

243
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,750
But I've only given you one
hour before the effect wears off

244
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,291
and you're
thrown to the outside.

245
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,250
[BOTAN] A human body
like Kuwabara's

246
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,375
couldn't stand
any longer than that.

247
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,833
If you miss this chance there
probably won't be another one,

248
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,375
so do the best that you can.

249
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,583
I will.

250
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,750
Hey, check me out! I'm inside
Kuwabara! Feeling smooth!

251
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,916
Looks like he's back to normal.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,958
Out of my way punks! Now!

253
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,250
So much, for normal.

254
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,083
[YUSUKE THINKS]
One hour. That's not enough.

255
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,958
Daughter! I need to speak
to your daughter Keiko!

256
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,708
Who do you
think you are, cowboy?

257
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,791
I don't have time to
explain! Where is Keiko?!

258
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,541
[WOMAN] Why
should we tell you?

259
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,166
Because it's me you
guys! I'm Yusuke!

260
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,375
Yusuke was never ugly like you!

261
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,750
And for your information he was
killed in an accident this week!

262
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,333
How could you be so cruel?

263
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,291
We were close family
friends with that boy

264
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,083
and your joke's not appreciated!

265

harass our daughter

on the day of her
best friend's funeral?

I tolerate a lot
of crud in my life

but bad manners
is not on the list!

I might look different
on the outside,

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,208
but inside I'm really--!

Have some respect!

[YUSUKE THINKS] That
could have been better!

274
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,750
We should have special
passwords for times like this!

275

[YUSUKE THINKS]
Dammit! Where could she be?!

277

Well if it isn't Kuwabara from
the Sarayashki Junior High.

278
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,125
Get off me!

00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,291
I know what it looks like

but I'm tellin' you
I'm not Kuwabara!

No I remember that face
and I owe it some bruises!

Fine just wait
'til after sunset!

You can hit me all you like!

00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,958
Sorry, but I don't
take requests.

285
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,458
Oh? Then take this.

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,208
Try that with me!

287

Okay, now I'm pissed!

Man that hurt!

I didn't think anyone
could throw punches

Yusuke Urameshi!

Darn, I'm giving
Kuwabara a good name.

292

Kuwabara, it's time for
me to even the score.

293
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,333
Yeah, me too!

294
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,333
And me!

295
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,666
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Unbelievable!

296
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,041
Does Kuwabara pick a fight
with everyone he meets?!

297
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,041
Attack!

298

Can't you understand?

I don't, have time,

for this!!

Well that was fun.

But probably not so good
on the time situation.

Here we go! I think those are
Keiko's friends! What a save.

I hope Keiko will be okay soon.

00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,291
You've found her,

317
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,708
but now you've got
to convince her, quick,

318
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,000
that you're not just
some ugly weird guy

319
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,625
with bruises on his face!

320
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,958
No time, no time.

321
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,791
Okay, I've known
her all my life.

322
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,916
There's gotta be something
between us that only I would do.

323
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,708
Yeah.

324
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,208
Keiko! Nice uniform!

325
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,250
They're so squishy!

326
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,250
Yusuke you jerk!

327
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,791
Oh! Who the heck are you?

328
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,958
I'm exactly who you thought
I was Keiko. I'm Yusuke.

329
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,500
I don't care what
any tough guy says,

330
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,125
your punches hurt the most.

331
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,500
[laughing]

332
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,833
Don't tease me Yusuke.
Is it really you?

333
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,833
It's too strange.
Why do you look like that?

334
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,666
I borrowed somebody's body,
but only for an hour!

335
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,000
I know this is weird,
but you have to believe!

336
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,541
Whether or not I believe
isn't the question!

337
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,916
I knew it was you from
the first time you spoke!

338
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,750
I know.

339
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,708
[KEIKO] And it's not just your
stupid gags, or how you laugh--

340
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,083
There's ways you move

341
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,666
and speak that in a hundred
years I wouldn't forget.

342
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,166
Whoa now.

343
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't cry. We'll save the
mushy stuff for another day.

344
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,333
Then tell me what's
going on. What's next?

345
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,875
Next I'm going
to give you my message

346
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,500
before this dummy
gets his body back.

347
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
Which, by the way,
happens in about a minute!

348
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,208
I guess you can think
of this as a rental car

349
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,333
and I'm about to
lose my license!

350
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,500
I'll say this as
straight as I can.

351
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,958
I'm taking this
test to get back,

352
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,250
and I'm trying hard not to fail!

353
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,500
So just trust me and take
care of my body until then.

354
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,958
And tell my Mom she's
got to stop the funeral!

355
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,416
I know I've been a bum to you
at times but please wait for me.

356
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,375
I will, I'd wait forever Yusuke.

357
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,458
[YUSUKE]
Okay, Botan I'm ready.

358
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,125
Uh that's funny, I thought
I was with the guys.

359
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,625
Apparently not!

360
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,375
Wow! This girl must really
have the hots for me!

361
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,333
Sorry about that.

362
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,416
Nah, it's okay.
I prob'ly deserved it.

363
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,708
[banging on the door]

364
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,791
[KEIKO] Atsuko! Please open
the door! Atsuko!

365
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:48,125
I have to tell you! About
Yusuke! He might be coming back!

366
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,875
He already has!

367
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,500
I opened up his coffin
again because well,

368
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
I was going to smack him one
more time for leaving me,

369
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,416
but then I saw.

370
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,291
Yusuke's cheeks have some color!

371
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,583
His skin is slightly warm!

372
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,291
His heart is beating.
It's slow, but.

373
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,625
My boy's alive!

374
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,708
All things considered,

375
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,708
I think I'd call this quite
a successful day, Yusuke.

376
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,750
Yeah.

377
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,375
Hey I think it's feeding now.

378
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,000
I only did good-natured things
today, don't you think so?

379
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,166
I don't know Yusuke,

380
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,375
you did beat up a
lot of kids as I recall.

381
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,625
[YUSUKE] Okay, listen up!

382
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,666
I've got to answer
a tough question:

383
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,583
What happens when your
rival shows some backbone

384
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,958
and takes a beating
for his friends?

385
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,500
I mean I'm all for surprises--

386
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,125
But who would have thought
Kuwabara had a code of honor?

387
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,666
See, Mr. Akashi is
threatening to kick him

388
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,625
and his friends out of school
if he doesn't clean up his act.

389
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,041
So what do I do now?
Help my rival?

390
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,000
If it's between him
and that no-good teacher,

391
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,583
I think I might.

392
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,708
I just hope that Spirit Beast
doesn't hatch and eat me first!

393
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,750
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
