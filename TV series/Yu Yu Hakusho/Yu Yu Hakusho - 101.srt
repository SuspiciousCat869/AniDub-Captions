one of the ruling lords
of Demon World.

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,583
While in another fortress,

5
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,916
Hiei confronted the pain
of his past to defeat Shigure,

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,208
the surgeon who
implanted his Jagan Eye.

7
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,583
With Hiei's victory,

8
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,833
he has won the favor
of the second lord, Mukuro.

9
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,458
But there is a
third ruler, Yomi,

10
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,875
and he's invited an
old friend to join his side

11
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,916
in the battle over Demon World.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,458
That friend's name:
Suichi Minamono.

[KURAMA]
Yes, Mother, it's me.

17
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,125
I'm here.

18
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,625
Don't worry, everything's fine.

19
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,625
Yes, I'm feeding myself well.

20
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,208
Earthquake?

21
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,958
No, I didn't feel anything.

22
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,666
We must have only gotten
small tremors in town.

23
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,833
I told you, Mother.

24
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,833
You needn't worry about me.

25
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,166
Stay on your trip as long
as you want--honestly.

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,583
You deserve it.

27
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,833
And don't worry about
the house, it's in good hands.

thanks to a clever patch
I made before leaving.

00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,375
She still thinks
I'm at the house.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,666
[KURAMA] On a warm day
in July, my mother,

32
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,791
after raising me on her own

33
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,875
for most of my
human life, remarried.

34
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,833
The wedding was small, with only
family and close friends.

35
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,125
She looked happy.

36
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,625
I'm sorry I'm missing it.

37
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,291
Give your mom a toast for me.

38

Cheers!

39
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:22,041
[KURAMA] Yusuke left two months
before, but I was glad he cared.

40
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,916
I have far from forgotten
the risk he took

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,875
to allow both my mother
and myself to live.

[AIRPORT AGENT

43
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,541
[KURAMA] My wedding gift to
them was an all-expenses-paid

44
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,375
overseas honeymoon for
the full month of August.

45
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,291
I sort of forced it on them
for my own convenience.

46
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,250
[KURAMA] I love you, too,
Mother. Take care.

47
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,250
[KURAMA] And now, two months
after Yusuke and Hiei,

48
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,000
and on the condition it would
only last through August,

49
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,958
I make my own trip
to Demon World,

50
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,833
to serve as an
advisor to Yomi's army.

[YOMI]
Hello, Kurama.

59
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,708
It's been far too long
since I've seen you.

60
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,500
I don't appreciate the pun.

61
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,583
And what sort
of welcome is that?

62
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,875
I came all this way to help you,
not to be attacked.

63
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,291
Don't be cross.

64
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,458
I wasn't entirely
sure it was you.

65
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,458
Your energy feels so much
different than it did before.

66
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,333
I have to be sure I'm
not advised by the wrong man.

67
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,708
So you sent them to identify me.

68
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,541
That's playing it
very cautious, Yomi--

69
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,708
A trait you never had
when I knew you.

70
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,375
You're not the only one
who's gone through changes.

71
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,333
I can't afford
to be reckless now.

72
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,458
Mukuro and Raizen
have had centuries

73
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,375
to perfect the keeping of power.

74
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,458
Now that I have an equal share,

75
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,916
they'll take any chance
to dethrone me.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
A thousand years
is a long time.

77
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,750
For some things, it's not.

78
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,291
Forgive the attack,

79
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,750
but if you were as strong
as I heard you'd become,

80
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,125
it wouldn't have been a threat.

And it wasn't.

Well, I don't pick up
any special Demon energy

In fact,
he smells half human.

96
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,166
You sure you want him
gracing our table?

97
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,500
[YOMI]
You heard what I said.

98
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,000
[YOUDA] Hmph.
Well, come on, then.

99
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
[YOUDA] Look to the screen,
if you would.

100
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,500
We'll start with a simple graph.

101
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,291
I've charted
the military power

102
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,041
of each of the three
territories in Demon World.

103
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,250
Now the numbers are relative.

104
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,875
They don't mean
anything material.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,208
If you don't
understand any of that,

106
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,333
take a math class
on your own time.

107
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,791
Now, we'll chart a
projection of the same powers

108
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,541
one year from today.

109
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,458
That has Raizen's
strength going down to zero.

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,208
That's wishful thinking.

111
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,375
And reckless!

112
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,708
Not so.

113
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,166
Because one year from today,
Raizen will be dead.

114

[thunder crashes]

115
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,166
Raizen's ridiculous
hunger strike

116
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,416
has brought his body
to critical condition.

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,791
He cannot last through the year.

118
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,750
This comes from
highly dependable sources.

119
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,833
[YOUDA] With Raizen gone,
his empire will collapse.

Lord Yomi and Mukuro
will be in a dead heat.

121
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,041
Our strategy should be
to incorporate the defectors

122
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,875
from Raizen's army into our own,

123
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,000
to tip the scale in our favor.

124
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Well...

125
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,125
Your tactics are
by the books, Youda.

126
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,750
Kurama, I'd like
to hear your opinion now.

127
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,708
Yes, I think we all would.

128
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,125
[COUNCIL A]
Lord Yomi spoke well of you,

129
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,000
and now brings you
to our elite table.

130
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,208
We want to see how
resourceful you are.

Yes, we'd just hate for you
to be a disappointment to him.

132
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,166
I'm confused.
The power of each territory

133
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,666
simply mirrors its ruler.

134
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,083
I'd like to see individual stats

135

of the first and second
strongest in each land.

136
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,291
Strength of the leader
is strength of the team.

But if you need proof,

138
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,708
I can show you stats
of every single warrior.

161
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,416
Let's assume for a moment that
your information is complete,

162
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,708
and Raizen's army will
collapse upon his death,

163
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,291
leaving a two-way fight.

164
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,791
Because Mukuro and
Yomi's powers are identical,

165
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,666
the deciding factor would
normally be the strength

166
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,208
of the number twos...

167
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,500
But in this case they're all too
weak to make any difference.

168
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,083
And if they're the second best,

169
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,750
logic follows that all warriors
besides the lords are useless.

170
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,250
The only thing that
Mr. Youda's intelligence shows

171
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,916
is that we know nothing...

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,250
Not until the number twos
are as strong as the lords.

173
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,416
Hmph. So our only
tactic is no tactic?

174
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,333
Sounds like you've been
wasting Lord Yomi's time.

175
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,875
Not at all, because the whole
balance is about to change.

176
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,041
What?

177
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,791
As I've explained,
those second in command

178
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,666
will determine
who prevails here,

179
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,166
and in half a year
they will all be replaced.

180
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,416
You damned fool!

181
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,708
[SHACHI]
Watch your tongue!

182
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,750
These hierarchies of power
have survived here

183
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,916
for five hundred years,
unchallenged by any Demon!

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,583
And only a sword
will make them change.

185
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
[COUNCIL B]
Shachi, control yourself.

186
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,500
He's a visitor here,
and doesn't understand our ways.

187
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,708
[SHACHI]
He will soon enough.

188
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,750
[YOMI] Now that was the
most stirring conference

189
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,291
we've had in years.

190
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,541
You should have seen the way
Shachi was staring at you

191
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,541
as you spoke.

192
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
The expression was undeniable.

193
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,916
He doesn't simply despise you;

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,875
he's already
plotting your death.

195
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
For a blind man,
you certainly have good eyes.

196
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,291
[YOMI] I heard his
quickened heartbeat.

197
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,750
Felt the heat from his eyes

198
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,625
as the filled blood vessels
turned them red.

199
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,083
Losing my eyesight was in
part what made me stronger.

200
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,666
But now, let me guess what
you foresee in half a year...

201
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,208
[yelling]

202
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,750
[YOMI]
In the land of Raizen,

203
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,625
his part Demon, part human
offspring, Yusuke Urameshi,

204
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,541
trains relentlessly,
and looks to take control

205
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,666
of Raizen's army,
thus preventing its collapse.

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,750
[YOMI]
While in Mukuro's fortress,

207
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,625
your friend Hiei has
improved drastically,

208
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,291
and from a few vague reports,

209
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,875
has garnered rare attention
from that soulless tyrant.

210
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,333
Urameshi, Hiei, and yourself

211
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,375
will be the number twos
in just half a year from now.

212
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,583
Isn't that what
you believe, Kurama?

213
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,083
"The second in command is key
in determining who prevails."

214
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,166
That's what you've
always believed.

215
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,250
[YOMI]
So... Friend...

216
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,833
I think now's a
good time to address

217
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,083
the other reason
I invited you.

218
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,875
After all, it seems out of order
to discuss your future here

219
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,708
before you meet him.

220
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,708
[YOMI]
Here we are.

221
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,000
Can you guess
who's behind this door?

222
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,291
The one I've searched
for all these years,

223
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,125
he who took my light.

224
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,958
That's my favorite saying
for what he did to me.

225
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,458
Maybe not.

226
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,833
You said blindness helped
you to gain your throne.

227
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,875
Right.

228
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,708
What's wrong?

229
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,125
Your heart is beating so quickly
and your eyes are pointed down.

230
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,500
Look up.

231
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,833
Yes, get a good view
of him at the way he is today.

232
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,166
[YOMI] His decay has become
much worse the last few days.

233
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,750
He hardly speaks anymore.

234
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,375
It hurts him too much.

235
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,208
It was one thousand years ago
when he fought against me.

236
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,166
Still, I can only
see him as he was.

237
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,333
[YOMI] In that distant epoch,
our world was opposite.

238
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,250
You were the leader,
and I, your right hand man.

239
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,083
I still had my eyes.

240
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,083
[YOMI]
We were greedy, you and I.

241
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,083
We wanted to make
ourselves known,

242
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,625
and carve out our own territory.

243
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,708
But to be a lord
requires power and wealth,

244
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,083
and to gain both,
we became bandits.

245
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,916
We led a legendary horde,

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,083
raiding all corners
of Demon World

247
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,375
for its most precious treasures.

248
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,666
I was hotheaded then, obstinate
and thirsty for action.

249
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,958
I often forced us
into confrontation

250
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,791
when you favored stealth.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,666
Soon, I disobeyed
you altogether,

252
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,041
leading our best men into the
most well guarded strongholds,

253
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,083
costing many of their lives.

254
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,416
I didn't care.

255
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I was selfish and reckless.

256
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,166
I just wanted the
quickest way to power.

257
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,416
I could never understand
your patience.

258
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,208
[yelling]

259
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,041
[growling]

260
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
[laughing]

261
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,833
You should watch it, Yomi.

262
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,583
Your foul character
will be the death of you.

263
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,000
[YOMI]
Looking back,

264
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,875
I don't know why you
saved me and kept me onboard,

265
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,583
except that we were friends.

266
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,708
We were so opposite.

267
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,416
You were cruelly ambitious,
but in a different way,

268
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,958
calculating, always
plotting three steps ahead.

269
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,666
It must have been difficult for
you to make your careful plans

270
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,750
with such a loose
cannon at your side.

271
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,083
Yet still you trusted me,

272
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,875
and it didn't take me long
to waste that again.

273
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,916
[YOMI]
A few weeks after my mistake,

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,541
I heard news of another fortress
that was impossibly defended,

275
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,625
but held unspeakable treasures.

276
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,458
I disobeyed you again.

277
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,166
When I arrived,
the castle was deserted.

278
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,833
That news was a lie!

279
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,625
Tell me what you're after!

280
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,791
I have no qualms with you!

281
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,708
[YOMI] The entire fight,
he never told me who he was,

282
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,041
or why he attacked.

283
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,250
He was strong.

284
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,541
At least,
compared to me at that time.

285
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,750
[GENWAKU KYOUSHU]
Look upon me!

286
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,416
[screaming]

287
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
Life's more
important than the reward.

288
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,250
[YOMI groaning in pain]

289
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,250
[YOMI]
Wait!

290
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,791
Who are you?
What does that mean?

291
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,666
[yelling]

292
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,250
[YOMI] "Life is more important
than the reward."

293
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,125
My only consolation from the
creature who took away my light.

294
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,666
I didn't understand anything,
or how I could live blindly.

295
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,166
I could only wait for you
to save me, as always.

296
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,958
But this time, you never came.

297
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,291
[YOMI] And until now,
ten full centuries later,

298
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,208
I did not meet
you again, Kurama,

299
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,333
didn't even know
where you were.

300
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,833
Why is that?

301
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,000
I resolved that the only
way to answer that question

302
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,625
was to find the
creature that blinded me.

303
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,708
And so I searched
these one thousand years,

304
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,208
but now that I have him,
have yet to learn a thing.

305
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,000
[chuckles]

306
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,291
You find something amusing?

307
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,375
You, Kurama.

308
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,875
Your heartbeat
returned to normal

309
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,000
the moment you saw
the awful physical state

310
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,291
this killer was in, as if
he were no longer a threat.

311
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,125
[YOMI]
You. Wake up.

312
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,333
Please, Your great Lordship.

313
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,916
Take my life from me.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,625
I can't take
this pain any longer.

315
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,708
Very well, Demon.

316
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,375
I shall grant you your wish.

317
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,083
You have suffered
more than enough.

318
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,958
But you must
answer my one question

319
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,416
your fear has
kept you from saying.

320
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,416
Who ordered you that day to
ambush us and forfeit my life?

321
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,625
Okay... he had cold eyes...

322
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,666
They were such cold,
terrifying eyes...

323
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,625
And silver hair...

324
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,666
He was Yoko... Kurama.

325
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,750
[growling, yelling]

326
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,208
There it is.

327
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,625
Of course I long suspected it,
but I didn't want to believe.

328
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,875
I should tell you right now

329
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,333
that I bear no grudge
against you, old friend.

330
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,583
In the enterprise of power,
you made a business decision.

331
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,708
Thinking back,
I was a liability.

332
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,083
Rash. Disobedient.
I lost countless men.

333
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,500
I would have tried
to kill me, too.

334
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,750
What do you want from me?

335
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,166
Precisely as my
Spirit of Words told you.

336
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,083
I want you to assist me
any way that you can...

337
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,958
Just as I assisted you
in the past,

338
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,625
despite my mistakes
of immaturity.

339
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,041
I learned much
from you, Kurama.

340
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,250
I've tried to model
myself after you.

341
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,541
I only brought up the past
so we could move beyond it.

342
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,958
And yet... if I say no?

343
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,041
Your human mother is
on a plane right now.

344
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,583
No, Yomi...

345
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,083
At least according
to the schedule

346
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,750
my agents have supplied.

347
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,666
That was nice of you, by the
way, to give them that trip.

348
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,333
[YOMI]
I just hope it doesn't crash.

349
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,375
Middle-aged newlyweds
dying on their honeymoon

350
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:53,625
is a bland topic for even
your lousy human TV shows.

351
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,375
You bastard...

352
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,166
[YOMI] Quite a life you had
after my hit was botched--

353
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,708
Reverting to your fox form
and venturing into Spirit World

354
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,041
for a solitary life of thieving,

355
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,375
until injuries forced you
to hide in yet another world,

356
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,458
possessing an
unborn human child.

357
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,958
And there, after fourteen
years of softening up,

358
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,000
your human mother fell sick.

359
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,875
To save her,
you teamed with other Demons

360
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,375
to burglarize
Spirit World again.

361
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,625
That led you to
a debt with Urameshi,

362
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,583
which led you to
Demon World fighting Sensui,

363
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,333
which in turn led you to me.

364
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,416
And all because
of mommy dearest.

365
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,916
[YOMI]
Collecting information...

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,083
Another lesson you taught me.

367
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,416
It showed me how much
she meant to you.

368
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,583
Earlier today you said
you didn't recognize me...

369
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,791
A smart lie to disguise
how much you knew.

370
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,416
[YOMI chuckling]

371
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,750
I've angered you greatly,

372
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,708
and yet your mind's
already considering

373
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,375
our every encounter calmly,

374
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,125
trying to sniff out
an advantage.

375
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,500
While others would be
overcome with real emotions,

376
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,583
blinded by their rage,

377
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,250
you're methodically planning
how to save your mom.

378
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,166
And no one could say if that's
because you actually love her,

379
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,250
or because you don't want
anything to handicap

380
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,666
your control of the situation.

381
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,583
That's cold,
and very threatening.

382
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,708
Very soon all of Demon
World will fall into chaos.

383
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,333
And that's when I'll
need your calm and cruelty,

384
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,041
your ability to
think without emotion.

385
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,375
Join me, Kurama.
Help me unify them all.

386
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,625
[NARRATOR]
In a brutal power play,

387
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,750
Yomi has forced Kurama
to serve as his advisor.

388
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,833
But the alliance
is hardly stable,

389
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,916
for the seeds of hatred
lie between them.

390
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,958
[YUSUKE] And I thought I was
having fun beating up monks!

391
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,625
Who can tell me
they don't love q. t.

392
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,083
with Kurama and his
thousand-years of darkness?

393
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,916
And yeah, in case you
didn't see that last shot,

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,666
it's only gettin' better.

395
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,458
Can Kurama work with Yomi
and save his mom?

396
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,791
And don't think fish-face forgot
those rips at the meeting.

397
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,000
Of course, don't think
Kurama forgot

398
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,250
how to turn into a certain
silver haired fox, either.

399
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,583
It's showdown time,

400
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,916
on the next ass-kickin'
episode of Yu Yu Hakusho.
