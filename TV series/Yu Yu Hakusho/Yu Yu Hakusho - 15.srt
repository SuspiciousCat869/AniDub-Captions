00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,125
Spirit World Intelligence

158
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,125
virtually forgot
this place existed.

159
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,666
What do you know?

160
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,583
Let's just say that when
you see their bodies

161
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,000
you may be very surprised.

162
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,000
[GENBU] Terrified.
Isn't that more like it?

163
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,791
Who said that?!

164
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:46,958
[Genbu laughs menacingly]

165
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,958
[GENBU] There's a door
behind you. Please take it.

166
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,416
Ladies first.

167
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,791
[Genbu laughs menacingly]

168
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,625
[GENBU]
Welcome, trespassers.

169
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,833
Okay I'm surprised!

170
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,916
I am Genbu of the
Four Saint Beasts.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,083
Do you have a request
before you die?

172
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, tell me how a beast
is a saint. I'm lost.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This stairwell is the
only way to the castle tower.

174
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,708
You can either defeat me
and go up on your own,

175
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,250
or be dragged there once
you've stopped breathing.

176
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,708
Why don't you all
attack me at once?

177
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,875
Then the last one
left won't feel lonely.

178
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,125
He's a rock Urameshi!

179
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,250
How are we gonna fight
against a talking rock?!

180
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,083
I will fight him.

181
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,333
Are you sure?

182
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,625
It would be ill-advised
for all of us to attack

183
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,291
without first
knowing his power.

184
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,000
Besides, I can hardly let Hiei

185
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,750
get all the credit
for this mission, now can I?

186
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,875
You want to die one by one?
I can do that too.

187
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,500
Hey, wouldn't we be better
off trying to lure him back

188
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,166
to that drop-down
ceiling or something!

189
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,166
Obviously you are
underestimating Kurama.

190
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,666
Do you know why I chose
him to be my partner?

191
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,500
To avoid fighting him myself.

192
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,833
[HIEI] Watch.
He's more cutthroat than

193
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,125
I am when it comes to battle.

194
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,833
And unbelievably precise.

195
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,750
I don't know guys,
he's still a talking rock.

196
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,916
Sir, the first move is yours.

197
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,125
Hey! Stone-man's doing
somethin' freaky with his tail!

198
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,166
Kurama!

199
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,958
Thanks to my
body's structure,

200
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,958
I can become one
with any type of rock.

201
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,666
With a little rearranging,
I can make any stone my tail.

202
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,458
Yeah, we're in trouble!

203
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,083
And since this whole
chamber is made of stone,

204
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,750
I have you surrounded.
There's nowhere to run!

205
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,083
Oh man! Now he's wounded!

206
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,791
Maybe we should help.

207
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,166
There is no need,
I've been hurt.

208
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,958
But he will not take
me by surprise again.

209
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,666
Wait until you see the
full extent of my power.

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,416
Then you won't be so confident.

211
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,166
He's gonna put
himself into the floor!

212
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,500
Do something Kurama!!

213
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,083
Now he could be anywhere.

214
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,833
I can't even since
Genbu's energy!

215
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,333
Same old trick.

216
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,458
Watch for his tail!

217
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,791
He's getting attacked
from both sides!

218
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,000
Where'd that freak go now?!

219
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,208
[Genbu laughs]

220
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,208
[GENBU] You'll never defeat
me by just running away!

221
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes Genbu,
I believe you are right.

222
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,708
A flower?

223
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,791
Now, that's weird.

224
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,666
If he's trying
to win the beast over

225
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,500
I don't think
that's a good idea.

226
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,875
[Hiei chuckles]

227
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,958
It's no ordinary flower.

228
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,791
[harp music]

229
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,375
[KURAMA]
Rose Whip!

230
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,583
Well, everything's
coming up roses.

231
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,708
It smells girly,
I don't think I like it.

232
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,458
Oh sure, I guess he should
be a tough guy like you

233
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,041
and be obsessed with kittens.

234
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,083
Shut up!

235
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,583
[KOENMA]
Oh, it's Gorgeous!

236
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,458
I remember hearing about
this kind of weapon.

237
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,375
Don't Animal Spirits use it?

238
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,583
[KOENMA]
Mm-hm.

239
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,000
[Genbu laughs]

240
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,000
[GENBU] You still don't
understand your problem!

241
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,916
What good will a
fancy whip do you

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,083
if you can't tell where I am?

243
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,625
Yes, not being able to
find you is a problem.

244
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,375
[GENBU] You just can't
be scared, can you?

245
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,916
Well, I'll soon change that!

246
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
Found you!

247
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,458
It's over, the thorns
on Kurama's whip

248
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,291
can slice through any substance,
including solid stone.

249
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,041
Rose Whiplash!

250
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,416
How did you find me?

251
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,791
Your smell,

252
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,083
after filling the room
with the rose's sweet aroma,

253
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,458
your putrid odor
was easy for me to find.

254
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,000
Well that's no fair.

255
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,083
Why isn't that any of my
fights end that quick?

256
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,541
Beat him in one blow!
Now that's what I call a wimp!

257
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,458
You idiots,
it only looked easy

258
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,083
because Kurama
was the one fighting.

259
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,416
If you had fought you would have
died in under a minute.

260
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,833
Why does everything you say

261
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,875
make me want to
bash your face in?!

262
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,041
Listen! I just
happened to place third

263
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,833
in Master Genkai's
Fighting Tournament!

264
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,958
The only ones who beat me were
Yusuke and an evil monster!

265
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,166
What's you point?

266
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,708
You little-- !!!

267
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:58,416
Children!! Would you mind
saving it for the bad guys!

268
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,458
[KUWABARA] Okay.
But he started it.

269
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,666
I guess now we
go up the stairs.

270
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,416
[KURAMA] It seems
my fight is not over.

271
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,375
Who's beaten?

272
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,375
Not me!

273
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,583
Uh guys I think he's putting 
himself back together?!

274
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,625
You can disassemble
me all you like.

275
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,208
I'll come back
together every time!

276
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,708
Actually, it makes
for a very nice attack!

277
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
Rose Whiplash!!

278
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,000
Right in the head!
Let's see him come back now!

279
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,791
[GENBU]
Want to try again?

280
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,875
Okay, that was luck!

281
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's end this. How'd you
like to be stoned to death?!

282
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,041
They're coming back!

283
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,583
Kurama!!

284
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,958
What the hell's he doing?!
He's gonna get killed!

285
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,833
[GENBU] You're not even
fighting back now.

286
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,125
Those blows must
have made you insane.

287
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,958
Yes, I'm sure of it. Now
you're laughing at nothing.

288
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,750
[GENBU] Wait! How'd
you get on the ceiling?!

289
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,625
What's wrong?!

290
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,708
I've heard of brass balls,
but come on!

291
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,708
Yeah I'd like to
see him use a toilet!!

292
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,875
What did you do to me?!

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,250
I took this.

294
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,291
What's that?!

295
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,958
[KURAMA] I believe this
is the equivalent

296
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,666
of the hypothalamus
portion of your brain.

297
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,833
It regulates all the
functions of your body,

298
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,458
including the process of
putting you back together.

299
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,583
But--

300
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,458
[KURAMA] It seems to relay an
energy signal when you separate,

301
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,541
making it very easy to find.

302
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,750
You-Can't-Do this!!
Give it back to me!!!

303
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,208
Give it back!!!

304
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,250
Farewell.

305
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,083
I don't think he liked that!

306
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,000
Good work Kurama!!

307
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,791
[YUSUKE] Are you okay?

308
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,958
If Kurama is injured we're
going to have some problems.

309
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,666
I'm sorry, Yusuke.

310
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,875
Nah... You've earned
yourself a break anyway!

311
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,708
Yeah, I'll handle the next one.

312
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,125
[NARRATOR] Thanks to the
clever moves of Kurama,

313
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,958
the mighty Genbu
has been destroyed.

314
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,375
But somewhere in the twists
and turns of Maze Castle,

315
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,791
three Saint Beasts
still remain.

316
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,791
[BYAKKO]
Please. Let me go next.

317
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,541
[Byakko laughs menacingly]

318
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,416
[BOTAN ]
Botan here.

319
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,958
While I'm fighting the Makai
Insects back on Earth,

320
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,583
Yusuke and the boys must
walk a thin line of peril

321
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,000
as they struggle their way

322
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,041
through the heart
of Maze Castle.

323
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,125
As the situation over
a collapsing bridge

324
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,541
threatens their lives,

325
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,250
Kuwabara will reveal some
surprising new abilities.

326
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,125
And I'm certain
he'll need them all,

327
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,916
as he faces off against
the next Saint Beast himself!

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,083
This ones name is Byakko and
he's a ravenous white tiger.

329
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,125
You'll be dying to see
him in the next episode

330
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,208
on Yu Yu Hakusho.
