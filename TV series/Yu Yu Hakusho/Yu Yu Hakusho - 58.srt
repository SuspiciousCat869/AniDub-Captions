00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,333
[HIEI]
Right.

158
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
Nice.

159
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,625
And Bui unloads like an angry
toddler in a therapy session!

160
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,125
But Hiei is
absolutely unaffected!

161
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,041
Insane! Hiei has actually
sucked away Bui's Battle Aura,

162
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,958
the secret of all his power!

163
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,708
Come now.
Can't you even test me?

164
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,041
Both are outside the ring!
I'll start the count, uh...

165
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,500
Finish.

166
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,500
The first time
Toguro beat me,

167
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,291
he told me I had the
potential to get stronger.

168
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,666
He was right.

169
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,625
It took someone like him to
show me how weak I was.

170
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,958
[BUI] He kept me at
his side while I trained

171
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,583
hard to kill him.

172
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,666
And I know I reached my max.

173
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,083
But every time I would
get stronger, so would he.

174
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,666
I'm sure it was just
bait to keep me improving.

175
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,291
[JURI]
Four!

176
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,916
[BUI] Now you've beaten
me. What's the point.

177
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,583
Come on, hurry up and kill me.

178
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,583
No... if you want
to die, kill yourself.

179
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,750
Eight! Nine!

180
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't take orders,
especially from those I beat.

181
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,666
And ten!

182
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,333
The second fight is over!
Hiei takes the point!

183
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,125
Did you hear that, Toguro?!

184
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,875
We're lookin' at
a tie ball game!!

185
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,958
Uh, wait, this is a
no-dragon-man area okay?

186
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,333
Really awesome, Hiei.

187
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,666
Yeah, awesome.

188
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,375
Uh, why don't you go
about twenty yards that way

189
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,041
and fight the rest of them!

190
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,416
That's against the
rules now, you cretin.

191
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,750
Besides, my attack expired.

192
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,416
Expired?

193
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,708
I don't know if your
brains can imagine it,

194
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,666
but this attack drained
a good deal of my energy.

195
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,791
I'll require some
hibernation to get it back.

196
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,958
Think you can manage
finding a safe place

197
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,041
for my body where it
won't get stepped on?

198
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,541
Did you say
hibernate?

199
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,625
Fancy word
for being lazy.

200
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,791
Listen to me as closely
as you can, you two.

201
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,958
I'm trusting you against
my better instincts

202
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,000
only because I
have no other choice.

203
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,291
Take care of
the Toguro Brothers.

204
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:12,958
If I wake up and we've lost,
I swear I'll kill you all!

205
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,291
That's Hiei for you.

206
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,875
He faints but he still
has time for threats!

207
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,916
Hold on. So nothing
we do will wake him up?!

208
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,166
[KOENMA] Not long ago
he was on streak of terror.

209
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,291
If he'd had this power then,
it would have been disastrous.

210
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,833
Now it's our asset.

211
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,625
Can I give him a moustache?

212
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,833
[NARRATOR] By finally realizing
the power of the dragon,

213
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,916
Hiei has won the second
match and tied the final round.

214
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,333
Now only the Toguro
Brothers and Sakyo remain.

215
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,708
[SHIZURU] Hi. It's Shizuru.
You know. The older sister.

216
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,375
Well, after an excessive
display of strength

217
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,375
by the guy with
eighties sunglasses,

218
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,333
baby bro gets forced into
fighting the elder Toguro.

219
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,958
You know, he's the freaky
one with straggly hair.

220
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,500
My brother unveils
his new sword,

221
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,833
but straggly hair
can do anything,

222
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,250
and when he puts
on a puppet show

223
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,041
to reveal the
truth about Genkai,

224
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,291
well, there's a good chance my
brother will screw things up,

225
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,541
and everyone will die.

226
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,250
That's next time
on Yu Yu Hakusho.
