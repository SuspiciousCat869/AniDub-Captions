thousand questions and answers?

158
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,500
That's a lot of
game-play, pal.

159
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,541
No wonder you never
answer your phone.

160
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,041
He's a video game expert.

161
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,583
And you should see how smooth
he is with the ladies!

162
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,791
Question Number 1
was: "In the Amazon,

163
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,625
the Araguari river has a
world-famous natural phenomenon

164
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,958
that causes water
to flow upstream.

165
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,333
What is this called?"

166
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,500
[KAITOU] Did I mention?
I don't need a handicap.

167
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,666
Concentrate. Question
two's coming up!

168
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,208
[KING YAMA] Centuries
of recuperation.

169
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,750
You realize you'll
be left unarmed?

170
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,125
[KOENMA]
Yes, Father.

171
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,250
So it's become that severe?
Then I have no choice.

172
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,250
You have permission.

173
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,458
Thank you, Dad.
I'll do what I must.

174
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,333
The floor's so cold in there.
I was scared I'd get frostbite.

175
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,000
Then you should put on a shirt.
Now, I have my dad's permission.

176
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:19,583
Right.

177
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,291
So I'm leaving, Ogre.
Maybe for keeps.

178
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,916
But George wants to go too.

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,166
[KOENMA] Don't start that
again. Just say goodbye.

180
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,291
No, sir!

181
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,125
But what about
our progress?

182
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,625
[ARCADE VOICE] You're right!
Five in a row!

183
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,083
Kaitou, five points!
Goblin King, zero!

184
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,125
All right! Five
more and it's over.

185
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,541
Killer job, Kaitou.

186
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,875
I didn't even
know the answers

187
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,833
when I got to read
the whole question.

188
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,250
Notice how
intensely Amanuma's

189
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,416
watching the questions
on the monitor.

190
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,833
I have to wonder if this
is a handicap, after all.

191
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,291
Kaitou is too good.

192
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,625
That's just a deer-in-the-
video-game-headlights look.

193
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,833
You're wrong, Yusuke. Get a
good look at the boy's eyes.

194
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,625
He's fearless.
Still confident of victory.

195
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,083
But how come?

196
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,125
Kaitou's answering right at
the start of the question.

197
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,583
How could anyone be faster?

198
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,458
Yeah, unless he can stop time.

199
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,375
Got it! Ready to play!

200
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,500
Ah yeah! With a
come-from-behind victory!

201
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,333
A little arrogant,
don't you agree King?

202
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,458
Considering you haven't
answered a question yet.

203
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,541
What have you been doing,
gauging my skill?

204
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,500
I've known of dorks like you,

205
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,666
guys who think they're
better at games

206
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,500
than me just cause
they're older.

207
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,958
Well for your info,

208
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,083
what I've been looking at
has nothing to do with you.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
After this next one,
you'll know what I mean.

210
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,500
Quiz question, number si...

211
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,625
[Bell]

212
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,708
[KAITOU THINKS] Ha.
He jumped the gun.

213
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,750
You realize what
Amanuma's done now.

214
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,458
If a player presses his buzzer
before the question begins,

215
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,500
he will not be allowed
to see the answer choices.

216
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,583
So he's just gonna guess, A
through D? But that's my trick!

217
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,166
I don't believe it.
He can't win off hunches!

218
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,000
Question Number Six--
this is an awesome one.

219
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,416
"In the year 2000,

220
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,208
a group of respected scientists
predicted an asteroid

221
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,666
would crash into the earth.

222
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,208
What was the asteroid's name?

223
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,791
The answer's "B" for "Toutatis."

224
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,166
[ARCADE VOICE]  You're right!
Goblin King, one point!

225
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,500
That's no hunch!

226
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,416
[YUSUKE] Yeah, either he's
got the world's longest

227
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,125
cheat sheet hidden somewhere,

228
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,500
or he memorized that whole
dumb question verbatim.

229
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
But how'd he know
it'd be that one?

230
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,875
Well, we already
know he's a psychic.

231
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,250
Maybe he can see into
a video game's future.

232
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,458
I believe the answer
is more down to earth.

233
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,250
Not only has he
memorized the questions,

234
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,833
like Kaitou,
he's memorized their order.

235
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,541
Impossible!

236
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
No one could ever memorize
the order in this game.

237
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,333
They're supposed to
be asked at random!

238
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,416
Not exactly, Mr. Know-it-all.

239
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,875
It looks random,

240
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,500
but it actually goes by a
pretty complicated formula.

241
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,750
It takes me the
first five questions

242
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,000
to figure out which
track it's on.

243
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,875
But now that I've got it down,
I'll be impossible to beat.

244
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,166
Quiz Question--

245
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,375
[Bell]

246
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,958
[ARCADE VOICE] You're right!
Two in a row!

247
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,541
Goblin King, two points!

248
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,916
Kaitou's given up all hope. He's
sure that he'll lose this way.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,916
Sadly, he's right.

250
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey Hiei, Where you goin'?
This isn't tag team.

251
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,208
[ARCADE VOICE]  You're right!
Three in a row!

252
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to turn
this game off.

253
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,958
Oh? And how? You see a
power strip somewhere?

254
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,541
Please, don't try
anything reckless.

255
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,416
We're inside
Amanuma's Territory,

256
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,666
so every action we're
allowed to take

257
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,291
is dictated by
the rules he's set,

258
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,041
and he can punish us
for doing it wrong.

259
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,333
Yeah man.

260
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,666
It's just gonna be a repeat
of when you tried

261
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,541
hitting Kaitou in the house.

262
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,291
[HIEI] Then at least
I'll know I tried.

263
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
[ARCADE VOICE]
Goblin King four points!

264
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,166
Nice one!

265
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,125
[ARCADE VOICE]  You're right!
Five in a row!

266
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,958
Tie game!

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,666
Not even a flinch.

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,916
We knew as much.

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,375
You and Hiei should be
study partners, Yusuke.

270
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,625
[YUSUKE] Shut up.

271
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,416
Could you guys
not be so noisy?

272
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,083
I'm trying to enjoy
my big triumph here.

273
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,458
I think this kid's far too young
to be having control of us.

274
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,541
Yeah, he's prob'ly still
doing the Velcro shoe thing.

275
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,458
It certainly seems the
only way to beat him

276
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,541
is through the
clearing of the game.

277
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:53,916
[ARCADE VOICE] 
Quiz Question--

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,916
[Bell]

279
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,250
[GAME MASTER] What do
you think you're doing?

280
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,375
You don't know the
questions like I do.

281
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,375
You'll just be making
random guesses.

282
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,500
I'll have a twenty-five
percent chance of victory.

283
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,291
That's much better than
just watching you win.

284
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,416
[Buzzer]

285
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,125
Sorry, that's wrong!
Kaitou has one bad mark!

286
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,166
[NARRATOR] And so the game
went-- a race to the buzzer.

287
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,583
Game Master scored 9.

288
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,625
Kaitou made two of his
possible three mistakes.

289
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,750
One last question
to decide it all.

290
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,791
[Buzzer]

291
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,541
Sorry, that's wrong!
Kaitou has three bad marks!

292
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,625
Kaitou, game over!

293
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,875
There is nothing that I hate
more than the pain of defeat.

294
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,583
But it's all my fault for
not noticing the pattern.

295
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,500
Come on, don't be
so hard on yourself!

296
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
You played a good round,
and it was fun.

297
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,666
Maybe we can play a game
you're better at, later on!

298
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,750
We'll have time!

299
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,125
[Game Master laughs]

300
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,500
[YANA] Wow.
He's crazy good.

301
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,791
As far as gaming goes,
that makes Kurama our last hope.

302
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,083
You know, I haven't
been too worried

303
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,083
since we won the first
three games so easily,

304
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,958
but what happens if
we lose Goblin City

305
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,500
in this kid's Territory?

306
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,208
Arcades do get pretty creative
with their death scenes.

307
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,041
Sorry about the loss.

308
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,541
But really,

309
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,916
the game wasn't as disturbing
as what happened just now.

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,625
There's something
strange about that kid.

311
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,333
He acted chummy. Does he even
realize what he's involved in?

312
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,666
Think, Kaitou. Do you feel
any different physically?

313
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,583
No. That's partly why
it seems so strange.

314
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,041
I thought he'd take my soul
for losing in his Territory.

315
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,458
But I almost feel better.

316
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,875
[KURAMA] Yes.
That would fit the pattern.

317
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,500
Alright, I'm gonna start
charging you money

318
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,750
for being vague.

319
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,916
I now suspect that even
if we failed every game,

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,041
none of us would lose our lives,
not as long as we keep playing.

321
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,458
Yeah, but I'm sure you
die in the video game.

322
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,541
[KURAMA] Yes, but only when
you're finished completely.

323
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,000
When you fail in Goblin City,

324
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,291
you're given the choice to
either give up or continue,

325
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,791
paying more quarters
in the arcade version

326
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,541
or pressing start at home.

327
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,333
As long as you
choose to continue,

328
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,000
you can begin again
without going through

329
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,458
the introductory sequence.

330
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,791
But if you give up,

331
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,958
the words "The End" appear
in red on the screen...

332
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,500
...above the graves
of your fallen heroes.

333
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,708
You mean unless we beat
this kid at the game

334
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,791
that's probably been his
babysitter most his life,

335
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,583
we'll have to keep playing
and playing if we want to live?

336
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,666
We don't have time for that!

337
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,250
That is precisely our
enemy's point...

338
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,125
to trap us inside this Territory

339
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,625
until the tunnel to
Demon World can be completed.

340
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,583
It's not a matter of
fighting for our lives here,

341
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,166
but for our time.

342
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,208
[GAME MASTER] Pretty smart!

343
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,625
You've figured out
Sensui's awesome plan.

344
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,125
I'm gonna let you
out of the game

345
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,666
as soon as they're done digging.

346
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,416
So come on, we still have a
few hours to have some fun!

347
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,833
It is such a hungry world.

348
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,791
Its own desire to open
is making my powers

349
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,583
more intensive by the minute.

350
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,833
At this rate,

351
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,000
it to will blossom like
the most perfect flower

352
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,458
in less than two hours.

353
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,166
[ITSUKI] You should
start your movie now.

354
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,166
[ITSUKI]
Can you feel them, Shinobu?

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,333
[ITSUKI] Feel their
desperation to get out?

356
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,625
Of course I do, Mr. Itsuki.

357
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,416
It's the urge of the cosmos
to reach its true equilibrium.

358
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,708
Isn't it exciting to know
that you're going to help,

359
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,833
Mr. Kuwabara?

360
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,583
How many times can I tell you?
I'd die before I help.

361
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,875
Urameshi, hurry your butt up!

362
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,208
Our time's running out!

363
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,791
[NARRATOR] Only two hours
remain before the tunnel opens

364
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,708
and releases Armageddon
on the human race.

365
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,708
With Yusuke's team trapped
in the Game Master's world,

366
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,083
how can Sensui's
plan be stopped?

367
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,291
[KURAMA] ] Regret is
a different beast

368
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,333
when you live for centuries.

369
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,458
We are about to learn
much more about this boy...

370
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,916
why he plays and who plays him.

371
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,750
Naïveté, I understand.

372
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,416
For I know what it is
to be a human child.

373
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,166
But I am also a Spirit Fox,
also a demon.

374
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,750
And now, with the human race
at the doorstep of extinction,

375
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,041
will I make a decision I may
regret for centuries more?

376
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,916
I pray I won't,

377
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
yet I know that I will.

378
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:27,583
