00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,958
to succeed it,
creating a Demon sleeper.

162
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,541
[OOTAKE] The first time he died,
he wasn't strong enough

163
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,291
to awaken the beast within him,

164
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,291
which is why he
came back as a human

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,666
when you revived him.

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,708
Inadvertently, though,
through his training

167
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,916
as a Spirit Detective, we've...

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,916
...amended that deficiency.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now, there's nothing to
stop that Mazoku gene

170
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,583
from rearing it's ugly
head, except for us.

171
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,416
And if your father,
King Yama, hadn't detected

172
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,375
trace amounts of the same
Demon energy shooting out

173
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,750
from Urameshi and the tunnel...

174
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,041
Well...

175
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,041
We could've defeated
one rogue Spirit Detective

176
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,666
only to give rise to
another, more powerful one.

177
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,125
Thank goodness we arrived
in time to prevent it.

178
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,708
And my father is certain
about all of this?

179
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,208
[OOTAKE]
Yes.

180
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,291
Forty-four generations ago,
before the Kekkai separated

181
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,458
the Living and Demon Worlds...

182
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,916
That's when the Mazoku planted

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,875
the seed of evil that's now
ready to bloom within him.

184
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,166
Which is why we must
destroy his corpse!

185
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,583
You'll have to do it
over my dead body!

186
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,875
[KOENMA]
Huh?

187
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,125
You all should be
ashamed of yourselves.

188
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,708
Insinuating that he's
a monster, or a traitor,

189
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,750
or anything other than
what he really is: a hero.

190
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,166
Who do you think he's
been fighting for?

191
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,500
Who do you think he
selflessly gave his life for?

192
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,333
And this is how you reward him?!

193
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,916
It doesn't matter
what's in your blood!

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
All that matters is
what's inside your heart!

195
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,791
Yeah, like we're gonna trust you
as a good judge of character.

196
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,625
We know all about the
last Spirit Detective

197
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,916
you got involved with,
and as far as I'm concerned,

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,791
you're still an enemy
of this mission.

199
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,166
Get your men in check, Captain.

200
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,791
I know the severity
of this situation.

201
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,500
That's why cooler
heads must prevail,

202
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,458
and regardless of
your thug's opinion...

203
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,916
Mr. Mitarai has proven himself

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,750
an honorable ally of my
Spirit Detective outfit.

205
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,500
And as for Yusuke...

206
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,291
If what you're saying is true,
it's my fault for missing it.

207
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,833
I won't let him suffer for that.

208
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,708
We will find another
solution, Captain,

209
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,041
because that is
what civilized--!

210
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,625
[OOTAKE]
Forgive me, sir.

211
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,500
[groans]

212
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,333
This is treason.

213
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,500
As a leader, I'm sure
you appreciate

214
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,166
the difficult choices
I have to make.

215
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,750
But this is in the best
interest of Living World.

216
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,750
[SOLDIER B]
Captain!

217
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,000
Look at Urameshi! He's glowing!

218
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,916
No, it's time!

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,291
That's not Spirit Energy he's
emitting--it's Demon Energy!

220
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,083
The transformation has begun!

221
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,541
[gasps]

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,375
Fire!

223

[SOLDIERS gasping]

224
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,458
We're gonna die!

225
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,500
Stop pissin' your
pants and fire!

226
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,291
Keep on firing!

227
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,666
Stop it!

228
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,916
[YUSUKE]
Man, you people sure know

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,166
how to make a guy feel welcome.

230
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,833
We're... too late...

231
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,416
The Mazoku is alive!

232
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,458
Puu! Puu!

233
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,958
Hey there, little buddy.

234
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,500
I see you've been drinking your
milk while I've been away.

235
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,958
Ya know, even though I was dead,

236
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,958
I could still heard some of
what you guys were sayin'.

237
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,583
So then... I'm...

238
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,083
some kind of evil,
vicious monster...

239
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,541
[SOLDIERS gasp]

240
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,500
[YUSUKE] My teachers have
been sayin' that for years.

241
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,875
I just thought it was
a figure of speech.

242
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,125
[SOLDIERS yelp]

243
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,833
[OOTAKE]
You see, Koenma, sir,

244
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,875
how strong his Demon Energy is?

245
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,250
No... Not Yusuke.

246
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,708
Your... Supreme Evilness...

247
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,041
I'm your humble servant!

248
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,833
Please allow me to do
whatever it is you desire.

249
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,000
[YUSUKE] Thanks, weakling,
but for what I desire,

250
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,250
I don't need any help.

251
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,958
For, what I desire...

252
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,041
...is ending the world
and everyone in it.

253
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,041
For I am the mighty
Mazoku, lord of evil!

254
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,875
[SOLDIERS gasp]

255
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,000
[YUSUKE] And now, after
hibernating for more

256
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,125
than 1,000 years, I will
finally reveal my true form.

00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:46,958

[YUSUKE]
Psyche! Jeeze, you're gullible!

[SOLDIERS]
Huh?!

261
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,625
Hey, Koenma...

262
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,750
You didn't really think
I'd turned bad, right?

263
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,416
Well d-- Well, no...

264
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,958
Anyway, I better push
off to Demon World...

265
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,708
Sensui gave me a death
sentence as a gift,

266
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,083
and I'd be a jerk if I
didn't return the favor.

267
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,083
But, you can't go anywhere!
You have to be quarantined.

268
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,583
You even think
about stopping me,

269
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,458
and I'll bite off your
head, mustache and all!

270
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,750
[yelps] I knew you couldn't
hide your true character.

271
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,708
You've transformed
into a demon menace.

272
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,916
Look, jerk.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,208
Gimme a break, it's
called a running joke.

274
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,666
I'm the same.

"Yusuke Urameshi, fearless
protector of the good stuff,

277
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,375
and a general hate
for authority."

278
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,375
And nothing as trivial
as a violent death

279
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,500
or a few drops of Demon's
blood mixed in with mine

You really should wash your feet

You can tell King Daddy that...

And that he can
disown me or fire me

You do understand
there's a good chance

we won't be able to go back...

we've beaten Sensui.

whiff of us and turned tail

319
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,833
faster than you can say chicken.

320
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,083
Even A-Class Ghosts tell
stories about the SDF.

321
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,625
We're their boogiemen.

322
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,083
[RINBAI]
Ha!

323
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,250
They're prob'ly even sicker
of hearing about the time

324
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,125
you cornered the
Spirit Fox than we are!

325
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:25,958
[SHUNJUN]
Shut up!

326
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,041
[gasps]

327
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,833
Something with immense
Demon Energy's

328
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,041
approaching the perimeter.

329
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,375
Where?

330
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:37,541
[RINBAI] Hm... It's
coming from Living World!

331
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,875
Impossible...

332
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,708
There are no Demons that
powerful in Living World.

333
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,875
[YUSUKE]
Hey, tool brigade!

334
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,000
Get outta the way!

335
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,666
[SOLDIERS gasp]

336
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,500
[YUSUKE] And get some cooler
uniforms while you're at it!

337
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,875
That's one big Spirit Animal.

338
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,958
I think that was Prince Koenma.

339
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,375
And that Mazoku,
Urameshi, was with him!

340
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,875
[RYUUHI] That's where the
Demon Energy was coming from.

341
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,875
[SHUNJUN]
We're all doomed.

342
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,500
[SENSUI chuckles]

343
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,250
I apologize if I
happened to have

344
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,916
caused you any harm.

345
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,833
Kill us if you're going to.

346
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,916
Just spare us the
sound of your voice.

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,750
[KURAMA grunts]
Physical strength is greater

348
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,125
than ours, at the
moment. That's all.

349
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,666
Unfortunately...

350
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
...that's the only thing that
matters here in Demon World.

351
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,333
[KUWABARA]
I'm sorry, Urameshi.

352
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,666
I failed you.

353
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,458
[SENSUI]
I am merciful.

354
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,916
I want to relieve
you of your misery.

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,958
Huh?

356
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,083
What's that?

357
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,833
A great Demon Energy...

358
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,083
And it's coming
from the other side.

359
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,500
[SENSUI]
It can't be...

360
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,833
Huh?

361
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm sorry I got delayed.
Traffic was a bitch.

362
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,166
But I'm back! And I'm
ready to finish this!

363
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,500
[PUU screeches]

364
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,166
[NARRATOR] One is a human
who fights to liberate

365
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,750
Demons and destroy his own kind.

366
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,166
The other is part Demon
who fights on behalf

367
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,333
of the Living World.

368
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,083
The final battle between
Sensui and Yusuke

369
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,125
is about to begin.

370
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,791
[YUSUKE]
I'm back from the dead... again.

371
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,875
But did you ever doubt it--
I mean, it's my freakin' story!

372
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,041
Well, death's the closest
thing you get to vacation

373
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,625
in the Spirit Detective racket,
so no sooner am I back

374
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,416
than I'm raising my fists.
But don't relax yet.

375
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,875
Even though I'm
coming fully loaded

376
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,416
with these new Demon powers,
it may not be enough

377
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,666
against Sensui's Sacred Energy.

378
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,250
But something feels wrong,
and a voice in my head

379
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,875
isn't making it any better.

380
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,125
It's a battle inside me
and a war without,

381
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,333
next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
