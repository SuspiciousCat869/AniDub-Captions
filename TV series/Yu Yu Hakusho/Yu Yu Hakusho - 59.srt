Ok, she must really be sick.

157
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
I'm sorry Yusuke, but
this might be a good time

158
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,916
for you to tell Kuwabara
the truth about Genkai.

159
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,375
[KOENMA] Yep, you're definitely
still pale Kuwabara.

160
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,875
How do we know you're
not gonna bail on us?

161
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,750
Would you please
shut up about that???

162
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,250
I'm a real man, okay!!!

163
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,916
The only way I'm
leaving that ring

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,208
is if he's
beaten or I'm dead.

165
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,083
[[KUWABARA THINKS] Now I
just gotta find a way

166
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,875
to make the first one happen.

167
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,000
Hopefully this Trial Sword
can do the trick.

168
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,208
[BALD DEMON]
Make this one count!

169
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,666
I sat six hours for this fight!
I better see some blood!

170
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,041
[SHIZURU THINKS] Be careful.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,458
[KOTO] Sorry for
being presumptuous,

172
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,291
but dare I say the long wait
was a help to this final round!

173
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,250
For hours we've
anxiously wondered

174
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,666
how this undeniably
crucial fight will end!

175
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,250
And now the answer comes!

176
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,625
In case I don't make it,
take care of my cat.

177
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,416
[YUKINA THINKS] Poor Kazuma.

178
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,750
[KUWABARA THINKS] Always
expectin' nothin' out of me.

179
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,583
Just makes for
a better surprise.

180
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,083
Ready? Begin!

181
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,000
Didn't expect that
one coming, did 'ya?

182
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,375
I don't know
what pocket

183
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
Kuwabara was
hiding this sword in,

184
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,583
but he is clearly
stronger than before!

185
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:50,000
His entire body's surrounded by
a shocking, electric aura!

186
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,916
The energy drawn in
by that sword strengthens

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,708
Kuwabara's body and improves
both his offense and defense.

188
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,416
If Toguro doesn't
realize that,

189
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,291
Kuwabara may actually
have a chance.

190
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,500
If there's any way to
bring you down, Toguro,

191
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,750
I'll find it!!

192
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,416
That weapon looks awfully
dangerous, try not to slip.

193
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,083
[YUSUKE THINKS]
What's he doing?

194
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,000
He isn't moving!

195
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,208
Whoa!!

196
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:38,291
That really got you, huh? Sorry.

197
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,708
Oh my goodness, people.

198
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,083
I don't if I should believe this
Kuwabara's first swing

199
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,791
has ripped elder Toguro in two!

200
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,416
I think this fight is over!

201
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,041
I thought Kuwabara
was dead for sure!

202
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,458
Honestly, so did I.

203
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,875
Hey, I didn't!

204
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,041
Hey. Um, did
Kuwabara just win?

205
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,125
I don't know.

206
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,708
I'm really incredible!

207
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,416
I beat a Toguro
Brother in one attack!

208
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,833
And the winner is Kuwabara!

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,250
What the...

210
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,875
I said a moment ago that elder
Toguro had been sliced in two,

211
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,666
but the real-life
splitting must have occurred

212
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,166
well before the sword came down!

213
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,166
It appears he's made
some kind of a clone,

214
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,791
slipped his real
self through a crack,

215
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,541
and attacked Kuwabara
from behind!

216
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
Smashing analysis
as always, Koto,

217
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,916
but could he maybe have a twin?

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We do background checks
on all the contestants,

219
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,208
and there was no
sign of that.

220
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,833
How about triplets?

221
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,500
You are a very
simpleminded child.

222
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,541
It feels so nice to trick you!

223
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,416
It's supposed to be one on one.

224
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,458
[Toguro 1 cackles]

225
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,333
Oh, I do assure
you that my decoy

226
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,666
and I are part
of the same body.

227
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,375
You got me.

228
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,791
But when you see the truth
of it, it is just a paper cut.

229
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,541
I feel the sensation of pain
but it's quite unlike yours.

230
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,375
You see I can move my body's
vital organs wherever I please.

231
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,083
When I see your attack
coming I simply adjust

232
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,375
so that all you hit is flesh.

233
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,375
It makes injuring
me very complicated.

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,333
All you are is a
little freak show!

235
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,166
It is truly an exquisite sword, 
you inherit it from her?

236

[KUWABARA]
Who??

237
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,750
You would think she'd
leave something like this

238
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,916
for her apprentice, but I guess
Yusuke wasn't strong enough.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,458
You don't know what
you're talking about!

240

Genkai is just sick!

Oh, that's perfectly sad.

You're friends have
been keeping secrets.

[TOGURO 1] Genkai is dead.
She has been for two days.

No! It can't be.

245
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh my gosh, is it true? Botan?

246
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,125
Why didn't I see that??

247
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,875
Give it a break,
you're the only one left.

248

Isn't that nice?

249
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,791
Genkai really didn't show
up in time for her battle.

250
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,833
[HIEI] No. You pull your
own weight from now on.

251
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,083
I see.

252
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,000
Everybody really did
know about it but me.

253

They kept me out on purpose.

254
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,458
They didn't think
I could take it!

255
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,416
Don't cry Kuwabara...

256

It isn't your fault the old
wench couldn't stay...

257

Go and question her yourself
if you don't believe me.

258

Another few inches and
I can pick out your heart.

[TOGURO 1] What a sad life
when you're friends

aren't even
straight with you.

264
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,375
But I will tell
you everything

265
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,875
about the frailty
of your humankind.

266
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,375
It's the story of a young,

267
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,083
impressionable
human girl named Genkai.

268
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,041
She was the most beautiful
girl in all the land.

269
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,125
She was a fighter who wanted to
be the very best in the world.

270
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,083
Then she met a man named Toguro
who also wanted to be the best.

271
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,416
And he agreed to play with her.

272
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
They did everything
together,

273
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,416
so much so that the man nearly
forget his own brother.

274
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,333
The woman and the man
were even in love.

275
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,666
[TOGURO 1] But then the woman
became ugly like a prune

276
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,250
and no one wanted
to be around her.

277
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,291
[TOGURO 2]
Brother.

[TOGURO 1]
Oh, it's okay.

279
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,291
He's just a little anxious
because this next chapter

280
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,416
is his favorite
part in the story.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,333
You see the man
became a demon

282
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,000
who would stay strong
and never become a prune.

283
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,250
The ugly woman became extremely
jealous of the handsome man

284
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,500
and went to fight him.

285
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,416
But she was not
strong anymore,

286
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,666
so the man was
happy to murder her.

287
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,166
This sadistic puppet
show has brought up

288
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,458
a very different explanation
for Genkai's absence!

289
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,708
Apparently she was
killed by Toguro

290
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,000
before the finals even began!

291
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,583
Talk to me, okay! Is it
true what he said?

292
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,500
Is Genkai really
gone now?

293
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,333
It's terrible!

294
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,250
Muttering some final rubbish
to her failed apprentice,

295
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
the woman's soul drifted away

296
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,250
to some quiet
corner of Hell.

297
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,958
We live happily ever after.

298
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,125
That's all crap!
Genkai wasn't jealous!

299
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,583
Toguro killed her because
he couldn't have her!

300

Your brother's
something of a fool.

301

Yes, it's a
bad habit of his.

302
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,291
I'm gonna kill you, 
you better know that.

303
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,083
That's very nice enthusiasm,

304
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,791
but you must have forgotten
I have your weapon.

305
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,791
I'd give it back,
but helplessness is more fun.

306
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,833
You're honorless.

307
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,166
Yes, I am!

308
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
Good thing that's not what
this tournament is about!!!

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,083
Elder Toguro has shot
his drill-shaped hand

directly into
Kuwabara's chest cavity!!

311
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,833
[TOGURO 1]
What's happening here??

312
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
I can't pierce your skin!!

313
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,791
I see, Kuwabara's
strength and his resolve

314
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,041
appear to be closely related.

315
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:41,041
You have no soul. You're just a
nasty little waste of space!!!

316
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,833
Now...

317
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,500
Die!!!

318
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,041
Oh damn.

319
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:57,333
[Toguro 1 cries out]

320
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,000
[KOTO] Oh, yet another new
attack from Kuwabara!  

321
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,458
This one looks like a variation
on his normal Spirit Sword!

322
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,625
[KOTO] Elder Toguro is
left on the floor

323
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,291
in a pile of assorted
body parts!

324
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,791
We may really get
to chalk up an X

325
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,416
on the scoreboard
this go-around!

326
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,583
That was nice.

327
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,916
Is it real
this time?

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,291
Well he does
look, divided.

329
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,208
I'll start the ten count! One!

330
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,500
I've seen enough mauling
and amputation in my day

331
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041
to know when a ten count
isn't necessary,

332
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,791
and this one
definitely qualifies!

333
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,958
Kuwabara has destroyed
the elder Toguro,

334
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,291
giving a two-one
lead to Team Urameshi!

335
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,666
One more like that and the
championship is theirs!

336
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,083
No question, Koto.

337
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,458
Yusuke will win the next
one for sure, it's in the can!

338
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,125
Hey, who did that?

339
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,333
Don't make me put
this horn in action mode!

340
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,041
[crowd shouts in chaos]

341
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,625
Yes, as I was saying,

342
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,166
I think Team Toguro
has an excellent chance

343
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,416
of clenching this
victory as well.

344
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,416
The fact is I'm neutral.
Either team can win.

345
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
I know it's important
for a color commentator

346
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,333
to have opinions,
but in this case I'm undecided.

347
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,458
[JURI]
Six!

348
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,500
Maybe honor doesn't
matter to your kind, Toguro.

349
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,500
But it does to me.

350
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,416
[JURI]
Seven!

351
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,625
[JURI] Eight!

352
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,333
[Juri reacts in horror]

353
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,625
Stop counting. Do you really
think it's over?

354
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,166
I was only surprised
for a moment.

355
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,333
I didn't think you
could attack me that way,

356
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,583
I should be
more careful.

357
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,250
What are you??

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,541
Good question. I'd
like to know that myself.

359
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,583
I suppose you should ask
the tournament committee

360
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,666
who made my wish come true.

361
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,166
I knew I'd become a demon.
The rest was trial and error.

362
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,166
[TOGURO 1] You better conserve
your energy from now on.

363
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,666
You're already hurt.
And I have yet to be.

364
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,000
[KUWABARA]
You're invincible.

365
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,958
I need to retract my
former statement, people.

366
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,416
Elder Toguro is alive and he's
clearly still in this match!

367
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,541
Every time you think he's down,

368
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,291
he shows a new
side of his talent!

369
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,416
This guy is absolutely bizarre!

370
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,458
This is the most
awesome thing ever!

371
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,666
Someone kill me!
I've seen it all!

372
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,500
I hope that human
cuts him before he dies!

373
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,791
I want to see him
come together again!

374
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,083
The only chance you have of
beating me and surviving,

375
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,541
Kuwabara, is to pierce
either my heart or my brain.

376
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,250
But that's not
very fair, is it?

377
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,916
It's kind of like searching for
a needle in a haystack,

378
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,291
except the needle can
move whenever it chooses to.

379
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,166
Just, shut up!

380
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,750
I think I'll
just skip the search

381
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
and send you straight
to your death.

382
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,583
Don't forget to tell
Genkai how much we miss her!

383
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,875
Bye!!!

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,541
[NARRATOR]
Every attack proves useless

385
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,958
against the elder Toguro.

386
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,541
Can Kuwabara find a way

387
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,416
through his grotesque
invincibility?

388
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,541
[YUSUKE] Yeah, nothing
like a maniac bad guy

389
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,916
who can move his organs around
to make your day go crazy.

390
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Kuwabara has a tough
time in front of him,

391
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,666
and while we've kind of gotten
used to him blowing his fights,

392
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,625
he has to win now or
we're in some serious crap.

393
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,875
Unless of course you
think Koenma's dorky jetpack

394
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
can beat Sakyo in a tiebreaker.

395
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,541
And that's if I beat Toguro.

396
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,916
Yeah. Anyway, if you need a
reason to watch the finals,

397
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,791
you're probably
watching the wrong show.

398
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,625
So, I'll see you next
time on Yu Yu Hakusho.
