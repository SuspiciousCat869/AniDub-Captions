00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,125
If it makes you feel any better,

159
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,583
Hiei looks like he
hurt himself pretty bad.

160
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,458
[SHISHIWAKAMARU THINKS] Perhaps
that pathetic beast

161
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,208
was an asset to
our team after all.

162
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,125
[KEIKO] Um, Botan, are you sure
you know where you're going?

163
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,083
It feels like we've
been walking for hours.

164
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,833
[YUKINA] What if we don't make
it to the stadium in time?

165
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,166
Then we'll unfortunately miss a
few more pulse-pounding seconds

166
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,791
of people cramming their
fists into one another,

167
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,166
and then I might just have
to stick my head in an oven.

168
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,125
Don't worry, we'll
be there in a jiff!

169
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,625
This way, everyone!

170
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,416
We just went that way, Botan.

171
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,625
Do you think that's
the reason why

172
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,916
we passed by the
same rock formation

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,416
three times on
the way over here?

174
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Honestly Botan, this short cut
isn't exactly turning out

175
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,958
to be what I
would call short.

176
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,916
I know exactly
where we're going.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,333
We just have to keep walking in
the direction that I'm pointing!

178
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,291
Oh! You really
have no idea, do you?

179
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,791
If we head back to the
hotel and go the normal way,

180
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,083
we might make it by sundown.

181
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,416
That's right!

182
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
We just need to see this
as a learning experience.

183
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:01,250
[Yusuke screaming in agony]

184
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,416
I refuse, I won't give up!

185
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:20,333
[Yusuke screaming in agony]

186
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,166
Come on, roll the dice again.
I have an urge for three in row.

187
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,541
[KUWABARA THINKS] Don't roll
my name yet. I wanna go last.

188
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,291
The team leader
always goes last.

189
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,583
I am the team leader
and I wanna go last.

190
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,833
[HIEI THINKS] Let it be me.

191
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,125
[KURAMA THINKS]
Please, fall on mine.

192
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,083
[KUWABARA THINKS]
Don't let it be me!

193
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,291
Yes.

194
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
Yes!

195
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,375
Damn!

196
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
[JURI] After rolling the dice,

197
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,375
both fighters are in place

198
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,958
for the third match
of the semi-finals!

199
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,625
Now fighting for
Team Urameshi, Kurama!

200
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,708
And for Team Uraotogi,
Ura Urashima!

201
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,208
It's nice to see that fate is
cooperating with us today, Onji.

202
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,250
I admit, everything
is falling into place

203
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,291
more or less as we
hoped that it would.

204
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,208
Those first two accomplished
exactly what was intended.

205
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,958
It's a pity we
couldn't tell them

206
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,583
they were only here
to drain Hiei's energy.

207
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,000
And now the dice
have chosen Ura Urashima,

208
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,833
the one best suited
for killing Kurama.

209
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
He'll finally put
our team on the board.

210
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,083
By the authority of
the Tournament Committee,

211
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,666
let the third match begin!

212
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,625
Start your fight!

213
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,291
[KOTO] It looks like this match

214
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,958
is going to be a duel
of lashing weapons,

215
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,000
with Ura Urashima
twirling his fishing line

216
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,416
and Kurama wielding
his trademark Rose Whip.

217
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,291
This one's gonna
be all about skill!

218
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,500
Wow! This is
an incredible display

219
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,833
of equally matched talents,

220
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,416
and while there's no
blood to speak of yet,

221
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
those sparks keep me hopeful!

222
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,166
Whoa, this is a fight!

223
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,791
Kurama needs to
stop fooling around

224
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,166
and start
fighting for real.

225
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,666
What? He's whip-swingin'
like a maniac!

226
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,458
Have you
learned anything?

227
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,291
It's Kurama's obnoxious habit.

228
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,791
He never creates
his own strategy

229
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,583
until after he fully
understands his opponent's.

230
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,833
[KURAMA THINKS] Peculiar.

231
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,041
Ura Urashima doesn't
even seem to be trying.

232
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,416
[URA THINKS] Kurama. Keep
fighting as you listen to me.

233
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,375
I have a favor to ask.

234
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,083
[KURAMA THINKS]
Telepathic communication.

235
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,916
I don't believe that's
legal in the ring.

236
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,291
[URA] I'm begging you--
please kill me!

237
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,625
[URA] Don't stop fighting
or they'll get suspicious.

238
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,708
[KURAMA] Why?

239
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,666
[URA] When I joined this team,

240
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,125
I had no idea what
I was getting into.

241
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,583
I needed money to support
my sick grandmother,

242
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,375
and Shishi Wakamaru
promised me riches.

243
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,666
At first it was just stealing,
which I knew was wrong but--

244
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,416
then things got worse.

245
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,250
They convinced me to do
many things I'm not proud of.

246
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:18,333
Though I have no one to blame
except my own weak disposition.

247
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,833
But I can't go on.

248
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,250
For the first time in my life
I'm doing the right thing.

249
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,291
[KURAMA] Suicide
is not the answer.

250
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,583
There is neither honor
nor redemption in that.

251
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,250
[URA] You don't
understand, Kurama!

252
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,833
If I don't kill you,

253
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,958
they're going to
hurt my poor grandmother.

254
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,166
But this guilt I feel
is too much for me to bear.

255
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,875
As I watched my
teammates fall today,

256
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,958
I realized that
being killed in battle

257
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,666
is the only way out.

258
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
Please. Take
pity on a lost soul.

259
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,583
[KURAMA] I'll help you,
but not by death.

260
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,083
This world has enough of that.

261
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,291
You can keep your life

262
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,833
as long as you change
the way you live it.

263
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,458
It's never too late.
Believe me.

264
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,708
As for your
grandmother's well being,

265
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,291
we can fake your death

266
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,625
I can sting you
with my Rose Whip

267
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,000
in a manner that will
knock you out temporarily.

268
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,583
[URA] You are indeed
a good man, Kurama.

269
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,125
Here we go!

270
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,625
Yes.

271
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,791
What?

272
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,791
Kurama!

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,291
And he's down!

274
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,291
I studied your fighting

275
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,291
and found your only
weakness is your kindness.

276
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,375
In that regard

277
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,958
I'd suggest you
change the way--

278
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,083
The way you
live your life.

279
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,541
[URA] But it's too late now.

280
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,833
How did you put up with

281
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,125
this goody-two-
shoes crap?

282
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,916
I had to choke back
some major chunks

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,625
while I was pretending
to be an upstanding citizen,

284
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,000
but does it feel
good to be bad again!

285
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,666
You're gonna die
just like Grandma!

286
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,250
[URA] Come on Kurama,
give me some credit here!

287
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,250
You didn't think I was
really trying to hit you

288
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,083
with those
attacks, did you?

289
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,916
Hook, line, and sinker.
And you're the stupid fish.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,083
This was not part
of my job description!

291
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,708
Isn't there anybody who can
break me out of this thing?

292
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,083
I am not supposed to be in here!

293
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,625
[URA] And before
you get any ideas,

294
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,333
know that my force field won't
be shredded nearly as easily

295
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,750
as that
enchantress, Ruka's.

296
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,625
In fact it's impossible to
break out from the inside,

297
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,166
so get comfortable.

298
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,958
And let me introduce
you to the Idunn Box.

299
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,041
Anybody other than the
possessor who breathes its air

300
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,958
will quickly return
to their younger age.

301
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,541
Back to those awkward
adolescent years,

302
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,125
the terrible twos,
or even infancy!

303
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Once infected,

304
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,750
you'll be so tiny
and inexperienced,

305
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,708
it'll be like
taking candy from a...

306
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,083
Oh well, there's not point
in cliche expressions.

307
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,083
You'll see soon
enough what I mean.

308
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,041
[URA] You can't hold
your breath forever!

309
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,333
[Ura laughs]

310
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,041
Why isn't that stuff coming
any closer--is it scared?!

311
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
Maybe you don't understand
the concept of force field.

312
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,583
Poopy, how do they
expect us to watch

313
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,083
with that smoke everywhere?

314
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,583
And why is it, the less I
see, the more I want it!

315
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,041
No clue, sir.

316
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,375
Way to go, Ura,
I really did it!

317
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
I can feel his Spirit
Energy getting weaker!

[KURAMA'S MOM] You're gonna
be late for school, Suichi.

[KURAMA'S MOM] Today is the
most joyful day of my life.

I'll call him, Suichi.

322
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,291
You know, maybe I have
gone a bit too far this time.

323
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,083
Hold on, his Spirit
Energy completely vanished.

324
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,625
That's not supposed to happen.

325
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,000
What the...?

326
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,625
[KUWABARA]
Do you feel that too?

[crowd in chaos]

328
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,208
Where in the world did
this power surge come from?

329
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,166
Could've sworn I felt
his power weakening

330
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,125
as he regressed
all the way back.

331

[YOKO KURAMA] I think perhaps

332

I've regressed further
than you intended.

333

And just as I had come to
accept my human captivity.

'Yoko has

Yoko The legendary
bandit Yoko??

What'd you do with Kurama?
I like him a lot better!

[YOKO KURAMA]
Oh, he's here... He's me.

Only now you've brought me out
in full. Thank you for that.

[NARRATOR] After fifteen years

the demon Yoko
Kurama has returned.

[KOENMA]
Yo. Koenma here!

sweet view of the action,

but I can't see a thing!

347
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,666
There's obviously a lot of
excitement brewing down there,

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,500
now that Kurama has
transformed into Yoko,

the powerful and
coldhearted Spirit Fox.

It's just not fair
that I manage the team

and I can't see diddly
while you get a great view,

what'd you ever do?

Sit on your butt and
turn the television on?

be a groundbreaker,
