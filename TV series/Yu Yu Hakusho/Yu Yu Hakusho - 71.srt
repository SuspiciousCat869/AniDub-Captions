00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,291
Mr. Sensui,
you must avenge us.

159
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,250
[SENSUI] Soldiers
take orders. Not me.

160
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,583
But lucky for you,

161
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,625
nothing could deny me
the pleasure of this kill.

162
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,625
[TOGURO 1 TELEPATHIC]
I thought you'd say that.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,750
[Toguro 1 laughs wickedly]

164
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,416
[SENSUI THINKS] Never
satisfied, never full.

165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,458
They eat and destroy
with grubby hands

166
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,125
until nothing is
left but piss.

167
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,208
But now...

168
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,708
The judgment of
all humans has begun.

169
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,750
My life, it's just starting.

170
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,083
There's still
things I need to do!

171
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,458
I need to marry a girl!
Grow my first moustache!

172
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,083
But now you're tellin' me that
someone's making a big hole,

173
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,041
so that pretty soon a whole
buncha' demons just like Toguro

174
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,708
can start attacking
us all at once?

175
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,083
And then there's
the A and S guys

176
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,500
not even Spirit
World can control?!

177
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
Has hope truly left us??

178
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,208
Is this the end
of everything??!!

179
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,833
[GENKAI] Get over it.

180
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,958
We'll talk about
our plan in a minute.

181
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,833
But I need to
rescue Kaitou first.

182
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,208
Oh right, the bookworm.
I forgot about him.

183
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,875
A full house.

184
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,833
I take it everything went just
as you planned, Master Genkai.

185
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,166
[KURAMA] You
played your part well.

186
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,000
You lost, but it was a
stirring introduction.

187
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,166
I wasn't playing along,

188
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,333
I tried my hardest
to defeat you.

189
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,458
For once I wanted
to see you lose,

190
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,041
but I'll just have to
wait a little longer.

191
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,000
Nice thinking brain boy, so
you put your soul on the line

192
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,125
because he's beaten you
on some math quizzes?

193
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,125
What if grandma hadn't
been here to save you?

194
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,875
Simple. He would have
faded into nothing.

195
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,291
Kaitou's a risk taker.

196
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,541
That's why these three
came to me for help.

197
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
He'd removed his own soul,

198
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,750
and they didn't know
how to put it back.

199
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,041
A soul is fragile without a
body or ghost to protect it.

200
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,708
In one full day,
it would break apart.

201
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,750
And yet, your curious
mind could not help

202
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,208
but pose the question.

203
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,083
Real discovery takes risk.

204
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,291
I had to know what would
happen if I broke my own rule.

205
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,000
Let me introduce myself
formally to the group.

206
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,833
My name is Yuu Kaitou,
I have the power of Taboo.

207
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,916
My name's Asato Kido, 
my power is Shadow.

208
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,166
Mitsunari Yanagisawa, 
and I call my talent Copy.

209
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,083
Like I told you, they
all live in Mushiyori City.

210
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,083
It's been a full month since
they developed their powers,

211
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
and there are many
others like them.

212
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,375
That's only a few weeks

213
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,625
after the closing of
the Dark Tournament.

214
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,750
Yeah, and that was the
beginning of Stage Two, right?

215
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,833
So that means it was just
days after I fought Toguro

216
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,958
when this whole tunnel
business got started.

217
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,208
[beeping]

218
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,500
Koenma's not wasting
any time, either.

219
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,958
[KOENMA] We've just
finished calculating

220
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
the growth rate
on that tunnel, guys.

221
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,458
It's bad.

222
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,666
As is, it will reach
Stage Four in three weeks.

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,791
Only three weeks?

224
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,208
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Three weeks...

225
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,958
Even Toguro gave me
more warning than that.

226
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,666
And there was only one of him.

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,875
There's gotta be
something we can do!

228
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,125
Can't you like close
the hole back up?

229
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,958
[KOENMA] The only way is
to stop the tunnel's creator.

230
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,416
This isn't a normal hole, 
it's not physical yet.

231
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,708
It's a distortion
in space-time,

232
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,791
one point three
kilometers wide.

233
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,958
But once it hits two
kilometers, it stabilizes,

234
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,416
changing from energy
conduit to a physical space.

235
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,333
You don't use a drill
to make a hole like this.

236
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,625
You use a psychic,
nested at the center-point.

237
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,000
So you know where the guy is,

238
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,125
and if he's beat
down we're all okay?

239
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Then all I have to do is
turn his brain into mush!

240
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,166
Not so fast, Yusuke.

241
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,291
You guys know the
city, right?

242
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,125
So then take me
to that hole.

243
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Damn it! What is this?
Be a Bitch Day??

244
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,583
Here's a brilliant concept!
Try learning from your mistakes!

245
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,541
What I wouldn't give for
a successor with a brain.

246
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,458
You know how much I trouble I
went to, planning this ordeal?

247
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,750
The whole point of tonight
was to teach you one thing.

248
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,375
You cannot go into this

249
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,541
without understanding
your enemy's powers.

250
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,000
You will lose!

251
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,791
[YUSUKE] And you've
gone deaf again!

252
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,625
Koenma said
we can't wait!

253
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,000
[KUWABARA] If the tunnel
completes we're doomed!

254
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,791
That still allows
us three weeks.

255
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,125
And three questions to answer...

256
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,000
How many fighters
in their group?

257
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,208
Who is their leader?

258
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,416
And what's the true
nature of their powers?

259
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,166
Without those answers,
attacking would be suicide.

260
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,166
[HIEI]
Koenma.

261
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,625
If these fools are done,
I have my own question.

262
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,833
In what class do you rank me?

263
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,666
[KURAMA] Hiei...

264
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,250
What? It's a fair question.

265
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,916
If his Spirit World lackeys are
going to place a letter on me,

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,208
then I deserve to know.

267
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,041
[KOENMA] Oh very well,
Hiei. I'll tell you.

268
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,291
As I've said,

269
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,583
the Toguro Brothers were
considered in upper B.

270
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,833
And as of the end of
the Dark Tournament,

271
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,458
you are ranked in the
middle of B-Class.

272
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,083
Underestimate me even now?

273
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,750
For the record,
when you fought Yusuke,

274
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,166
you only had an upper
D-Class ranking.

275
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
But in less than a year,

276
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,000
you've jumped up
nearly two full classes.

277
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,291
Quite an astounding
feat, to be sure.

278
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,041
You have much to be proud of.

279
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,791
You're a child.
Don't father me.

280
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,625
Come on...

281
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,583
You already have your fox,
your clown, and your hag.

282
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm a moot point.

283
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,708
[KUWABARA] You're just
gonna walk away??

284
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,166
This is your world
to look after, not mine.

285
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,416
I don't intend to
hinder your cause,

286
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,791
but I am not going
to help it, either.

287
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,666
Coward! Real men help
where they're needed.

288
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,583
Save that idealism
for your fairy tales.

289
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,958
Well I'm not gonna
shed any tears, Hiei!

290
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,958
In fact, I'm happy you're gone!!

291
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,708
He's the same selfish
punk he was from the start.

292
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,291
Yeah, he's the same.

293
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,916
He'll come rescue us at the
end when he need him the most.

294
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,125
It's hard to predict
what he'll do.

295
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,916
Humanity's destruction
was Hiei's former dream.

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,333
These new developments
leave him much to consider.

297
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,333
[KOENMA] Maybe I
should have told him

298
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,000
he was in the upper B-Class.

299
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,458
Or the special upper B-Class.
That sounds good!

300
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,500
[BLUE OGRE THINKS]
I need a new job.

301
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,500
[KUWABARA]
So, what now?

302
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,958
We move into the city at
sunrise and begin scouting.

303
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,000
These three will go with us.
They could be of some use.

304
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,916
You guys game for that?

305
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,583
What do you think?
It's our home town, man.

306
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,583
We're not gonna watch it
turn into some demon parade.

307
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,708
Yes, we've already been
given our powers.

308
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,083
The way I see it,

309
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,916
we can either help out the
humans or the demons,

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
and to tell you the truth,
I prefer my own kind.

311
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,750
Same goes for me. I'm not
letting anybody take my turf.

312
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,541
Nice, now the next
job for all of you

313
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,125
is to get what sleep you can.

314
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,958
In the morning we'll
divide into two teams

315
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,541
so we can cover more territory.

316
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,083
Until we know more,

317
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,125
no one goes home and
no one leaves the group.

318
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,000
Goodnight.

319
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,416
[KUWABARA] We're all sleeping
in this freaky house?

320
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,750
But I didn't bring
my special pillow!

321
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,708
[KUWABARA] Um, Botan, would you
pet my hair until I fall asleep?

322
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,791
[Slap]

323
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,208
[BOTAN] Yukina wouldn't
appreciate that!

324
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,125
[KUWABARA] I meant in
a mom kind of way!

325
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,291
[SENSUI]
Itsuki, how's it coming?

326
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,250
Mr. Sensui...

327
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,208
We have an obstacle.

328
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,125
[SENSUI]
Tell me.

329
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,375
[ITSUKI]
A Kekkai Barrier.

330
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,166
So strong, it's intoxicating.
I can't break it.

331
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,500
We need someone else,
Mr. Sensui,

332
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,375
someone with talent like my own.

333
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,625
So while I concentrate
on the tunnel,

334
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,291
they slice open the net.

335
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,208
Then we can
raise our glasses.

336
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,000
Someone who can break
a Kekkai Barrier.

337
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,333
Very well, I know people.
I'll find your man.

338
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,916
And in the mean time,

339
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,333
I'll start judgment on
anyone who's in our way.

340
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,208
[KEIKO]
Puu?

341
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
You look horrible,
what's wrong?

342
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,125
[PUU]
Puu!

343
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,458
[PUU]
Puu!

344
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,666
You don't forget that beak.

345
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,791
[SHIZURU]
Hey, sweetheart.

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,166
Shizuru!

347
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,750
I talked to Yusuke's mom.

348
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,000
He never came home last night,
and Puu's acting really strange.

349
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,083
Yeah, Kazuma didn't
come home, either.

350
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,375
Wanna play follow
the pudge-ball?

351
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,083
If it's anything
like usual,

352
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,916
he should take us right
to Yusuke and my bro.

353
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,166
Is something
wrong, Shizuru?

354
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,666
That's a nice way
to put it,

355
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,166
I just got an awful
premonition...

356
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,791
Even worse than
the tournament.

357
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,875
[KEIKO THINKS] Yusuke...

358
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,750
[YUSUKE] How come every case I
get is even more impossible

359
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,333
than the last??

360
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,125
I think Koenma hates me.

361
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,041
We'll make the sunrise
march into Mushuyori City,

362
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,833
and humans with insane
powers are everywhere.

363
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,541
We can't tell
who's on our side

364
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,000
and who's fighting
for the demons,

365
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,000
and there's no time
to figure it out!

366
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,291
Every minute the
tunnel's getting bigger,

367
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,458
and the mastermind
is coming for us.

368
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,583
Who's he gonna get
to slash the barrier?

369
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,500
And how am I gonna
punch him in the face?

370
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,666
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
