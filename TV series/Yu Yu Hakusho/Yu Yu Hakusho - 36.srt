00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,041
Let me show you
my modifications!

161
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,166
Amazing!

162
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,583
Ichigaki's stretching out
his arm like it's warm putty!

163
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,208
Yusuke!

164
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,916
[YUSUKE] Hiei, wait.
I've got dibs on this jerk.

165
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,041
Yusuke's back up!

166
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,166
Despite the delicious outpouring
of blood from his arm!

167
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,166
And what's more, he's
asking Hiei to withdraw!

168
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,833
Does he really want to take
this beast on by himself?

169
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,000
Just don't get killed.

170
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,833
Go ahead then. Defy all logic!

171
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,958
What's this?

172
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,791
That was for the three
innocent lives you stole!

173
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,250
[YUSUKE] And this one's for
screwing with their master!

174
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,875
Nicely put.

175
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,541
And this is for my friend
who felt sorry for them

176
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,750
and got his ass kicked
into the ground!

177
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,041
Thanks for the
shout out Urameshi.

178
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,916
And the last one's for me!

179
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,250
Just for pissing me off!

180
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,250
[Dr. Ichigaki cries out]

181
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,208
Now you go think about
what you've done Dr. Ichigaki.

182
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,291
[KOTO] Wow,
can I just say--wow?

183
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,375
Doctor Ichigaki has
been totally demolished

184
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,708
by Yusuke's powerful assault!

185
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,333
The crowd is speechless!

186
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
He, he did it!

187
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,458
Finally! Now that's
what I call just deserts!

188
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,041
It doesn't matter.

189
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:27,250
Taking Dr. Ichigaki's life away
is never going them bring back.

190
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,875
Yen. Ryo. Kai.

191
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,250
It's all my fault. How
can I ever forgive myself?

192
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,041
[MASKED FIGHTER] Save your
tears, Mitamura.

193
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,083
Your boys
aren't dead.

194
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,583
Are you kidding?

195
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,500
I-I can move!

196
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,875
Now this is stupid weird!

197
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,000
Kai, Yen!

198
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,583
Hey! Fill me in! I can't
see up there, you know!

199
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,208
We're really alive!

200
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,166
And in complete control!

201
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,833
But, I don't understand.

202
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,625
A few minutes ago their Spirit
Energy was completely AWOL!

203
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,125
[MASKED FIGHTER] Yes,
I guess it worked.

204
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,208
It's been twenty years since
I've used that technique.

205
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,666
I never thought I'd see you.

206
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,083
[M-3]
Master!

207
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,708
[MITAMURA]
Wait! Why do you turn?

208
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,125
We've committed
horrible sins, master.

209
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,250
I can't even remember
all the people that I've--

210
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,625
The lessons that you
taught us didn't mean anything!

211
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,208
We're a disgrace to your dojo!

212
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
Please, just leave us Master.

213
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,125
We can't bear
to look at you now!

214
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,083
Damn it! Why couldn't she
have just killed us!

215
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,916
How can you say such things?

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,541
[MASKED FIGHTER] Your master is
right. Your guilt is misplaced.

217
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,750
The technique I used
is called the Spirit Wave.

218
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,250
It is one of the five
great attacks by trial,

219
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,000
and is powered by
your own Spirit Energy.

220
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,250
If your souls are corrupt,

221
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,250
then the wickedness
will take your life.

222
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,875
But if you are pure of heart,

223
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,000
then that purity consumes you,

224
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,708
destroying any
outside impediments.

225
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,833
It was your soul that
destroyed the Verruca

226
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,750
and freed you, not me.

227
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,500
That proves you
have nothing to hide.

228
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,583
Yen, Ryo, Kai. She says
what I've known all along.

229
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,500
If there was anything
you could have done

230
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,458
to prevent those
kills, you would have.

231
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,708
[MITAMURA] Your
bodies were taken over.

232
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,000
But who you really are--
your souls--are still clean.

233
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,708
I see you in the same
way now as I always have.

234
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,458
As my three most noble students.

235
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,750
Let's put this behind us!

236
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,958
[ALL]
Master!

237
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,875
[M-1]
We missed you so much!

238
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,625
Master, is it true? Are you
really going to be okay again?

239
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,458
Yes, I think so.

240
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,291
Well mystery lady
that was some attack.

241
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,958
You have done us well, Fighter.

242
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,250
They're so happy!

243
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,333
How come you never
talk to me like that, Ogre?!

244
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,833
They're all okay.

245
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,083
I think letting those
guys beat the snot out of me

246
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,916
is the best
thing I've ever done.

247
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,166
[KOTO] And so, in a
dramatic explosion of emotion

248
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,875
fit to make any demon wretch,

249
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,208
the Urameshi Team
is set to advance!

250
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,666
But the price of victory
hasn't been cheap!

251
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,583
Kuwabara's injuries look severe!

252
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,166
So how's he doing?

253
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,083
Not too great.

254
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,666
It's nothing life threatening

255
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,791
but he's clearly going
to need time to recover.

256
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,625
Time, huh?

257
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,958
Yusuke!

258
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,041
Maybe I could
be of some help!

259
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,416
I'd like to repay
you if it's possible.

260
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,375
We're the ones
who hurt Kuwabara!

261
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,750
Let me fight in his place.
I'll join as your substitute!

262
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,416
Well thanks for the offer.

263
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,666
But this dufus would have
a fit if I gave his spot away.

264
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,375
You understand?

265
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,833
Plus, we're only
allowed one substitute.

266
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,333
And only after one
of our guys is dead.

267
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,166
Urameshi, I'm not dead yet.

268
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,041
Well folks, it's official!

269
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,083
Come on. Let's get
Lazarus off the grass.

270
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,500
You're a good man, but
we got to go this alone.

271
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,291
[M-3]
I understand.

272
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,666
Take care of your master.

273
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,333
I'd say he's the one
that needs you most now.

274
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,041
Right?

275
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,000
Of course, well good luck.

276
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,708
Maybe we'll see
you again someday!

[angry crowd]

278
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,416
Oh shove it where it hurts!

280
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,000
[SPEAKER] May I have
your attention please.

281
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,041
The third round of
the Dark Tournament

282
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,833

The Tournament Committee

00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,583
to begin the round in accordance
to the match diagram,

287
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,166
starting from the left.

288
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,916
Team Urameshi and Team Masho,
please report to the ring.

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,250
What? Again?

290
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,416
Hey! Why don't you tell
your stupid friends up there

291
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,250
to let one of the
other teams fight!

292
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,250
I'm sorry sir.

293
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,541
If you have a complaint

294
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,083
you'll have to take
it up with the committee.

295
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,708
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good reason for their decision!

296
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,583
Get over there and fight
you ignorant little cry-babys!

297
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,083
This is a demon's tournament!
You're fighting under our rules!

298
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,125
It's perfect! Kill 'em
while they're all worn out!

299
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,875
Rip off their ugly heads!

300
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,750
[MASKED FIGHTER THINKS]
I suspected they'd pull this.

301
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,208
Two of our members are hurt,

302
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,458
and after the
Spirit Wave technique,

303
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,500
I will be of
little help as well.

304
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,416
Yes. Your luck
is very poor, Yusuke.

305
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,583
But think of how
much stronger you'll be

306
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,625
when you meet me in the end.

307
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,708
Okay, if a doubleheader's
the call I might as well enjoy.

308
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,916
I've got plenty of anger left
from the troll doctor, anyway.

[angry crowd]

310
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,416
[KUWABARA]
Botan, help me.

311
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,833
It's about to start. I need
you to help me get there.

312
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,833
[BOTAN] No can do, sport.
You're in no shape to fight!

313
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,208
The best thing you can do
now is focus on your recovery.

314
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,000
But we're all stuck in
this thing together, Botan!

315

I can't just lie
down in some sickbed

00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,458
and listen to my teammates
fighting for their lives!

317
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,208
Team Masho! This is your final
call! Enter or be disqualified!

318
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,250
[KOTO] And here
they are, people!

319
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,000
Appearing in the same mysterious
fashion as always! Team Masho!

320
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,250
Why do you I get the feeling.
This is gonna be a tough one?

321
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,708
[NARRATOR] As the powers
residing over the tournament

322
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,416
continue to rule against them,

323
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,083
Yusuke and his haggard team

324
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,416
must begin a new battle while
still exhausted from the last.

325
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,916
The opponent is Team Masho.

326
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,291
What secrets do they hold?

327
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,208
[KOENMA] Koenma here,
and I'm pretty peeved.

328
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,416
My team's match

329
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,208
against the strange
Team Masho is beginning,

330
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,791
and Kurama is
stepping up first.

331
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,125
Everyone in this wicked sect

332
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,916
is a skilled
master of something,

333
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,833
and for Gama, it
happens to be makeup.

334
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,166
Weird and harmless enough,

335
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,583
unless this demon paint

336
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,666
can paralyze any part of a
fighter's body it touches!

337
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,291
See Kurama fight
for his life

338
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,125
while unable to
use his legs or arms!

339
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,833
While outside the ring,

340
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,958
Hiei and the Masked
Fighter succumb to a very,

341
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,041
how do you say,
provocative trap.

342
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,083
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!

343
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:27,750
