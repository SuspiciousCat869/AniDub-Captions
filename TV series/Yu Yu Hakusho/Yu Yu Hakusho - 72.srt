00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,791
Yeah, right.

158
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,125
Got it?

159
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,250
He doesn't know anything.
Just a guy like us.

160
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,833
Let's wake him, he could
still be of some use to us.

161
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,333
Is it cool if I take the
rest of the day off, boss?

162
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,916
I think I'm losing my mind.

163
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,666
Nightmare,
just a nightmare.

164
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,166
My life's
improving, sir!

165
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,166
All these humans with
different special powers,

166
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
and Yusuke's kicking
so much tail.

167
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,208
And I'm the only one here
you've called by name!

168
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,000
Koenma.

169
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,666
[KOENMA]
Yes, Kurama. Report.

170
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,541
[KURAMA]
The center-point was barren.

171
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,208
But I think it may be possible
they've encamped underground.

172
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,000
Very clever.

173
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,958
[KURAMA] That's not all. It
appears we're being followed.

174
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,458
What?

175
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,291
I'm not sure, but I'm rejoining
the teams just to be safe.

176
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,125
[KOENMA] Understood.
Yo, Ayame!

177
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,250
Sir?

178
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,083
[KOENMA] I want a depth
analysis on that center-point.

179
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,291
Sewers, caves,
everything, Ayame.

180
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,125
Okay?

181
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,541
Of course, sir.

182
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,916
Her name.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,541
And for a moment there,
you made me feel special.

184
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,208
So how does it
work, Murota.

185
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,750
I mean, in a crowd like
this, who do you hear?

186
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,583
Every thought that's
within thirty yards of me.

187
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:19,083
It all comes at once, like
it's one big conversation.

188
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,416
[MAN 1 THINKS] Stupid boss.
I'll move up his deadline.

189
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,125
[MAN 2 THINKS] Gotta get money.
Gotta get money.

190
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,125
Gotta get the money.
Gotta get the money.

191
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,208
[WOMAN 1 THINKS] Ugly creep.
How 'bout I mace you!

192
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,625
[MAN 3 THINKS] She looked
at me! Wow, she's hot!

193
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,708
[MUROTA] The more intense
the thought, the louder

194
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,541
it sounds to me, like it's
screamed over a crowded room.

195
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,666
It's painful sometimes.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,250
Tough luck, don't
be a baby about it.

197
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,291
Now you've got
some scouting to do.

198
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,791
Check everyone's thoughts

199
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,750
and tell us if you
hear something weird.

200
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,750
But don't show it
on your face,

201
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,000
and do not make eye
contact with them.

202
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,083
They have powers, too.

203
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,375
They'll sense they're in your
Territory, just like we did.

204
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,250
I'll... try.

205
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,250
What's up?

206
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,666
You found one?

207
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,791
[MUROTA] That girl...

208
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,250
She's going to make
out with her teacher!

209
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,041
We've got to stop her!
Or watch!

210
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,875
We're trying to save humanity!

211
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,416
Hey... Wait a sec.
You really want to kill me.

212
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,666
Did you have to read my mind
to figure that one out?!!

213
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,041
And I might help him.

214
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,833
No, please! I'm sorry!

215
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,791
Your ass parks here
'till you find something.

216
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,041
Yes sir.

217
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,083
So how's it coming along?
Have you found anything out yet?

218
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,833
Murota?

219
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,583
[MUROTA]
Yeah, I found something.

220
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,666
[wicked laughter]

221
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,208
[VOICE] I'll kill them all.
Women and kids, sickly old men.

222
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,583
Until every foot
of dirt is a grave.

223
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,000
Then I'll stack them on top.

224
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,416
I'll kill them all.

225
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll kill them all.

226
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,166
I'll kill them all.

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,375
I'll kill them all.
I'll kill them all.

228
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,125
I'll kill them all!!!

229
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,625
Shut up or they're
going to find you!

230
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,750
[MUROTA] I'm sorry, I can't
take it. The voice is too loud.

231
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,208
But it's quiet, too...

232
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,291
Savage and dark...

233
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
Please, let me go!

234
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,166
Don't worry,
I'll handle him.

235
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,500
Just tell me who he is,
and don't point.

236
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,041
[MUROTA] He's coming from
the right. Tall guy, in black.

237
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,708
His hair's slicked back.

238
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,333
[crowd reacts in shock]

239
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,125
Damn it!

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,458
[SENSUI] We'll call that my
introduction, Yusuke Urameshi.

241
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,833
[YUSUKE THINKS] He's the
leader, he has to be.

242
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:26,666
Hey...

243
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,083
[KIDO] What do we do?

244
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,333
[YANAGISAWA] The hospital!
Someone call an ambulance!

245
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
[sirens blasting]

246
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,791
[KIDO] How is he?
You think he'll make it?

247
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,708
I don't know. Not many people
survive a bullet to the brain.

248
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,875
That's true, Yana,
but he'll be fine.

249
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,041
This is the so-called
bullet he took.

250
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,833
Doesn't look
like metal.

251
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,291
[GENKAI] It's a pencil eraser.

252
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,208
That's crazy.

253
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,375
Are you sure?

254
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,458
Score one for
old number two.

255
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,958
So the guy got his head
cracked open by a pencil top?

256
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,125
That's right.

257
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,083
It's a warning.

258
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,291
I swear we've caught
every red light.

259
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,041
How can we find Yusuke
and your brother now, Shizuru?

260
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,458
We can't even find Puu.

261
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,166
Chill, princess.

262
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,583
We saw the blue wonder fly
off in this direction.

263
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,333
Besides, knowing my brother,

264
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,916
we can just follow
the bugs...

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,541
He's probably playing
with them.

266
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,083
[KEIKO]
Bugs? What bugs?

267
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,666
[SHIZURU THINKS] Right...

268
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,833
No wonder she's not
flipping out.

269
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,250
[KEIKO] Come on, Shizuru,
what are you talking about?

270
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,166
Nothing.
Just a fly.

271
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,250
[Ambulance siren]

272
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,041
Somebody's hurt.

273
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,875
Don't look now.

274
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,583
[PUU]
Puu!

275
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,291
Puu!

276
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,291
Either he's taken up ambulance
chasing, or Yusuke's inside.

277
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,125
Wait, Keiko! We don't
know for sure!

278
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,708
[PUU]
Puu!

279
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,166
Hello, Sniper.

280
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,083
Yusuke didn't
follow you as planned.

281
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,541
No. He kept his cool.
I was most surprised.

282
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,625
Sea Man is shadowing
Kurama's group.

283
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,125
He's waiting for orders.

284
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,791
And Yusuke's team is
entering the hospital.

285
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,708
Doctor will intercept them
shortly, as you've arranged.

286
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,541
[SENSUI] One of our
enemies might be the one.

287
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:46,666
As you recall, our psychic has
a problem with a Kekkai Barrier.

288
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,708
Even if he completes the tunnel,

289
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,083
the best destroyers
won't be able to cross.

290
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,208
We need another psychic
to break the net.

291
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,916
And we may have found
one in this group.

292
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,250
Who is it?

293
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,000
You leave that business to me.

294
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,083
In the mean time, let's
get rid of the extras.

295
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's dig a hole, Sniper.
Each one of us.

296
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,250
Seven graves will
be a decent start.

297
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,625
Let's dig a hole, Sniper.
Each one of us.

298
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,750
Seven graves will
be a decent start.

299
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,125
Black Angel, Gate Keeper,
Sniper, Gourmet, Game Master,

300
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,833
Doctor, and Sea Man.

301
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,125
Those were the words that
came to his mind when

302
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,375
he said the word seven.

303
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,833
[YUSUKE] Sounds like fun.

304
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
But what does it mean?

305
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,333
Are those the names of the
guys who are makin' this tunnel?

306
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,916
I mean, there's
seven of 'em?

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,458
[YUSUKE]
Seven, is that all?

308
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,208
Wait, I don't know.

309
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,583
That's just what I heard
in the back of his mind,

310
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,208
like a speech he was preparing.

311
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,833
Everything else was just
this terrible hatred,

312
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,708
and an urge to kill.

313
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,916
Gourmet, Doctor,
Gate Keeper.

314
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,541
Those all gotta be
nicknames, right?

315
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,750
Well of course...

316
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,000
And more than likely
they are clues

317
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,500
to each of their
particular abilities.

318
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,833
By the way, Yusuke, you did
well with that confrontation.

319
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,791
You finally showed patience.

320
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,416
You didn't start
punching like a moron.

321
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,500
'Cause I think I was
afraid of him.

322
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,750
I sensed it right when we met.

323
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,666
There's something
dangerous about him.

324
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,750
[YUSUKE] It's not
what I sensed, though.

325
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,958
It's what I didn't sense.

326
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,750
Like, who I saw
wasn't the real thing.

327
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,625
If Toguro was all about
throwing the fastball,

328
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,916
then this guy definitely
likes the curve.

329
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,958
Yes, and we know he's the
type who saves that pitch

330
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
until the very last inning.

331
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,458
Whatever power is behind
this mystery of his,

332
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,291
he won't reveal it until
he's ready to finish us.

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,208
The fact that he didn't
use his own power

334
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,041
to attack Murota
tells us that.

335
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:56,791
What??

336
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,791
Are you kidding me?

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,791
You mean, the guy
who was standing there

338
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,250
isn't the one who shot him?

339
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,125
[YUSUKE] No.
He didn't do anything at all.

340
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,041
Then you noticed it as well.

341
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,583
[GENKAI]
The angle was wrong.

342
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,291
The shot came from five
feet to the man's right.

343
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,125
Him facing us was
just a go signal.

344
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,166
For whom?

345
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,208
Yeah, so who's
the shooter?

346
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,333
[GENKAI] Let's examine
what we do know.

347
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,958
This eraser has faint
demon trace-marks.

348
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,625
Apparently, the shooter
made it the exact hardness

349
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,041
he desired by coating
it with energy.

350
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,541
Hard enough to break
the skin and scare us,

351
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,125
but too soft to
pierce the skull.

352
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,375
It was launched by telekinesis.

353
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,458
Seconds after the shot fired,

354
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,083
I tried traced it back
toward its origin,

355
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,000
but it was too far.

356
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,416
It must have been fired from
over five hundred yards away.

357
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,625
That's quite a feat.

358
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,375
That's five
football fields!

359
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,333
All with his mind.

360
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,625
If they're all as
strong as this triggerman...

361
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,166
Yeah I gotcha.
We're in a world of hurt.

362
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,166
[MUROTA] No...Enough!

363
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,666
I didn't sign up for
any of this, you people!

364
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,208
I'm not a hero!
I don't want to die!

365
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,958
[NARRATOR] Only hours into their
infiltration of Mushiyori City,

366
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,750
Yusuke and his team have
already found themselves

367
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,083
in the thick of danger.

368
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,791
But unexpectedly, it is
they who are being hunted,

369
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,041
by seven enemies
they do not know.

370
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,833
In a city once
dull and peaceful,

371
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,333
a battle of worlds
is poised to begin.

372
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,708
[BOTAN] Next time
on Yu Yu Hakusho,

373
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,166
we'll find ourselves
falling deeper

374
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,833
into an inescapable trap.

375
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
Kido's very survival
is in question,

376
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,666
as the psychic known as Doctor
springs on Yusuke's group.

377
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,333
Meanwhile, with the tunnel
to Demon World expanding,

378
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,500
the spawning insects become
yet another lethal threat.

379
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,416
Can Yusuke survive the predator

380
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
in the hospital's
maze-like halls?

381
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,916
And don't forget
about my group!

382
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,583
We're being stalked as well!

383
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,333
Next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
