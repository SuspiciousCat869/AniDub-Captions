You are the one.

[RAIZEN]
At Last.

00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,583
You don't know how
to use your power.

00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,916
Let me show you.

[DEMON] Shut up.
This doesn't concern you.

Outta the way, dumbass!

12
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,041
I'd just finished
shooting my Spirit Gun,

13
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,291
but I realized I wasn't
the one who fired it.

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,750
If my ancestor is here and still
alive, we have to find him!

15
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,916
Oh... come on Urameshi!

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,666
We closed the case
and saved the world.

17

Can't we at least take a nap?

18
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,916
I'm not gonna rest until I
get to the bottom of this.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,416
My ancestor got in
the way of my fight,

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,291
and I can't let him
get away with that.

You know, Yusuke...

...you may want to give
this decision more thought.

23
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,125
You can go back to
Living World now,

24
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,541
or stay here in
Demon World forever.

25
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,458
But you have to choose.

[KOENMA] I'll give you a couple
minutes to think it over Yusuke.

Ha! I don't need it. I've
already made up my mind.

You... look good.

Yeah, well, I thought
I'd try a change.

Oh, Yusuke. Always
stopping my heart!

Though it's not always because
of makeovers! What happened?

42
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,083
I'm having flashbacks of Rando.

43
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,416
Man, I would kill for my
hair to grow that fast.

44
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Those marks. Are they
tribal incantations?

45
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,208
Is this a press conference?
Give me a break.

46
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,041

Koenma,

00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,000
You know Spirit World
won't overlook this treason.

00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,458
Treason?

54
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,125
You have disobeyed my orders,

delivered directly from your
father, to erase that boy.

56
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,291
You've let the Mazoku emerge,

fully knowing what
that could bring.

58

You'll take responsibility
and come with us.

Yes, I'm no fool, Ootake.

00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,583

pissing me off,

different thing!

And since you're all new here,
I'll give you a tip.

Threatening the guy
who helped save us

00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,583
will definitely piss me off.

he could to help,

what it takes to protect him,

Each time you do,
you'll put a big neon sign

above you for stray
Demons to flock to.

see you eaten alive.

stepping on their shadows.

322

Mitsunari Yanagisawa.

323
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,208
Able to replicate the
appearance, voice,

finger prints, and even the
memories of whomever he touches.

Yuu Kaitou.

326

Inside his
intellectual territory,

327
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,875
no one can commit a violent act,

328
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,541
and if you utter the Taboo
words, your soul is taken away.

training under Genkai,

use their powers again.

Later, they graduate school
and lead normal lives.

But that's not
all of our story...

I was wondering if you'd
just dumped me here.

00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,916
[KURAMA] Koenma felt
that we should lay low,

[HIEI]
Hmph.

340
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,583
So, you have the
infamous Chapter Black?

341
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,500
I can only imagine what
you could do with that.

342
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,916
Demons would pay a high price.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
[KURAMA]
Humanity's worst crimes,

344
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,916
including what they've
done to Demons.

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,416
Could spark a newer,
stronger rebellion.

346
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,916
Just think...

347
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,083
Or perhaps you would just
want to keep it for yourself,

348
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,625
and watch it weekly.

349
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,291
After all, It's what you've
been searching for, isn't it?

350
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,166
A concrete reason
to hate all humans

351
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,333
and justify anything you do.

352
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,666
Damn it, my sword
must have slipped.

It's so quiet.

Really, Shinobu.

357

That's been my only
complaint about you.

358
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,750
You've always been insistent
on doing these things

359
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,750
to ease your soul.

360

When the answer to your sadness
was right beside you all along.

You just wouldn't see it.

362
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,750
I guess I have always
resented you some for that.

363
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,291
But you're right,
we shouldn't fight.

364

You've seen the error
of your ways now

Forgive me for speaking
out now, your majesty.

admit this to him myself,
