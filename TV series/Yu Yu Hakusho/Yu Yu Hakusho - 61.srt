[Toguro 1 cries out]

157
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,166
[KOTO] The usually rather
vibrant crowd looks on

158
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,375
in stunned silence.

159
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
I don't think anybody
saw that one coming.

160
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,833
Especially not Toguro
who's been blown

161
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,166
right out of the stadium!

162
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,625
I knew that the boy could do it.

163
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,000
Where am I? And who am I?

164
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,791
Hey lady get up, and snap out
of it! You've got a job to do!

165
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,375
There's a fighter
outta the ring

166
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,666
and you'd better start countin'
like you're always doin' for me!

167
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,250
Take a moment to look
where Yusuke's standing.

168
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,666
[KUWABARA] Hey! How the heck
do you get back in the ring?

169
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,208
[KURAMA] In this final battle,
there will be no boundaries.

170
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,000
The only rule is
kill or be killed.

171
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,041
Wow! Now that's an
attack to remember!

172
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,208
I'm so happy I got
beat by Urameshi

173
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,833
before he got the
super powers.

174
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, if he was that strong
when I fought with him,

175
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,458
that'd by my
clacker on the barbie

176
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,833
and I'd be sittin' here today
on two extra-toasty buns!

177
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,916
I can see now that
I underestimated him.

178
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But I don't know it
all just seems short

179
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,916
of the spit to me, somehow.

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,750
We won! That'll show
those nay saying demon fans!

181
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,541
Well, that's done,
let's pack up,

182
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,625
grab some over-priced souvenirs
and forget our heartbreak.

183
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,166
Puu! Puu!

184
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,083
Yusuke is much stronger now

185
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,666
than I ever imagined
a human could be.

186
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,958
[KURAMA]
Yet...

187
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,083
Toguro didn't even bother
to block his attack.

188
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,166
[HIEI] If Toguro can escape a
blast that powerful unscathed,

189
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,000
there's no telling what
else he might be capable of.

190
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,416
Look, will you stop being

191
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,833
such a glass-is-half-empty
kinda guy for two seconds?

192
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,958
Accept it! There's
absolutely no way in heck

193
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,791
that guy's ever coming back in
anything other than an ashtray.

194
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,958
[YUSUKE THINKS] No.

195
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:05,250
Is that all you've got for me?
I expected more from Genkai.

196
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,958
He's invincible! That's the
only explanation for it.

197
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,666
[KOENMA] That's not good.

198
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,250
Whoa! Look at it people!

199
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,458
Toguro has miraculously
risen from the dead.

200
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,375
Runs in the family I guess.

201
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,666
There's not so much as a
scratch on this giant brute,

202
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,375
the only difference
is his shades are gone!

203
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,833
And what piercing
eyes he has!

204
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,458
[YUSUKE THINKS] Damn it! He just
dissolved my energy shield

205
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,000
with a mere flex of his power.

206
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm gonna have to
throw it into gear

207
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,000
if I wanna stick
around and get this done.

208
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,750
[TOGURO 2]
I was foolish to depend on

209
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,791
you rising to this occasion.

210
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,708
I wanted to test you to see if
you were really strong enough

211
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,333
to compete with me.

212
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,375
Obviously my standing here
means that you've failed,

213
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,500
So there's no need for
me to go to full power.

214
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,166
I'll finish
this as I am.

215
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,333
[NARRATOR] Even possessing
the Spirit Energy of Genkai,

216
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:35,041
Yusuke seems unable to inflict
any damage on the mighty Toguro.

217
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,000
Can this possibly be
the end of our hero?

218
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,291
Will he avenge
his master's death,

219
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,833
or join her as one of
Toguro's many victims?

220
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:48,625
The clash of these two
great warriors wages on!

221
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,291
[YUSUKE] Hey guys! I'd say
it's goin' pretty well.

222
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,875
I'm getting' in some
pretty good cracks in.

223
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,791
But this Toguro guy
isn't that tough.

224
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,583
Look, he's even starting
to show his vulnerable side.

225
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,041
Hmm. Strike that.

226
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,875
Guess we'll
finally see that 100%

227
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,500
he's bragged about after all.

228
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,208
Probably intimidated by
my sheer brute strength.

229
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,666
Yeah, that's it.

230
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,166
I'm not worried, even if my
friends and teammates are.

231
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,125
See, I'm hiding
something myself.

232
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,958
These people can't
believe what they're seeing

233
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:20,875
and neither will you,
next time on Yu Yu Hakusho!
