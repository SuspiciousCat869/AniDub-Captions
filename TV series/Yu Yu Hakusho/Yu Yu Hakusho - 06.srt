158
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,958
I'm afraid we have
more to discuss!

159
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,416
He really tried to set me up!!

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,250
You've been freed from the
charge. Now go to work!

161
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,458
Okay, okay I'll get to it!
But before that, he pays.

162
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,416
That's not smart policy Yusuke.

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,208
Assaulting a teacher
when you've been set free!

164
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,208
I can't just let
him go like that!

165
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,666
Then attack him invisibly.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,333
Give me a break!
Do I look invisible?!

167
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,916
It's one of your new abilities.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,041
Try to take control
of your Spirit Energy

169
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,500
and then gather as
much as you can

170
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,625
into your right index finger.

171
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,583
Hey. It's getting warm!

172
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,500
Good, now all you have
to do is aim and shoot.

173
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,750
Imagine the trigger in your mind
and then pull it tight.

174
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,250
Pull, huh?

175
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,125
Iwamoto!

176
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,375
Iwamoto, are you
alright? What happened?

177
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,666
It worked.

178
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,041
It's your Spirit Gun.

179
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,458
My what?

180
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,458
[KOENMA] A human being,
as I've explained before,

181
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,541
emits both body
and spirit energy.

182
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,125
While a ghost, you became more
aware of your Spirit Energy,

183
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,958
and can channel it into your
finger, hence the Spirit Gun.

184
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,916
It's far more powerful
than a normal punch,

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,125
but until you increase your
spirit muscle, so to speak,

186
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,416
you can only use it once a day.

187
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,666
[KOENMA] Your chief concern
will be recovering the items.

188
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,708
The Shadow Sword will make a
monster from whoever it cuts.

189
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,458
The Forlorn Hope emits a
cryptic power at full moon.

190
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,333
And the Orb of Baast
can capture living souls,

191
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,458
especially those of children.

192
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,083
[YUSUKE] Cheery.
Who came up with that one?

193
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,291
[KOENMA]
Understand, Yusuke.

194
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,041
These artifacts were
forged from darkness,

195
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,125
and prey on the
weak and desperate.

196
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,458
They were created eons ago
by the universe itself,

197
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,958
and serve a vital role
in balancing life.

198
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,083
But in the wrong hands
they can also destroy

199
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
and tip the scale towards evil.

200
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,125
Get them Yusuke.

201
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,541
As a living human you're
the best chance we've got

202
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,916
while they're on Earth.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,125
Don't say anything more.

204
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,125
You brought me back
to life, right?

205
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,166
Well I'm guessing I can
do something useful

206
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,708
to earn my keep.

207
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,875
It's in your hands, Yusuke.

208
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,875
All these rich kids.

209
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,958
All shopping.

210
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,125
How does Koenma expect me
to find them in this mess?

211
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,541
Some help he was!

212
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,791
We think they're somewhere
in uptown, he says.

213
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,041
Hello, that
feels a little awkward.

214
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,583
[PEDESTRIAN 1] Someone call
an ambulance! It's a kid!

215
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,750
[PEDESTRIAN 2]
What happened?

216
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,458
[PEDESTRIAN 1]
I don't know. He fainted!

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,833
[KOENMA] The Orb of
Baast can capture living souls,

218
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,916
especially those of children.

219
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,291
I think that's what
they call a lead, folks.

220
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,958
[YUSUKE]
Hey! Wait up!

221
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,041
[YUSUKE THINKS] Uptown
became downtown real quick.

222
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,833
He's a monster!

223
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,333
[YUSUKE THINKS] There it is!
The Orb thingy!

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Here goes.

225
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,250
Hey kid, you got
some cash for me?

226
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,125
Sorry Minor-League,
I don't have time for you.

227
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,333
That's the wrong answer.

228
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,250
Well don't say I didn't
give you guys fair--warning!

229
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,541
[YUSUKE THINKS]
Damn.

230
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,166
Koenma sir. We've got
data on the criminals.

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,875
Good, show me at once.

232
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,416
[OGRE CLERK]
Of course.

233
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,791
[OGRE CLERK] His name's Kurama,
and that's all we know.

234
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,250
Somehow he's avoided
all of our files.

235
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,208
Hiei is another mystery case.

236
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,541
No criminal record,
origin unknown,

237
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,458
though informants all describe
him as a real cut-throat.

238
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,750
Definitely a loner.
Last we've got Gouki.

239
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,541
Now here's your
run-of-the-mill crook.

240
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,125
Twelve previous convictions,

241
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,458
killed his last ten pursuers--
murder seems to be his hobby.

242
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,250
It's a rough bunch, sir.

243
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh yes, I expected as much.

244
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,708
You must be out of your mind!

245
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,416
Botan--you came.

246
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,833
[BOTAN]
Well yes!!

247
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,916
Did you think I wouldn't when
you sent my best project

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,208
to a pack of wolves!

249
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,833
All three of these
criminals are pushing

250
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,541
out tremendous
amounts of energy.

251
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,833
They'll rip Yusuke into pieces!

252
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,625
[KOENMA] Yes yes, I understand
the odds are against him,

253
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,916
and I would have preferred to
start him on smaller cases

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
until his abilities grew.

255
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,583
But with this new case,
I had no choice.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,791
[BOTAN]
Fine. Give him the case.

257
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,083
But at least let me train
him for a while, first.

258
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,541
How much could he learn
in less than a week?

259
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,333
Less than a week?

260
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,166
Surely those criminals
can't cause damage

261
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,583
in that little time, can they?

262
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,333
The crooks aren't
the problem.

263
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,583
In a week my father
comes back from vacation.

264
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,708
King, Yama is coming back?

265
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,125
The one thing he always tells
me is protect the King's Vault.

266
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,041
But I didn't think someone
would actually break in!

267
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:56,125
[BOTAN] Will we be scolded
really badly? Do you think?

268
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,541
I'm afraid ours will
be a minor issue.

269
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,041
If dad gets angry,
the whole world will suffer.

270
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,666
Can't you just, explain it?

271
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,958
You know how my dad can get.

272
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,250
[KOENMA] Everything's fire
and brimstone with him.

273
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,208
He might sink an
entire continent

274
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,666
to get those three
artifacts back!

275
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,666
That's why I had to send Yusuke
out without the proper training,

276
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,125
and that's why he
only has a week

277
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,916
to return those artifacts.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
He's got to,
for the sake of his planet!

279
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,875
Yusuke must defeat
those criminals,

280
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,041
even at the
cost of his own life!

281
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,625
I understand, Koenma.

282
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,791
I'll go back to the living world
and help him as much as I can.

283
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,708
He's our one hope. Don't forget.

284
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,166
[rain pouring]

285
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,333
Great. This stupid rain's
gonna wash away his tracks.

286
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,458
[Gouki laughs creepily]

287
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
[HIEI]
Oh yes. This is perfect.

288
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,958
If the sword can make
demons from trees,

289
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,041
just think what
it'll make from humans.

290
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,708
I say we go to
the next big city

291
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,375
and carve out a
thousand of them.

292
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,041
Imagine raising an
entire demon army!

293
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,625
I like the way you think, Hiei.

294
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
If we teach them to eat souls

295
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,958
I even know how
we'll feed them all.

296
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,875
The Orb of Baast!

297
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,625
And once the
moon becomes full,

298
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
we can use Kurama's weapon

299
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,166
and supposedly get complete
control! Isn't that right?

300
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,625
Sorry, I must withdraw
from this alliance.

301
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,875
[BOTH]
What?

302
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,541
[HIEI] What is that
supposed to mean?

303
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,916
Surely you're not
dropping out of the game

304
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,083
when we've come this far!

305
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:48,916
[KURAMA]
Yes.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,291
You coward.

307
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,041
Your years of hiding
yourself in this human world

308
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,166
have made you just like them,

309
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,125
Spineless and ready
to be walked on.

310
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,833
I don't give a flip
if he leaves,

311
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,416
but he's got no
right to the loot.

312
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,166
Give us the pretty
little mirror.

313
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,416
I can't, I have great
need for it myself first.

314
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,000
Alright. Then I'll
punch it out of ya'!

315
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,750
[YUSUKE]
Excuse me, neighbors!

316
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,416
Couldn't help but notice
there's no rain falling here.

317
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,541
Maybe the next time you guys
go stealing some magic toys,

318
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,041
you should hide where it's not
so obviously sunny. Just a tip.

319
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,208
Who are you and how do you
know about the artifacts?

320
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,458
Give us your name!

321
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,875
Oh thank you, hoped
you'd ask. Hello boys!

322
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,750
The name's Yusuke,
I'm a Spirit Detective.

323
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,083
Spirit Detective?

324
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,041
Don't worry, he's just
one of Koenma's fools.

325
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,666
He must have been the only
human they could round up.

326
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,541
His spirit energy is pathetic.

327
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,958
Hey! Where are you going?

328
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,666
[KURAMA] Sorry. I don't
have time to be arrested.

329
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,125
Stop Kurama! You can't
just walk out on our plan!

330
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,791
[YUSUKE] Hey, don't leave yet
you guys! I just got here!

331
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,291
So much for manners!

332
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,625
[Gouki laughs]

333
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,791
Don't feel bad, kid.

334
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,208
I'm much more polite
than those two brats.

335
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,958
I'll turn myself in nice

336
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,916
and neat if I can't
rip off your head.

337
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,375
Sounds like a deal.
Just don't pull my hair.

338
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,458
But if you don't mind waiting,
I need a little snack.

339
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,375
What do you mean?

340
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:33,291
I find this orb very useful.
I never have to cook anymore.

341
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,833
People don't realize how hard
it is to eat human souls.

342
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,708
You gotta cook the
humans so they taste good,

343
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,375
but not enough to kill them.

344
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,958
But this--It takes all
the guess work out of it.

345
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,958
Pulls 'em from the
body still alive

346
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
so all you get is
good, clean soul.

347
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,291
[YUSUKE] Is that--is that
the little kid?!

They're the best!

349
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,583
Monster!!

350
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,666
Spit him out!!

351
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,666
And that's a knockout.

352
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,208
That's right little boy,
you're safe now.

353
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,291
Just fly on home to your body.

354
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,750
Two more to go.

355
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,416
For a human,
you're pretty decent.

356
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,708
What's your problem?

357
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,958
Get back on the ground!

358
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,000
I hit you too hard for
you to be on your feet!

[NARRATOR]
Kyukonki.

360
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,625
These dark, primitive beasts
feed on living souls,

361
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,083
ripping the victims apart

362
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,208
and devouring them while
they're still alive.

363
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,291
I think I'm in trouble.

364
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,250
Next time I see Koenma,

365
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,291
I've got to remember to ask
him how to fight monsters.

366
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,625
Easy kid, you run away.

That's right!

Damn it, Mr. Iwamoto
screws me once again.

371

Do you know what the best
spices for a soul are?

372
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,125
Some fear and a dash of pain.

[YUSUKE THINKS]
I'm really going to die. Again!

[KOENMA] Oh, I've got
news for Yusuke!

375
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,083
If he thinks this Kyukonki
monster tests his stuff,

376
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,791
wait until his show-down with
the wise and mysterious Kurama.

377

Botan even takes a human form
to give the rookie some help,

378
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,666
which of course he'll need.

379

Yusuke learns the lines between
good and evil often cross,

380
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,083
as the red-haired rogue
reveals his ancient past.

And calls on Yusuke to make
an ultimate decision.
