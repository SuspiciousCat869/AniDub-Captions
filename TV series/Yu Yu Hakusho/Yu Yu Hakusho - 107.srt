1
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,208
[NARRATOR] One hundred and
twenty-eight fighters have

2
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,333
moved on from the preliminary
matches to the main tournament,

3
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:45,416
as the search for the next king
of Demon World continues.

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
First up to fight was
Yusuke and Nekotama.

5
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,541
The battle quickly grew
into something much more

6
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,625
than anyone thought
Yusuke could handle.

7
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,750
But victory came fast for
the ex-spirit detective.

8
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,625
Now, deep into the
main tournament,

9
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,666
dozens of skilled fighters
continue to tear at each other,

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,333
each with his own
dream of kingdom.

11
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:17,333
[CROWD cheering]

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,666
[SHISHIWAKAMARU]
Chorus of Ten Thousand Skulls!

13
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,041
[SHISHIWAKAMARU yells]

14
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,166
Spiritual Light Attack!

15
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,666
[SHISHIWAKAMARU yells]

16
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,958
[YUSUKE]
So... How's it goin'?

17
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,666
Suzuka was defeated.

18
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,125
He never had a chance
in this round.

19
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,500
Cryin' shame, it is,
trained really hard, he did.

20
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,416
[SHISHIWAKAMARU groans]

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,125
[KOTO]
Shishiwakamaru surrenders!

22
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,958
That puts Hokushin through to
the next round

23
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,291
as the winner of match eight,
Group 3.

24
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,958
Yep, I guess no
matter who you are,

25
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,208
there's always someone better.

26
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,750
Aye...

27
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,500
But Touya here is plenty used to
dispensin' of his superiors,

28
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,500
Isn't that right, boyo?

29
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,541
Whatever.

30
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,041
Right! Time for
the wind to pick up!

31
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,916
Listen, pal, I don't
plan to be losin'

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,458
till me and you
finish what was begun.

33
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,541
Of course.
You'll win this for sure.

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,958
Then I'll see you two
after I win this. [laughs]

35
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,625
Same old Jin.

36
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,625
No, you focused him,
and increased his power.

37
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,125
[YUSUKE]
Hm.

38
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,541
Coming your way right now,
is the sixth match of Group A.

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,583
Fighting in this round
are Jin and Souketsu!

40
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,750
And the warriors are ready,

41
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,041
so let's see how this
is going to begin!

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
[JIN]
A waif, he may be,

43
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,750
but loads 'pon loads of
power are contained inside.

44
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,541
[JIN]
Aye, underestimating this one's

45
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,208
the last thing a boy could do.

46
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,000
[RINKU]
Wait up, Sasuga!

47
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,500
Oh, this kid can
be so annoying!

48
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,791
Of course, how
can he be blamed

49
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,750
when he's chasing
these kind of looks?

50
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,083
Don't run too fast!

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:03,291
[RINKU groans]
Who put that wall there?!

52
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,083
[RINKU]
Hey, Chu!

53
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,583
Rinku...

54
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,791
I think it's time you stopped
chasing skirts and watch.

55
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,125
Old Jin needs support from
all his best blokes.

56
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,875
Yeah? You're just jealous
'cause she's cute!

57
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,000
Not cuter than my own sheila!

58
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,875
Now, let's keep our eyes
on the prize... for Jin.

59
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,375
Go ahead and change the subject.

60
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,291
I can see all the
red on your cheeks.

61
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,208
[KOTO]
Let the match begin!

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,125
Ah... you use the wind...
This should be a challenge.

63
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,791
Well, a challenge you've
surely got. Now, here I go!

64
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,250
--[JIN grunts] 
--[REFEREE yelps]

65
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,416
Mmm... Oh, great wind...

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,958
Always supported
old Jin, ye did,

67
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,041
so don't let today be the end.

68
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,750
'Cause if I pull this off,
I owe it all to you.

69
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,041
[yells]

70
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,083
What?!

71
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,541
[SOUKETSU growls]

72
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,833
[gasps]

73
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,291
[SOUKETSU snickers]

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,125
Souketsu's patient attack sends

75
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,166
Jin plowing painfully
into the dirt!

76
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,625
I really hope there's more
to this battle than just that!

77
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,000
[groans] Now, that
wasn't your best.

78
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,416
No... That, sir, was
merely an introduction,

79
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,625
an appetizer to my
main course of pain!

80
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,000
Very pleased to hear that, sir!

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,083
You sound like one of them

82
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,791
professional grapplers
on the telly.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,916
Uh, I don't know if Jin is
still in this fight or not.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,583
It doesn't look like
he's going to turn back.

85
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,708
And now, back to the right foot!

86
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,750
You got to be kidding!
What, now me eyes are broken?

87
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,916
[SOUKETSU chuckles]
I don't think he's down there.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,541
[SOUKETSU laughing]

89
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,291
[JIN]
How'd you be gettin' up here?!

90
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,708
That's the wind
manipulator's tragic flaw.

91
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,000
You can only move as fast
as the wind can take you.

92
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,125
[JIN growls]

93
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,291
[JIN grunts]

94
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,958
Interesting... so you really
can pack a punch.

95
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,541
Two fighters battling
it out in mid-air!

96
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,625
This is an incredibly
rare sight to see

97
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,333
in this kind of
tournament, people!

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,458
I hope you're all
taking this in!

99
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,000
It doesn't seem as if Jin is
holding it together out there.

100
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,833
My ancestor's pals
are pretty bad dudes.

101
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,541
Souketsu and Raizen...
Makes sense.

102
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,208
For his display at the start,

103
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,333
your friend isn't
holding up too well.

104
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,083
My friend?!

105
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,875
In the tournament, every
person I see is an enemy.

106
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,250
Of course, they are.

107
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,000
You're saying you feel that
way about anyone you face?

108
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,250
Yes, even you.

109
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,833
Say nighty-night!

110
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,750
After you!

111
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,791
[yells]

112
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,541
Oh, no...

113
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,250
[JIN]
Tornado Fist Explosion!

114
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,625
[SOUKETSU screams]

115
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,250
Can't lose this match, no,
not to a ninny like him.

116
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,875
Here to go 'round with Yusuke
is why I be fightin'.

117
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,708
Delusions like that
are good for no one.

118
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,083
Aye, shoulda known...

119
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,333
Welcome to the end of the line.

120
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,416
[KURAMA]
Oh, no...

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,875
[JIN groans]

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,708
Too bad it ended so quickly.

123
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,375
I enjoyed fighting you
more than the last one.

124
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,791
It looks like Jin might be down!

125
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,583
But with Souketsu having that
much difference in power,

126
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,250
it's not surprising.

127
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,958
N-Not out, yet... Some
handy tricks, I still have.

128
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,708
[SOUKETSU] I haven't
met anyone since Raizen

129
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,375
strong enough to get up
after a beating like that.

130
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
No... Where's me wind?

131
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,166
[SOUKETSU] Are you
still planning to continue?

132
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
Planning on winning!

133
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:36,541
[JIN growls, yells]

134
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,875
[JIN]
Didn't pick up to train

135
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,125
with Genkai and the others
to drop the ball now.

136
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,166
No task before
was ever so tough.

137
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,375
This fight's candy
compared to that!

138
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,666
If I'm to be beat,
then by Yusuke's hands alone!

139
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,125
[JIN grunts]

140
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,958
[growls, yells]

141
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,708
It's gotten to the point where
it's even hard for me to watch!

142
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,458
No attack Jin dishes out can
even put a dent in Souketsu!

143
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:10,458
[JIN panting]

144
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,708
You remind me...
of myself a long time ago.

145
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,458
You? How's that?

146
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,041
It was about fifteen
hundred years ago.

147
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,000
[SOUKETSU]
I fought against Raizen.

148
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
[SOUKETSU groans]

149
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,083
[SOUKETSU]
I was just like you at the time,

150
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,625
blinded by my ambition,

151
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,083
focused to a fault
on defeating Raizen,

152
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,833
never realizing that I'd
be the one to fall that day.

153
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,125
That, in fact, the battle
was over before it began.

154
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,000
Regardless of the outcome, I was
honored to fight with Raizen.

155
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
Someday I will defeat him.

156
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,083
I want one more
chance at victory.

157
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,958
This is the singular motivation
that has carried me to here.

158
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,083
But now, Raizen is gone.

[SOUKETSU] I know you're
doing the same as me.

161
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,250
You're fighting, but holding
out until you have the chance

162
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,625
to face down Raizen's
ancestor, Yusuke, again.

163
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,291
Aye, never before or since,
have I wanted a rematch

164
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,541
with Yusuke Urameshi as much.

165

That's what I thought.

So I'll respect

defeat Raizen's ancestor.

I... don't... think so.

[KOTO] The battle

204
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,375
with multiple kinds of terrain

to allow each fighter the
best area to flex their powers.

I wonder which one of
these agile warriors

will benefit more from
the flat area on the lake!

That'll keep Kujoo
grounded for a while.

The reason they want
to fight against you is

283
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,666
because of something
fundamental they see.

before he walked into the arena.

I used to be a

Free to believe what I wanted,
but the only thought in my mind

was the desire to pit my
powers against you guys again.

When the tournament ended,
you asked me what I would do.

I didn't have a
real answer then,

in the kind of fight

to myself exactly what I am.

today is where it happens...

Touya is on the move, and it
looks like he is getting ready

316
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,666
to bring this neck-and-neck
battle to a quick finish!

317
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
I could take that hit
or just get out of here.

318
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:06,958
What'll it be?

319
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,500
[gasps]

320
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,541
[TOUYA groans]

[KUJOO growls]

322
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,125
What the--How do you
still have power left?!

323
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,750
Hah, I don't.
I used it all up.

324
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,875
Just to bust out
of your ice cage.

325
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,625
You're lying, and I can
see it all over your face.

326
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,791
I'm not lying.

327
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,541
I just want to win...

328
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,583
...like you!

329
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,083
[TOUYA yells]

330
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,125
[KUJOO yells]

331
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,125
[TOUYA groans, yells]

332
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,541
[KOTO] They're moving
so fast down there,

333
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,250
I-I can't tell who's winning!

334
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,708
Your guess is as good
as mine at this point!

335
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,250
I can't see.

336
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,458
[YUSUKE growls] It's like a
silent movie with no picture!

337
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,750
[KUJOO growls]

338
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,791
[TOUYA groans]

339
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,458
[BOTH grunting]

340
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,791
[pants]

341
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,875
Damn you!

342
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
You let the ice take away

343
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,375
just enough of your
powers to even us out.

344
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm not gonna put it up
with those kinda handicaps.

345
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,083
[pants] I just wanted to
even the playing field...

346
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,166
Don't think it
wasn't a risky move.

347
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,541
[TOUYA laughs] You've got
one weird sense of adventure.

348
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,916
[KUJOO]
You're welcome.

349
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,666
I should thank you.

350
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,666
I feel I've almost burned
myself out completely.

351
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,125
We will live to do
it again someday.

352
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,875
[TOUYA gasps]

353
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,000
[groans]

354
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,291
Touya!

355
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,291
No more stunts
like that, you got me.

356
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,333
I gotta rest up
for the next match.

357
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,791
Coming from behind to win
the 11th match of Group B

358
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,333
is the chivalrous Kujoo!

359
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,791
That was a close one!

360
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,208
You forget...

361
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,041
Touya seemed satisfied.
That's what's important here.

362
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,083
If you don't believe me,
take a look at him.

363
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,083
Yeah, I see it.

364
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,541
[KURAMA]
Between Yusuke and those who

365
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,041
fought in the Dark Tournament,

366
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,041
Raizen and all of his
former fighting comrades,

367
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,000
it is truly amazing
that today's battle

368
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,625
between these two groups
could be so pleasant...

369
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,583
So sportsmanlike.

370
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,458
Hmph, if there were many
more of these types of bouts,

371
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,208
Demon World just
might change for good.

372
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,333
What do you mean by that?

373
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,833
Nothing...

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,541
[KOTO] It's my pleasure
to announce that

375
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,833
the first round of Groups A
through D has been completed.

376
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,125
Would all advancing fighters
please make their way

377
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,041
to the waiting room of
their corresponding group

378
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,916
at this time?

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,291
[KURAMA]
See you later, Yusuke.

380
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,333
[YUSUKE]
Sure.

381
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,333
[YUSUKE]
Kurama!

382
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,458
You better not lose.

383
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,125
Or you either.

384
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,291
You'll be fighting
against Yomi very soon.

385
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,958
He can be quite dangerous.

386
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,375
Don't worry about it.

387
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,708
I fight even better
against the big guys.

388
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,666
Right, I thought you'd say that.

389
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,875
[KURAMA] It isn't always
easy walking into battle...

390
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,750
...but I suppose we all
have our demons to face.

391
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,166
[NARRATOR] The first rounds have
proved to be nothing simple,

392
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
removing most of the
Dark Tournament fighters

393
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
from progressing.

394
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,375
But each walked away a
victor in his own way.

395
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,791
Will Yusuke and the others

396
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,541
be able to make it through
the next round of battle,

397
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,416
or will the crown go
to some unknown Demon?

398
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,625
[YUSUKE] You know, I
wasn't expecting a showing

399
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,416
from Yoko Kurama this early,

400
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,125
but who am I to deny my
friends of what they need?

401
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,833
The only thing that throws
me for a loop is that

402
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,375
I don't think even Kurama
knows what he needs.

403
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,208
He's distracted and distant.

404
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,750
He keeps worrying
about his family,

405
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,375
and his friends, and himself.

406
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,541
I don't wanna sound like his
girlfriend or anything,

407
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,125
but it looks like he's got a
few demons to get out.

408
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,333
And I'm not talkin' about
the kind he's fighting.

409
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,791
Next time, on Yu Yu Hakusho!
