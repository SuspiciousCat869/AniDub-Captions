that circumstances

[KARASU]
But it doesn't really matter.

Even things that seem
ideal always turn sour.

163
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,166
I'm just speeding the process!

164
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Besides! I've found
that there's no greater rush

165
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,625
than taking the life
of someone you care for.

166

[KARASU]
The intimacy that murderer

00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,666
and victim share
is unparalleled.

168

Witnessing their spirit separate
itself from their body.

[KURAMA THINKS] His attacks are

[KARASU] Like I said, it isn't
necessary for me to touch you,

it's just one of the perks.

You okay?!

Darn it! What's the deal?
Why doesn't he change?

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,458
If that clown
gave him bad juice,

176

I'll make him regret
the day he was born!

177

Listen to yourself.

178

This is so boring.

If I were in the VIP room,
I could at least have a drink.

[KARASU] Perhaps I should
explain how my power works.

184
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,333
It's similar to yours in
that we both manipulate things

185
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,166
with our energy, but with
one distinct difference.

186
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,416
You can only control things that
already exist, like your plants,

187
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,250
but I manifest my
thoughts into tangible things.

188
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,708
For example, the object
I'm holding in my hand.

189
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,250
Although you can't see it, it is
still very real and very deadly.

190
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,583
[KARASU] But honestly, I don't
think words can do it justice,

191
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,583
It's just one of those things
you have to feel for yourself.

192
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,291
[KARASU]
After all, like they say,

193
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,916
actions speak
louder than words.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now make sure that you pay
very close attention, Kurama.

195

with several sticks of dynamite!

But tragically, I'm not
able to see the damage!

Please don't
make me take another.

Anyone see?!

206
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,750
[KARASU] Very amusing.

This battle is in for
a heart-stopping facelift!

fortunate I could come.

He wouldn't have survived
that blast, being what he is.

You telling me that's Kurama?

Basically, as you've heard,
his full name is Yoko Kurama,

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,791
but he's known by
several other titles, too.

Well, he was always a Legendary
Bandit in my generation.

[YOKO KURAMA] Creating a
bomb from nothing takes talent.

That caliber of

to a superior class of demons.

A class I consider
to be fairly worthy.

226

[YOKO KURAMA] Worthy to fight,
and worthy to die.

But we're still not equals.

Rest assured Karasu.
I wholly agree.

Now I see. You create monsters

How very clever.

break free from Suichi Minamono

[KARASU] That's fascinating.

But nothing more
than a loser's excuse.

238

[KARASU] You weren't able
to beat me then,

It's a rare plant found only
on Earth's South America.

249
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,541
The Ojigi is extremely
sensitive to movement,

250
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,791
and when it senses
any kind of vibration

251
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
it will quickly close
its leaves around its prey.

than to corner an animal

to show our teeth.

[YOKO KURAMA] An Ojigi plant is
quite dangerous regularly.

lethal and more sensitive
