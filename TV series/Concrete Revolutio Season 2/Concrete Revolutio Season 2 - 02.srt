00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,708
I wish it didn't have
to be this complicated.

319
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,583
I have no regrets giving
my life to Grosse Augen.

320
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,958
It was always my choice to make.

321
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,166
More importantly,

322
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,625
there's someone who
wants to talk to you.

You mean Jiro.

He wants to speak to you. Alone.

Stop her! Before she--

How dare you!
I'm your teacher!

Meteortail!

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,250
The Chofu Airfield? Why did
he want to meet here?

332
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,250
[JIRO] With all the preparation
work for the return,

00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,458
it's not in use.

If something happens,
no one'll get hurt.

[KIKKO]
Jiro!

I'm sorry, Kikko!

337

You liar!

[JIRO]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

339
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,583
These are the ruins
of the Ikuta lab.

00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,166
Equus!

341
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,583
[HYOUMA]
He used Shirota as a diversion

342
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
so he could steal Equus!

343
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,333
Looks like he didn't forget
all the Bureau's tricks.

344
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,375
Since when could he
control his power?

345
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,833
My seal is broken,

346
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,875
yet he's still holding
the <i>kaiju</i> inside him.

347
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,000
But how?

348
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,000
Fumers.

349
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,041
Fumers?

350
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,333
Vaporous life forms from space.

351
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,041
They seek out
developing cultures,

352
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,416
intervene as the leaders,
and aim to gain control.

353
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,625
They view themselves as gods.

354
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,458
I didn't know they
were on this planet.

355
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,166
That means the chief's back.

356
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,625
He managed to survive,
and he's protecting Jiro?

357
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,583
Arcus, go!

358
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,666
Jiro Hitoyoshi.

359
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,875
Detective Shiba.

360
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,250
You work for the
Bureau now? Why?

361
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,708
You're under arrest!

362
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,750
Everything you wished
for's happened.

363
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,708
It's a crime to be a superhuman!

364
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,625
Isn't this what you wanted?

365

[MAGOTAKE]
Detective Shiba!

367
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
[HYOUMA] Careful.
He's been acting strangely.

368
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,000
On the contrary, for the first
time, he's acting normally.

369
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,541
You care to explain?

370
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,875
He hates superhuman criminals
because upholding the law

371
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,833
is the one thing that
makes him feel human.

372
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,583
But he wanted to use his powers
to be a symbol of justice.

373
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,125
He's learning.

374
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,083
Some laws are unjust
and have to be broken.

375
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,000
And now...

376
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,000
[MAGOTAKE]
His machine brain

377
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,416
can't tolerate the
contradictions.

378
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,833
I was wrong about you.

379
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,541
You need more than
a few simple repairs!

[FUUROUTA]
Hey! Wait!

pilot that thing!

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
You forget. He's a traitor.

384
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,708
I know he's our enemy,

Don't get in my way!

387

The Fumers are
extremely dangerous!

388
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,958
They're far worse than
the S Planetarian.

389
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,666
They possess intelligent beings,

390
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,958
control the minds
of other life forms.

391
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,291
That's the truth behind
Akita and the others.

392
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,791
He must've taken over Jiro.

393
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,666
Even possesed by spacemen,
he's still important to me!

394
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,041
Couldn't you at least
say "us" for a change?

395
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,416
You humans are too immature
to understand justice!

Ullr! What can we do?

It's too late.

are controlling you.

But not entirely.

No, I know.

I knew. I should've
known what I had to do.

407

The S Planetarian is a criminal.

Jiro protects him,
so he's a criminal.

They're my enemies.
Both of them.

I knew this. Then why
did I help him?

I'm damaged. Broken.
In need of repair.

I'm glad I kept it clean.
I knew he'd come back for it.

[RAITO] That was the day
everything changed.

425
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,041
I finally understood what
the "right" thing was,

00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,250
what it is I should
be doing to help.

After I took the parts
from the android,

I was able to return
to my correct state.

429
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,833
But the police thought
I was malfunctioning

430
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,750
and tried to shut me down.
