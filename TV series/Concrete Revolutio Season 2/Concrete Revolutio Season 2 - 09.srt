[NANA] Why'd they choose to
show up now of all times?

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Well whaddaya know? The
rumors were true after all.

4
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,208
There actually is
a secret hideout

5
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,708
for superhumans on the run.

6
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,875
Well, well. Nana Maria.
Formerly of IQ.

7
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:24,500
Later hired by Imperial Ads
to instigate the Shinjuku riots.

8
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,583
You people are why we're hiding.
We're public enemy number one!

00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,375
Thanks to you, we
can't find any jobs

10
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,458
and we live in constant fear!

11
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,875
Ha! You think we
caused all of this?

12
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,583
I bet you weren't even there
to know what happened!

13
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,750
It was a party, man!

00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,166
"We superhumans could
change the world.

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,458
All we had to do
was work together."

16
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,375
That was the line they sold us.

17
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,583
It was Imperial Ads who told
us that, who you worked for.

18
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
Stop trying to act
like you're innocent.

19
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,166
Well, excuse me for wanting
to make a difference!

20
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,708
[FUUROUTA] That's enough!
There's no need to fight.

00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,625
Fuurouta the ghost.

22
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,083
[FUUROUTA] When you're in here,
there's no good or evil.

23
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,083
Everyone is welcome regardless
of where they came from.

24
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,125
As if we can tell who's good
or evil these days anyway.

25
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,458
Exactly.

26
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,125
So there isn't any reason
for us to do anything

27
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,791
except throw back
a couple of drinks

00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,541
and enjoy each other's company.

Heh. I'm always nice
to pretty girls.

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,916
I stopped takin' favors
from the Superhuman Bureau

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,166
after they killed my friends.

that stuff matters here!

[CLAUDE] You are a

returned to battle!

[REPORTER A] Eyewitnesses

[HANTA]
You see this?

43
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,083
[REPORTER A] ...revealed
his plans to establish

44
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,416
a new police force

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,833
after meeting with Master
Ultima earlier today.

46
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,750
This new organization will
specialize in superhuman crimes,

47
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,000
replacing the public
Security Force...

48
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,458
[HANTA] The Prime Minister's
getting desperate.

49
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,916
Not surprising, he's
lucky to still have a job.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,333
If it weren't for
the oil crisis,

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,625
he'd've been removed from office
when he was impeached.

52
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,375
The real question is where
he got these new weapons.

53
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,000
All of them were excavated
from a legendary ruin

54
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
at the bottom of
the Pacific Ocean.

55
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,125
They've been refurbished
with today's hardware.

56
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,166
The salvage op was
run by Imperial Ads.

intention of these "NUTS"

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,708

61
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,708
There is no way this ends
well for the people like us.

62
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,041
Perhaps not.

63
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,125
But we can't take matters
into our own hands

64
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
and attack the government.

65
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,375
That's terrorism.

but still, I couldn't stop him.

[MICHIKO] Ugh! Am I ever going
to find a good candidate?

70
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,833
[HYOUMA] Sorry, but when
we screened these guys,

71
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,916
finding NUTS pilots
wasn't our priority.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,875
Yeah, well it is now
seeing as our weapons

73
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,833
are being beaten by ancient
monsters in the Middle East.

74
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,083
Which, don't tell the news,

75
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
is the real reason
behind the oil crisis.

76
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,958
[KIKKO] Y'know, to some people,
they're superhumans of legend.

77
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,333
[MICHIKO]
Yeah, so?

78
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,625
There are other people that
wanna call them gods.

79
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,583
But this is Japan, so they're
" <i>yokai</i> ." That right?

80
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,083
As you are aware, our country
hasn't overcomplicated

81
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,708
our definition of what we
consider to be "superhuman."

82
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,375
It includes humans who were born
with extraordinary abilities,

83
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,500
or developed them later
on in life, and that's it.

84
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,083
Plain and simple.

85
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,458
In other words, non-humans like
Miss Emi and I don't qualify.

86
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,416
I think you're forgetting
the Bureau you work for

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,416
was founded off one
simple principal.

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,625
That every superhuman of justice
has an evil counterpart.

89
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,208
You ask me, we're only just
starting to understand

90
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,458
what evil really is.

91
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,875
[MAGOTAKE]
Now I get it.

92
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,416
Doesn't matter how many
"evil" superhumans you catch.

93
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,375
To the masses,
there's no good or bad.

94
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,291
Just two people
going at it in public.

95
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,875
But if you call every
powered non-human evil,

96
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,250
suddenly there's a clear enemy.

97
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,125
One that can be smashed
with your giant robots.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,583
Sound about right?

99
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,291
Well, we certainly
can't let superhumans

100
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,916
have a bad image when
we've been saying

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,250
they'll make the world a better
place for the last five years.

102
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,458
[EMI, KIKKO]
You stole that line from Jiro.

103
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,125
Maybe. But happens once
all your enemies are gone?

104
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,541
I'm sorry that this
evening isn't turning out

105
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,875
to be more romantic for you.

106
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,541
I'll worry about romance once
it's over and we're free.

107
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,000
Good plan.

108
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,541
One of these days, we're
gonna find a way out of this.

109
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,375
Just give it time.

if he were here to join us,

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,333
but we know that's not the case.

113

This doesn't need to get
out of hand, Raito Shiba!

Heh.

115
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,583
[SATOMI] The Superhuman
Bureau is finally obsolete.

116
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,583
Aren't you worried that we
may be rushing things a bit?

117
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,833
After all, we're not sure how
the NUTS will perform.

00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,458
This is confusing to me.

00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,666
However, your actions
tonight... are evil!

125

Fair enough!

[gasps]

128
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,583
[SATOMI] It sounds to me like
they want a demonstration.

129
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, but, uhh...

130
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know why
you're so worried.

131
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,625
You are a capable pilot.

132
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,250
They have to be used by
superhumans. I can--

133
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,625
That's a cover story.

134
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,000
Something we said to make
the public feel safe.

135
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,541
But once official
service starts,

136
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,291
the pilots are going to be
normal people like you.

137
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,250
The NUTS robots are going
to give us the power

138
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,583
to rival the gods themselves.

139
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,500
Are you saying if all
of this works out,

140
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,291
we won't need
superhumans at all?

141
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,250
I'm saying you will
become a superhuman.

142
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,875
In the riots six years ago,

143
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,750
they used large robots
to oppress us.

144
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,666
Those were nothing
compared to the NUTS.

145
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,166
I must crush them.

146
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,666
So you think fighting the
government is an act of justice?

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,416
Or should I call you
the Hikari Knight?

158
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,416
I can't win. Please stop.

159
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,125
I'm only human. I can't--!

160
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:23,041
[CLAUDE]
Justice. Freedom. Peace.

161
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,000
Why is it that you fight?

162
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,250
[MICHIKO] Peace. I fight
to protect the peace.

163
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,750
[SATOMI] The power to rival
the gods themselves.

164
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,250
[gasps]

165
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:36,041
[CLAUDE] I may never be a god,
but I can be a superhuman!

166
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,958
That's Claude's voice!

167
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,958
[MICHIKO]
What? I'm out of fuel!

168
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,041
[AKI screams]

169
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,583
Aki! Get out of there!

170
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,583
[SATOMI]
Tries Corporation.

171
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,458
Just had to give me one
more headache, didn't you?

172
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,875
[EMI]
Jiro! How could you do this?

173
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,333
[KIKKO] Tell me it's not
what it looks like!

174
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,583
Well?

175
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,250
Do you want me to
turn back time?

176
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,416
Even if I did, I wouldn't
be able to stop them.

177
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,875
For now, you should investigate
the fuel. There's something--

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,250
For the record,

179
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,041
I'm not mad that you
couldn't stop their attack.

180
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,000
And we're all upset
about Imperial Ads

181
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,791
and their giant new toys.

182
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,125
I'm mad... 'cause
you stood there!

183
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,708
You didn't do a damn thing
to try to beat their robot

184
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,333
or the Iron Detective!

185
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,125
Instead, you just watched
from the sidelines!

186
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,791
Don't treat me like a criminal!

187
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,333
When are you going to grow up?

188
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,416
[KIKKO screams]

189
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,166
[MAGOTAKE]
No doubt about it.

190
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,125
Yeah, it's the Bio Destroyer.

191
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:42,041
You mean... it's that stuff
from the incident with Sanae?

192
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,583
[MAGOTAKE] Yeah, the chemical
the Americans created

193
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,958
in hopes of destroying
the immortal family.

194
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,291
Now they've found some way
to turn it into a fuel source.

195
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,416
Breaking down molecular
bonds for power.

196
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,250
That sounds awfully familiar.

197
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,458
Like the nuclear fission
research done in the past.

198
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,791
[JUDAS]
This is...

199
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,708
[HANTA] I warned you many
times before, but this time

200
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,458
will be the last!

201
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,125
Your violence and destruction
don't accomplish anything!

202
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,541
And you fighting Yatsuka
Heavy Industries robots does?

203
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,500
Or how Shirota battles
against aliens?

204
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,458
It's your actions that don't
accomplish anything.

205
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,833
Still better than your methods,

206
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
which only make
superhumans look bad!

207
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,791
 Why can't you set aside your
differences and work together?

208
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,291
We're supposed to be friends!

209
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,708
[RAITO]
Oh, that's rich.

210
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,291
[HANTA]
It's simple, Jiro.

211
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,125
Because whether you want
to admit it or not,

212
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,916
your organization is evil.

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,166
[MIEKO]
Earth- <i>chan</i> !

214
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,666
[RAITO] With so many
machines showing up,

215
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,833
you'd think we were
a science fair.

216
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,833
Whose side are you taking?

217
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,833
[HANTA] More importantly,
why are you here?

218
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,291
Someone was crying
for help, so I came.

219
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,083
Jiro! The doctor needs you!

220
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,458
[JIRO] Are you sure we're
the same blood type?

221
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,291
[JUDAS]
Honestly, it doesn't matter.

222
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,625
I'll explain once
I've got her stable.

223
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,083
[AKI screaming]

224
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,583
What's the matter?

225
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,083
[JUDAS] Don't worry about it.
This is how it always is.

226
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,708
How it always--?

227
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,833
[JUDAS] For some reason,
your blood vitalizes cells

228
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,375
and makes them grow.

229
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,958
I'm surprised you
didn't know that

230
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,791
considering it was a well-known
rumor in the circles I ran in.

231
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,958
You mean amongst the evildoers.

232
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,541
You may recall, I took
some of your blood

233
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,791
as part of a health
exam a while back,

234
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,625
then ran some experiments.

235
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,375
Aki Haruka was part of them.

236
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,750
Why would you do that?

237
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,583
Growing larger really
isn't all that useful.

238
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,708
It was just a side
effect of my tests.

239
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,375
That's how his blood works.

240
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,916
It produces varying
results in superhumans.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,750
But as for its true
nature, well,

242
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,375
I'd have to ask Professor
Hitoyoshi about that.

243
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,625
Why would you ask my father?

244
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,416
[JUDAS] Because he's the leading
researcher of your blood.

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,416
Take the GigantoGon
incident for example.

246
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,541
They said your blood
created a giant <i>kaiju</i>

247
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,833
out of a peaceful
animal from the south.

248
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,833
How do you think that happened?

249
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,416
It's also the explanation behind
Beastly Radio Wave Japan.

250
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,291
Enough!

251
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,333
[MIEKO] That must be the reason
Aki went berserk as well.

252
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,125
If it weren't for Jiro,
she wouldn't've lost control

253
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,375
and attacked NUTS.

254
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,166
Aki wished for this!

255
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,291
He had nothing to do with it!

256
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,333
Oh, really?

257
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,875
Come on. You must've
thought it, too.

258
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,125
"Another varying side
effect of Jiro's blood

259
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,958
is doing things he wants to do."

260
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,083
[gasps]

261
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,125
He couldn't be sure.

262
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,916
True. But we always are.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,166
We don't struggle with a choice.
We make the right one.

264
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,958
But humans aren't like that.

265
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,375
Sometimes, they make
the wrong choice.

266
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,458
Wow. Did you come up
with that yourself?

267
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,250
That's why Jiro called me.

268
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,041
[JIRO]
But I didn't--

269
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,208
[EARTH- <i>CHAN</i> ] You did. Your
heart is crying out for help.

270
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,583
But I don't know what
I can do to save you.

271
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,875
And I don't think you do either.

272
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,208
[RAITO]
Where are you going?

273
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,250
We were built for one reason,

274
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,625
to fuse so we can preserve
peace in this nation.

275
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,375
We can't stay.

276
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,416
[HANTA, MIEKO]
Cross! Megasshin!

277
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,125
So I guess we're
enemies of peace?

278
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,750
[TACHIBANA] Why do we even
care about a small fuel leak?

279
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
Just tell 'em it's experimental!

280
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,416
We care because the fishery
in the Arakawa River

281
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,791
and its outlets were
heavily damaged.

282
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,666
It will likely affect
the entire Tokyo Bay.

283
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,541
I'm not worried about that.
All I want is results!

284
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,083
In that case, NUTS-One more
than proved itself in combat

285
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,250
against a superhuman.

286
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,666
Yes, it performed better
than we had hoped.

287
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,875
What a shame it's been
nothing but a waste,

288
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,791
considering that the
media is now aware

289
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,083
of your secret dealings
with Master Ultima.

290
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,041
The people now suspect Tries
Corporation paid you off

291
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
to accept NUTS.

292
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,958
[gasps]

293
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
[SATOMI]
Let's review:

294
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,500
Our company is
completely unaffiliated

295
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,875
with the NUTS fiasco,

296
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,833
Tachibana will be
forced to leave office,

297
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,125
and Master Ultima will now
face countless lawsuits.

298
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,500
That stone killed a lot
of birds. Not too shabby.

299
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,500
Maybe, but will the NUTS
project really be cancelled?

300
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,500
Yes. And it's quite
the costly loss.

301
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,958
illion per robot.
About 13

302
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,416
But what else can you
do when the things

303
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,583
are too dangerous to employ?

304
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,916
Sir. How can you be
so calm about all this?

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,416
Because even without NUTS,
we still have Okinawa.

306
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,750
And that movie is coming out
at the end of the year.

307
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,583
See? The end result
will be the same.

308
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,125
[MICHIKO]
And what result is that?

309
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,208
A world without superhumans.

310
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,333
[gasps]

311
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,500
[SATOMI] Leave them on
display here for the night

312
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,625
and then get them back
to the facility tomorrow.

313
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,041
[MICHIKO]
But you and I are the only ones

314
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,625
who know this program
has been cancelled.

315
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,666
What if superhumans decide
to launch another attack?

316
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,791
All the better, really!

317
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,875
An act like that would
only serve to further

318
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,041
the public's hatred of
"violent superhumans."

319
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,375
[YUMIHIKO] "Don't fight
if something happens"?

320
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,500
You want me to just stand there
and watch them attack the NUTS?

321
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,291
No, I would also
like you to make sure

322
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,708
the fuel doesn't get everywhere
as they're being destroyed.

323
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,750
Don't worry, Rex FE's armor
shouldn't be affected by it.

324
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,583
Doesn't matter who it
is? Not even Jiro?

325
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,625
[MICHIKO] All this time and
you still worry about him?

326
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,041
[YUMIHIKO]
I read the film script.

327
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,041
So, this is all true, isn't it?

328
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,583
"Not everything is
black and white.

329
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,791
There's a lot of grey, too."

330
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,500
That was profound
when I was a kid.

331
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,541
But I realize now
it means nothing.

332
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,916
Running red lights, urinating
in public, skimming change,

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,625
things like that are
so trivial, and yet,

334
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,500
we make such a big
deal out of them.

335
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
Even the Prime Minister
is wrapped up in scandals.

336
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,041
Jiro didn't say anything new.
He just stated the obvious.

337
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,250
I see. You're upset.

338
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,500
[YUMIHIKO] I think true
justice requires more

339
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,750
than seeing the problems.

340
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:27,291
It also needs a strong will to
denounce evildoers like him.

341
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,666
[sighs]

342
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,416
[knocking]

343
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,583
[MICHIKO] Hey, I'm dry
over here! Hurry up!

344
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,500
Yeah, I'm coming!

345
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,208
This is water!

346
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,916
[FUUROUTA]
'Cause I'm cutting you off!

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,916
[door opens]

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,541
[FUUROUTA]
About time you got here.

349
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,958
For real!

350
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
Case you forgot, you called me!
And then made me wait!

351
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,125
What's wrong with
you? Typical man.

352
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,083
[JIRO]
Almost surprised you showed.

353
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,750
Guess you really are concerned.

354
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,083
Just so you know, she was
already pretty hammered

355
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,625
before she came here with me.

356
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,625
It's not her most
endearing side.

357
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,500
Can't believe I drank
the whole thing.

358
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,583
Anyways, this is what
you want, right?

359
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,666
When you were inside the robot,

360
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,166
explain why your voice
sounded like Claude's.

361
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,291
It's 'cause these superhuman
power ampfification helmets

362
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,750
are based on the one he wore

363
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,708
that had the voice changer
built into it, jeez.

364
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,458
But the voice changer
was only added

365
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,541
in order to hide Jin's identity.

366
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,666
So why keep a useless function?

367
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,083
It wasn't like "Claude"
was another personality.

368
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,083
How should I know
why they kept it?

369
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,333
What're you doing?
That one's for girls!

370
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,708
I'll clean off my cooties.

371
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,083
[MICHIKO] Fine, just don't
let it touch your mouth!

372
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,208
[door opens]

373
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,083
Jiro. Let's play!

374
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,541
[JIRO]
Oh, wow!

375
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,958
The sky's so huge!

376
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,291
[EMI]
Wait up! Don't go so far!

377
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:22,416
[JIRO] No! I wanna play
outside some more!

378
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,166
[PEOPLE screaming]

379
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,500
There's a <i>kaiju</i> inside me?

380
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,875
But why?

381
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,916
[JIRO] Twenty-first year
of the Shinka era.

382
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,041
A year after the war ended.

383
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,708
[SATOMI]
I'm sure you've figured it out.

384
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,041
About the child you
found in Hiroshima.

385
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,250
Jiro? He's just an
ordinary baby.

386
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,791
Tell me. Have you heard
of the atomic bomb?

387
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,875
Of course, the one the Germans
were hypothesizing about.

388
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,166
But it was ultimately a failure.

389
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,291
Last year, the U.S. military
tried to drop one on Hiroshima.

390
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,541
They'd hoped it would
vaporize the entire city.

391
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,666
However, it appeared the
bomb had no effect at all.

392
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,041
Instead, only a small child
was found at the site.

393
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:20,125
But what if that wasn't
supposed to happen?

394
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,500
What if the bomb actually
did what it was supposed to

395
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,250
and caused horrible destruction?

396
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,125
What if that was the right path?

397
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,666
"The right path"?
What are you saying?

398
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,458
[SATOMI] In a world where
our humble happiness

399
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,708
is threatened by
violent superhumans,

400
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,750
a new motion picture
vows to showcase

401
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,708
their terrible nature
in stunning detail.

402
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,208
Tokusatsu Movie
Corporation presents:

403
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>The Great Prophecy of Japan</i> .

404
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,041
Coming soon.
