It's like the Bureau's
back together.

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,833
Jiro, is that true?

164
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,791
[SATOMI] He was pretending to
be the symbol of ultimate evil.

165
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,083
Unifying all superhumans
against him.

166
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,833
Allowing himself to
be defeated. His master plan.

167
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,875
[JIRO scoffs]

168
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,000
[HYOUMA]
Humans would praise Hoshino

169
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,625
as the witch of justice,

170
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,625
as the hero who slayed the most
terrible kaiju to ever exist.

171
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,916
She'd be able to live
among people again.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,833
I won't! It's not worth it!

173
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,708
Why do you want me
to kill you Jiro?

174
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,208
Because I'm the one
who hurt you the most.

175
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,541
Remember that day
we met at the café?

176
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,250
When I asked you to
protect superhumans?

177
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,916
You were so pure and strong.
And I believed in you.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,708
I thought, "This girl has the
makings of something great."

179
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,625
But I awoke an evil
inside you. Changed you.

180
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,875
The Kikko I once knew vanished,

181
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,375
and she fought for her own ends,
no longer for justice.

182
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,250
[KIKKO]
You wanted me to stay the same?

183
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,791
Innocent forever
like the day we met?

184
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,916
You realize how selfish that is?

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,166
You didn't hurt me.
I was growing up.

186
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,416
You deny it, but I've
always known in my heart

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,625
you were a superhuman.

188
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,416
I don't get to claim that.

189
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,666
Really? Because you're a <i>kaiju</i> ?

190
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,833
Because you killed
Rainbow Knight?

191
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,458
Or is it because you're
attracted to both of us?

192
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,083
I broke the promise
I made you.

193
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,791
How can I fight for justice?

194
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,166
You couldn't help it.

195
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,541
Every person's heart
is like a <i>kaiju</i> .

196
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,541
No matter how much you
want to do the right thing,

197
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
you can't stand in its way.

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,583
Idiot.

199
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,541
Spare your martyrdom, please.

200
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,666
You think your death
changes anything?

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,708
You're merely a pawn.

202
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,458
[SHAKKOU] Allow me! I'll be
happy to give him his wish!

203
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,750
Ignore this one.
Go where you please.

204
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,666
[SHAKKOU]
Mr. Satomi! What is th--?

205
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,250
My God, that's pure
bio destroyer!

206
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,250
Enough of these theatrics.

207
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,416
Humans and superhumans
had their war,

208
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,750
now superhumans
must leave the stage.

209
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,625
Exactly what I've been
planning all along.

210
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,708
Now go. Take these monsters
and beasts with you

211
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,500
and depart for a world
far from this one.

212
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,250
So it's all according
to your plan?

213
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,375
Trouble is, there will always
be a need for superhumans.

214
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,083
No one will ask for
their help again

215
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,000
if they think freaks like
you are gone forever.

216
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,083
The world will see this
new energy system.

217
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,958
How it operates on all
superhumans, not just your kind.

218
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,958
Watch how the public
turns on them.

219
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,000
Why do you want to rid
the world of superhumans?

220
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,583
[SATOMI]
It's unnatural.

221
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,375
A civilization surrounded
by all-powerful heroes

222
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,333
will never be able to mature.

223
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,208
Its stuck in a constant
cycle of fantasy.

224
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,000
Like a child dreaming,
refusing to grow up.

225
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,625
Come on.

00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,166

Goodbye, Jiro.

[JIRO]
Emi, I can't leave yet.

228

You want to fight me? Cute.

229
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,375
But this late in the game
it won't change a thing.

230
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,916
Maybe you're right. Maybe not!

Stop them!

234
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,083
Mr. Jaguar, is this
what you wanted?

235
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,125
[SATOMI]
What?

236
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,833
[HYOUMA] I invented the Red
Jaguars to change history.

237
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,333
But none of the technology
I used was from this timeline.

238
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,458
We can release maybe one or two.

239
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,041
But any more and you
start to see a problem.

240
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,458
Meaning what?

241
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,708
[HYOUMA] A time paradox.
They can't exist in this era.

[HYOUMA]
Jiro!

243
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,875
You're not the only one that
wanted to be an ally of justice.

244
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,250
That's why right now.
I'm an ally of Jiro Hitoyoshi.

245
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,791
[HYOUMA]
Did I go too far?

246
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,458
You're a bona fide criminal.

trust him. Doesn't matter.

Stop laughing!

253
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:54,416
I can't. You're children
with no concept of reality.

254
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458
Nothing in this
world will change.

255
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,458
With or without superhumans.

256
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,875
Of course it's impossible
to want what's right,

257
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,583
when we can't even
control our own hearts.

258
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,458
But we'll never stop trying
and that's what matters!

259
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,791
Wrong. It's a wasted effort.

260

You see, I am just
like you: Pure energy.

261
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,416
[SATOMI] Years ago, a giant
meteor fell to Earth,

262
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
large enough to obliterate
an entire nation.

263
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,666
But there was no destruction.

264
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,916
Just me. Left at
the impact site.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,625
I contain that immense power
and it's mine to wield.

266
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,791
The ability to shape
the world in my vision.

267
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,875
I stopped aging,
and honed my strengths

268
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,000
until they reached their
ultimate pinnacle.

269
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,791
You'll find I'm quite
strong for my age!

[SATOMI]
Now. Vanish!

272
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,375
[SATOMI]
Everyone will forget you.

273
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,791
Superhumans will be viewed as
a replacement for oil and coal!

274
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,500
A natural resource!

275
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,833
[KIKKO]
People won't forget!

276
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,750
Miss Michiko wrote a song!

277
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,500
About fish cakes
escaping the hot plate!

278
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,541
What?

279
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,791
[KIKKO]
When people hear that song,

280
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,625
they'll remember superhumans!

281
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,250
Everyone has their
own way of fighting!

282

That's Miss Michiko's!

Is that a joke? A lousy song?

[gasps]

287
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,166
[JIRO]
You have a short memory.

288
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,375
Did you forget you controlled
people with a movie?

289
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,125
And that is the limit
of its influence.

290
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,750
A lousy song. Lousy movie,
lousy superhuman.

291
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,333
You're disgusting. Sick!

292
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,750
[SATOMI] Precisely my point.
There is no real power there.

293
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,500
[JIRO]
I finally understand.

294
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,041
This isn't the first time
I've met someone like you.

295
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,041
Nor will it be the last!

296
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,458
What? An unstoppable force?

297
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,875
[SATOMI]
A god?

298
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,875
[JIRO]
No. A fool.

299
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,250
Really?

300
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,500
You laugh off justice
as a misconception.

301
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,666
You laugh off superhumans
as childish dreams.

302
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,375
You laugh at people who
try to change reality.

303
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,333
So, yes. No matter
what the cost,

I have to defeat you!

Don't worry.

His body will recover
from the venom quickly.

Yeah. But his friends will not.

Chief Akita?

324
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,875
[ULLR] Remember what the
space sheriff told us?

325
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:55,416
The Fumers control Jiro's power.
But they're also life forms.

326
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,791
[SATOMI] If Akita and the
Fumers are destroyed,

327
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,000
you'll have no way to
control the full extent

of your own power.

329
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,541
And you won't be
able to maintain

330
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,833
that pathetic human form.

Back in Shinka Year 29, the
invisible <i>kaiju</i> , it was him!

332
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,000
Without the locks,
he's pure energy!

333
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,333
Jiro! We have to go
to the new world!

334
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,791

I'll use my magic!

336
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,541
If I spend all of the energy
I got from everyone,

337
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,416
I should be able to
hold it in for a while.

He needs me.

It's too late to stop this!

341
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,666
But Satomi said
he's just like me.

342
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,541
[JIRO]
If he's telling the truth,

343
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,791
he should be able to open
the passage between worlds

344
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,708
instead of me.

345
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,833
Take Emi. See her across.

346
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,333
You're coming with us.
You swore we'd be together!

347
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,291
This is the second promise
I broke. Please forgive me.

348
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,791
Don't cry. I'm not
going anywhere.

349
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,833
I'm staying... here.

350

Home for humans.
And superhumans.

[KIKKO]
Using Satomi's power,

352
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,666
we opened up a portal
to a different world.

353
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,416
[ULLR] Star Child, I've taught
you all you need to learn.

354

But--!

[ULLR] Now our journeys
take different paths.

356

[KIKKO] That day, I think Ullr
gave me permission to live

357
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,833
and grow old in this world
alongside my friends.

[KIKKO]
They left our realm.

In search of a place they
could call their own.

360
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,708
Miss Michiko is
really high up now.

Everyone's making
movies, songs, comics.

[FUUROUTA]
They have hope.

364
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,250
Maybe if enough people remember
superhumans and beasts,

365
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,666
and wish hard enough
to see them again...

[KIKKO] Then one day,
he'll come back to us.

That's how he was born,
after all. It could happen.

The ones up in the sky.
Devila and Devilo.
