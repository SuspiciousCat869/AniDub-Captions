This is new.

[MICHIKO] What can you tell us
about the superhuman remains?

7
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,291
Most of the corpses
were Japanese.

8
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,125
And most were in their teens.

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,750
Some of them no more
than seven years old.

10

Total, there were
over 100 bodies.

Those that were

We suspect a government agency

to be involved.

That's what they're doing.

[JIRO]
Claude. Jin Nagakawa.

This is what he was
trying to show to us.

[HYOUMA] How many times
do I have to tell you?

26
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,541
We didn't know anything
about the labs

and experiments at Ogasawara.

28
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,458
[EMI sighs] How about the
fact the chief was actually

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,833
a puff of
extraterrestrial smoke?

30
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,375
[HYOUMA] So he was a spaceman.
It never caused a problem.

31
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,541
[JIRO]
The point is he hid it from us.

32
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,416
And the truth about
Rainbow Knight.

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,250
[HYOUMA] You let Claude
and Hoshino go

34
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,083
because you believed
what he said?

35
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,708
[JIRO]
I didn't let them go!

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,916
Claude and Kikko. I'll find
them both. I promise.

37
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,875
Finish the job. We have
two months 'til the

Kill Claude and

41
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,708
[MICHIKO] Last year, in August,
near Shinjuku Station,

42
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,583
a tanker train derailed.

43
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,500
It was carrying
U.S military fuel.

44
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,750
And was being transported
through the center of the city.

45
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,166
Then, there was
October last year.

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,458
[SATOMI] You'll remember
rioters clashed against police

47
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,208
in Haneda. There was
a student casualty.

48

[SATOMI] This summer, secret
experiments on superhumans

49

were revealed to have taken
place in Ogasawara.

50
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,708
This was the final push.

Year 43 of the Shinka Era.

This will be remembered
in history as the day

"Enough is enough!"

all over the world.

Including this country. A huge
protest is planned in Tokyo.

And appropriately today
on World Peace Day.

00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,708
What's the point?

67
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,000
The students claim that they'll
stop the American fuel tanker

68
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,500
at Shinjuku station. But how
will it change anything?

69
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:43,166
[MALE STUDENT3A] It's all
a fantasy. Changing the world.

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,541
[SATOMI] The students
won't stop at the station.

71
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,083
They'll march on to
government buildings.

72
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,708
You should prepare
for the possibility

73
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
of violent revolution today.

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,916
The government won in the
end in Prague and Paris.

75

Those countries didn't have
to worry about Claude.

76
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,791
I see, so that's the reason
you don't want me to vote

77
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,333
"Yes" for the revised
secrecy laws. Unbelievable.

78
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,625
Your only concern is
making some quick cash

79
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
with a superhuman star.

80
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,458
Under the revisions,
all superhumans will be

81
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,291
put under government control.

82
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,875
Civilians like you wouldn't
be able to do your jobs.

You business types
are all the same.

84
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,166
You only start to worry when you
feel your profits are at stake.

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,541
I'm sure you want to
control dangerous individuals

00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,583
as much as I do.

87
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,666
Read the law before you form
an opinion! Don't you see?

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,958
The new measures breaks
people into two categories.

89
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,458
Humans and everything else.

90
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,833
Once somebody's classified
as superhuman,

91
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,333
human laws no longer
apply to them!

92
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,583
Potential criminals.
Dangerous thinkers.

93
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,708
Different races. By defining
them as superhuman,

94
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,208
you can create any
segregation law you wish.

[gasps]

96
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,666
A paranoid fantasy. I assure
you, it'll never happen.

00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,750
[MITSUYA] You still don't
know where Claude is?

[MALE ANNOUNCER A] Earlier this
month, several student groups

106
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,875
organized street protests in
opposition of the government.

107
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,958
Their demands included
discarding the revised

108
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,375
Superhuman Law and halting
US military tankers.

109
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,708
On World Peace Day,
the 21st of this month,

an even larger turnout is
expected at Shinjuku station.

111
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,500
I didn't expect you to
come out of hiding

112
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,750
without your queen.

113

[ULLR]
We're not enemies, you and I.

114
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,416
Unlike Hitoyoshi and Star Child.

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,416
Really? But you teamed up
with the Phantom Sword.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,458
[ULLR]
If Claude and Star Child elope,

117
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,416
this world will achieve balance.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,708
So that's the deal.

119
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
[ULLR]
To tell you the truth,

120
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,333
I have been searching for a
partner myself for a long time.

121
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,250
And I find normal
humans so boring.

122
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,375
But you... You're different.

123
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,708
[ULLR grunts]

124
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,375

We were just chatting.

125
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,250
[ULLR screams]

126
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,041
So, tell us about the
Queen of the Devil Realm.

127
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,291
[ULLR]
Fine. I'll talk.

128
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,500
She sees humans
only as a resource

129
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,833
and feeds on their happiness.
Kikko was a mask.

130
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,333
Hidden beneath is a
cold-hearted, merciless ruler.

131
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,833
The medicine prepared
by Jin Nagakawa.

132
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,875
The powerful hypnosis by Claude.
And finally, her disappointment

133
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,791
in you brought out the
second personality.

134
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,583
Is there a way that we
can bring Kikko back?

135
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,833
[ULLR]
No. She's lost forever.

136
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,750
What you saw is
Star Child's true form.

137
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,250
[EMI] So you're still going
to fight Claude. For Kikko?

138
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,500
[EMI grunts]

139
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,083
What is it?

140
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,666
Do you know what a Jinko is?

141
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,541
A Human Tiger?
What does that matter?

142
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,458
They aren't uncommon.
At least in Japanese folklore.

143
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,791
There are several stories of
greedy or lonely humans

144
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,625
turning into tigers.
It's a type of monster.

145
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,000
So what?

146
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,833
I can turn Kikko into one.

147
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,708
[gasps]

148
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,125
[EMI]
If it works,

149
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,833
it should only affect her
"Devil Queen" half.

150
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,875
It's only active right now
because the medicine

151
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,708
brought it out. And the
other Kikko you know?

152
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,458
[JIRO]
She'll survive?

153
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,791
[EMI] Yes. If that is
really her true face.

154
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,500
But you have to
promise me, Jiro.

155
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,083
After this, you'll never
see her again.

156
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,333
[EMI]
Whenever you're with her,

157
