Early this morning,

2
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,791
a train accident and
fire broke out

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,291
in the Hokuriku Tunnel.

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,375
Over 700 were injured
and 30 are confirmed dead.

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,208
After receiving reports from
the on-site investigators,

6
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,458
the government has concluded
it's extremely likely

7
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,291
superhumans were involved
in this accident...

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,333
Ugh!

9
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,833
I'm sick of 'em
blaming superhumans

10
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,166
for every little thing!

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,291
[KIKKO]
They already know the fire

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,000
came from the smoking room.

13
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,875
[FUUROUTA] How does switching
the blame to superhumans

14
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,333
help change anything?

15
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,791
Don't get all worked up.

16
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,166
Won't make those poor
folks any less dead.

17
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,500
It helps control
the public's opinion.

18
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,041
Makes people demand
their government

19
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,500
take greater control
over superhumans.

20
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,166
You're right. The
media's helping us.

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,708
Thanks.

22
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,375
I'm reporting to you from the
Tsuruga side of the tunnel.

23
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,291
Are we working to make life
more difficult for superhumans?

24
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,625
Professor?

25
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,500
You don't have to be such
a square all the time.

26
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,375
Ugh! C'mon, Miss Emi!

27
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,625
We gotta speak up
against these old men!

28
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,125
Uh. Wait. Where'd she go?

29
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,333
She stepped out. I imagine
she's quite worried.

30
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,666
About what?

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,166
The princess has
several underlings.

32
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,958
A couple of whom
reside underground.

33
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:15,500
They're obviously going
to be the prime suspects.

"Barely her equal"? Your words.

The last time I saw her,

she was swimming
through a magma pool.

75
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,625
Not that I was watching
her or anything! How crass!

76
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,875
I don't know where Her Grace--

I mean, that idiot
disappeared to afterwards.

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,541
And that's what
I'm worried about.

79
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,916
She can appear
anywhere she chooses.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,291
If she starts trouble,
it won't end well.

81
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,041
Was the tunnel accident
this Devila person's fault?

82
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,666
It's hard to imagine
her acting so reckless.

83
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,458
But she and I are different.

84
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:27,250
Unlike me, she has no intention
of being friendly with humans.

[KIKKO]
The Great Depth Construction?

what it sounds like.

The underground's
almost untouched.

88
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,041
The plan is to develop
it like the surface.

Expanding human
infrastructure downward

90
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,750
the same way we've built it up.

91
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,416
You're talking about more than
just subways and sewer systems.

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
The metro system is only
scratching the surface,

so to speak.

94
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,333
The idea is to go much deeper

95
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,333
using a process called
"shield tunneling."

96
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,833
Sounds dangerous.

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,708
And what'll happen to Miss Emi's
kind who live down there?

98
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,166
Actually, there's an old clan

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,791
that even Emi doesn't
have jurisdiction over.

100
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,541
They go by many names,

101
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,875
but are commonly referred
to as demons.

102
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,791
Are they superhuman?

103
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,833
Technically speaking, yes.

104
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,583
There are no legal distinctions
separating monsters from demons.

105
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,958
[HYOUMA]
Meaning they fall under

106

the Superhuman
Bureau's protection.

107
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,208
Superhuman laws
have weight up here,

108
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,250
but would demons
even listen to us?

109
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,458
In truth, I highly doubt it.

110
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:27,041
Devila's relationship with
humans is tenuous at best.

Uh, Komorin. Devila has a
younger sibling, doesn't she?

133
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,666
[KOMORIN]
A younger brother. Devilo.

If we find him first,
he might able to help us.

Yes, but he hasn't reached
his mature form yet.

Is he talking to us?

What an amazing voice!

143
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,750
There is a park.

00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,791
If there is a park,
then people will gather.

You're not permitted to loiter
here. Disperse immediately.

147

This isn't a park!
It's a passage!

148
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,125
A passage is meant
for traveling.

149
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,166
A passage allows all kinds of
people to meet one another.

150

Different people. Me. You.

He's right!

There is the sky
and the earth.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There is up and there is down!

154

There is right
and there is left.

155
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,583
If there was no right,
the earth would splinter.

156
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,166
If there was no left,
the sky would shatter.

157
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,000
We have both right and left.

00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,375
[FUUROUTA]
His power is speaking?

159
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,250
Can he cast spells or something?

160

00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,000

I can do to help you.

[SHAKKOU]
This is your monster?

320
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,208
Yes. He's my friend.

321
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,791
My sister gave him orders
to protect me from harm.

322
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,875
[SHAKKOU]
Sister?

323
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,250
Devila, Queen of
the Underground?

324
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,708
So it's true. She really
is invading the surface.

325
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,208
Devilo! It's vital we
meet with your sister.

326
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,166
We'll get Emi to
serve as mediator.

327
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,708
The conflict between humans
and your kind must stop!

328
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,875
I've had just about
enough of you.

There'll be no peace.
Our orders are clear!

The monsters below caused
the tunnel accident.

And they have to pay for it.

00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,166
In exchange, Japan
demands that they forfeit

333
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,458
the underground as a new colony.

We can't allow dangerous

Zumanan hasn't done anything!

You're obstructing justice.

I thought only ghosts
were able to do that.

350
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,333
Because it is a ghost.
That's Fuurouta!

351
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:12,958
Do it!

[SHAKKOU]
Got it! Let's move!

We have to stop them!

Silence!

They caused the train wreck
and attacked the city.

I'm returning them
to their home.

[DEVILO] Why do we have
to go back under ground?

We are everywhere.

Oh, man. Now what's wrong?

The Shield Building! It's
sinking into the ground!

Earthquake, maybe? Then why
can't we feel it over here?

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,250
Zumanan did his best
to control himself.

385
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,500
But he must have done
something under the building.

386
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,833
So then...

Huh. It'll think twice
before it messes with

If he stopped going easy on you,

Well, if that creature is
as dangerous as you say,

it's even more reason for us
conquer the underground.
