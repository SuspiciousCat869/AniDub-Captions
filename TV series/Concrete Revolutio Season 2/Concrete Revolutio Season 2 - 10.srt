All lies! It's all lies!

318
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:18,791
[RAINBOW KNIGHT]
No!

319
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,375
[JIRO]
Stop lying to me!

320
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,666
[WOMAN A yelps]

321
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
[JIRO]
You fought for justice.

322
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,916
How could you do this?

323
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,666
[RAINBOW KNIGHT]
I am not justice.

324
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,541
Perhaps there's no such thing.

325
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,208
[JIRO]
No!

326
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,125
What have I done?

327
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,875
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,833
[RAINBOW KNIGHT]
I... I understand.

329
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,083
[JIRO]
It was me?

330
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,666
I killed him?

331
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,791
No. I couldn't.

332
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,916
[EMI]
Jiro!

333
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,791
[gasps]

334
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,291
Not me! It's a lie!

335
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,708
Don't show me this!

336
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,916
[SATOMI] The truth is
Rainbow Knight was killed.

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Not by a police conspiracy.
Not by a fire he started.

338
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,750
This superhuman of justice
was murdered by a beast

339
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,875
that is still running free.

340
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,875
Jiro Hitoyoshi.

341
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,750
And now, he's trying
to destroy Japan.

342
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,916
I knew the truth. All along.

343
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,500
[EMI]
Long before humans existed,

344
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,458
monsters, spirits, and demons
called this planet home.

345
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,500
In modern times,
we've lived in fear.

346
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,166
Hiding from you until now.

347
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,583
My name is Emi Kino.

348
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,333
A woman born from a
human and a monster.
