1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,250
[JONATHAN screams]

2
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,833
[HYOUMA] One of your superhuman
soldiers went missing.

3
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,541
And you want the
Bureau to find him?

4
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,208
[CAROLCO] Master Sergeant
Jonathan Morrell.

5
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,000
He was stationed here
after we pulled out

6
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,250
of the Mekong Delta War,

7
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,166
but disappeared
earlier this morning.

8
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,666
It's imperative that
we find him quickly.

9
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,500
As the leading experts of
superhuman crimes in Japan,

10
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,500
we'd like your assistance
in tracking him down.

11
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,416
Why come to us and not
the public Security Force?

12
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,125
To keep this under wraps.

13
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,291
The situation involves
military secrets

14
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,458
we'd prefer to keep
a tight lid on.

15
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,041
Gettin' the security
forces involved

16
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,458
will only make things
more difficult.

17
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,583
The Superhuman Bureau on the
other hand can mobilize quicker,

18
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,333
and is far more discreet.

19
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,041
In addition, your Professor
Magotake and our organization

20
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,208
have crossed paths before.

21
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,250
[KIKKO] Are you friends
with Colonel Carolco?

22
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,666
What did he mean you'd
crossed paths before?

23
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,250
I don't know him personally, but
I am familiar with his group.

24
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,208
Well, I can't say I'm
completely unrelated to them.

25
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,083
The Jungle Operation
Enforcers, J.O.E.

26
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,916
An experimental
unit that employs

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,875
artificially-modified
superhumans.

28
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,625
Its technical background
is based heavily on data

29
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,875
that came from Japan
after the war ended.

30
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:35,875
Your research.

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,333
Yes.

32
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,791
Since I was stationed at the
Ikuta Lab during the war,

33
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,791
I am somewhat responsible
for what they're doing.

34
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,166
But still, a U.S soldier
fighting in Southeast Asia?

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,583
Why did he get dropped off in
Japan instead of going home?

36
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,791
It's not just Sergeant Morrell.

37
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,083
All J.O.E superhumans are
stationed here in Yokota.

38
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,541
They have special
barracks for them.

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,458
Good a place as any to
start our investigation.

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,125
[HYOUMA] What do you mean
we're not permitted?

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,208
[SOLDIER A] I'm sorry,
but this is area is off limits.

42
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,458
[MAGOTAKE]
We've been commissioned

43
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,000
by Colonel Carolco to
locate Sergeant Morrell.

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,250
We need to search his bar--

45
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,583
Please note that in this
base U.S. laws apply.

46
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,291
Japan has no authority.

47
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

48
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,208
[KIKKO] Those guys didn't
exactly give us a warm welcome.

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,416
[ULLR] It's a shame Star Child
can no longer be Queen.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,333
Disposing of those
petty officials

51
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,625
would've been good training for
the ruler of the Devil Realm.

52
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,500
[tapping]

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,291
[footsteps]

54
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,333
I brought her here.

55
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,833
Thanks, Fuurouta.

56
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,541
Jiro--

57
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,916
[JIRO]
Listen.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,375
The U.S. military
is using the Bureau.

59
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,541
Stay away from
the Jonathan case.

60
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,041
That's why you
called me out here?

61
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,458
[JIRO]
You saw the quarantine.

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,833
Or did they lie and
call it barracks?

63
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,083
Figures.

64
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,875
Soldiers who returned
from the Mekong Delta

65
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,750
are locked up there.

66
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,916
They'll never return
to the United States.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,250
They won't? But why not?

68
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,708
[JIRO]
Deniability.

69
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,750
The U.S. is still
experimenting on superhumans.

70
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,708
Procedures just like
the Antares submarine.

71
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,583
They wanna keep
everything undercover.

72
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,041
So they're trying to get
rid of the soldiers

73
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,541
without anyone knowing.

74
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,375
That's why Jonathan escaped.

75
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,916
[gasps]

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So this soldier, Jonathan, he's
sort of like you, isn't he?

77
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,791
If the U.S. forces find
him, he'll be killed.

78
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,583
Permanently silenced.

79
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,541
[KIKKO] That's why
you're hiding him then.

80
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,291
[JIRO]
Abusing superhumans?

81
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,541
Tools for war, thrown
away afterwards?

82
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,583
I can't allow them to do that.

83
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,375
I'll help Jonathan get
back to his country.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,416
That's all he wants
to do. To go home.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,458
I'll fight anyone who
tries to stop him.

86
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,708
But this is the military
you're talking about!

87
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,166
Yeah.

88
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,208
Which is why you shouldn't
get involved with this case.

89
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,625
When you see my father,
tell him the Superhuman Bureau

90
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,583
is supposed to
protect superhumans.

91
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,333
Not be complicit in
helping assassinate them.

92
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,041
I dunno why you don't come
back and tell him yourself.

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,666
[JIRO] Seeing him again would
only complicate things.

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,833
Take care.

95
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,791
[EMI]
Typical.

96
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,000
Never talks about anything
except his agenda.

97
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,541
How long have you
been standing there?

98
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,666
Hey. You know me,
I don't like taking sides.

99
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,416
[EMI] I wasn't planning on
working with the U.S. Military.

100
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,375
But if Jiro's involved,
it's a different story.

101
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,875
[RAITO] Jiro should be meeting
us here soon. Sit tight.

102
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,166
Understood.

103
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,875
[JONATHAN gasps]

104
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,791
[JONATHAN yelping]

105
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,916
What's wrong?

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,791
[JONATHAN]
Up there! What is that?

107
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,916
[RAITO]
What? The altar?

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,750
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just for decoration.

109
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,458
I won't stay here
with that thing!

110
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,375
[door opens]

111
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,041
Sorry. Did you have
to wait long?

112
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
Not bad.

113
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,500
[RAITO] It's the best I
could do on short notice.

114
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,750
More importantly,

115
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,458
how do you plan to get
a cyborg onto a plane?

116
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,833
I was thinking of
smuggling him in by ship.

117
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,250
You'd go through all of that
just to send him home?

118
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,666
It probably never crossed
your mind he's a villain

119
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,416
who deserves to be turned in.

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,833
He's a victim. Simple as that.

121
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,833
[RAITO sighs]

122
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,416
Why don't you ask him what
he did during the war?

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,375
There's no way he can go
back to a normal life.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,291
Your friend is right about me.

125
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,166
I'm-I'm nothin' but a murderer.

126
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,916
You're a superhuman.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,166
And it's not your fault.
They did this to you, right?

128
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,083
Yeah. To help my country.

129
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,750
I thought it would be
the right thing to do.

130
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,333
Superhumans are supposed
to be a new frontier.

131
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,916
A beacon, leading humanity
to a brighter future.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,208
That was the story I was told
that got me to volunteer.

133
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:27,458
But what really happened in
those jungles was inhuman.

134
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,333
[JONATHAN]
The people of that country,

135
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,416
they didn't want our freedom.

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,791
They preferred the
darkness of the forest.

137
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,583
They hid in the jungle
with monstrosities.

138
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,583
Attacking us without mercy.

139
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,500
If we hesitated, we'd be killed.

140
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,291
On the battlefield, all I could
think about was surviving.

141
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,916
I kept telling myself, if I
only got out of the jungle,

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,458
I'd be able to prove
it wasn't all in vain.

143
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,625
Show that everything we
did was for justice.

144
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,041
That there was a
reason for fighting.

145
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,083
And now here I am.

146
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,291
Once I learned murderers
can't set foot on U.S. soil,

147
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,125
I lost faith in
everything I believed.

148
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,166
It was as if my whole
world fell apart.

149
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,541
As if my own parents
betrayed me.

150
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm gonna be killed like this.

151
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,375
A broken weapon.

152
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,125
Betrayed by your parents. Huh.

153
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,250
I think I know how you feel.

154
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,916
Jiro. Are you a superhuman?

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,166
[JIRO]
No.

156
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,416
I'm just a normal man
who looks up to them.

157
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,666
You must be disappointed then.

158
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,833
Meeting one and having him
turn out to be a criminal.

159
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,208
[JIRO] Superhumans do
what no human can.

160
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,375
You said it yourself,
they're a beacon.

161
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,291
A symbol of hope in
a hopeless world.

162
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,250
You wanted power to help people.

163
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,916
But your government
used you as a weapon.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,083
You're not to blame for this.

165
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,708
Long ago, my life was
saved by a superhuman.

166
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,291
He restored my hope,

167
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,833
taught me the
importance of justice.

168
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,500
After I was betrayed,

169
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:11,083
I got back on my feet because I
remembered what he stood for.

170
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,416
You're a good superhuman.

171
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,083
And you deserve the chance
to prove it to the world.

172
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,125
That's why we can't
let you die here.

173
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:25,375
You have to go home and denounce
the crimes of your military.

174
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,291
"A normal man." Yeah, right.

175
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,291
[screaming]

176
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,458
Jonathan, what--?

177
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,250
The window! The window!

178
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,333
There's nothing out there!

179
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,083
[CAROLCO]
We're showing you these files

180
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,916
only because we hold you
in the highest regard.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please remember that these are
classified military documents.

182
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,458
For your eyes-only.

183
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,583
No matter how tough a
superhuman body may be,

184
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,333
an operation this
extreme would put

185
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,291
an incredible amount of
stress on anyone's mind.

186
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,958
It's no wonder they're
mentally unstable.

187
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,291
Seems the U.S learned
nothing after the tragedy

188
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,916
with the Cheetah Unit.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,833
Don't you dare compare
our revolutionary program

190
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,750
with those of pre-war Japan.

191
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,291
Its roots are
completely different

192
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,875
from those of your country's
Imperialist agenda.

193
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,250
Superhumans used for
military purposes.

194
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,125
How are they different?

195
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,750
[CAROLCO]
Ideology.

196
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,291
America strives for
a greater cause.

197
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,791
We're soldiers who fight
for all of humanity.

198
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,416
Meaning what?

199
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,916
Born from regular humans,

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,875
we superhumans are the
next step in evolution.

201
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,250
We will guide the world
into a future of promise.

202
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,291
Ancient spirits hinder
the progress of mankind,

203
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,166
shackling us to an
old world mentality.

204
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,041
The Bogeyman, El Coco, trolls.

205
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:51,666
Believe here, you
call them the <i>yokai</i> .

206
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,083
Whatever name they go by,

207
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,291
the old rulers must be
eliminated from this world.

208
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,083
That is our military's purpose.

209
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,666
After we cleanse
South East Asia,

210
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,708
we'll move on to
the Middle East.

211
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,083
[MAGOTAKE] You intend to murder
every monster in the world?

212
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,458
The United States is among
the world's youngest nations,

213
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,625
yet we've achieved historically
unrivaled prosperity,

214
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,791
which could only be done

215
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
by delegitimizing
the native cultures.

216
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,208
It's our responsibility
to spread this glory

217
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,375
to the entire world.

218
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,083
To all nations.

219
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,541
How? By invading them?

220
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,666
[phone rings]

221
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,000
[CAROLCO]
'Bout time.

222
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,458
[KIKKO] Jiro told us to stay
away from the investigation.

223
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,083
But we're gonna interfere again?

224
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,041
[EMI]
What was the alternative?

225
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,375
You were going to
convince the Bureau

226
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,708
he's right and we're wrong?

227
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,125
Hey, it might've worked.

228
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,458
Anyway we should double-check
the military's claims

229
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,958
to see how much of it is true.

230
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,500
The Americans should have no
problem finding a deserter,

231
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,041
but if we find him first,

232
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,750
at least we'll be able to
use it to our advantage.

233
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,375
You gals said you
located Sergeant Morrell?

234
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,750
Right over there.

235
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,916
Wait! I thought you were--

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,583
[CAROLCO]
This is gonna be dangerous.

237
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,166
Please stand back.

238
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,625
Hey!

239
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,625
[SOLDIER A]
Huh? Empty?

240
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,208
Oh, no. Did I get
the rooms confused?

241
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,833
Never shoulda
trusted you, bogeymen.

242
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,041
This is insane! You
can't do this in Japan!

243
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,375
If you think our
actions are excessive,

244
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,958
you simply don't comprehend
the gravity of the situation.

245
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,666
I assure you, to keep
damages to a minimum,

246
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,875
this is the most effective
solution for us.

247
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,583
I leave this site
to your command.

248
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,833
No problem.

249
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,166
Do as you like and leave
us to clean up your mess.

250
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,875
Not that I expected
anything else.

251
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,625
If you knew this would happen,

252
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,041
why did you volunteer
to help them?

253
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,458
It was the best way to protect
Jiro from the U.S. military.

254
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
Instead of resisting
them head-on,

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,791
we should pretend to be
allies and get in their way.

256
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh.

257
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,583
Still, it seems an awful
lot more diabolical

258
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,250
than your usual style.

259
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,291
Everyone else we've fought

260
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,750
wasn't worth getting
serious over.

261
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,458
But today is different.
I'm facing my true enemy.

262
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,791
[MASTER ULTIMA] I received
the photo you sent over.

263
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,250
The person accompanying the
deserter is Jiro Hitoyoshi.

264
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,000
[CAROLCO]
Who is he, sir?

265
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,958
[MASTER ULTIMA]
Let us just say he holds the key

266
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,291
to upcoming energy strategies.

267
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,708
A walking atomic weapon
in the right hands.

268
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,041
Colonel, this is a golden
opportunity for us.

269
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,166
Please make this man's capture
your highest priority.

270
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,875
His corpse will suffice.

271
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,541
My mission is to track and
recover Master Sergeant Morrell.

272
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,500
[MASTER ULTIMA] Compared to the
capture of Jiro Hitoyoshi,

273
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,000
finding a single deserter
is of no consequence.

274
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,541
[CAROLCO] Understood, sir.
You can count on us.

275
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,208
Damn. Looks like these guys are
pullin' out all the stops.

276
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,375
Jonathan. Are you okay?

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,416
[screams]

278
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,916
Come back here!

279
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,583
[JIRO]
Jonathan!

280
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,458
Don't give up! You have
a home to go back to.

281
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,458
No. That's not the point.

282
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,041
I mean, I still want to go home.

283
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,958
But more than that, I can't
stand being in this country.

284
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:28,083
I have to get out of here.
It's driving me mad!

285
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,083
The stench of the water,

286
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,458
of the plants and animals living
in the rivers and forests.

287
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,250
My homeland has
none of these smells.

288
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,250
Nothing is familiar here.

289
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,916
I miss the smell of cities--
of human beings!

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,916
But this country, it just
reminds me of that damn jungle!

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,583
Everywhere I look,
there's monsters!

292
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,291
Jonathan!

293
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,666
[JIRO]
Where did he go?

294
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,125
Way to ruin the
mountain atmosphere.

295
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,208
What kind of airplane
was that, anyway?

296
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,250
It had a really weird shape.

297
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
A monster!

298
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,375
Oh, no.

299
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,166
Jonathan!

300
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,750
Jiro. You don't have to worry.

301
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,041
I finally figured out
how superhumans

302
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,291
should lead humanity.

303
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,916
Every person needs
to have faith.

304
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,541
That's why the
legendary creatures

305
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,416
are still worshipped today.

306
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,250
But if we're going to replace
them with a new deity,

307
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,125
it has to be stronger,
more hideous.

308
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,583
The absolute
embodiment of terror!

309
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,958
Walking death!

310
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,208
Understand? Death and terror.

311
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,750
There's no truth more
universal than those.

312
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,583
Jonathan. But why?

313
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,958
We'll enlighten the ignorant
masses with the sound

314
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,750
of our tank treads and
the flames from our napalm!

315
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,916
We'll burn every inch
of this planet!

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And only then can
civilization begin anew!

317
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,250
The fear we bring
will unite the world!

318
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,041
Snap out of it!

319
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm wide awake!

320
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,625
Stand down, Jiro Hitoyoshi.
This isn't your fight.

321
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,791
Leave him to me.

322
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,833
[MAGOTAKE]
Open your eyes, Jiro!

323
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,958
It's far too late
to save him now!

324
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,125
So you wanna abandon him?
Throw him away like garbage?

325
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,750
We're not. We're here to take
the Sergeant back home.

326
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,083
With whatever shred
of honor he still has.

327
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,500
[JONATHAN]
Liar! I have no home!

328
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,375
Only war will embrace
what I've become!

329
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,541
Every place I go, I'll
paint red with blood.

330
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,041
I'll purify.

331
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,000
I will make a battlefield
out of this place, too!

332
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,083
Sergeant, I'm relieving
you of your command!

333
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,041
You can't take war
away from me!

334
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,250
Your fight is over, soldier.

335
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,000
I want to see my home again.

336
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,916
[CAROLCO]
You will. I promise.

337
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:59,208
[JIRO] Now you take him back?
After you've killed him?

338
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,875
[CAROLCO]
Jiro Hitoyoshi.

339
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,875
You will surrender
and come with us.

340
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,208
Who are you to judge me?

341
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,375
[CAROLCO]
We are soldiers of freedom.

342
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,041
The flag bearers for the future.

343
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
Freedom, you say?

344
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,208
You're full of it! You
destroyed Jonathan's heart!

345
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,166
[CAROLCO] It's a path we
all must take some day!

346
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,958
But there is no turning back!

347
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,375
We will continue fighting
until the end of the world!

348
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,958
[JIRO]
You wanna sacrifice your friends

349
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,333
just to let the war go on?

350
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,750
[CAROLCO] Until the old
rulers are eliminated,

351
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,916
our war will never be finished.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,333
And on that day,

353
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,500
the burned husks of our honor
can finally return home,

354
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,791
wrapped in our flag.

355
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,541
That is not justice.
It's insanity!

356
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,708
You have no right to
talk about justice.

357
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,041
Your country worships
both good and evil.

358
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,583
Idolizes heroes and villains.

359
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,666
Wake up to the new era!

360
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,625
Your death will guide humanity
to its glorious future!

361
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,000
[KIKKO]
Meteortail!

362
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,833
[CAROLCO]
Uh! He vanished.

363
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,708
Are you behind this, Magotake?

364
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,875
You got Sergeant Jonathan
Morrell's body back.

365
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,208
Your "mission" is
officially over.

366
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,375
Now kindly leave
Japan immediately.

367
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,208
[REPORTER A] According to
Superhuman Security Services,

368
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,666
the monster that caused
the explosion in Tachikawa

369
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,791
was killed earlier this
morning in Daizoukyoujiyama.

370
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,166
That was quick.

371
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,958
Imperial Ads already had
their cover story in place.

372
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,416
[REPORTER A]
...and killed by security forces

373
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,083
after a brief struggle.

374
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,125
The monster is said to
have been a refugee

375
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,291
from Southeast Asia, where
fighting still continues.

376
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,041
The incident is sure to
cause the government

377
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,083
to reevaluate its border
control policies.

378
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,958
[RAITO] There was no place
for him to go back to.

379
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,916
He was a freak created for war

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,125
and could only survive
on the battlefield.

381
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,041
You wasted your time.

382
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,000
No, I didn't.

383
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,208
Jonathan wanted
to be a good guy.

384
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,583
And tried to become one.

385
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,583
That was reason enough
for me to try'n help him.

386
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,708
And see it through to the end.

387
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,458
[MICHIKO]
My name is Michiko Tozaki,

388
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,125
CEO of Superhuman
Security Services.

389
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,625
As we have revealed before,

390
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,166
we will import a super robot
from the American company,

391
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,500
Tries Corporation.

392
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,375
All we need are pilots.

393
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,875
You can count on us
to defend Japan!
