[REPORTER A]
Three months have passed

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,041
since the grand opening of
the Okinawa Superhuman Expo

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,541
and the festivities
continue to this day.

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,708
Superhumans have gathered
from all around the globe

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,708
to attend this event,
the first of its kind.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,583
Many conflicts have
arisen around their kind

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,791
in recent decades.

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,916
But now, thanks to
Master Ultima's efforts,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,833
superhumans have promised
to work together

10
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,875
for the benefit of humanity.

11
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,000
So you gonna tell
me who you are?

12
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,791
Or why you came to this country?

13
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,166
[ULTIMA]
Of course.

14
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,541
I am Master Ultima, and I've
come for the creatures.

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,250
[KOMA laughs]

16
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,666
[KOMA] Sorry but if you were
trying to not be offensive,

17
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,708
you failed. So why not
call us what we are?

18
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,416
[ULTIMA sighs]
Fine, in your terminology,

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,666
i'm here to eliminate
the <i>kaiju</i> , <i>yokai</i> ,

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,708
and devils once and for all.

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,291
That's crazy.

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,333
[EMI]
And the truth finally comes out.

23
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,250
Well, if it isn't
the Yokai Princess.

24
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,166
Reports say superhumans
are disappearing

25
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,666
once they arrive for the expo.
But when you look closer,

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,958
only the types you just
listed have gone missing.

27
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,583
This is your doing.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,083
Haven't we met before?
You know Jiro somehow, right?

29
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,958
[EMI] I'm actually supposed
to be his fiancée.

30
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,166
I'm sorry they threw you in
the "freak" category, too.

31
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,250
[gasps] What is wrong
with you, my friends?

32
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,041
[EMI]
You don't get to call them that.

33
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,333
Especially now that your
power to subdue <i>kaiju</i>

34
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,125
has been nullified.

35
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,125
They don't seem too happy
now that I've filled them in

36
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,958
on what you've been doing here.

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,541
I guess you can say that
I opened their eyes.

38
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,041
[ULTIMA]
So I see.

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,083
Initiate: Freeze Mode!

40
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,083
[FIRE MONSTER] Princess.
He is quite formidable.

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,250
Yes.

42
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,041
[ULTIMA] Have you not realized
no superhuman can defeat me?

43
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,708
[EMI] You truly think
I find your silly

44
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,000
Bio Destroyer intimidating?

45
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,291
[EMI]
It's us against them now.

46
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:22,583
It's time we showed the world
we're the real superhumans.

47
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,291
[FUTAGAMI] The Superhuman
Bureau this Emi Kino used to

48
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,958
work for has been dormant since
the <i>Great Prophecy of Japan</i>

49
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,583
film was released
in theaters last year.

50
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,041
In light of these recent events,

51
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,916
it has officially
been shut down.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,625
With that, our first
order of business

53
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,583
is arresting its former members.

54
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,083
[REPORTER A] Following its
transfer from the cabinet

55
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,208
to the office of the
Ministry of Defense,

56
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,000
the Public Safety
Force has united

57
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,416
with the police department's

58
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,166
Superhuman Violence
Regulation Headquarters.

59
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,083
Together, they have
been reestablished

60
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,083
as the Super Soldier
Warrior Squad.

61
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,291
Today marks the start
of their first mission:

62
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,083
A mass search of radical
superhuman hideouts.

63
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,375
They're looking for
a terrorist group,

64
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,708
with ties to the recent
murder of Master Ultima,

65
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,875
calling themselves "Monsters."

66
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,208
Many potential suspects,
including kaiju and devils,

67
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:18,500
have since occupied
Ultimapolis, eluding arrest.

68
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,958
Along with the
proactive approach

69
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,000
of the Super Soldier
Warrior Squad,

70
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,916
the government is attempting to
negotiate with the Monsters.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,958
All of this in hopes of
preventing incidents

72
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,541
like last year's Maru-nochi
bombings from happening again.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,541
[ALL gasp]

74
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,833
Good choice going with
the tear gas, guys.

75
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,375
But it won't work on me!

76
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,500
[SHAKKOU]
That's why I'm here.

77
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,833
To destroy you
with my own hands!

78
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,500
[SHAKKOU]
Megasshin! Get him!

79
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,625
[MIEKO]
It's all right.

80
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,458
[HANTA]
We have bigger concerns.

81
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,875
[MAGOTAKE]
I'm telling you,

82
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,041
I haven't seen the other former
bureau members in months.

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,000
They all left after that movie.

84
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,416
I guess they didn't
want to work for

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,416
an "evil organization that
harbored a violent beast."

86
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,791
We can barely go
out in public now.

87
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,750
[HYOUMA] "A violent beast."
So where is Jiro?

88
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,458
I couldn't tell you if I wanted.

89
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,791
I haven't seen him
since New Year's.

90
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,083
[JIRO gasps]

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,083
[CHINATSU]
Mr. Jiro! It's really you!

92
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,583
Uh, sorry.

93
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,541
[JIRO]
It's okay. Are you leaving us?

94
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,416
[gasps]

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
I have to.

96
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,625
[JIRO] I get it. Thank you
for everything you've done.

97
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm engaged now. He's nice.

98
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,500
He has a child already,
but I don't mind.

99
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,458
[REPORTER A]
Needless to say,

100
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,833
the film that came out
earlier this month,

101
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,625
<i>Great Prophecy of Japan</i> ,
took us by surprise.

102
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,833
Is it true there was a <i>kaiju</i>
within the Superhuman Bureau?

103
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,125
[REPORTER B]
Afraid so.

104
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,833
Twenty years ago,
there was a mysterious fire

105
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,583
that damaged Shinbashi, Ginza,

106
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,458
as well as the
National Diet Building.

107
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,458
That same beast is said
to have been responsible

108
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,875
for these events.

109
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,875
It was just a movie.
Another of Satomi's products.

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,916
It's not "just a movie."

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,166
The people who
saw it believe it.

112
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,125
Besides, I know it's true.

113
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,416
[gasps]

114
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,750
I want to know.
Where did I come from?

115
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,541
I told him.

116
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,541
About the hypothesis you
proposed to me so long ago.

117
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,250
Really? I don't imagine
Jiro liked hearing

118
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,583
he could be the connection
between two worlds.

119
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,958
[MAGOTAKE]
In our world, 30 years ago,

120
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
during the summer in Hiroshima,

121
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,916
it seemed as if the new
bomb had been a failure.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,958
However, what if instead
of vaporizing the city,

123
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,500
the bomb's destructive energies
took on the form of baby boy?

124
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,250
[HYOUMA] While, in a different
overlapping world,

125
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,791
those same energies successfully
wrought devastation.

126
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,291
There wouldn't be
anything left standing

127
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,750
after a blast like that.

128
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,041
But it would mean
they've harnessed

129
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,666
the power of nuclear fission,

130
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,458
freeing them from the strife
surrounding fossil fuels.

131
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,416
A world like that will
have obtained peace.

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,083
Nice theory, but it doesn't
explain why Jiro exists.

133
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,333
Because someone
wished for him to.

134
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,208
Whoever that was,
they wanted to save us.

135
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,416
They didn't want us to
experience the same death,

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,458
destruction, and tragedy
that had happened

137
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,916
in the other world.

138
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,916
[MAGOTAKE] When a person
cries out for help,

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,958
someone has to swoop in
and save the day.

140
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,166
So that's what I did,
the day I heard you crying.

141
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,083
[JIRO]
Then the Bureau's purpose...

142
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,541
[MAGOTAKE] Wasn't to
protect all superhumans.

143
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,458
It was to protect
one superhuman.

144
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:44,041
You, Jiro. We were
defending you.

145
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,833
Satomi, the Americans,
they were all after you.

146
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,250
That's why we had to organize:
To keep you safe.

147
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,958
[JIRO]
I don't deserve to be saved.

148
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,125
[MAGOTAKE]
Jiro.

149
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,625
I've killed people,
like Rainbow Knight.

150
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,791
Then there's Shinbashi,
the kaiju made from my blood.

151
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,875
I'm responsible for
those murders, too.

152
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,875
That's why you should let
the Bureau protect you!

153
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,666
[JIRO]
I won't go back!

154
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,291
You don't care about me!

155
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,958
You just care
about your "science"!

156
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,708

the way superhumans

Of course! What happened?

00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,000
[EARTH- <i>CHAN</i> ] I'm not sure.
Something's wrong with me.

[KIKKO]
Mr. Jaguar!

321
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,583
Earth- <i>chan</i> gets her power

322
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,625
from receiving distress
calls from people in need.

323
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,958
Which means she requires
their suffering to survive.

324
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,458
But since she couldn't bring
herself to make others suffer,

325

even in self-defense,
she ran out of juice.

[SHAKKOU]
Of course we did!

329
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,750

Run away with us, Jiro.

This place is full of

You do know that they're
the bad guys now, right?

00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,000
I know they've chosen
to fight humans

'cause it's the only

to protect the humans!

Just because someone
has superpowers,

386
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,041
it doesn't mean that
they are superhuman.

There's no way they could
have ever been our saviors.

So instead, they're our enemies.

those away years ago!

to never tell her that?

She had to do it, otherwise
we couldn't keep you safe!

396
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,708
She even made Jiro promise
to never see you again

397
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,958
so you wouldn't lose control.

398

You mean, the reason Mr. Jiro
left the Superhuman Bureau...

399
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,166
...was because of me?

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,333
[HYOUMA]
It's over, Hoshino.

401

There's no point in

[KIKKO]
There's not?

403
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,333
We've found them.

404
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,125
The Ultimapolis surfaced
near Okinawa.

405
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,000
Jiro defeated the S Planetarian,

406
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,500
then declared war
against all superhumans.

407
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,041
[KIKKO]
Moments later,

408
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,625
Miss Emi appeared before the
world to release a statement.

409
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,333
The superhuman city built
as the home of the Expo

410
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,833
would now be a safe
haven for y <i>okai</i> , <i>kaiju</i> ,

411
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,291
and other demi-humans.

412
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,083
On that land, they would
be eternally free.

413
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,791
According to our
latest research,

414
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,625
these inhuman
creatures can be used

415
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,958
to create a completely
new form of energy.

416
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,500
[KIKKO]
Soon thereafter,

417
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,583
Satomi revealed the truth
he'd hidden away for so long.

418
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,791
However, we've been
fighting over this resource

419
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,333
for many years now.

420
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,250
So mother nature decided to
provide us with something else.

421
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,458
The way he talks about them

422
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,791
makes me sympathize
with the monsters.

423
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,791
[SATOMI] Has there ever
been a more appropriate time

424
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,333
for superhumans
to band together?

425
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,291
[KIKKO]
The people made their choice.

426
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,375
As did the superhumans.

427
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,250
After all, in this era where
the line between right and wrong

428
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,750
is so hard to see,

429
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,458
they finally had what
they'd wanted all along.

430
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,666
An enemy to overcome.

431
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,291
And so the fighting began.

432
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,583
Both the Self Defense Force

433
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,958
and the American military
kept their distance,

434
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,708
fearing a Bio Destroyer leak.

435
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,708
This had become our fight,
and we had to do it alone.

436
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,250
[JIRO] It's time to wake up
and face the music.

437
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:10,375
Justice is here. But has this
really been a child's dream?

438
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,625
Either way, I will keep singing.

439
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,916
What about you?

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,458

final episode:

441
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,083
"Can you still sing?"
