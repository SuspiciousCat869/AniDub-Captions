159
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,000
much as we did our own.

160
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,250
Under our rule,

161
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,166
we'll lead the inferior
Earthlings to greatness.

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,958
[JIRO] Have you ever
heard of the Fumers?

163
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,625
They're an advanced race
of space creatures.

164
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,833
That kind of rings a bell.

165
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,166
They bond with other
beings as host bodies.

166
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,583
I hear they're enemies
with Imperial Ads.

167
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,750
They also stopped the
revised Superhuman Law.

168
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,083
[AKI] Okay, so, what do
they have to do with--?

169
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,125
[groans]

170
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:21,958
[gasps]

171
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,333
[JIRO]
Hey! What's wrong?

172
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,791
[MICHIKO] We can't be held
responsible for people we fire.

173
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,458
They're no longer under
contract with us.

174
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,583
So you admit it. The person
in the photo is Arachne?

175
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,250
A member of the Angel Stars?

176
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,458
[MICHIKO]
Former.

177
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,708
She is a former member.

178
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,625
So why did you let her go?

179
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,791
Happens all the time.

180
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,291
Tell us the reason.

181
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,458
A scandal.

182
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,833
A scandal?

183
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,750
Bless your heart.
I thought you'd grown up.

184
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,500
But you still have
a lot to learn.

185
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,000
I know what she means!

186
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,083
Arachne was involved with
someone she shouldn't have been.

187
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,416
And then, she and the
man, um, you know...

188
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,875
Well, not necessarily a man.

189
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,833
[KIKKO sighs]

190
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,000
[EMI]
I know you.

191
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,625
Ladies. Please, call me Satomi.

192
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,458
I'm an advisor for this company.

193
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,125
Whenever they have
a need for me.

194
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,625
Yoshiaki Satomi,
is that correct?

195
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,583
Dr. Hitoyoshi has
mentioned you before.

196
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,541
Oh? He and the professor
know each other? That's good.

197
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,958
If you'd be so kind,

198
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,458
I'd like you to let us handle
the Arachne situation.

199
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,916
You're looking, too?

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,458
We need to question her!

201
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,041
Maybe we can work
together on it.

202
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,333
Not a chance.

203
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,708
I never keep company with
monsters and demons.

204
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,958
It's mutual.

205
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,125
I have no desire to work
with an ex-superhuman

206
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,458
who spent his days scheming with
the military during the war.

207
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,083
To our company,
superhumans are a product.

208
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,458
Something for humans
to admire and lust after.

209
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,958
We would never
risk putting those

210
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,250
who might disgrace our good
name on the same shelf.

211
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,916
A product?

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Who does that guy think he is?

213
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,125
Treating us like
we're the enemy?

214
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,333
[EMI] The Public Security Forces
want superhumans for weapons.

215
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,666
The Bureau wants to
protect superhumans.

216
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,583
Those guys just wanna make
money exploiting them.

217
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,458
Human beings are so
needlessly convoluted.

218
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,666
And then there's Jiro,

219
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,833
who seems intent on
taking the Bureau down.

220
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,958
I can't believe you're
not angry, Miss Emi.

221
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,625
Oh, I'm very angry.
So it's time to do this--

222
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,208
[gasps]

223
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,541
If these will lead us to Jiro,
why didn't you use them before?

224
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
Then I'd just be the girl
chasing the boy.

225
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,166
How embarrassing.

226
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,916
[AKI]
Are you disgusted?

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,375
I didn't realize Judas
did modification work,

228
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,750
not just healing.

229
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,041
I told him I wanted
to be stronger.

230
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,333
I asked him for them.

231
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,916
Being a superhuman
Idol wasn't enough?

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,333
Back then, I only
did as I was told.

233
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,625
When student protests were
popular, we took their side.

234
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,708
Then right away, we switched
to the police's, but...

235
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,041
[JIRO]
Yeah, I get it.

236
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,291
You gals thought you were
doin' the right thing.

237
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,416
[AKI chuckles]

238
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,625
What's so funny?

239
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,541
You quit bein' that
crooked ad agency's pawn

240
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,083
because you discovered
a sense of justice, right?

241
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,125
"Justice! Justice!" Is that
all you think about?

242
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,250
What a bunch of
self-righteous nonsense.

243
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,291
You're such a drag!

244
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
[grunts]

245
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,833
Seriously? Stop treating all
o' this like it's just a game!

246
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,791
Our parents went to war

247
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,583
to protect this nation's
sense of justice.

248
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,208
Trouble is, they lost,

249
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,291
because it never existed
in the first place.

250
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,666
Two sides, fighting.

251
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,041
Each one believing
they were "right."

252
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,500
And just look where it got us.

253
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,541
You're obsolete, Jiro Hitoyoshi.

254
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:46,333
Oh. Right. I, uh,
don't know your name.

255
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,166
[AKI]
Aki Haruka.

256
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,291
That's pretty.

257
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,791
Said the traditional
way, "Haruka Aki,"

258
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,458
it sounds like it means
"Spring or Autumn."

259
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,500
Seems so indecisive and unclear.

260
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,083
Guess I don't want my life
to go the same way.

261
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,875
[HYOUMA] Here it is.
I knew she looked familiar.

262
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,166
She used to be a member
of the Angel Stars.

263
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,833
[FUUROUTA]
Fanny was their drummer.

264
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,875
Cause of death not released?
She was so young.

265
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,666
The way it's worded,
it might have been a suicide.

266
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,708
Unless...

267
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,541
[AKI]
Fanny and I were dating.

268
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:22,083
[JIRO] She was the
drummer from your band.

269
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,375
[AKI] The agency found out,
called it scandalous.

270
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,875
Not only for an idol,
but for a superhuman.

271
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,416
Being ordered to
fight was one thing,

272
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,708
but being bound by
someone's idea of love,

273
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,750
just because of who I am inside?

274
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,458
So then, where's Fanny
after all this?

275
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,666
She's been set free now.

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,166
[JIRO]
Free?

277
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,750
Is it wrong for superhumans
to want freedom?

278
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,750
I don't understand justice.

279
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,583
After everything, I just
don't have it in me.

280
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,416
But these Fumers,
they seem to know.

281
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,166
Maybe they could teach me.

282
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,000
True justice is beyond
human comprehension.

283
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,500
So now I have to
learn it from them.

284
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,875
Please, Jiro, bring them to me.

285
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,791
The Fumers are gone.

286
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,958
[UCHIHATA]
Akita! What are you doing?

287
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,458
[SHIMAZU]
Akita!

288
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,083
We Fumers are
incomplete on our own.

289
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,666
So if you don't join with
another lifeform soon,

290
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,500
you'll die!

291
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,875
[UCHIHATA]
That's right.

292
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,500
And with a regular life form,
we don't last long.

293
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,125
We worked years to create
the ultimate superhuman,

294
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,583
something that could be worthy
of becoming our vessel.

295
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,500
[SHIMAZU] That was what this
pavilion was supposed to be.

296
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,708
We don't have time
for a casual chat!

297
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,500
Without a body,
you won't last long!

298
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,750
That's right! This one's the
closest thing you have!

299
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,875
[UCHIHATA]
Too cramped.

300
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,041
[SHIMAZU]
We'll take his next!

301
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,958
Well, go on, what're
you waiting for?

302
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,250
Take me if you can!

303
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,458
[AKITA] We can only
invade lifeless bodies.

304
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,500
They need you dead first.

305
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,666
Oh my God,
you mean all this time,

306
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,250
these people you're replacing,
you've been killing them?

307
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,250
You wanted to protect
superhumans

308
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,250
just so you could take
them over and use them

309
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,958
as your damn puppets?

310
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,375
[AKITA]
Think of it as a farm.

311
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,916
[SHIMAZU] Akita! Stop chatting
and help us finish this!

312
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,750
[JIRO]
That's why you built the Bureau?

313
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,666
So your species could
harvest superhumans?

314
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,416
Unlock one!
