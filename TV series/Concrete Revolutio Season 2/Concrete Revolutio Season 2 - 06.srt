[EARTH- <i>CHAN</i> ] You think that

Just being superhuman

Yet, I arrested many in

Have you noticed any
growing around your house?

300

Uh.

Yeah, I have. A whole

We tried pulling them out,

growing back in.

00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,833
I see.

305
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,208
That's consistent with what I've
heard in other cases as well.

306
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,666
The Canada Goldenrod performs
a process called "Allelopathy."

307
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,833
This means it emits chemicals
that inhibit the growth

308
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,333
of other nearby plants.

309
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,916
However, these seem to be
mutated so that the chemicals

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,083
are stimulating dormant
superhuman genes.

311
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,541
Which explains my
health exam results.

312
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
It does seem to be
the most likely cause

313
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,083
as far as we can tell.

314
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,208
So we're burning the colonies
whenever we come across them.

Don't worry, I'll handle
all of the legal work.

319
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,958
Oh, look! That's Christmas Day!

320
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,291
I guess you'll be
giving your daughter

321
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,333
the gift of good health
this year, won't you?

322
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,125
And then I really won't be
a superhuman anymore.

323
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,041
[MICHIKO]
That's the idea.

324
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,125
We believe this
mutant strand...

325
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,041
Dad, look! I drew Human-Man!

326
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,333
Tell me, sweetie, who's cooler:
Him or your old man?

327
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,625
Human-Man!

328
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,291
Sorry, Daddy, but since
Mommy went to heaven,

329
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,500
all you ever do is cry.

330
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,208
[SHAKKOU] Local residents, may
I please have your attention?

331
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
We are about to begin
the incineration process

332
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,375
of these dangerous plants.

333
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,916
They are believed to
be the cause behind

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,958
a widespread
pollution-based disease

335
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,166
currently affecting the nation.

336
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,958
We posted several newspaper ads

337
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,000
to notify you of
today's procedure.

338
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,375
Your safety is of the
utmost importance.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,833
Human-Man?

340
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,625
What are you doing?

341
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,458
[WAKAMURA]
You can't destroy these plants.

342
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,958
I won't let you!

343
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,500
That's just great.

344
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,750
[FUUROUTA]
I don't get it.

345
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,666
I thought Human-Man was
one of the good guys!

346
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,791
He probably has the
superhuman disease.

347
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,625
That would explain why
he showed up outta nowhere.

348
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,833
[EMI]
He must realize that if

349
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,375
the mutated plants
are destroyed,

350
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,250
he'll lose the source
of his powers.

351
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,291
But he isn't aware
of how widespread

352
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,500
this issue is becoming.

353
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,041
Most of those who've developed
powers have no idea

354
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,250
how to control them.

355
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,083
The worst cases wind
up in the hospital,

356
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,250
while others just have trouble

357
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,000
adapting to their
daily routines.

358
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,083
Are you saying we
shouldn't protect them?

359
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,583
That disease victims aren't
the same as other superhumans?

360
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,416
[MAGOTAKE] If having
powers becomes the norm,

361
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,291
there will inevitably
be more riots.

362
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,291
So, no, we should
get more samples,

363
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,166
but this is the Security
Force's problem.

364
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,333
Sounds like we're settling
for their leftovers.

365
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,666
Jiro would never go
along with this.

366
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,416
What, Kikko?

367
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,708
Sorry. Excuse me.

368
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,291
[ULLR]
Wait, Star Child!

369
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,833
Oh, good. Now I have
to return that.

370
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,958
Human-Man! Why are you
hurting those people?

371
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,416
[SHAKKOU]
Cease your attack immediately!

372
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,916
These plants are ruining
lives across the country!

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,208
By defending them,
you're making people suffer.

374
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,958
And I won't allow it!

375
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
He's here!

376
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,083
Jiro Hitoyoshi!

377
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,583
Why are you doing
this, Mr. Wakamura?

378
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,958
You said you were happy
to be a superhuman.

379
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,083
You refused to use your
powers for personal gain.

380
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,708
So what's making you lash out?

381
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,291
Ullr, wha--?

382
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,833
[ULLR] I have a message. This
man has the superhuman disease.

383
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,208
I've heard of it.

384
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,791
[ULLR] Those flowers are
the cause of his condition.

385
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,458
Without them, he will become
a normal human again.

386
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,583
That's why he's protecting them.

387
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
Aw, crap!

388
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,458
[SHAKKOU]
Listen, Hitoyoshi!

389
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,000
If that villain refuses to move,

390
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,083
we'll have no choice
but to attack!

391
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,500
[WAKAMURA] I'm a villain?
I guess that's true.

392
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,500
These plants are hurting
people simply by existing.

393
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,416
And as long as I fight to keep
them from being destroyed,

394
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,375
I'm no better than a
criminal who would try

395
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,833
to poison the
city's water supply.

396
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,291
You can't be serious.
Don't think that way!

397
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,875
[ULLR] This man is knowingly
risking the lives of others

398
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,208
just so that he may
remain powerful.

399
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,833
There is no reason for
you to protect him.

400
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,458
End of message!

401

an obsession for you?

Earth- <i>Chan</i> . Not you, too!

There's no denying the truth.

407
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
That man didn't
become a superhuman

408
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,333
for the sake of world peace
or vanquishing evil,

409
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,541
and therefore, he has
no heart of justice.

You don't know that!

You need to help save him!

[WAKAMURA]
That's my daughter.

415
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,916
She's the one who
loves superhumans.

416
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,583
So when I became one,
I thought she would be happy.

stay this way.

For her!

419
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,458
That reasoning doesn't make
up for all of the trouble

your actions are causing for
countless innocent lives.

Yeah, you're right.

But honestly,

424
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,833
I've never concerned myself
with the welfare of others.

Ever since her mother
passed away,

I haven't been there

My obsession is my disease.

You're not Mommy, are you?

You must be the one
who called out to me.

463
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,041
It's because of you that
I was able to grow.

As a thank you, I will take the
cause of this conflict away.

465

there was no stopping

the mutant Canada Goldenrods
from growing all over Japan.

And so, many
superhumans were born.

Because of this, the 48th
year of the Shinka Era

During the Waring States era,

475
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,250
a heroic youngster sped
through the turmoil,

476
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,875
living and dying
to protect Japan

477
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,875
from the Evil Zeth Satan Clan.

Let us join our hearts together.
The time to transform is now!

00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,708
