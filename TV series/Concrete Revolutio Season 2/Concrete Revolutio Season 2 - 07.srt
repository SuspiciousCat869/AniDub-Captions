00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,708
Mr. Tasman. Where do these
mountains of ice come from?

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,875
A continent known
as Magallánica.

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:24,125
A mysterious land located
somewhere on the southern seas,

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,583
yet to be discovered.

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,333
It's said to be completely
covered with snow.

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,250
Ruled by strange creatures with
pouches on their stomachs.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,291
[KOMA] A place not even the
explorers of Europe have seen.

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,583
That is my destination.

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,041
It's too dangerous!

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,875
I thank you for taking me this
far, Mr. Tasman. Goodbye.

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,333
[EXPLORER A]
It's not unheard of.

12
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,916
An explorer goes missing,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,333
then years later, the ice will
melt and we'll find their body.

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,416
Hm?

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,208
[EXPLORER A] I don't know
which base she's from,

16
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,333
but I guess we have
to dig her out.

17
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,750
[EMI]
That expression on her face.

18
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,000
[MAGOTAKE] Looks like she's
smiling, doesn't it?

19
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,708
[EMI]
Is she a superhuman?

20
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,458
[MAGOTAKE]
She'd have to be to survive.

21
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,458
Frozen in place for
over 300 years.

22
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,583
[EMI] But her outfit,
it's definitely Japanese.

23
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,583
How did she end
up in Antarctica?

24
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,875
[MAGOTAKE]
Good question.

25
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,041
Could she be related
to your kind?

26
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,666
That's too far back for
me to have knowledge of.

27
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,750
She doesn't smell
like a <i>yokai</i> though.

28
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,958
[SATOMI]
Sold!

29

[MAGOTAKE]
Why am I not surprised?

30
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,166
Imperial Ads has
purchased this decoration

31
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,250
from the Environmental Agency.

32
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
We'll handle the investigation.

33
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,083
The Superhuman Bureau
will be reimbursed

34
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,250
for maintenance and
transportation costs.

35
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,583
It will be invoiced as a
"reference material fee."

36
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,208
What's your scheme
this time, Mr. Satomi?

37
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,458
My scheme? A rather
bizarre choice of words.

38
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,791
The Superhuman Bureau,

39
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,291
the Public Security Force,
and Imperial Ads?

40
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,833
We all work together now.

41
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,041
Public and private, creating
better policies for superhumans.

42
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,458
[MICHIKO] And now we
have one frozen in ice.

43
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,083
Think of the publicity.

44
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,041
It's really a shame they're
going to wake her up.

45
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,166
Seems like she's
having a good dream.

46
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,833
Hey, guys. Has the
ice block arrived yet?

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,916
[HYOUMA] Are you sure you
can take him down, Koma?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,916
[KOMA] I destroy evil
and bring peace.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,541
That is my purpose.
It's all I know.

50
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,833
Imperial Ads said they're
gonna use it for publicity.

51
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,583
Maybe they're shooting
a film about Antarctica.

52
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,000
Mr. Jaguar?

53
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,041
[TACHIBANA]
Why do you think I'm spending

54
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,708
so much money on you?

00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,458
Stop them from
printing this trash!

56

[SATOMI] The tall nail
does get the hammer.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,916
And you, Mr Tachibana,
are a telephone pole.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,083
Japan has seen
unparalleled advances

thanks to me and my continued
role as its Prime Minister!

No one denies that, sir.

We met you before the war,

and we've helped your
career get this far.

friend, I assure you.

She's ready to meet you.

Oh.

Wow, these drawings

All of these little circles?

This might be of interest.

including the violence
in Shinjuku.

And recently, a daring
prison escape.

00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,625
Unease is spreading
among the populace.

There are new sightings.

As told in the legends,

I must sacrifice myself, as the

Yes.

There's a chance the characters

girl from the ice!

160
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,583
[HYOUMA]
Jiro! Hoshino! Stop her!

161
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
Or this won't end well!

162
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't you have missiles
or weapons of any kind

163
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,041
on this thing?

164
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,291
Hey, hands off!

165
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,333
And no, I designed this
plane to support Equus,

166
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,833
not act as a combat jet.

167
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,208
Then stop time or something!

168
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,458
Great idea!

169
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,791
Just one problem.
Your friend took my watch!

170
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,250
[CHINATSU]
Listen to this!

171
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,083
The Iron Mask Fencer joined
forces with Dragongod Asahi

172
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,750
to defeat Zesuzusaata.

173
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,166
Zeth Satan!

174
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,416
The legendary rulers of
Azuchi-Momoyama period Japan!

175
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,750
It all makes sense.

176
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,875
[CHINATSU]
Zeth Satan?

177
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,458
The name sounds awfully Western.

178
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,000
Likely.

179
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,458
There were European missionaries
in Japan during that period.

180
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,583
I spoke to some of my kind who
knew the history better than me.

181
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,583
That area has a strong
spiritual force,

182
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,041
and centuries ago was used
to seal away an ogre-god.

183
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,500
Then Emi won't be
able to go near it.

184
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,916
Yes, yes, it all makes sense!

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,416
Everything makes sense
for the second time today!

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,416
Nobody knows who was buried
in the Takamatsuzuka Tomb,

187
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,666
or why it was built
in the first place.

188
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,583
But if this other tomb
is similar in shape

189
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,708
it must have been used
by the Iron Mask Fencer

190
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,791
to seal evil with help
from the local spirits.

191
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,000
It's imprisoning Zeth Satan?

192
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,250
[ULLR]
Very strange.

193
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,416
It seems that girl just
dug up her old nemesis

194
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,458
she worked so hard to seal away.

195
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,875
I think I know why.

196
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,708
I'll bet she's going to
resurrect a 300-year-old spirit.

197
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,791
[KIKKO]
Jiro! Listen to me!

198
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,041
What do I do?

199
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,833
[ULLR] You don't need my
permission to transform anymore.

200
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,708
Adults set their
own power channels.

201
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,833
Right.

202
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,416
Witch power channel
set! Meteortail!

203
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,208
[ULLR] Star Child has lost
touch with her essence.

204
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,666
She's no longer a
candidate for queen.

205
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,500
She will simply age
like a normal human.

206
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,750
I've been told you're
the Iron Mask Fencer.

207
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,291
I only know you
from picture books.

208
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,416
A lone warrior, battling
evil to save the people.

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,916
A hero of justice.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,041
So why are you trying to
bring back Zeth Satan?

211
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,166
Don't interrupt me!

212
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,375
Fencer Beam!

213
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,708
[JIRO]
She can fire beams?

214
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,500
Kikko! A weapon!

215
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,541
[KIKKO]
If you want my help,

216
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,833
you have to promise
me something!

217
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
[JIRO] I'm not going
back to the Bureau!

218
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,291
In that case...

219
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,375
It's obvious you don't
understand women.

220
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,083
You can't handle this!

221
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,333
[JIRO] What is this smell?
It's like strawberries.

222
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,291
What do you want
here, sorceress?

223
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,291
To help. You're alone and
looking for a familiar face.

224
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,541
But you woke up in a world
that no longer remembers you,

225
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,750
so you're seeking out
the one who does.

226
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,041
Your archenemy who was
frozen along with you!

227
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,333
Perhaps.

228
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,041
After all, I fought
countless bloody battles

229
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,166
against the Zeth Satan Clan.

230
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,875
And I was determined to kill
every last one of them!

231
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,750
Every last one? Isn't
that just a bit extreme?

232
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,208
Back then, it was
considered normal.

233
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,500
Neither side stopped fighting

234
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,083
until the other was
totally eliminated.

235
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,666
Maybe that's how things
worked back then,

236
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,416
but these are modern times,
you have other choices!

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,166
After all, you're pretty cute.

238
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,000
[ULLR] Do you want her to
work in a department store

239
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,291
or something?

240
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,666
War is the only thing I know.

241
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,541
But you're just like
that dumb bandit.

242
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,333
You don't understand
women either!

243
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,541
[KIKKO]
Wha--? Excuse me?

244
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,666
Arise! Iron Mask!

245
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,458
Whoa! The Iron Mask
Fencer is real?

246
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,375
Great detecting.
Kiko, get clear!

247
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,541
I can't run! Zeth Satan
is almost finished.

You saved me.

251

Change of plans: I need
you to take the stick!

252
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,375
Oh, now I'm allowed? I thought
I didn't know how to fly it!

253
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,250
You've piloted Arcus
before, right?

254
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,250
It's pretty much the same thing!

255
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,958
[KOMA]
Spirit. Awaken.

256
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,458
Come on, need to find something
tall. Something tall.

257
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,250
Meteortail!

258
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,791
[KIKKO screams]

259
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,041
A ninja trick!

260
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,666
[HYOUMA]
Koma Kage! Stop the ritual!

261
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,125
It'll revive Zeth Satan, but it
won't bring back your friend.

262
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,708
The one who sacrificed his
life to make the seal,

263
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,416
Dragongod Asahi!

264

[KOMA]
Fencer Beam!

265
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,583
Well, what are you
waiting for? Finish it!

266
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,708
Answer me first.

267
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,041
Why did you betray Zeth
Satan and go on the run?

268
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,916
So that I could bring
closure to our struggle.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,416
And you've bested me.

270
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,708
Then it's over. There's
no reason to fight.

271
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,750
There is a reason. People
will know you spared me.

272
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,958
If you let me go, you'll
be seen as a villain.

273
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,708
How many innocents have I hurt?

274
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
I cannot be forgiven.

275
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,458
No! You've changed!

276
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,333
If you let me live, you
cannot stand for justice.

277
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,333
I will defeat Zeth Satan!

278
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,458
Then I shall take his power,
and with it, I will kill you.

279
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,625
[KOMA]

That's right.

I'll bring Dragongod Asahi
back into this world!

[FLOWERS]
No! No! No...

290
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,250
It was a different time.

291
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Neither you nor
Asahi could admit

292
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,541
you had feelings for each other.

293
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,875
I know you.

00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,625
Jaganosuke!

295
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,708
Are you sure you can
take him dow, Koma?

296
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:28,000
[KOMA]
I destroy evil. And bring peace.

297
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,250
That is my purpose,
it's all I know.

298
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,791
[HYOUMA] Even if Asahi
lives in your heart?

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,666
They were close friends. Wow.

300
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,958
Just listen!

301
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,708
[KOMA]
I thought if I kept fighting

302
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,833
and didn't stop until I killed
every last one them,

303
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,458
it would lead to an era
of peace and happiness.

304
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,250
But... the fighting never ended.

305
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,791
All I accomplished was losing
the one person I cared about.

306
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,500
I understand what
you're feeling,

307
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,541
but this won't bring Asahi back.

308
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,125
That seal is all that's
left of him now.

309
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,333
[KOMA] Then I'll break
apart every last piece!

310
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,041
For Dragongod Asahi.

311
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,750
So no one makes my mistake,

312
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,375
I'll make sure evil
never gets revived!

313
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Why did you--?

314
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,875
It's in rough shape,

315
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,083
but I think the seal can
hold its power for a while.

316
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,583
We'll put it back more
securely this time.

317
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,916
I know a couple of specialists.

318
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,666
Get out of the way and
let me destroy it!

319
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,833
[JIRO] Asahi rests here!
Isn't that what you said?

320
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:40,166
A superhuman of evil that has
since woke up to justice.

321
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,875
I think that's cool.

322
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,083
This guy's determined to
protect all superhumans,

323
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,083
living or dead.

324
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,416
That's not what I heard.

325
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,958
I was told he's the leader
of the forces of evil.

326
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,750
Who said that?

327
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,041
[TACHIBANA]
Huh.

328
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,041
After today, these rumors
will vanish forever!

329
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,958
No! No! My lady!
You're mistaken!

330
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,833
But Hitoyoshi is leading
a band of evil superhumans.

331
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,500
But only because you've
labeled all superhumans evil

332
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,250
so you can torture them.

333
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,416
Prime Minister Tachibana!
It's you I'm after!

334
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Defend yourself!

335
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,125
Please, my lady, I beg you!
Look at my family tree!

336
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,958
Stop this nonsense!

337
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,708
[KOMA]
Shinnoshin!

338
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,750
[TACHIBANA]
Lord Shinnoshin Kage.

339
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,083
Your brother. My ancestor!
We share the same blood!

340
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,583
So your plan was revive
the Iron Mask Fencer,

341
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,916
make her do some "hero" stuff,
then reveal you're related.

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,458
A publicity stunt that would
blow away those pesky scandals.

343
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,916
I'm almost impressed.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,750
[TACHIBANA] I can prove it.
I have superhuman powers.

345
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,250
They're limited,

346
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,916
but I have the ability to
control the minds of animals.

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
I'll show you!

348
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,500
Is that how you
influence politicians?

349
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,083
Yes. It's not that hard.

350
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,125
Their brains are on
a par with reptiles.

351
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,916
I refuse to believe
we're related.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,500
My family wouldn't torment
superhumans for greed.

353
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,416
[TACHIBANA]
Superhumans are tools for war.

354
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,541
Their abilities have to
be managed carefully.

355
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,208
War? Is that all you seek?

356
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,041
Not me, I'm trying
to put a stop to them!

357
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,625
I destroyed all my enemies,
but the world is still fighting.

358
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,000
These new models
are quite small,

359
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,750
but the quality is remarkable.

360
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,208
Satomi?

361
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,541
We can integrate my
pocketwatch into Earth- <i>chan</i>

362
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,875
and give her time
travel capabilities.

363
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,958
She'll be able to carry you back
to your original timeline.

364
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,250
I'd do it, but I can
only transport myself.

365
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,250
Earth- <i>chan</i> 's already
agreed to help you.

366
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,416
Since you know right from wrong.

367
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,416
It must be difficult, figuring
out good from evil in this era.

368
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,625
The Prime Minister
might be corrupt,

369
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,916
but killing him won't
change anything.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,958
You'll get lost, like Fuurouta.

371
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,375
[KIKKO]
Huh?

372
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,000
Koma. You belong in a time
where there's clear sides.

373
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,416
I don't think so.

374
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,541
Why not?

375
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,458
Iron Mask Fencer,
defender of justice,

376
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,458
cutting down evil in swaths.
You should be in a--

377
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,625
A different era?

378
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,625
What's so great about mine?

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,916
I killed every single
agent of evil,

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
but the present doesn't seem
any better than the past.

381
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,166
[KIKKO]
Then where will you go?

382
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,166
I remember now.

383
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,208
Before I was frozen,
I wanted to explore the world.

384
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,125
I don't need a destination.

385
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,416
I was on a journey.
And that journey's not over!

386
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,625
[REPORTER A] A secret audio
recording has surfaced

387
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,375
of Prime Minister Tachibana

388
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
confessing that he is
in fact a superhuman

389
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,416
able to control the
minds of the weak.

390
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,625
A shock to not only politicians,
but the entire nation.

391
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,166
Late last night,
copies of the tape

392
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,791
were delivered to all
major news outlets

393
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,208
by a man calling
himself Renderer Brace.

394
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,750
The tape contains a conversation

395
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,125
between Prime Minister Tachibana
and an unknown person.

396
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,291
In it, the Prime Minister
refers to himself

397
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,125
as the descendant
of a superhuman.

398
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,875
It's often said that
the Prime Minister's

399
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,791
long-lasting time in office,
beginning right after the war,

400
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,708
was brought about by his
extraordinary ability

401
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,625
to understand the
minds of others.

402
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,666
If, however, this ability
is a superhuman power,

403
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,916
the implications are disturbing.

404
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,041

Jungle Operation Enforcers.
