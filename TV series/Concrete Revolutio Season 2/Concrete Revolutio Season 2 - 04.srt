00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,333
[REPORTER A] One of our
nation's projected gold medals

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,250
is the 200-meter ski jump.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,791
Following the grand
opening on January 6th,

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,166
the competition will be held

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,166
here at the
Hikarinomori Schanze.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,208
And representing
Japan in the jump

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,208
will be none other than
the "Three Birdmen."

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,750
[SHIN chuckles]

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,541
[SHIN]
Great jump! As always.

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,583
Thanks a lot, Zenda.
Or rather "Birdman Shin."

11
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,250
Oh, come on. You don't
have to call me that.

12
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,625
[AMATO]
Actually, I do.

13
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,041
You guys are representing Japan,

14
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,125
and that demands
all of our respect.

15
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,708
That's right, it does.

16
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,333
So why don't you practice what
you preach and call us "sir"?

17
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,500
[AMATO]
I guess I should.

18
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,208
You "guess"?
So much for respect.

19
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,916
I'll work on it. Sorry, sir.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,541
Knock it off, Gamba.

21
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,750
You can't talk to him like that

22
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,166
just because we got the
superhuman surgery.

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,416
[GAMBA]
Sure I can.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,041
After all, if he'd gone
through with it, too,

25
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,000
maybe he'd be more than
just a test jumper

26
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,500
checkin' the hill
for the real pros.

27
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,833
Why didn't you accept
the procedure?

28
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,000
If you'd done it like we did,

29
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,125
taking home the gold
would be a snap.

30
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,875
What does that mean?

31
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:29,916
Don't tell me.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,333
You "sirs" still aren't
good enough

33
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,500
after everything
you've been through?

34
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,625
Oh, that's it!

35
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,041
Stop it!

36
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,625
You wouldn't want the paparazzi
getting a shot of this.

37
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,916
I bet you'd like it, huh?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,791
[SHIN]
That's enough!

39
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,666
[laughing]

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,791
[COBRA]
What's that?

41
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,083
[SHIN, COBRA scream]

42
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,250
Finally. That flight
made me queasy.

43
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,666
I didn't realize ghosts
could get airsick.

44
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,500
Well, the high altitude does
distance him from nature.

45
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,541
It has that much of
an effect on him?

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,875
It might!

47
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,458
You still can't tell when
she's makin' stuff up?

48
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,750
[KONPARU]
Please, call me Konparu.

49
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,125
I'm sorry if this
ruined your holiday.

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,208
You feel the excitement
in the air?

51
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,583
That's because of the Sapporo
International Sports Grand Prix.

52
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,583
It represents peace, and
reminds people they're safe.

53
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,916
Nothing may cause
its cancellation.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,583
[HYOUMA] People seem really
excited about the ski jump.

55
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,500
It's not surprising when
you think about it.

56
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,166
The Birdmen are popular.

57
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,791
[HYOUMA] Coming out of
the "post-war" phase,

58
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,583
port Grand
the Tokyo Inter
Prix in '39 was the "hop."

59
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,666
The Osaka Expo in
'45 was the "skip."

60
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,291
And finally this year's "jump"

61
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,291
will mark the completion
of Japan's reconstruction.

62
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
[KONPARU]
That's right.

63
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,583
So of course, upper management
have it in their heads

64
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,666
that we need to sweep all
three medals in the event.

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,708
Which is where we come in

66
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,958
to help you with
your little problem.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,250
[HYOUMA]
So they got hit by lightning

68
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,458
and then flowers grew
out of their heads?

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,250
[GAMBA]
It was him. He did this to us.

70
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,458
[HYOUMA]
Him who?

71
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,000
[GAMBA] Slope's test
jumper, Koichi Amato.

72
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,791
He was there when it happened.

73
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,000
You know Mr. Amato's
not behind this.

74
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,333
He isn't a superhuman.

75
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,875
Are you sure?

76
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,333
How do we know he didn't get
a weird power all of a sudden?

77
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,666
It's not like it'd be the first
time that's happened.

78
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Right, Superhuman Bureau?

79
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,833
Would it kill you to be
polite for a minute?

80
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,916
These people came all the
way out here to help us.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,875
Then why haven't they
done anything yet?

82
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,208
We can't compete
in this condition!

83
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,750
It's that serious?

84
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,583
Not in the sense
that it's detrimental

85
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,125
to their health or
anything, but uh...

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,458
[COBRA]
Stupid thing won't bend.

87
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,500
We can't put our
helmets on over 'em.

88
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,916
Well, uh, you boys
could wear this helmet

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,041
with a hole we worked out.

90
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:39,958
[SHIN chuckles]

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,125
Idiot.

92
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,666
We'd be the laughing
stock of Inter-Sport

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,333
if we went out
looking like this.

94
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,750
It is not gonna happen.

95
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,000
[KONPARU] Unfortunately,
we're running out of time.

96
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,333
The opening ceremony is
the day after tomorrow.

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,833
To make matters worse,

98
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,333
the Three Birdmen are
supposed to perform

99
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,291
an exhibition jump
on the new hill.

100
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,916
There's no postponing it.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,458
So you see, we must have this
issue resolved by tomorrow.

102
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,833
[EMI]
While you have my sympathy,

103
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,875
our job is to protect
superhumans,

104
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,041
not solve paranormal problems.

105
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,875
Despite that, we can't let
the Sapporo Inter-Sport fail.

106
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,166
Our nation is counting on us,

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,416
so that means we're
gonna have to work

108
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
outside our comfort zones.

109
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,333
What's up?

110
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,291
[EMI]
Well...

111
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,541
[GAMBA]
Aw, man!

112
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,750
Those look just like the
clouds that zapped us!

113
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,791
[KIKKO] I'll go check
it out! Meteortail!

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,500
Everyone! Clear this area!

115
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,458
Look up there!
A real witch girl!

116
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,083
Meteortail!

117
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on! Why are they so fast?

118
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,458
Typical Kikko discretion.

119
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,916
Between that and
her uselessness,

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,750
at least she's consistent.

121
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,083
[KIKKO screams]

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,625
[ULLR]
Stay with me, Star Child!

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,666
[KIKKO yelps]

124
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,041
Nice catch.

125
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,166
Oh, wow, Miss Kikko!
You're heavier than I thought!

126
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,375
Oh! Wait!

127
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,000
[ULLR] You're all right.
No flower sprouted.

128
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,375
Fuurouta!

129
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,333
Yeesh. Spinny. Dizzy. Hehh.

130
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,166
Looks like you two are okay.

131
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,833
But the attack didn't
even phase them.

132
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,625
Kikko, conjure me a
lightning rod, now!

133
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,125
[KIKKO]
Huh?

134
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:34,958
Hurry!

135
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,375
[KIKKO]
Right! Meteortail!

136
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,708
[HYOUMA]
That's a first.

137
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,208
It's not like you
to put yourself

138
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,500
in harm's way like that.

139
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,708
No choice.

140
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, so we managed
to handle one problem,

141
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,375
but we still don't
know the cause,

142
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,750
and Sapporo's turning
into a flower garden!

143
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,250
We'll get there.

144
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,000
[AMATO]
Huh? What the--?

145
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,916
[GAMBA]
What did you do?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Is that you, Iwashita?

147
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,666
[GAMBA]
No, not Iwashita. Gamba.

148
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,416
Now tell me how you
did this flower thing.

149
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,166
I didn't do anything!

150
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,708
[GAMBA] Like I'm gonna
believe you didn't go

151
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,875
outta your way to shut us down.

152
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,416
After all, if we can't compete,

153
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,458
they'll have no choice
but to let you jump!

154
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,166
I told you. I didn't!

155
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,500
Don't lie to me!

156
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,541
I heard you mumblin'
something under your breath!

157
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,875
What, 'd'you think
I was unconscious?

158
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,750
You know what's
causin' all this.

159
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,666
Tell me. Or pay the price!

160
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,416
[GAMBA]
Whatcha think?

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,125
That was just a
small demonstration

162
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,250
of what I'm capable of as a
Bio-Enhanced Super-Athlete.

163
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,500
[AMATO]
Stop it, Iwashita!

164
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,708
[GAMBA]
I told you, my name is Gamba!

165
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,958
I threw away that identity
when I was modified.

166
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,625
And because of those
modifications,

167
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,250
you think you're better than me.

168
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,958
No, that isn't true at all!

169
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,708
Oh, I'm pretty sure it is.

170
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,750
There's no reason you'd
attend as a normal person.

171
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,833
You want everyone to think
you're just a test jumper,

172
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,458
but you're listed
as a competitor!

173
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,375
The office made that
choice without asking me!

174
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
How convenient!

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,375
Stay away!

176
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,375
It's ridiculous.

177
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,208
To think that a flower could
ruin so many years of sacrifice.

178
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,625
But that's what you
wanted, right?

179
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,375
[AMATO]
You're wrong!

180
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,458
I don't know why
this is happening.

181
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,000
[GAMBA] How long can you
keep up this charade?

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,708
And what are you willing
to give up for it?

183
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,041
Because the only thing I have
left is this childish name.

184
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,208
But now that I won't
be able to compete,

185
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll gladly take it.

186
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,083
If I don't, nothing I went
through will have any meaning!

187
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,458
Listen! I admire
what you've done!

188
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,208
See, that's how I
know you're lying.

189
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,916
'Cause if you did,
you'd call me "sir."

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,333
[JIRO]
Put him down!

191
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,416
[JIRO]
Hold it!

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,041
[AMATO] Let him go! There's
no point in chasing him.

193
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,208
[JIRO]
But he--

194
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,625
It's fine. Unless
you're with the police.

195
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm not. But I am here
for you, Koichi Amato.

196
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,208
How'd you get your own place?

197
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,458
This is where I grew up.

198
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,625
So what's going on
really isn't your doing, is it?

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,708
But everyone thinks it is.

200
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,291
So the Superhuman Bureau
will be coming after you.

201
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,166
Their entire purpose is to
register unknown superhumans

202
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,375
and make them work for
the nation's government.

203
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,458
That's wrong. So I'm
here to protect you.

204
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,625
[AMATO] The only athletes that
are supposed to participate

205
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,250
in the Inter-Sport are those
with biological enhancements.

206
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,291
Mechanical enhancements
aren't allowed,

207
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:07,458
so the competition is still
determined by a person's talent.

208
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,083
That's why they wanted
me to become enhanced.

209
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,666
But I declined the procedure,

210
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,708
and became a disgrace
to our country.

211
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,166
So they removed me
from the roster

212
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,208
to make an example of me.

213
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,666
Oh, man.

214
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,083
I was just too afraid.

215
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,416
I kept thinking,

216
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,666
"What if I do this, but I
don't win any medals?"

217
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,250
It would've been a waste.

218
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,958
I couldn't bring myself
to sign the papers.

219
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,833
[AMATO] And if I couldn't
do that, there was no way

220
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,958
I could compete with our
people counting on me.

221
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,833
So you don't have to worry about
this Bureau coming after me,

222
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,500
'cause I can't do anything
"for the nation" now.

223
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,916
Looks like I made a
terrible mistake. I'm sorry.

224
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,041
What? You're giving up?

225
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,750
With that weird power of yours,

226
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,166
you could help get to
the bottom of this.

227
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,000
[JIRO] I'd like to, but you
were the only lead I had.

228
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,291
[AMATO]
Well, your lead's not cold yet.

229
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,166
[AMATO chuckles]

230
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,541
[AMATO] Man, look at
that big ol' dumb grin.

231
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,458
I feel embarrassed
just looking at it.

232
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,333
[JIRO]
Aw, it's not bad.

233
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,375
[AMATO] This was taken back
when I was in middle school.

234
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,708
There used to be a shrine around

235
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,333
where the Hikarinomori
Schanze is now,

236
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,291
but it doesn't exist anymore.

237
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,666
Every New Year,
there was a tradition

238
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,791
to hang a target in the forest.

239
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,500
Hitting it was said
to please the gods,

240
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,583
who would then deliver
a good harvest.

241
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,416
This had happened since
before anyone could remember.

242
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,750
A 15-year-old boy was always
chosen to take the shot.

243
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,750
And that year, they chose me.

244
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,750
[SPIRITS laughing]

245
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,541
[AMATO]
You see, the Hikarinomori Forest

246
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,333
used to be the home of
a god called Pirikappi.

247
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,166
Pirikappi.

248
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,125
[ULLR gasps]

249
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,041
[ULLR] I'm starting to get cold.
How much farther?

250
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,708
You'd have to ask Miss Emi.

251
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,708
[FUUROUTA]
Yeah, but it feels so good!

252
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,125
Man, I love places like this!

253
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,875
Are you sure the cause of
this human flower phenomenon

254
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,333
is really out here?

255
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,666
[EMI]
Absolutely.

256
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,541
And honestly, I feel like
we're partly to blame

257
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,083
for how out of hand it's gotten.

258
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,958
The only ones who sprout the
flower are normal humans.

259
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,333
If we'd realized that earlier,

260
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,000
we could've saved a lot
of people back in the city.

261
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,333
[HYOUMA]
But the Three Birdmen got 'em,

262
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,541
and they're superhuman.

263
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,208
[EMI]
Yes, artificially.

264
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,166
Despite that, though, they're
still fundamentally normal.

265
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,625
How do you know that?

266
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,708
You'll have to wait and see.

267
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,708
We're here.

268
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,125
[HYOUMA]
This is it?

269
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,666
[EMI] Yes. It's the symbol
of the god of this forest.

270
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,541
Jiro, hey!

271
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,416
Great, it's you.

272
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,208
[KONPARU]
Mr. Amato.

273
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,333
The test jump for
today is cancelled.

274
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,416
[AMATO]
That doesn't make sense,

275
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,125
the opening ceremony
is tomorrow.

276
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,791
Well, given the Three
Birdmen's current condition--

277
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,125
Regardless of that,

278
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,375
I have a responsibility
to check the hill.

279
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,583
It's my job as the test jumper.

280
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,791
[KONPARU] I'm afraid I can't
allow you to approach the slope.

281
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,291
Mr. Gamba's orders.

282
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,708
I'm sorry? He has that
kind of authority?

283
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,083
A top competitor speaks,
the brass listens.

284
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,375
Sadly, this is
out of my control.

285
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,708
[AMATO]
Konparu.

286
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,833
Please try to
understand, Mr. Amato.

287
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,458
[HYOUMA]
Spill, Jiro. Why are you here?

288
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,041
So! Are you responsible
for all this?

289
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,041
[JIRO] No. But trust me,
you're outclassed on this one.

290
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,833
Mr. Jaguar! What's Emi doing?

291
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,083
Oh, no.

292
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,458
Uh, guys, this situation just
got a whole lot more dangerous!

293
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,583
What?

294
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,250
[FUUROUTA]
'Cause that's a god.

295
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,750
[JIRO]
She's been possessed.

296
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,375
That's the god of the forest.

297
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,708
[HYOUMA]
What are you saying?

298
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,833
[JIRO] The Hikarinomori
Ski Jump was built on top

299
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,708
of this god's home.

300
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,375
Its name, Pirikappi,

301
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,250
was given to it by the people
who used to live here.

302
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,583
In their language,
it meant "Beautiful Seed."

303
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,666
They chose it because
Pirikappi would spread seeds

304
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,500
that grew into
flowers and trees.

305
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,666
Which would explain the
human flower phenomenon

306
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,583
we've been dealing with!

307
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,791
[FUUROUTA]
Look out!

308
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,208
[SHIN]
You attacked Mr. Amato?

309
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,125
As payback for
causing this mess.

310
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,916
[SHIN] No one who loves
skiing as much as he does

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,458
would ever do such a thing.

312
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,666
But he's been reduced to a test
jumper! The motivation's--!

313
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,458
[COBRA]
Will you two shut up?

314
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,458
Yelling at each other
won't help us find a way

315
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,166
to get rid of these
stupid things.

316
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,166
[giggles]

317
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,375
[COBRA]
Seriously.

318
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,750
You're right.

319
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,041
[HYOUMA]
Emi!

320
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,041
After her, Kikko!

321
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:10,875
'Kay!

322
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,375
Meteortail!

323
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,166
Wait for me!

324
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,625
What's this?

325
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,125
[KONPARU]
You can't be here!

326
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,416
These grounds are off limits!

327
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,041
Men! Secure the area!

328
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,791
[GUARD A] We're trying,
but they won't stop!

329
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,416
[KONPARU]
They're here, too?

330
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,375
What is going on?

331
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,250
[AMATO]
This is bizarre.

332
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,416
[HYOUMA] The god is using Emi's
power to bolster its own.

333
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,875
We have to find some
way to bring them down.

334
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,250
[FUUROUTA]
Impossible.

335
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,291
You're talking about
fighting a force of nature.

336
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,458
Even working together,
we'd never stand a chance.

337
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,625
But still.

338
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,250
Now, let the ceremony begin!

339
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,708
This can't be!

340
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,125
[FUUROUTA] No way!
They all turned into trees!

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,958
Turn those people
back to normal!

342
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,375
[giggles]

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,625
[HYOUMA]
What're you doing?

344
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,125
What I have to!

345
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,500
I never thought
you'd attack Emi!

346
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,791
If it's the only way to save
her, of course I would!

347
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,333
I guess he still
cares about her.

348
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,250
port!
Our priority is making sure
nothing cancels the Inter

349
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,750
Our nation's pride
depends on it!

350
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,750
[JIRO] So you'd rather get
rid of a problem than fix it?

351
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,125
"Business as usual."

352
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,083
You only care about what
superhumans can do for you!

353
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,625
[HYOUMA] Stop acting like
a child and grow up!

354
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,000
You don't even try
to understand!

355
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,333
[AMATO]
That is enough!

356
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,291
None of the things you're
bickering about matter.

357
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,208
Not even in the slightest.

358
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,916
All that's important now
are the competitors.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,833
They've given
everything they had

360
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,333
just so they could
participate in this event.

361
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,291
Meanwhile, you've lived your
whole lives with powers.

362
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,041
But you would rather use
them to fight each other

363
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,083
than do anything to help!

364
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,125
I'm begging you to
please restore the hill.

365
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,583
I don't want the athletes' hard
work to have been in vain.

366
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,291
[HYOUMA]
Wha--?

367
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,333
[gasps]

368
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,875
[AMATO] The opening
ceremony is tomorrow.

369
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,291
Every New Year,
there was a tradition

370
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,000
to hang a target in the forest.

371
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,875
Yes, I see.

372
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:11,458
Hold on.

373
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,291
[AMATO]
Just go.

374
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,916
Mr. Amato.

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,625
[AMATO] I know what it wants:
The tradition must be fulfilled.

376
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,541
Wait, you don't mean
you're gonna try and jump

377
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,416
with the hill like this.

378
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,083
I am.

379
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,541
[HYOUMA]
You can't!

380
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,375
I will. And you can't stop me.

381
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,416
[JIRO]
Mr. Amato.

382
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,333
[AMATO]
I understand.

383
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,541
We humans have become
so self-absorbed,

384
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,791
the gods must have
gotten lonely.

385
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,916
[FUUROUTA]
He's not seriously gonna try

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,666
and jump into that gap, is he?

387
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,916
[KIKKO]
That's impossible.

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,583
As a normal human, he'll
never make it that far!

389
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,500
[AMATO]
Draw. Draw.

390
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,208
[AMATO]
Loose!

391
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,916
[HYOUMA]
Kikko! Move those trees!

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,583
If we do nothing, he's gonna
crash right into them!

393
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,833
--Right!
--[JIRO] No!

394
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,416
[HYOUMA]
No good. He's falling short.

395
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,666
[JIRO]
Don't! He has to finish this!

396
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,000
Look!

397
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,083
Bullseye!

398
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:44,125
How'd ya like that, Pirikappi?
Just like when I was a kid!

399
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:49,166
[SPIRITS laughing]

400
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,500
[KIKKO] This must be
Pirikappi's blessing.

401
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,375
[HYOUMA] Mr. Konparu,
you feeling all right?

402
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes. How's everyone else?

403
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,791
[HYOUMA]
Emi. You okay?

404
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,541
Yes. Where's Jiro?

405
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,375
He disappeared again.

406
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,041
[GAMBA]
So, Amato...

407
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,291
I'm sorry!

408
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,541
What I did to you was
terrible and wrong.

409
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,208
They told us what you did.

410
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,958
How you risked your life
to save everybody.

411
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,208
Thank you so much!

412
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,208
You really are the best!

413
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,208
It's fine. Don't thank me.

414
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,666
Sir, I was just--

415
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,416
[GAMBA] Aw, man! You don't
hafta call us that anymore!

416
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,750
I wasn't brave enough
to do what was necessary

417
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,000
to represent the nation.

418
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,375
Unlike you.

419
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,333
The only way I could be
useful was as a test jumper.

420
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,500
So that's what I am.

421
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,083
Go get those medals.

422
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,166
It doesn't matter if you're
superhuman or not.

423
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,916
You guys are heroes.

424
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,666
[EMI]
Thanks again, everyone.

425
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,166
I'm sorry I caused
so much trouble.

426
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,375
[HYOUMA] We all know
it wasn't really you.

427
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,208
[EMI] Monsters like me
are very similar

428
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,416
to the forgotten elder gods.

429
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,208
We were a little too in
tune with each other.

430
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,833
We got the medals, though,
so it turned out great!

431
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,875
Maybe. Although...

432
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,291
[KIKKO]
Huh?

433
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,208
What if they hold an Inter
Sport event here in Tokyo?

434
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,875
I don't know what we would do.

435
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,750
The elder god beneath this city
is a troublesome one indeed.

436
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,250
[DEVILO]
Rarirero rareriro rororon pa.

437
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,625
I'm Devilo, my sister's Devila!

438
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,291
Deroron deroron dededeno de.

439
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,916
Gods may be ugly,
but devils are pretty!

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,958
That's a fact that
none shallala know.

441
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,041
Tears come up and falololow!
