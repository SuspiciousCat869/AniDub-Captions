WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.403
Jaden:
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX..."

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.072
Aster: SOMEONE'S COMING.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.107
Echo: ADRIAN.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.942
Zane: I DON'T TRUST THIS GUY.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.377
HUH? OH!

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.080
LOOK. IT'S THAT
CREEPY ARM.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.882
YOU'VE TEAMED UP
WITH YUBEL

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:16.316
LIKE VIPER
AND MARCEL.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:19.152
COME WITH ME,
ECHO.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.955
I DON'T WANT
TO GO WITH YOU.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.391
THAT WASN'T
A REQUEST.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.961
LET HER GO, ADRIAN.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.631
GAME ON.
GAME ON.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.399
I ACTIVATE THE RITUAL

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.369
OF THE ULTIMATE
FORBIDDEN LORD SPELL CARD.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.875
THERE IT IS...
EXODIA.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.811
Adrian: IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE MY DESTINY
AND RULE THIS WORLD,

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.347
I MUST CONTROL
EXODIA'S POWER,

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.083
BUT IN ORDER TO RELEASE
EXODIA FROM ITS CHAINS,

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.555
I MUST OFFER UP THE DUEL ENERGY
OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.223
ADRIAN...

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.625
ECHO, I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.961
AND YOU WON'T.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.730
ECHO, NO!
DON'T DO IT.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.600

WITH ECHO'S HELP, I WILL SOON
CONTROL THE POWER OF EXODIA.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.674
Aster: NO! ECHO, STOP.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.043
YOU CAN'T LET HIM USE
YOUR DUEL ENERGY.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.078
PLEASE, MISS ECHO,
LISTEN TO HIM.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:26.680
WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.415
MAY HAVE
DANGEROUS
REPERCUSSIONS.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.549
DO NOT DO THIS.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.485
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
STOPPING FOR ANYBODY.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:32.886
HER MIND IS MADE UP.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:34.655
AND IT'S
NOT CHANGING.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.591
HOW COULD YOU ASK THIS
OF YOUR FRIEND, ADRIAN?

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.093
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO HER?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:44.231
WITHOUT HER DUEL ENERGY,
SHE'LL BE SENT
TO THE STARS.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.435
RGH! DON'T YOU GET IT?
YOU MAY NEVER SEE
HER AGAIN!

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.038
AND THE ONLY THINGS THAT
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LEFT

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:53.306
ARE HER MEMORY
AND EXODIA.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:57.911
IS IT REALLY WORTH
ALL THAT? IS IT?

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.882
[THINKING] I KNOW THAT
BY DOING THIS, ADRIAN,

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:05.752
YOU WILL FINALLY HAVE THE POWER
YOU SO RIGHTLY DESERVE.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.357
UH!

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:10.924
AAH!

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:12.559
OH!
AAH!

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.131
AAH!

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.800
UH!

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:20.934
AAH!
AAH!

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.869
AAAH!

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.238
ADRIAN, STOP IT.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:26.907
AAH! AAH!

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.109
THE RITUAL
OF THE ULTIMATE
FORBIDDEN LORD

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.544
HAS ALREADY
BEEN ACTIVATED.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:32.179
THERE IS NO
STOPPING IT NOW.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:34.281
MY DESTINY IS
TO RULE THIS WORLD,

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.384
AND THIS DUEL WILL DELIVER ME
THE POWER I NEED.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.953
THEN FORGET IT, 'CAUSE
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.755
THIS DUEL'S OVER,
GOT IT?

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.423
I'M AFRAID NOT.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.192
YOU'RE NOT BACK
AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.626
YOU CAN'T STOP A DUEL.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.361
WE MUST CONTINUE
THIS BATTLE

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.664
UNTIL ONE OF US BECOMES
ONE WITH THE STARS.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.100
AS PART OF
MY RITUAL'S EFFECT,

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.269
I CAN SEND
ALL FORBIDDEN ONE CARDS
IN MY GRAVE TO MY DECK.

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.840
BUT MY FORCE OF FOUR
SPELL PUT A STOP
TO EXODIA.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.575
FOR THE TIME BEING.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.312
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
TWO FORBIDDEN ONE CARDS
IN MY HAND

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.182
TO SUMMON EXODIOS,
THE ULTIMATE FORBIDDEN LORD.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.085
EXODIOS?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.187
[ROARS]

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:15.856
PRECISELY.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.158
THINK OF HIM AS EXODIA'S
DISTANT COUSIN.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.762
OH, MAN, NOW I
GOTTA FACE A FAMILY
OF FORBIDDEN ONES.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.430
HMM...

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.899
MY EXODIOS CANNOT
BE DESTROYED,

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.435
AND HE'S ALSO IMMUNE
TO SPELLS, TRAPS,

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.270
AND MONSTER
SPECIAL ABILITIES.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.605
YOU'RE JOKING.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.673
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR THE PUNCHLINE.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.575
HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE EQUAL TO THE NUMBER

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.612
OF CARDS IN MY GRAVE
THAT HAVE "FORBIDDEN ONE"
IN THEIR NAME,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.249
AND THAT NUMBER IS THEN
MULTIPLIED BY 1,000.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.484
WITH TWO FORBIDDEN ARMS
IN MY GRAVE,

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:48.455
EXODIOS GETS
2,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.257
AAH! AAH!

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.826
HER DUEL ENERGY.
EXODIA'S
DRAINING IT.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.963
HMM. NOW, EXODIOS,
TIME TO POWER YOU UP.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:59.766
SEE, WHENEVER EXODIOS
IS ABOUT TO ATTACK,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.035
IF I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A CARD IN MY HAND

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.104
WITH THE NAME
"FORBIDDEN ONE" IN IT,

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.639
I CAN THEN
REMOVE THAT CARD

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.841
AND SEND IT DIRECTLY
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.010
AND WITH THAT, MY EXODIOS

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.046
GAINS ANOTHER
1,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.182
UH! UH! AAH!

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:16.950
ECHO!

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.586
NOW PREPARE TO FEEL
THE WRATH OF EXODIOS,

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:21.555
THE FORBIDDEN LORD.

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.456
GO, LIGHTNING
FIRE FLASH.

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:25.725
[ROARS]

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:29.796
UH!

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:32.132
OH, DEAR ME.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:36.169
UH... UH... RGH.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.172
SHAKE IT OFF AND FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.908
COME ON.
AAH!

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:44.811
Aster: WELL, YOU
DON'T DISAPPOINT.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.148
EXODIOS SURE IS
A POWERFUL MONSTER,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.016
BUT, YOU SEE,
YOU CAN'T HAVE

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.552
THE MONSTER YOU
REALLY WANT, CAN YOU,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.789
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
I PLAYED ONE LITTLE
SPELL CARD,

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.725
AND AS A RESULT,
YOU CAN'T SUMMON EXODIA,

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.760
THANKS TO
FORCE OF FOUR'S EFFECT.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.729
REMEMBER
WHAT IT DOES?
OF COURSE.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:04.531
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO SUMMON EXODIA,

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.267
I NEED ALL 5
FORBIDDEN CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.603
AND YOUR SPELL
ONLY ALLOWS ME 4.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.673
THAT'S RIGHT. SO SORRY.
UNLESS YOUR EXODIOS...

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:17.210
HAS YET ANOTHER
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:21.014
WHEN 5 CARDS WITH
"FORBIDDEN ONE" IN THEIR NAME
ARE IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.517
I CAN BREAK EXODIA'S SEAL,
AND THEN IT'S GAME OVER.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.186
GAME OVER?

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.055
AND WITH THE SEAL BROKEN,
EXODIA WILL BE FREE

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.658
TO ABSORB THE LAST
OF ECHO'S DUEL ENERGY.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.326
FACE IT.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.497
YOU CAN'T SAVE YOURSELF,
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T SAVE HER.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.335
ONCE EXODIA'S SEAL
IS BROKEN,

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.638
ECHO'S DUEL ENERGY
WILL ENABLE HIM TO RULE
BY MY SIDE.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.874
PITY YOU WON'T BE
AROUND TO SEE IT

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.710
'CAUSE ONLY THEN
WOULD YOU KNOW WHY
THIS HAD TO BE DONE.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.080
YOU GOT IT WRONG
'CAUSE, YA SEE,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.716
I'M STOPPIN' YOU
AND EXODIA.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:00.486
FIRST,
I PLAY A FACEDOWN

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.055
AND THEN
ACTIVATE DUNKER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:04.757
BY SENDING
A DESTINY HERO

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.192
IN MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.595
YOU AUTOMATICALLY TAKE
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.898
HA HA HA!

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.399
ASTER, YOU CAN TRY
ALL YOU WANT,

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:15.067
BUT DON'T YOU SEE
THAT IN THE END,

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.235
YOUR DESTINY IS HOPELESS.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.638
WELL, MY DIAMOND DUDE
WILL FIX THAT RIGHT UP

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.040
'CAUSE I PLAY
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.943
BY REMOVING
A DESTINY HERO
IN MY GRAVE FROM PLAY,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.812
I CAN THEN SUMMON
A LEVEL-4-OR-BELOW
DESTINY HERO

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.481
FROM THE SAME PLACE,

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.516
AND GUESS WHO'S
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.919
DESTINY HERO
DISK COMMANDER.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.757
AND IF DISK COMMANDER IS
SUMMONED FROM THE GRAVE,

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.293
LUCKY ME 'CAUSE
I GET TO DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.862
THEN I'M GONNA
SACRIFICE MY DUNKER,

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:44.864
DIAMOND DUDE,
AND DISK COMMANDER

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.101
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
DESTINY HERO DOGMA.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.538
[ROARS]

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.373
WITH THAT MANY
ATTACK POINTS,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.243
ASTER'S MONSTER IS STRONGER
THAN ADRIAN'S EXODIOS.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.046
Aster:
AND BECAUSE DOGMA WAS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.647
YOU LOSE
HALF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.550
ONCE THE NEXT STANDBY
PHASE TAKES PLACE...

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.019
HMPH.
BUT WHY WAIT
TILL THEN?

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.021
LET'S SLICE
SOME POINTS OFF NOW.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.491
GO, DOGMA
DAGGER DASH.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.328
[ROARS]

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.501
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT EXODIOS
CAN'T BE DESTROYED IN BATTLE?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.170
HE MIGHT BE SAFE,

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:25.771
BUT YOUR
LIFE POINTS AREN'T.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.808
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
IT'S MY MOVE.
NOT SO FAST.

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:30.743
YOU LOSE HALF
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.879
THANKS TO DOGMA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,
REMEMBER?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.318
[THINKING]
KEEP SMILING, ADRIAN,

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:40.720
BECAUSE WITH
ONE MORE ATTACK,

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.389
YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT SUMMONING
YOUR PRECIOUS EXODIA

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.558
BECAUSE THIS DUEL
WILL BE ALL OVER

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.160
AND ECHO
WILL BE SAFE.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.196
BRING IT ON.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:53.466
EXODIOS, IT'S TIME
TO SHOW HIM YOUR POWER.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.301
[THINKING]
HE'S ATTACKING ME?

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.902
BUT MY MONSTER'S
STRONGER.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.505
I TAKE IT YOU FORGOT
ABOUT HIS SPECIAL ABILITIES.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.173
EACH TIME HE ATTACKS,

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:04.410
I CAN SEND A FORBIDDEN ONE
CARD TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:07.546
AAH!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.215
ECHO, NO!

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:10.983
AAH AAH!

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.520
AND WITH THAT,
4 EXODIA CARDS ARE NOW
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:17.290
BUT YOU NEED 5.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.825
THAT'S JUST TO SUMMON
THE FORBIDDEN ONE, ASTER.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.461
THEY ALSO MAKE
EXODIOS STRONGER.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.630
[ROARS]

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.899
4,000?
THIS IS BAD.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.202
NOW, EXODIOS,
TAKE OUT DESTINY DOGMA.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.406
[ROARS]

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.843
UH! NO!

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.146
ASTER!

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:47.887
EXODIA.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.056
OH... OH...

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.726
[THINKING] IT'S COMING.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.956
[THINKING] IF ADRIAN
GETS ONE MORE FORBIDDEN
CARD IN HIS GRAVE,

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:08.658
EXODIA'S SEAL
WILL BE BROKEN,

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:11.727
AND ECHO'S DUEL ENERGY
WILL BE DRAINED
COMPLETELY.

00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:14.597
LET HER GO.
NO.

00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:18.034
NOTHING CAN BE DONE.
HER DUEL ENERGY IS HIS NOW,

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.336
AND SOON, EXODIA
WILL BE FREED

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:22.838
FROM THE BINDS THAT HOLD HIM
WITHIN HIS PRISON,

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:24.573
AND HE'LL BE MINE
TO COMMAND,

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.777
AND THEN NOTHING WILL STOP ME
FROM RULING THIS WORLD.

00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:30.413
OH!
HMM...

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.784
ADRIAN. HE'S FALLING
TO THE DARKNESS.

00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:36.652
AAH!

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.721
IT'S JUST LIKE
WHAT I DID.

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:41.824
ALL HE CARES ABOUT
IS POWER,

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.093
NO MATTER
WHO HE HURTS.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.029
ADRIAN, DON'T DO THIS.

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.566
WHATEVER DOES
HE MEAN, ZANE?
UH...

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:52.969
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE MEANS.

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:56.572
HE'S SAYING THAT
DARKNESS CORRUPTS YOU.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.008
IT HAS THE POWER TO
CHANGE WHO A PERSON IS.

00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:01.677
NOTHING'S CHANGING ME.
THIS IS WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:04.880
YOU SEE, I'M JUST FINALLY
UNLEASHING WHO I REALLY AM.

00:11:05.548 --> 00:11:06.549
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.517
DID ECHO KNOW WHO
YOU WERE REALLY WERE,

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:11.854
OR DID SHE DO ALL THIS
FOR THE PERSON
SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE?

00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:13.689
ARE YOU
LISTENING, ADRIAN?

00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:15.624
WELL, ARE YA?

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:17.293
DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR HER.

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:19.228
SHE KNEW THAT, IN ORDER
FOR ME TO RULE,

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.629
I HAD TO LET
THIS SIDE OUT.

00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:22.164
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:24.567
THAT SIDE OF YOU'S
GOING TO THE STARS.

00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:28.104
[ROARING]

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.308
IT'S NOW OR NEVER,
AND I DRAW

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:35.177
THE SPELL D-MIND,
AND THANKS TO THIS,

00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:38.080
SINCE THERE AREN'T
ANY DESTINY HEROES
OUT ON MY FIELD,

00:11:38.714 --> 00:11:41.050
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
A LEVEL-3-OR-BELOW
DESTINY HERO

00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:42.985
DIRECTLY FROM MY DECK,

00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:46.022
AND I CHOOSE
DESTINY HERO DEPARTED,

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:47.690
AND SPEAKING OF LEAVING,

00:11:48.324 --> 00:11:50.860
I'M REMOVING THE DESTINY
HERO MALICIOUS
IN MY GRAVE FROM PLAY

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.830
SO THAT I CAN SUMMON
ANOTHER DESTINY HERO
FROM MY DECK,

00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:58.334
AND NEXT,
I'M SUMMONING
MY D-CUBIC.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.042
NOW I SACRIFICE
ALL 3 TO SUMMON
DESTINY HERO PLASMA,

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.044
DESTINY'S
ULTIMATE HERO.

00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.846
CHECK IT OUT.

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:14.083
AND PLASMA
CAN THEN EQUIP

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:15.684
ONE OF THE MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:17.620
GETTING HALF OF
ITS ATTACK POINTS

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.989
AS WELL AS
THAT MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:22.224
HMM, IMPRESSIVE,

00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:25.761
BUT SINCE WE'RE ON
THE TOPIC OF MONSTER
SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:29.565
YOU REMEMBER THAT EXODIOS
ISN'T AFFECTED BY THEM...

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:32.535
RRGH!
AND ONCE
I ATTACK YOU,

00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:36.005
ALL THE PIECES
WILL BE IN PLACE
FOR EXODIA TO BE RELEASED.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:37.773
OH, REALLY?

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:40.976
NOT IF I PLAY
MY FACEDOWN SPELL
KNOWN AS DRAIN TIME.

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.813
THIS CANCELS OUT
A GAME PHASE I CHOSE
FOR ONE TURN,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.615
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO OUR BATTLE PHASE,

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:49.151
AND... GUESS WHAT...
WITHOUT A BATTLE PHASE,

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:51.520
YOUR EXODIOS
IS STUCK IN NEUTRAL,

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.756
SO HE CAN'T ATTACK,
AND YOU CAN'T SEND

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:55.891
THE FIFTH EXODIA CARD
TO YOUR GRAVE.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.694
THAT'S INTERESTING.
DARN RIGHT, IT IS...

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.529
[THINKING]
AND AS LONG AS EXODIA'S
STILL IN CHECK,

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.298
I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:06.302
WITHOUT A BATTLE PHASE,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I CAN DO...

00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:09.438
THROW DOWN A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:11.674
OH, ASTER,
HOW STIRRING.

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.176
RGH! I'LL SHOW YOU
STIRRING.

00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:16.912
GO, PLASMA ROAR.
HMM.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.648
AND BECAUSE
MY DESTINY HERO PLASMA'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:23.252
I CAN PLACE
A PLASMA COUNTER ON IT.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:27.957
DON'T FORGET,
YOU STILL HAVE TO SKIP
YOUR BATTLE PHASE.

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:32.461
I PLACE A FACEDOWN.
YOUR TURN.

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:34.497
[ROARING]

00:13:35.164 --> 00:13:37.166
OHH!

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.735
[THINKING]
HOLD ON, ECHO.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.471
ADRIAN? GUESS WHAT.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:44.206
DURING THIS
STANDBY PHASE,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.709
DESTINY DEPARTED'S
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES,

00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:51.113
SUMMONING HIM
TO YOUR FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE...

00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:56.385
AND NOW
MY PLASMA ATTACKS
YOUR DESTINY HERO.

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.722
GO, PULSATING
PELLET BARAGE.

00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:04.393
GOOD THING I HAVE THIS,
MY FACEDOWN TRAP...

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.395
DEFENSE SEAL WALL.

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:08.831
IF THIS IS PLAYED WITH
EXODIOS ON THE FIELD,

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:11.100
NOT ONLY IS YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK NEGATED,

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.836
BUT THE CURRENT
BATTLE PHASE IS ENDED.

00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:18.674
THAT MAY BE, BUT
I'M ACTIVATING THIS,

00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:21.110
DESTINY HERO PLASMA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.512
IT CAN ABSORB HALF
DEPARTED'S LIFE POINTS,

00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:26.081
MAKING PLASMA
500 POINTS STRONGER.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:35.391
NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:37.493
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.462
[THINKING] I JUST HAVE
TO LAST ONE MORE ROUND.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.831
A VALIANT TRY
BUT FRUITLESS.

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:45.801
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?
'CAUSE GUESS WHAT I GET.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:49.738
ONE MORE PLASMA COUNTER.
HMM.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.375
[THINKING] OH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT, ADRIAN.

00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:55.544
WITH TWO COUNTERS,
I CAN SEND PLASMA ROAR

00:14:56.212 --> 00:14:57.713
TO THE GRAVEYARD
ON MY NEXT TURN.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.848
THEN, I CAN
DESTROY A MONSTER,

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:02.785
AND YOU TAKE HALF ITS
ATTACK POINTS AS DAMAGE.

00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:05.187
IT WON'T WORK
WITH EXODIOS,

00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:09.692
BUT I COULD DESTROY
MY OWN PLASMA.

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:14.029
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
LAST ONE MORE ROUND.

00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:19.635
RRGH!

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:22.404
[THINKING]
YOU CAN DO THIS.
I KNOW IT.

00:15:23.072 --> 00:15:24.073
[WHIMPERS]

00:15:24.573 --> 00:15:25.741
[ROARS]

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:27.409
HUH?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.320
[ROARS]

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:35.867
AND NOW, MY EXODIOS,
ATTACK.

00:15:36.534 --> 00:15:38.169
[ROARING]

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:39.838
AAH!

00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:43.641
END THIS DUEL NOW.
UNLEASH YOUR FURY.

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:45.343
HOLD ON!

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.546
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
PLASMA DISCHARGER.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.751
BY DESTROYING ONE EQUIP
CARD ON MY FIELD...

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:57.956
THE BATTLE PHASE
TAKING PLACE
IS RENDERED USELESS,

00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:02.494
WHICH IS A FANCY WAY
TO SAY YOU CAN'T ATTACK.

00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:04.395
[THINKING]
ALL ADRIAN HAS TO DO

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.398
IS END HIS TURN,
AND I CAN WIN THIS.

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:10.368
COME ON.

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:12.804
Echo: AAH!

00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:16.207
AAAAH!

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.376
ECHO?

00:16:19.043 --> 00:16:21.312
WHAT IS THAT?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.282
HER PENDANT.

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:31.322
OH! HUH?

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.858
I'M SORRY YOU'RE CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:36.094
ALL THAT I WANTED
WAS TO PROVE TO ADRIAN

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.196
THAT I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR HIM.
