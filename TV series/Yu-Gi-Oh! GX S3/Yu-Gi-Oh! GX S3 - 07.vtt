I CAN BRING
ONE BACK!

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.346
THEN I CAN FUSE
BOTH CARDS TOGETHER!

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:24.517
SO I SUMMON V-TIGER JET
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.252
[GROWLS]

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.157
THEN I'LL BRING BACK
W-WING CATAPULT!

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:34.760
NOW I'LL
COMBINE THEM!

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:39.465
IN ORDER TO FORM
VW TIGER CATAPULT!

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.012
YOU MAY HAVE
A BUNCH OF CLOUDS,

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.215
BUT I'VE GOT
THE PERFECT STORM!

00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:03.199
I DISCARD ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND,

00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:06.636
SWITCHING YOUR
COTTON BALL
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:08.638
THIS SHOULD
CLEAR THE AIR!

00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:12.141
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MY PREMATURE
BURIAL SPELL!

00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:14.143
FOR EIGHT HUNDRED
LIFE POINTS...

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.713
I CAN RESURRECT
A CARD!

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.949
LIKE MY
X-HEAD CANNON!

00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:23.186
AND THANKS TO
HIS SPECIAL EFFECT,

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.924
I CAN ALSO SUMMON
Y-DRAGON HEAD
AND Z-METAL TANK!

00:17:29.826 --> 00:17:32.662

00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:44.006
MEET XYZ-DRAGON
CANNON!

00:17:48.544 --> 00:17:50.279
HAVE YOU HEARD
THE LATEST
WEATHER REPORT?

00:17:50.913 --> 00:17:54.117
THEY SAY THIS
CLOUD COVER'S
GONNA BREAK!

00:17:57.687 --> 00:17:59.322
AAH!

00:18:08.631 --> 00:18:09.766
Jaden: CHAZZ IS
KICKING BUTT,

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:11.367
AND HE HASN'T EVEN
PLAYED HIS OJAMAS!

00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:14.270
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
SAID THOSE WERE
HIS FAVORITE CARDS!?

00:18:14.937 --> 00:18:16.973
THEY ARE.
BUT THEY HAVE THIS
LOVE/HATE THING.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.041
HE HATES
HIS MONSTERS?

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:22.145
SHEESH. THAT BOY'S
GOT SOME ISSUES.

00:18:30.553 --> 00:18:31.554
HEY!

00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:32.622
WONDERING HOW I WENT

00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:34.524
FROM TWO CLOUD TOKENS
TO FOUR!?

00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:38.361
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
SACRIFICE MY CLOUDIAN
SHEEP CLOUD.

00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:40.663
SUMMON ALL
THE DUST-BUNNIES
YOU WANT!

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.231
'CAUSE MY
NEXT CARD...

00:18:42.732 --> 00:18:44.333
IS FIVE CARDS
IN ONE!

00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:46.803
NO WAY! IS HE DOING WHAT
I THINK HE IS!?

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.272
I FUSE VW CATAPULT

00:18:49.939 --> 00:18:52.642
WITH XYZ-DRAGON
CANNON TO FORM...

00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:57.680
VWXYZ-DRAGON
CATAPULT CANNON!

00:19:08.891 --> 00:19:10.426
THAT THERE'S
SOME HEAVY METAL!

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:12.328
NOW FOR ITS
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:14.030
ONCE EVERY TURN...

00:19:14.697 --> 00:19:16.132
I REMOVE A CARD
FROM YOUR FIELD!

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:17.800
LIKE ONE
OF YOUR CLOUDS!

00:19:18.334 --> 00:19:19.335
NOT QUITE!

00:19:19.702 --> 00:19:21.204
CLOUD TOKENS DON'T
COUNT AS CARDS!

00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:22.872
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:24.474
BUT I MEANT
THAT ONE!

00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:28.077
SUMMON CLOUD!

00:19:28.744 --> 00:19:29.712
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:19:29.946 --> 00:19:31.147
CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT GRAY SKIES

00:19:31.447 --> 00:19:34.283
ARE GONNA CLEAR UP,
SO PUT ON A HAPPY FACE!

00:19:35.618 --> 00:19:36.619
GUESS WHAT, GUYS!

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:37.987
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
THIS BUT I'M ACTUALLY

00:19:38.654 --> 00:19:39.655
ROOTING FOR CHAZZ!

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:41.057
GET IT RIGHT, SY.

00:19:41.457 --> 00:19:42.592
DON'T YOU MEAN
"THE" CHAZZ?

00:19:43.025 --> 00:19:44.026
"THE" CHAZZ?

00:19:44.293 --> 00:19:45.561
YEAH, HAVEN'T
YOU NOTICED?

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:48.030
CHAZZ SPENDS THE MAJORITY
OF HIS TIME THINKING

00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:50.867
OF WAYS TO PROVE HE'S
COOLER THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:52.735
HE EVEN MADE UP
HIS OWN CHEER.

00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:54.337
SHOW 'IM, SY.

00:19:54.737 --> 00:19:56.072
Syrus: CHAZZ IT UP!
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:57.740
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:19:58.274 --> 00:19:59.275
NOT BAD!

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:02.211
WISH I COULD AFFORD
A CHEER LIKE THAT!

00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:04.280
I PLAY A FACEDOWN

00:20:04.947 --> 00:20:07.083
AND END MY TURN.

00:20:09.352 --> 00:20:11.120
[THINKING]
WHY DOES THIS
GUY SEEM SO CALM?

00:20:11.621 --> 00:20:13.823
HURRICANE CHAZZ IS
ABOUT TO BLOW
HIM APART,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.826
AND HE'S
ON CLOUD NINE!

00:20:17.493 --> 00:20:18.528
[THINKING]
REMEMBER, CHAZZ,

00:20:18.861 --> 00:20:20.363
WHAT STARTS
WITH A FEW DARK CLOUDS,

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.132
CAN END
IN A DEVASTATING STORM!

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:26.802
AND I PREDICT A MAJOR
DISTURBANCE IN THE AIR!
