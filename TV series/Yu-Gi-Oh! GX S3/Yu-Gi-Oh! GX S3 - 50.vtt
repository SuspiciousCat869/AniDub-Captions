NOW ANSWER ME THIS--
WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.331
THOSE YOU SENT
TO THE STARS WOULD SAY

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.300
IF THEY SAW YOU
EMBRACING THE POWER

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.968
OF THE SUPREME
KING AGAIN?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.636
WELL, JADEN?

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.039
THEY'D PROBABLY
NEVER FORGIVE ME,

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.041
MUCH LESS
UNDERSTAND.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.876
MAYBE I'M GOING
ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.877
[WHIMPERING]

00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.613
JADEN, YOU CAN'T
LISTEN TO HER,

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.750
BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO
START DOUBTING YOURSELF,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.686
AND THE SUPREME KING
WILL TAKE OVER!

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.187
HE'S GOT
A POINT.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.023
[GASPING]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:12.425
I HAVE TO REMEMBER
MY OWN ADVICE.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.894
IF I WANT TO USE THE POWER
OF THE SUPREME KING,

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.130
I'VE GOT TO COME
TO GRIPS WITH WHAT HE--

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.264
WITH WHAT I DID.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.767
IT'S MY FAULT
MY FRIENDS WERE LOST.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.403
BUT NOW,
I CAN RESCUE THEM.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.104
I HAVE TO TRUST
IN THE STRENGTH OF MY DECK

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:27.707
TO RIGHT ALL THE WRONGS
I'VE CAUSED.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.810
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND I DRAW!

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.113
JADEN...HOW ABOUT
A POWER BOOST?

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.015
SOUNDS GOOD.
NOW, THEN...

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.217
DO WHAT
YOU DO BEST.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:39.952
AH? HUH?

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:50.096
THAT BIRDBRAIN OF YOURS
WILL PAY FOR THAT.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.765
I CAN'T WAIT TO
GROUND HIM PERMANENTLY.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.400
WELL, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.570
BECAUSE I PLAY
CARD EXCLUDER!

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.772
AND DUE TO HER
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:03.276
YOUR SAMSARA LOTUS
IS NOW REMOVED
FROM THE GAME.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.079
SO NOW, YOUR RESURRECTION
COMBO IS NO MORE.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:08.881
ALL RIGHT!
SEE YOU, YUBEL!

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.217
THERE'S NOTHING
TO SACRIFICE.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.687
MAYBE, BUT I'M SURE THAT CARD
ISN'T GOING AWAY THAT EASILY.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.193
JADEN, WHY DO
YOU DO THIS?

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:22.195
WHY DO YOU TRY
TO GET RID OF ME?

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.297
IS IT ALL TO PROTECT
YOUR NEW FRIENDS?

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.999
YOU WORK SO HARD
TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.835
BUT YOU WON'T
SAVE THEM ALL.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.503
[GASPING]

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.805
HOW?
AAH!

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.440
BEFORE YOUR MONSTER
ATTACKED,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.776
I TRIGGERED
THE TRAP ZERO HOLE.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.178
WITH THIS ACTIVATED,
YOUR MONSTER'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.247
IS NEGATED,
AND THEN DESTROYED.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.850
SO, THEN YOUR YUBEL
IS SAFE...

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.652
UNTIL I PLAY
THIS TRAP CARD.

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.653
HUH?

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.390
I ACTIVATE NEO-SIGNAL.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.427
AND SINCE YOU
DESTROYED MY MONSTER,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.597
I GET TO CALL OUT
A NEO-SPACIAN,

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.967
AND I'M DIGGING UP
NEO-SPACIAN GRAND MOLE.

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.473
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
FRIENDS, I TAKE IT.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.842
JADEN, LET'S PARTY.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:13.412
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.
NOW, ATTACK!

00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:19.185
HE CAN'T HARM HER.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:22.955
THAT MAY BE, BUT WHEN
MY MOLE ATTACKS
YOUR YUBEL,

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.024
NO ONE TAKES
ANY DAMAGE,

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.225
BUT BOTH
OF OUR MONSTERS

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:28.294
GET SENT BACK TO OUR
HANDS INSTEAD.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.797
NOT TRUE. THERE WILL BE
PLENTY OF DAMAGE,

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:36.202
ONCE I PLAY THE TRAP
CARD HATE BUSTER!

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:41.274
AND WITH THIS, KISS
YOUR MOLE GOOD-BYE,

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:42.875
BECAUSE NOW BOTH
OF OUR MONSTERS

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.777
ARE INSTANTLY
DESTROYED.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:45.778

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:48.748

THE CATCH--DAMAGE.

YOUR HELP, PAL.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.413
INTO WHAT?

SO, HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW LOOK?

00:11:39.731 --> 00:11:41.733
I BET YOU'RE WONDERING
HOW IT HAPPENED.

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.601
WELL, LET ME EXPLAIN IT.

00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:46.504
SINCE YUBEL WAS DESTROYED
BY HATE BUSTER'S EFFECT,

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:49.674
SHE WAS ABLE TO EVOLVE
INTO THE BEAST YOU SEE NOW.

00:11:49.674 --> 00:11:53.044
AND WITH HER,
THE STAGE IS SET...

00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:55.680
FOR ME TO EXACT
MY FINAL REVENGE.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.217
NOW SAY HELLO
TO TERROR INCARNATE!

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:02.153
IT'S TIME
YOU MET YOUR FATE.

00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:04.322
HOLD ON. WHAT FATE?

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:06.557
YOU BANISHED ME.

00:12:06.557 --> 00:12:09.961
SO NOW, IT'S YOUR TURN
TO BE BANISHED!

DON'T YOU SEE?

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:15.667
IT HAS TO END
THIS WAY.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:19.203
IT WAS I WHO TRANSPORTED YOU
TO THESE FAR-OFF DIMENSIONS.

00:12:19.203 --> 00:12:22.674
AND IT WAS I WHO TRIED TO
REACH OUT TO YOU THROUGH MARCEL,

00:12:22.674 --> 00:12:25.743
BUT THEN YOUR FRIEND, JESSE,
HAD TO INTERFERE.

00:12:26.744 --> 00:12:29.247
SO I TOOK HIM
AND MADE HIM MY MINION,

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.316
KNOWING YOU'D COME
LOOKING FOR HIM

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:34.419
AND KNOWING THAT YOUR FRIENDS
WOULD NEVER LET YOU COME ALONE.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:36.220

USE THEM AS PAYBACK

FOR ALL THE PAIN
YOU CAUSED ME.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.958
THAT'S RIGHT.
I BROUGHT THEM ALL HERE

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.995
HOPING THAT IF I MADE THEM
SUFFER BY THE HANDS OF YOU,

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:45.463
THEIR CLOSEST FRIEND,

00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:46.998
YOU MIGHT SEE THE ERROR
OF YOUR WAYS

00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:49.434
AND WE COULD FINALLY
BE REUNITED.

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:52.103
BUT INSTEAD,
YOU FIGHT WITH THE HOPE

00:12:52.103 --> 00:12:55.506
OF SENDING ME AWAY AGAIN.
BUT THIS TIME,

00:12:55.506 --> 00:12:59.010
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
BUT YOU ARE, JADEN.

GOING TO HAPPEN,

NOT WITH TWINKLE MOSS

00:13:08.953 --> 00:13:11.389
BECAUSE WITH
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:13.324
I CAN DRAW ONE CARD.

AND IT LOOKS LIKE I DREW
ELEMENTAL HERO PRISMA!

BUT BECAUSE IT'S
A MONSTER CARD,

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:24.402
MY TWINKLE MOSS'S EFFECT
WON'T LET ME ATTACK.

00:13:24.402 --> 00:13:27.572
