00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:22.769
EVEN IF IT MEANS
HIDING THE TRUTH.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:26.106
OKAY, YOU JUST WENT
TO A REALLY
WEIRD PLACE.

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:28.174
I WAS WITH YOU
TILL THE KING THING.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.443
DON'T MAKE FUN!
SEE THIS?

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.912
THE PERSON INSIDE
IS YOUR BETTER.

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.881
HE IS STRONGER
THAN ALL OF YOU.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.250
HE'S SMARTER,
AND HE IS KIND.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.687
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:41.821
IS THIS FOG?

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.693
FEEL THAT?

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.194
DID IT GET COLDER?

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.797
WHAT IS THIS?

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:52.565
Aster: JADEN!

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.200
ZANE! WATCH THE OTHERS!

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.201
MISS ECHO!

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.770
COME HERE,
I'LL PROTECT YOU!

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.838
THEN, I'M GOING
TO HELP ASTER.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.774
WAIT, YOU MUST
PROTECT ME!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.845
THIS FOG...
THIS COLD...

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.981
Ojama Yellow:
HOLD ME!
I'M FREEZING!

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:12.852
Aster: WHAT'S THIS?

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.188
EVERYONE, TRY TO HOLD ON
AND STICK TOGETHER...

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:33.873
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.208
I CAN'T BE CERTAIN,

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:38.111
BUT I THINK WE WERE
JUST TELEPORTED HERE.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.513
MISS ECHO,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.086
[MOANS]

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.822
JADEN, YOU OKAY?

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:52.559
I AM NOT LIKING THIS.
[GASP]

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.194
Aster: SOMEONE'S COMING!

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:03.036
IT'S ADRIAN.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.605
YOU MEAN
THE TRANSFER KID?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:06.606
ADRIAN...

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.644
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!
WE WERE ALL WORRIED.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.779
AFTER YOU WERE
LEFT BEHIND,

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.848
I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.549
[THINKING] I DON'T TRUST
THIS GUY.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.651
I WASN'T
LEFT BEHIND, CROWLER.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.221
I STAYED.
I CHOSE TO STICK AROUND.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.622
YOU DID?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.990
SO YOU...

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.625
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
ALL THIS TIME?

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.626
DID YOU
SEE JESSE?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.561
AFRAID NOT.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.997
OH MAN... AH!

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:34.067
LOOK! IT'S
THAT CREEPY ARM!

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.468
NO WAY!

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.469
YOU'VE TEAMED UP
WITH YUBEL,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.937
LIKE VIPER
AND MARCEL!

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:38.938
AAH!

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.643
ECHO...SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.346
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.014
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.383
AND WHY ARE YOU STARING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:53.553
[CHUCKLES] I'M JUST
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:54.954
DON'T TRUST
THIS GUY.

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:55.955
ADRIAN!

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.192
COME WITH ME, ECHO.

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.728
I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH YOU.

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:02.896
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.265
THAT WASN'T A REQUEST!

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:08.201
ECHO! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:10.603
Aster: ADRIAN!
LEAVE HER ALONE!

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.505
I'M ONLY GOING TO
TELL YOU ONCE--

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.174
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND ECHO.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.341
NOT ANYMORE!

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.110
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE JUST SAID?

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.279
SHE DOESN'T WANNA
GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.281
Adrian: IS THAT SO?

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.316
DON'T YOU WANT
THE BEST FOR ME, ECHO?

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:25.318
I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.987
WITHOUT YOU, I CAN'T
ACHIEVE GREATNESS.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.256
I NEED YOU.
WON'T YOU HELP?

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.259
YOU SEE, I MUST
HAVE ALL YOUR
DUEL ENERGY, ECHO,

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.928
IN ORDER TO BE KING!

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:35.929
DUEL ENERGY?

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:36.930
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.731
BUT SHE'LL...

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.134
NOT A CHANCE!
LISTEN, PLEASE!

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.703
ECHO, JUST COME
OVER HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.907
LET HER GO, ADRIAN!

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:51.044
AAH!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.278
OR WHAT?

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.580
OR YOU'LL ANSWER TO ME!

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.348
IF YOU REALLY
WANT ECHO...

00:11:55.348 --> 00:11:57.584
YOU BETTER BE
READY TO DUEL!

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:01.054
UHH...ASTER...
DON'T...UHH!

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.458
Adrian: FINE. I ACCEPT
YOUR LITTLE CHALLENGE.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:09.295
BUT NOT HERE,
IT'S TOO DARK.
FOLLOW ME...

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:22.308
THERE--I'LL GO FIRST...

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:24.043
Crowler: ISN'T THIS CAVE
DARK TOO?

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.012
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:27.513
Zane: HE WANTED TO BE
HERE FOR SOME REASON.

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:28.948
BE CAREFUL, ASTER.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.084
Adrian: YES, ASTER--
BE CAREFUL.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.327
Adrian and Aster:
GAME ON!

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.528
HANG IN THERE...

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.198
IT'S MY TURN!
I DRAW!

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:48.601
I SUMMON VORTEX TROOPER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.104
DUE TO MY TROOPER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.072
I CAN SEND TWO CARDS
TO MY DECK,

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.876
AND THEN
SHUFFLE THEM ALL UP.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.845
AND NOW, I DRAW
TWO NEW CARDS.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.615
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.983
[THINKING] SO
HE SUMMONED A MONSTER

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:05.985
THAT LETS HIM
SWAP CARDS AROUND.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:08.121
WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY
HAS HE GOT GOING ON?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.289
WHATEVER.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.457
KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE PRIZE, ASTER.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.060
MY TURN--
I DRAW!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.929
I SUMMON
A DESTINY HERO!

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:19.632
TIME FOR DIAMOND DUDE
TO SHINE!

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.035
FIRST, I'LL ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:24.370
IT LETS ME CHECK
MY DECK'S TOP CARD.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.506
AND IF IT HAPPENS TO BE
A NORMAL SPELL...

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:27.507
THE SPELL WILL ACTIVATE

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:29.309
DURING MY NEXT
MAIN PHASE.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.944
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S A SPELL CARD.

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.914
WE'LL DEAL
WITH THAT LATER

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.883
'CAUSE DIAMOND DUDE'S
ABOUT TO ATTACK!

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:39.152
GO DIAMOND BLAST!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.220
[ROARING]

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.292
WHEN VORTEX TROOPER
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.462
I CAN DRAW A CARD
FROM MY DECK!

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:55.001
I PLACE TWO CARDS FACEDOWN--
YOUR MOVE, TRANSFER.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.404
Adrian: SO IT IS, I DRAW...

00:13:58.404 --> 00:14:01.641
AND SUMMON DEEP DIVER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:04.243
AFTER I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.378
I END MY TURN.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:06.979
[THINKING] WHY ISN'T
HE ATTACKING?

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.314
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'VE GOTTA

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.382
HURRY UP AND BEAT HIM

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:11.951
BEFORE WHATEVER HE'S
COOKING STARTS TO BOIL.

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:19.425
Zane: WHY DID ADRIAN WANT
TO DUEL ASTER DOWN HERE?

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:22.729
AND WHAT'S
HE PLANNING ON DOING
WITH ECHO'S DUEL ENERGY?

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:24.697
AND MY GUT'S TELLING ME
THAT BOTH QUESTIONS

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.733
ARE GONNA WIND UP
HAVING THE SAME ANSWER....

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.435
READY, ADRIAN?
MY MOVE!

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:30.837
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:32.905
DUE TO DIAMOND DUDE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:34.774
I CAN ACTIVATE
DESTINY DRAW.

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:37.877
SO I DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.545
NOW, DESTINY DUDE
LETS ME CHECK

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.913
THE TOP CARD OF MY DECK
TO SEE

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.316
IF IT'S A NORMAL SPELL
OR NOT.

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:44.617
AND IT IS.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.153
SO, I'LL JUST PUT IT
IN MY GRAVE FOR NOW

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.422
AND WAIT TILL NEXT ROUND
TO TRIGGER IT.

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:51.958
IF THERE IS ONE.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.227
SAY THAT TO DESTINY
HERO DUNKER,

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.661
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.029
[ROARING]

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.898
WITH DUNKER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.266
I CAN SEND
A DESTINY HERO

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.934
FROM MY HAND
TO THE GRAVE

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.370
IN ORDER TO DISH OUT
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.142
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE,

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.277
SO I'M ACTIVATING
THE FIELD SPELL

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.613
CLOCK TOWER PRISON!

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.023
BIG BEN? HMPH!
BIG DEAL!

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:26.292
NOW, I REVEAL
MY FACEDOWN CARDS!

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.294
WAIT A SEC--WHY PLAY TWO?

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.263
'CAUSE TIME'S
OF THE ESSENCE!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.932
BY PLAYING TWO
ETERNAL DREAD TRAP CARDS,

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.734
I CAN WIND
MY CLOCK TOWER AHEAD

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.937
BY A TOTAL OF 12 HOURS.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.006
THE BELL WILL TOLL
FOR THEE, ADRIAN.

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:49.482
AND NEXT, I PLAY
THE SPELL

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:51.317
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON!

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.419
THIS LETS ME DESTROY
ONE SPELL OR TRAP

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.420
THAT I HAVE IN PLAY.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.988
IF MY TOWER IS DESTROYED

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.458
WITH BOTH HANDS
AT 12, I CAN SUMMON UP

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.194
DESTINY HERO DREADMASTER
TO TAKE ITS PLACE!

00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:03.729
[ROARING]

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.366
AND NOT ONLY THAT--

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.268
WHEN MY PRISON'S
SPECIAL EFFECT

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.370
GIVES DREADMASTER
HIS WAKE-UP CALL,

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.007
I GET TO SUMMON
ANOTHER DESTINY HERO
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:18.511
AND I CHOOSE
DESTINY HERO DISK COMMANDER!

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.613
THANKS TO
DISK COMMANDER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:24.217
I GET TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS
FROM MY DECK.

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:26.352

Adrian: I PLAY
MY FACEDOWN CARD,
DIMENSIONAL PRISON!

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.262
GREAT.
A COUNTER TRAP.

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:12.298
IT CAN ACTIVATE ANYTIME
YOU ATTACK ME
WITH A MONSTER.

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:13.366
AS FOR THE MONSTER--

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.634
SLOW DOWN, PAL!

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:15.968
IF DREADMASTER ATTACKS

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.637
ON THE TURN
HE'S SUMMONED,

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:20.773
MY DESTINY HEROES
CANNOT BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE,

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.275
AND THEY DON'T
TAKE DAMAGE.

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:24.343
I'M NOT DESTROYING
YOUR MONSTER.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.878
I'M REMOVING IT
FROM PLAY.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.550
AND HERE'S MORE BAD NEWS!

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.486
BECAUSE YOU SENT
MY DEEP DIVER
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:35.454
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:38.024
LETTING ME SELECT
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:40.560
AND I PLACE THAT CARD
ON THE TOP.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.796
I GET IT, HE MUST BE
STRENGTHENING HIS HAND,

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:46.232
TRYING TO BUILD IT UP
TO SUMMON SOMETHING BIG.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:51.571
WAIT... OF COURSE.
I BETTER STOP THIS NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.873
HERE GOES--
I ACTIVATE

00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:56.309
THE FORCE OF FOUR
SPELL CARD.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:57.643
BECAUSE OF THIS SPELL,

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:00.379
BOTH PLAYERS CAN
ONLY HAVE FOUR CARDS
IN THEIR HANDS.

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.848
IF YOU TRY TO ADD
A FIFTH CARD
TO YOUR HAND,

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.350
IT GOES STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:08.220
I HAVE THREE CARDS
IN MY HAND,

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.622
SO I'M GOOD TO GO.

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:11.223
BUT YOU GOTTA
DITCH ONE, TRANSFER.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.262
YOU WERE ABOUT
TO COMPLETE EXODIA!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.097
Adrian: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.799
WELL, YOU CAN'T DO IT
UNLESS YOU HAVE

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.801
ALL FIVE CARDS
IN YOUR HAND.

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.436
IT HURTS, I KNOW.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.205
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ONE CARD SHORT!

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.276
WHAT IS IT?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.582
THAT'S IT FOR ME.

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.851
THIS ISN'T OVER.
I DRAW.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.056
LOOK AT THAT.
TOO BAD IT'S USELESS.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:45.491
YOU GOT A BACKUP PLAN?

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:48.694
I SURE DO.

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.830
FROM MY GRAVE,
I ACTIVATE

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.599
THE RITUAL OF THE ULTIMATE
FORBIDDEN LORD SPELL CARD!

00:18:56.002 --> 00:18:57.870
NO WAY...

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.706
THERE IT IS!
EXODIA!

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.478
WHAT IS THAT?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.213
Adrian: IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE MY DESTINY

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:08.581
AND RULE THIS WORLD,

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:11.083
I MUST CONTROL
EXODIA'S POWER.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.186
BUT IN ORDER TO RELEASE
EXODIA FROM ITS CHAINS

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.955
AND HARNESS ITS ENERGY,

00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:18.357
I MUST OFFER UP
THE DUEL ENERGY

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.925
OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.193
ADRIAN...

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:24.196
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED YOU
TO REALIZE MY GREATNESS.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.532
ECHO, I CAN'T
DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.535
AND YOU WON'T.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.704
ECHO, NO.
DON'T DO IT.

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:33.639
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO WIN A DUEL,

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:37.176
BUT I'D NEVER
CROSS THIS LINE.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.544
ADRIAN...

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.381
Crowler: UH, YOU DON'T
WANNA DO THIS, MISS ECHO.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.583
COME ON, ECHO!
STOP IT!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.686
HE'S USING YOU!

00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:50.923
Aster: ECHO!
