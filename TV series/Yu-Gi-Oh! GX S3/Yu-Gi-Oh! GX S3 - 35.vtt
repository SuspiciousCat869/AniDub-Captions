THAT'S WHEN
YOU ARE TO REMOVE

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.516
THE WRAPPINGS THAT ARE
COVERING YOUR EYE.

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.352
HUH?

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.586
A COMET TURNS.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.054
A FRIEND
WALKS LOST.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.389
A BANDAGE FALLS.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.826
THE EYE
SEES THE TRUTH.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:14.861
A FRIEND SHOWS US THE WAY.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.407
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE OLD GUY
WAS OFF HIS ROCKER,

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:29.743
BUT NOW THE PIECES FIT.

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:33.680

SHOW US THE WAY?

I COULD STILL SEE
THE JADEN YOU AND I KNOW.

THAT'S JADEN.

DON'T MIND IF I DO!

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:09.435
HERE WE GO, THEN.
I DRAW!

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:13.439
AND SUMMON SHELL KNIGHT
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.276
WHEN HE'S SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD,

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.778
MY OPPONENT TAKES
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:20.780
ATTACK HIM...
NOW!

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:24.050

AND END MY TURN.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.665
NOT BAD... HE DEALT
SOME DAMAGE,

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:40.700
AND SET UP
SOME DEFENSE.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.069
[LAUGHS]
THAT DEFENSE IS USELESS.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.071
SIMPLY PATHETIC.

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:48.841
WITH MOVES LIKE THAT,
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.212
I DRAW!

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.114
FIRST UP, I PLAY
A RATHER "FIENDISH" SPELL.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:58.885
HUH?

00:11:58.918 --> 00:11:59.919
WHAT COULD THAT BE?

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:01.955
I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.690
THAT'S A NEW EDITION
TO JADEN'S DECK.

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.259
I WONDER WHAT HE'S
GONNA DO WITH THAT?

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:10.163
WITH DARK FUSION,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.831
I COMBINE
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.701
AND ELEMENTAL HERO
BURSTINATRIX...

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:19.572
TO FORM EVIL HERO

[SHOUTING]

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:26.879
SO, DARK FUSION
TAKES TWO GOOD GUYS

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.449
AND MAKES
ONE BAD GUY?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.517
GO, INFERNO WING!

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.787
ATTACK THIS WORM
WITH INFERNO BLAST!

[YELLING]

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:38.858
I PLAY MY FACE-DOWN.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:40.627
SAKURETSU ARMOR!

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.196
THIS CARD DESTROYS
AN ATTACKING MONSTER.

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:45.932
YES, NORMALLY THAT
WOULD BE THE CASE, BUT...

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.568
BECAUSE OF DARK FUSION,
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:51.638
INFERNO WING CAN'T BE DESTROYED
BY SPELLS OR TRAPS.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.841

AH!

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.381
BUT MY SHELL KNIGHT
IS IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.716
SO HOW COME I TOOK
DAMAGE JUST NOW?

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:07.553
BY ATTACKING YOU, HER SPECIAL
ABILITY GETS ACTIVATED.

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:11.591
AND THEN SHE DEALS DAMAGE
EQUAL TO YOUR MONSTERS'
ATTACK OR DEFENSE POINTS,

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:13.593
WHICHEVER ONE IS HIGHER.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.129
SINCE SHELL KNIGHT HAS
MORE DEFENSE POINTS,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.632
YOU LOSE
TWO THOUSAND LIFE POINTS.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.604

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:26.973

YOU'RE HIDING 'CAUSE YOU
FEEL BAD ABOUT SOMETHING.

TO HIDE ANY LONGER.

YOU CAN ONLY LOOK
TO THE FUTURE.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.495
TOMORROW IS YOURS FOR
THE TAKING, BUT YOU HAVE
TO TRULY WANT IT.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.331
AND IN ORDER TO TAKE IT,
YOU MUST HAVE POWER!

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:16.302
AND IF YOU WANT THIS POWER,
YOU HAVE TO BE MERCILESS.

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:20.806
USE THIS CARD,
AND YOU CAN CONQUER ANYTHING
THAT GETS IN YOUR WAY.

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:23.309
AH!

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.311
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.146
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO TRICK YOU, MATE.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:28.814
HE'S JUST USING YOU.

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:30.383
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,
JADEN,

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.118
JUST TURN AROUND
AND WALK AWAY.

[GROWLS]

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.331
THE EYE OF ORICHALCUM HAS
SHOWN US THE FIGHT GOING ON

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:47.767
IN JADEN'S MIND
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.136
DARKNESS HAS NOT
FULLY TAKEN OVER.

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:52.371
THERE IS STILL GOOD,
AND THE ONLY WAY

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.507
TO GET HIM BACK IS TO
BEAT HIS DARK HALF...

YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH A FUSION CARD

I'M ACTIVATIN' THE
SPELL FOSSIL FUSION!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.234

YOU GOTTA FIGHT HIM.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.489

[GASPS]

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:08.941
YOUR EYE IS NO MATCH
FOR THE POWER OF DARKNESS.

CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:13.612
JADEN AND I
ARE ONE SPIRIT.

HOW CAN THIS BE?

IF JIM'S EYE CAN'T
DEFEAT THE DARKNESS
CONTROLLING JADEN,

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:22.621
MAYBE HIS DUELING CAN.

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.958
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
THE JADEN WE KNOW BACK

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:29.095
IS TO DUEL HIS DARK HALF
AND SEND IT TO THE STARS.

PLAY HIS CARDS RIGHT
