WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:04.104
Jaden, voice-over:
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.205
STAY STRONG MATE.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.008
IT'S OVER FOR ME...
BUT NOT FOR YOU.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.746
WELL THEN, YOU NEXT?

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.147
UHH!

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.753
I'M SORRY JIM BUT I CAN'T
DO THIS ON MY OWN.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.221
Syrus: AXEL?
UHH!

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.056
SYRUS.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.192
IF IT'S TRUE THAT
YOUR DUELING DAYS ARE OVER,

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.326
SO BE IT.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.728
BUT WHEN I LOOK
INTO YOUR FACE,

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.663
I CAN STILL SEE
THE DUELIST IN YOU...

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.101
LOOK AT ALL THE DUEL DISKS.
JADEN WAS HERE.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.569
AND IT SEEMS
THAT HE'S DUELING

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.604
EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING
THAT GETS IN HIS WAY.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.506
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.909
AND SEE IF WE CAN
STOP THIS MADNESS

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.510
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.279
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO NEED SOME HELP.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.515
WELL, LET'S GO RESCUE
SOME DUELISTS.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.017
HOW DO YOU EVEN LOOK
AT YOURSELF

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.219
KNOWING THAT YOU
RAN AWAY AFRAID.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.720
I AM NOT RUNNING.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.357
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL!

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.226
ONCE YOU'RE SENT
TO THE STARS...

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.662
THEN THE WORLD,
WILL BELONG...

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.063
TO OUR SUPREME KING!

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.598

Ojama Yellow:
WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING
IN THERE, ARE WE--SYRUS?

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.230
IT LOOKS TOO SCARY.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.232
LET'S GO FIND
A NICE MEADOW INSTEAD.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.435
A GENTLE BROOK,
SOME TREES,
MAYBE SOME NICE DEER.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.138
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE THAT IN THIS WORLD.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.973
BESIDES, BEING IN THERE
IS MUCH SAFER

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.174
THAN BEING OUT HERE.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.576
STAY BEHIND IF YOU WANT.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.779
EEH...HUH?

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.981
SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING US.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.850
IS THAT WHO I THINK IT IS?

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.718
NAH, IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN HIM,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.587
UNLESS, MAYBE IT WAS,

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:35.022
BUT HE DID
LOOK THE SAME.

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:37.758
HEY CYRUS, WAIT UP.
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.126
STOP ACTIN' YELLOW,
WOULD YA?

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.894
I CAN'T!

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.329
Axel and Skull Knight:
GAME ON!

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.965
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED!

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.101
I PLAY A MONSTER FACEDOWN!

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.238
AND THEN I'LL PLAY ANOTHER
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.509
ALL RIGHT, I'M UP THEN.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:01.314
FIRST, I ACTIVATE--
THE BLAZE ACCELERATOR
SPELL CARD!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.583
THEN I SEND
BLAZE ACCELERATOR
TO THE GRAVE,

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.219
SO THAT I CAN PLAY
TRI-BLAZE ACCELERATOR!

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.221
NOW, IF I SEND
A PYRO-TYPE MONSTER

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.523
IN MY HAND TO MY GRAVE,

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.025
I GET T' TAKE OUT
A MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.795
AND YOU TAKE
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.397
ONLY CATCH--I CAN'T
ATTACK THIS TURN.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.167
SO I SEND VOLCANIC
SCATTERSHOT TO MY GRAVE.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.769
AND TARGET YOUR FACEDOWN
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.472
SO DOES IT HAVE
ANY LAST WORDS?

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.708
YES!
IT SAYS "TRAP CARD!"

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.677
YOU SEE WHEN A FACEDOWN
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.680
GETS TARGETED,
BY A SPELL CARD
LIKE YOUR TRI-BLAZE,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.083
MY REVERSE EFFECTOR
ACTIVATES.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.151
TURNING MY MONSTER
TO ATTACK MODE.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.088
AND TRIGGERING MAGICAL
MERCHANT'S FLIP EFFECT.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:42.355
THIS LETS ME DRAW
FROM MY DECK

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.191
UNTIL I GET
A SPELL OR TRAP CARD,

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.726
WHICH GOES TO MY HAND.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.694
AS FOR ALL THE OTHER CARDS--

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.731
IF THEY'RE MONSTERS THEY
GET SENT TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.532
WAS THAT 12 CARDS?

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.435
IT WAS--ALL FOR
THIS LITTLE CARD HERE.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.872
NOW I HAVE TO SEND MAGICAL
MERCHANT TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.775
WITH THAT DONE--YOUR
ACCELERATOR'S EFFECT ENDS

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.343
WITHOUT EVER ACTIVATING.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.612
MAYBE SO--
BUT NOW SCATTERSHOT'S

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.547
SPECIAL ABILITY
GOES INTO EFFECT.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:10.150
BECAUSE I SENT
MY SCATTERSHOT
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.019
500 OF YOUR LIFE POINTS
GO UP IN FLAMES!

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.689
[ROARING]

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.394
AND NOW TO TURN UP
THE HEAT SOME MORE!

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:24.865
I SUMMON
VOLCANIC SLICER!
[ROARING]

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:26.133
FOR EVERY TURN
IT'S OUT--

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.235
THIS MONSTER OF MINE
GETS TO SLICE OFF

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.370
ANOTHER 500
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.806
[ROARING]

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.650
HEH!
THAT KINDA TICKLED.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.286
NOW, I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.456
THEN IT'S MY MOVE.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.057
AND I PLAY THIS--

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.927
THE SYNTHESIS SPELL
RITUAL SPELL CARD.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.329
NOW, IN ORDER
TO ACTIVATE THIS--

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.766
I HAVE TO SACRIFICE MY MAD DOG
OF DARKNESS AND MY VORSE RAIDER,

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.536
WHICH WHEN ADDED TOGETHER
TOTAL AT LEAST LEVEL 6.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.406
AND THAT!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.242
ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON!--LYCANTHROPE!

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.011
MY BIG, BAD WOLF!

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:12.913
2,400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:15.048
AND NOW--TO ADD SOME BITE!

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.483
I TRIGGER THIS SPELL CARD!

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.754
BOOSTING HIS POWER
BY 500 POINTS...

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.256
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING
TO HOWL ABOUT ISN'T IT?!

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.892
AND IF YOU TRY
TO DESTROY HIM
WITH AN EFFECT...

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.662
THE SPELL CARD
TAKES THE HIT.
UHH.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:32.599
THIS MAKES YOUR TRI-BLAZE
ACCELERATOR PRETTY USELESS.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.634
ATTACK--LYCANTHROPE!

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:38.038
[GROWLING]

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:40.740
[ROARING, GROWLING]

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.543
UHH!

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:48.448
I PLAY MY TRAP!
VOLCANIC ARMOR!

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.418
IF YOU DESTROY
A PYRO-TYPE MONSTER
ON MY FIELD--

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.687
THEN 500
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE BURNT UP!

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.161
HEH! HOW CUTE!

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:02.229
YOU THOUGHT
A LITTLE HEAT WAVE

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.597
WOULD MAKE ME
SWEAT THIS DUEL.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:04.698
TOO BAD!

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.900
LYCANTHROPE'S ABILITY
ACTIVATES!
[GROWLING]

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.135
ANYTIME HE DEALS DAMAGE
IN BATTLE...

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:12.038
HE DISHES OUT AN ADDITIONAL
200 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.975
FOR EVERY NORMAL MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:16.109
SAY WHAT?

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.079
THERE ARE 14 NORMAL
MONSTERS IN MY GRAVE...

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.614
SO, YOU, LITTLE MORTAL,

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.849
ARE ABOUT TO HAVE
A HUGE AMOUNT
OF LIFE POINTS--

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.651
BITTEN OFF!

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:28.655
SO THAT'S WHY YOU
SENT ALL THOSE CARDS
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD?

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.357
JUST THINKING AHEAD...

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:31.958
NOW, LYCANTHROPE--

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.461
ATTACK WITH SERRATED
SHADOW SLASH!

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.131
UHH! UHH!
UHH! UHH!

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.200
YOU'RE WOLF-MEAT,
LITTLE MORTAL.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.502
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT LYCANTHROPE!

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:43.837
IT'S OVER!

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.139
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO RUN--COWARD!

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.708
BUT YOU, YOU'LL NEVER
GET AWAY!

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.411
BECAUSE YOUR DESTINY
IS WITH THE STARS!

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.481
[LAUGHS]

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:03.690
[LAUGHS]
ONLY 100
LIFE POINTS LEFT!

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.225
THEN IT'S
OFF TO THE STARS!

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.526
POOR COWARD!

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:09.963
UHH. COME ON, AXEL...
JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:13.300
IT'S MY TURN!
I DRAW!

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.334
GUESS WHAT!

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:15.902
I KNOW YOU ALL
THINK I'M A COWARD,

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.737
BUT I'M AFRAID THIS
NEXT MOVE'LL HAVE YOU

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.472
SHAKIN' IN YOUR
DUEL DISK!

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.975
FIRST I SEND
MY ACCELERATOR
TO THE GRAVE!

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.644
AND THEN, I SUMMON
THIS--VOLCANIC DOOMFIRE!

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:28.281
[ROARING]

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.216
THAT'S A LOT
OF FIRE POWER!

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.485
AND THEN I PLAY--
MY FACEDOWN TRAP CARD!

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:37.290
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.126
IT'S VOLCANIC MINE!
IT PLACES A BOMB TOKEN

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.628
ON EVERY OPEN SPACE...

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.331
IN YOUR
MONSTER CARD ZONE!

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.732
HUH?
