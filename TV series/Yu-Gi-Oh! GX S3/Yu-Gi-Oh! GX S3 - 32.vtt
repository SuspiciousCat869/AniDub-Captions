00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:10.390
MY WICKED CANON...

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.592
RELEASE ALL YOUR POWER!

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.299
COME FORTH,
SUPER POLYMERIZATION!

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:21.234
MY FRIENDS,
THEY'RE GONE.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:24.471
YES, BUT YOUR LOSS
IS MY GAIN.

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:28.608
THOSE FOUR OFFERINGS HAVE
ENABLED ME TO ACQUIRE--

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.443
OH!

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.446
NO! DON'T GO!
COME BACK!

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.615
CURSES, THEY
WEREN'T ENOUGH.

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.717
I DID NEED
THE FIFTH RUNE.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.886
WHAT?!
A FIFTH RUNE?

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.489
SO YOU NEEDED ANOTHER--
ANOTHER OF MY FRIENDS?

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:44.924
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE LITTLE ONE.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.361
I NEEDED THE POWER
OF THE FIVE SPIRIT
SPHERES--

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.131
ANGER, HATE...

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.933
ANGUISH, SADNESS,

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.102
AND DOUBT.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:59.005
SO YOU DID THIS
FOR A CARD?!

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.073
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.741
TOO BAD I UNDERESTIMATED
THE POWER

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.543
OF SUPER POLYMERIZATION.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.279
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SUMMON IT,

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.348
BUT I'LL DEFEAT YOU
WITH OR WITHOUT IT.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:10.617
SO PREPARE TO VISIT
THE STARS,

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.185
'CAUSE IT'S STILL
MY TURN!

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.455
AND NOW I'LL REMOVE
SINISTER DOCTRINES

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.491
AND DISPEL WICKED
CANON FROM PLAY.

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:25.698
DOING THIS ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON UP TO A LEVEL 8
FUSION MONSTER!

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:30.336
PLEASE WELCOME REIGN-BEAUX,
OVERLORD OF DARK WORLD!

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.272
[GROWLS]

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:34.774
OH!

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:38.878
NOW TAKE HIM DOWN,
MY MIGHTY REIGN-BEAUX!

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.880
ATTACK WITH WAVE
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.782
[ROARS]

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:48.021
[GROANING]

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.392
[THINKING]
COME ON JADEN, IF YOU
DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON,

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:55.395
THAT KING'S GONNA
BEAT YOU ROYALLY!

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.968
JADEN, I'VE ATTACKED
YOU ENOUGH FOR NOW,

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:06.606
SO TAKE A KNEE, MY KNIGHT
OF THE DARK WORLD ARMY.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.142
AND NEXT,
I PLAY A FACEDOWN

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:11.177
AND THEN END MY TURN!

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:12.479
HUH...

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.848
YOUR MOVE, BUT WHY BOTHER?

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:17.150
WHY NOT JOIN
YOUR FRIENDS RIGHT NOW?

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.422
WHAT'S THIS?
YOU'RE CONTINUING?

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:25.225
I'M SURE YOU'RE FRIENDS
WOULD APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.460
IF YOU HADN'T GOTTEN
THEM SENT TO THE STARS,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.628
RIGHT, JADEN?

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.330
DON'T TALK
ABOUT MY FRIENDS!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.931
BUT IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY FEEL,

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:33.800
ASK THEM YOURSELF!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.702
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THEM ALL SOON ENOUGH!

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.904
HUH?
[GROWLING]

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:41.875
[LAUGHING]
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:45.979
NOW I'LL REMOVE
MY TWO DARK TOKENS

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:50.550
TO SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.820
AND NEXT I PLAY
MY COMMON SOUL
SPELL CARD

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.322
WHICH WHEN ACTIVATED
LETS ME SUMMON THIS--

00:10:56.322 --> 00:11:00.827
MY NEO-SPACIAN
AIR HUMMINGBIRD!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:06.065
THEN I JOIN NEOS
AND AIR HUMMINGBIRD
WITH CONTACT FUSION...

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:10.570
TO FORM ELEMENTAL
HERO AIR NEOS!

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.704
SO WHAT?

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.439
IT CAN'T DO ME
ANY HARM!

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.508
I WOULDN'T BE TO
SURE ABOUT THAT

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.378
BECAUSE I'M ACTIVATING
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:20.346
SINCE I'VE GOT
LESS LIFE POINTS,

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.315
THE DIFFERENCE
GETS ADDED TO
ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:30.023
AIR NEOS,
LET'S TAKE OUT
THIS REIGN-BEAUX!

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.457
ATTACK!

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.964
AAH!

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:41.100
NOW I PLAY THE SPELL
CONTACT OUT,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.536
WHICH LETS ME DEFUSE
MY AIR NEOS.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.371
WELCOME BACK, YOU TWO!

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:50.810
ALL RIGHT! NEOS,
TIME TO TAKE DOWN
HIS SERVE.

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:57.383
AND WITH HIM GONE
YOU'RE WIDE OPEN!

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.252
AAH!
AIR HUMMINGBIRD,

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.920
ATTACK
BRRON DIRECTLY!

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.727
AND THANKS
TO ITS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:11.698
FOR EVERY CARD
IN YOUR HAND, I GAIN
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:14.267
OH! NOT BAD!

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.903
HMM. NOT BAD AT ALL.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:20.340
HA HA HA!
YOUR ANGER'S INTENSE.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.842
IT MAKES YOU
A POWERFUL DUELIST,

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.144
BUT YOU MUST SEARCH
DEEPER, JADEN,

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:30.049
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS--
THE TRAP CARD REVENGE SOUL!

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:32.352
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
HARD WORK WAS A WASTE!

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:35.021
'CAUSE THE MONSTER
YOU JUST DESTROYED

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.889
COMES RIGHT BACK!

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.958
HA HA HA!

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.127
HUH. I'M FINISHED.

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:44.230
IN MORE WAYS
THAN ONE!

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.033
'CAUSE I PLAY
THE DARK CORRIDOR!

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:51.070
AND NOW I GET TO TAKE
A DARK WORLD MONSTER
FROM MY DECK

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.674
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND
AS LONG AS I SEND ONE CARD

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.276
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.311
BUT THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:02.081
SINCE THE CARD I SENT
AWAY WAS CELRI,
MONK OF DARK WORLD,

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:04.384
IT'S SUMMONED
TO YOUR FIELD!

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:05.685
HA HA HA!

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.920
ONCE THERE,
ITS SECOND SPECIAL ABILITY

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.355
GETS ACTIVATED,

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.524
FORCING THE PERSON
OPPOSING IT TO SEND

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.926
ONE CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:17.730
WAIT, BUT YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT SUMMONED
CELRI TO MY HAND!

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.599
SO THEN THAT
MAKES YOU...

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.901
ITS OPPONENT!

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:26.205
SO I SEND A CARD
DIRECTLY INTO MY GRAVE!

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:29.375
AND OF COURSE I CHOSE
MY OVERLORD OF DARK WORLD,

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.477
THE MIGHTY REIGN-BEAUX.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.747
AND NOW ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.250
WHICH ENABLES HIM TO BE
SUMMONED DIRECTLY BACK

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.620
TO MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.021
AND THEN...

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.824
I CAN TRIGGER HIS
OTHER ABILITY,

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.027
SO ALL THE TRAP CARDS,
SPELLS, OR MONSTERS

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.830
THAT ARE ON YOUR FIELD
ARE DESTROYED!

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.831
SAY WHAT?!

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:55.802
I THINK I'LL DESTROY
ALL YOUR MONSTERS!

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.408
[GROANING]

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.078
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALL ALONE!

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:09.782
REIGN-BEAUX,
GIVE HIM SOME COMPANY!

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:14.187
UNH! AAH!

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.391
NOW I'LL FINISH
WITH A FACEDOWN,

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:21.060
AND YOU'RE ALL BUT
FINISHED AS WELL!

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:28.534
FACE IT, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOSE THIS DUEL!

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.703
HA HA HA!

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:34.040
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE GUTS TO MAKE A STAND!

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.108
HA HA!

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:37.343
THIS IS PATHETIC!

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.878
THINK AGAIN.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.213
MY FRIENDS...

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.714
MAY BE GONE,

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.517
BUT I PLAN ON
STAYING RIGHT HERE!

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.586
I USED TO DUEL
FOR FUN,

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:51.257
BUT NOW I'M DUELING
TO AVENGE WHAT YOU DID
TO MY BEST FRIENDS.

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:53.893
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.097
[GROWLING]

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:01.601
I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD
O-OVERSOUL,

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:05.438
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
NEOS FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:09.308
AND NEXT,
I'LL EQUIP HIM
WITH ASSAULT ARMOR,

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:12.245
WHICH GIVES MY NEOS
A THREE HUNDRED
POINT BOOST!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.913
NOW, NEOS...

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.982
LET'S TAKE
HIS REIGN-BEAUX
OUT FOR GOOD!

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:17.250
[GROWLING]

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.985
NOW FINISH HIM OFF!

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.689
ATTACK
WITH COSMIC CRUSH!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:28.961
STRIKE HIM DOWN!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.534
AAH!

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:37.637
HEY BRRON, YOU READY
FOR S'MORE NEOS?

00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:40.039
'CAUSE WHEN I REMOVE
ASSAULT ARMOR

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:43.075
HE GETS TO INFLICT
A SECOND DOSE OF DAMAGE!

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.378
SAY WHAT!?
YOU HEARD ME!

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:46.879
GO, NEOS!

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.381
HA HA HA!

00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:51.851
THAT'S IT, JADEN.
FEED INTO YOUR ANGER.

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:57.023
YOUR ACTIONS WILL ONLY
LEAD TO YOUR DEFEAT.

00:15:57.023 --> 00:16:00.760
I REVEAL THE SPELL CARD
CORRIDOR TO DARK WORLD!

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.697
WHICH BRINGS BACK
MY REIGN-BEAUX.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.599
YA NEVER LEARN.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.101
TAKE HIM DOWN AGAIN!

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.171
HYAH!

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.539
AAH!

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.374
AAH!

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.810
[THINKING]
LITTLE DOES HE KNOW
THAT I STILL HAVE

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.746
COBAL, EXCAVATOR
OF DARK WORLD!

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:23.449
WITH NEOS GONE,
JADEN IS WIDE OPEN!

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:28.120
ANGER HAS CLOUDED HIS MIND
AND BLINDED HIS EYES!

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.356
NOW COBAL'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:33.526
RETURNS CORRIDOR
TO DARK WORLD TO MY HAND,

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.595
RESURRECTING
MY REIGN-BEAUX,

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:38.130
OVERLORD OF DARK WORLD
ONCE AGA--

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.199
I ACTIVATE
MY SPELL...

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.668
BATTLE
OF SLEEPING SPIRITS!

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.904
NOW WE CAN BOTH
SUMMON A MONSTER...

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:47.173
THAT WAS
JUST DESTROYED!

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.910
YOU KNOW MINE,
AND I KNOW YOURS.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.480
SO, BRRON, AS LONG
AS YOU KEEP BRINGING
YOUR REIGN-BEAUX

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.084
BACK AROUND,
I'LL KEEP ON
TAKING IT DOWN

00:16:58.084 --> 00:16:59.519
OVER AND OVER!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.455
AND EVENTUALLY I'LL
HAVE MY REVENGE ON YOU.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.924
SO HURRY UP
AND RESURRECT IT.

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:07.226
I KNOW THIS WON'T
BRING MY FRIENDS BACK,

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:10.229
BUT WATCHING YOU SQUIRM
SURE MAKES ME FEEL BETTER!

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.864
LET'S DO THIS!

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.432
ERR. I CAN'T.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:17.036
SINCE I JUST USED
MY SPELL CARD CORRIDOR,

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.539
I CAN'T SUMMON
ON THIS TURN.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.474
THEN I'M AFRAID
THIS...

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.242
IS GOOD-BYE!

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.747
AVENGE MY FRIENDS!

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:29.415
SEND HIM
TO THE STARS!

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.451
HA HA HA! AAH!

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.427
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:45.898
YOU MAY HAVE WON,
BUT THINK ABOUT
ALL THAT YOU'VE LOST.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.936
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR IT BUT
ANGER AND PAIN!

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:52.305
THEY WILL BE YOUR
NEW FRIENDS.

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.640
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
YOU LOST!

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.310
NOW TELL ME WHAT
YOU DID WITH JESSE!

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.378
YOU WON'T LIKE
WHAT YOU HEAR.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.047
TELL ME!

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.982
HE'S UP THERE
IN THE STARS

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:04.817
WITH YOUR FOUR FRIENDS!

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.987
YOU'LL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN!

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:10.856
LIAR!
TELL THE TRUTH!

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:13.859
NO MORE PLAYING!

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:18.798
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:20.099
CAN THIS REALLY BE?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.500
NO WAY.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.668
MASTER BRRON IS GONE!

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.103
I'M LEAVING!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.009
Syrus: JADEN.

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.078
SYRUS?!

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:35.414
I WAS AFRAID
THAT THEY--OH, MAN.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.384
I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:40.052
YOU SURE?

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.555
BECAUSE, I JUST
DON'T THINK YOU
CARE AT ALL.

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:44.824
YOU'VE CHANGED,
JADEN.

00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:47.093
HUH?

00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:49.729
IT'S YOUR FAULT
THAT OUR FRIENDS
HAVE VANISHED.

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.897
YOU LED US HERE!

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.500
JUST SO YOU COULD
FEEL BETTER, J.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.602
BECAUSE OF JESSE,
RIGHT?!

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.637
WELL, HE'S GONE!

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.573
JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE!

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:02.842
SYRUS! COME BACK!

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.478
AXEL, WAIT!

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:09.615
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ON YOUR OWN.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.919
MY OWN?

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:16.255
WHY'S THIS
HAPPENING TO ME?!

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:19.025
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:23.963
AND I--I ENDED UP MAKING
THINGS WRONG FOR EVERYONE.

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:25.164
WHY?!

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.833
WHY DID THIS ALL HAPPEN?!

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.201
AAH!

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.837
HOW AM I EVER GOING TO
MAKE THINGS RIGHT AGAIN?!

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:38.177
IS THAT THE--THE CARD?

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.311
IT IS.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:41.180
IT'S THE SUPER
POLYMERIZATION CARD

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.349
THAT BRRON WAS
TRYING TO SUMMON.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.551
HOW COULD HE TAKE
MY FRIENDS AWAY FROM ME,

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.987
ALL FOR A CARD?

00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:52.191
AND NOW MY BEST FRIEND
WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ANYMORE.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.061
Man: JADEN...
HUH?

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:57.897
I WANT YOU TO BE WHO
YOU WERE MEANT TO BE--

00:19:57.897 --> 00:19:59.865
A GREAT WARRIOR.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:03.869
BUT FOR THAT,
YOU NEED POWER.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.806
POWER? BUT HOW DO I
GET THAT?

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:10.743
THAT CARD.
SUPER POLYMERIZATION.

00:20:10.743 --> 00:20:14.880
TO UNLOCK ITS SECRETS,
DEFEAT THOSE WHO OPPOSE YOU

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.117
AND ABSORB THE DUEL ENERGY
THAT'S RELEASED.

00:20:18.117 --> 00:20:20.586
HOLD ON.
JUST WHO ARE YOU?!

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.856
THE ONE WHO RULES
THIS WORLD...

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:26.726
THE SUPREME KING!

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.729
