WEBVTT

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.039
HUH?
HUH?

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.642
Jesse: WELCOME.
HUH.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.344
YUBEL!

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.979
JADEN, LOOKS LIKE
YOU MADE IT.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.715
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.917
HEY,
WHAT'S THAT?

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.285
Crowler:
A DUEL DISK.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.754
THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND
BY ITS FORMER OWNER.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.490
HE WON'T BE DOING ANY DUELING
WHERE HE IS NOW.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.791
WANNA SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.496
HUH?

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.098
AAH!

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.232
ADRIAN!

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.034
AAH!

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.869
HUH? OHH...

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.341
I'M SORRY!

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.947
THAT WAS CREEPY.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.850
SO...
DID YUBEL
DO THAT?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.186
I SURE DID. HA HA HA!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.522

HA HA HA!

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.054
YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACE.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.724
YOU'RE MAD,
AND YOU'RE SCARED,
AND IT'S GREAT.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.659
YOU'RE THINKING OF ALL
THE LITTLE FRIENDS YOU'VE LOST

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.761
IN THIS DIMENSION,
AND IT ANGERS YOU,

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.530
BUT YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL 'CAUSE
THE LAST TIME YOU GOT UPSET,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.700
YOU TURNED INTO
AN EVIL, POWER-HUNGRY MANIAC.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.669
KINDA LIKE ME.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.537
GO AHEAD. GET ANGRY.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.973
ADRIAN GOT ANGRY,
AND YOU SAW WHAT I DID TO HIM.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.441
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME!

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.677
GOT THAT?

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.680
YOUR DAYS OF SENDING
PEOPLE TO THE STARS
ARE OVER, YUBEL.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.748
YA HEAR ME?

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.383
THIS IS BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:32.285
SO LEAVE JESSE
OUT OF THIS AND DUEL ME
IN YOUR TRUE FORM.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.155
LEAVE JESSE
OUT OF THIS?
HA HA HA!

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.857
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:39.860
WITH THIS BODY,
I GET TO FORCE YOU
TO FIGHT YOUR FRIEND.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.194
NO, YOU DON'T.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.630
I COULD JUST DROP
MY DUEL DISK AND
WALK AWAY FROM THIS.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.998
AND WHERE
WOULD YOU GO?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.368
THE ONLY WAY
OUT OF THIS DIMENSION
IS THROUGH ME, JADEN.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.038
HMM.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.975
SHALL WE?

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.544
Syrus: HOLD ON.
YOU SURE YOU'RE READY?

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.212
AND WHAT ABOUT
POOR JESSE?

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.149
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO START
PUMMELING AWAY AT THE LAD?

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.685
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
HE'S BEEN TAKEN OVER.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.120
COME ON. WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.856
YOU LOVE DUELING, JADEN.
YOU LIVE FOR IT.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.425
IF YOU'RE TOO SCARED
TO DUEL,

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.593
THEN YOU MUST BE
TOO SCARED TO LIVE.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.829
HUH. HAH.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.231
JADEN!
DON'T DO IT.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.702
Jaden: [THINKING]
SOONER OR LATER, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SETTLE THE SCORE WITH YUBEL.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.438
I DON'T WANNA HURT JESSE, BUT
IF I DON'T PUT AN END TO THIS,

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.740
WHO KNOWS WHO ELSE'LL GET HURT?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.043
BESIDES, MAYBE I CAN SAVE JESSE.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.378
WHEN I WAS THE SUPREME KING,

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.681
JIM FOUGHT HIS HEART OUT TRYING
TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO ME.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:38.251
HE DUELED TO THE END, TRYING TO
SAVE ME FROM MY OWN FEELINGS.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.520
THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOTTA DO
FOR JESSE.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.923
I'VE GOTTA FIND
A WAY INTO HIS MIND

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:46.159
AND GET HIM TO KICK YUBEL OUT.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.995
STILL, THEY HAD HELP
FROM THE EYE OF ORACHALCUM,

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.199
AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
AS POWERFUL AS THAT.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.001
WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO DO IT?

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.636
ADRIAN RISKED HIS LIFE, TOO,

00:03:56.636 --> 00:04:00.607
BUT HE WASN'T ABLE TO BREAK
YUBEL, EVEN WITH EXODIA.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.442
WHAT IF I DO THIS
AND I'M NOT READY?

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.846
YUBEL WILL DEFEAT ME,
AND THEN ALL MY FRIENDS
WILL BE TRAPPED FOREVER,

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.614
AND YUBEL WILL
TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE,

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:10.283
AND IT'LL ALL BE BECAUSE
I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH, AND--

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.854
Neos: JADEN...

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.123
HUH, IS THAT YOU, NEOS?

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.058
HUH? AQUA DOLPHIN,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.594
FLAME WINGMAN,
GRAND MOLE.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.997
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.398
ARE WE HAVING
A PARTY?

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.068
YES, AND YOU'RE
THE GUEST OF HONOR, JADEN.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:31.004
WE'RE GATHERED HERE
TO GIVE YOU
A PEP TALK, JADEN.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.373
YOU CAN'T GO INTO THIS
DUEL DOUBTING YOURSELF.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.876
IF YOU DO,
YUBEL WILL OWN YOU.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.045
Aqua Dolphin:
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T DOUBT
YOUR OWN SPIRIT, JADEN.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.715
AFTER ALL, IT'S THAT
UNYIELDING SPIRIT OF YOURS

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.317
THAT ENABLED
YOU TO SAVE NEO SPACE.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.953
SURE, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MAGICAL ARTIFACT
TO HELP YOU OUT,

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.157
BUT YOU'VE GOT US,
AND YOU'VE GOT YOU.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:53.393
YOUR GREATEST POWER
IS YOUR ABILITY
TO SEE THE BEST IN PEOPLE.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.428
YOUR BEST WEAPON
IS YOUR BELIEF

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.230
THAT NO ONE
IS BEYOND SAVING.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.499
YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT,
OR ALL WILL BE LOST.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.737
NO ONE
IS BEYOND SAVING.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.940
I KNOW THAT JESSE
AND HIS CRYSTAL
BEASTS CAN BE SAVED.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.977
I HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE DARKNESS
CAN BE BROKEN.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.280
I GET IT NOW.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.249
THIS WHOLE THING--
THE INTERDIMENSIONAL
FUNHOUSE,

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.952
THESE MIND GAMES,
USING MY FRIENDS
AS BAIT--

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:21.688
IT'S ALL PART
OF YUBEL'S GAME.

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.023
YUBEL HAS BEEN
TRYING TO WEAKEN ME

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:25.692
BY MAKING ME
DOUBT MYSELF.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.797
Crowler: JADEN!
DON'T DO THIS, MY BOY.

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:35.802
STAY BACK!

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:36.937
HOLD THIS.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:43.043
IF YOU WANT A DUEL,
THEN YOU'VE GOT ONE.

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:45.178
HA HA!
I HOPED YOU'D SAY THAT.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.215
YOUR TIME IS UP, YUBEL.
YOUR GAMES END HERE.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.749
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.156
HEH HEH.
SOMEONE'S FEELING BETTER.

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:58.959
HEY, FELLAS, THANKS
FOR THE PEP TALK.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.594
TALKING
TO YOUR CARDS?

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:03.797
WE USED TO BE THAT CLOSE,
BUT THEN YOU BETRAYED ME...

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:06.299
SO NOW YOU'LL
FEEL THE PAIN
YOU PUT ME THROUGH.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.069
LET'S DO THIS.

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.907
YOU'LL RISK EVERYTHING
TO SAVE YOUR FRIEND,

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.877
BUT CAN YOU HELP HIM
BEFORE YOU DESTROY HIM?

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.845
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.314
LET'S GET STARTED.
MY MOVE.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.118
[THINKING]
I'VE COME ALL THIS WAY,

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:28.822
AND NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES,
I HAVE TO SAVE MY FRIEND.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.628
THEY'VE STARTED
THEIR DUEL.

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.663
IF JADEN LETS YUBEL
GET IN HIS HEAD,

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.765
THERE'S NO WAY
HE CAN WIN THIS.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.567
I DON'T THINK
I CAN WATCH.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.036
THIS IS IT, JADEN.
I DRAW.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.641
I ACTIVATE THE ADVANCED
DARK FIELD SPELL.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:49.142
NOT THAT ONE!

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:52.379
ISN'T THAT
THE SAME FIELD SPELL HE USED
TO DEFEAT YOUR BROTHER?

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.515
HOW DOES IT WORK AGAIN?

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.117
UHH!

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.786
IF JESSE SENDS
A CRYSTAL BEAST FROM HIS
DECK TO HIS GRAVEYARD,

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.855
THE FIELD SPELL
WILL ACT AS A SHIELD

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:04.090
AND PROTECT HIM
FROM ALL BATTLE DAMAGE.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.628
NOW LET'S GET
TO MY BEASTS.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:12.599
FIRST, I PLAY ADVANCED
CRYSTAL BEAST COBALT EAGLE.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.204
THAT'S IT FOR NOW.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:21.274
THEN IT'S MY TURN.
I DRAW.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.475
[GASPS]

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:23.977
POLYMERIZATION.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:27.047
THIS IS THE CARD I USED
FOR EVIL WHEN I WAS
THE SUPREME KING,

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:29.950
I CAN'T USE THIS.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.418
WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:34.154
WHY IS HE JUST STANDING THERE?
HE MUST DO SOMETHING.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:38.725
UH-OH. IF THAT CARD'S
WHAT I THINK IT IS,
JADEN'S IN TROUBLE.

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:42.329
HMM, WHY THE HESITATION?
SOMETHING WRONG?

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.665
[THINKING] I DON'T KNOW
IF I HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO USE THIS CARD.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:48.101
IF ONLY I HAD THE GUTS
THAT ZANE HAD...

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.538
I MEAN, HE RISKED EVERYTHING
TO HAVE ONE GREAT DUEL.

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:53.707
HE DIDN'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK,

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:57.277
EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THAT GIVING
HIS ALL MIGHT DESTROY HIM.

00:07:57.277 --> 00:08:01.548
I HAVE TO BE THAT BRAVE, TOO.
I CAN'T BE SCARED ANYMORE.

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:06.219
HERE GOES. I ACTIVATE
POLYMERIZATION.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.354
HE DID IT?

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:09.222
I FUSE
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.858
AND ELEMENTAL HERO
BURSTINATRIX.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.026
HUH!

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:22.402
[THINKING] MY POOR FRIENDS.
I CAN'T DO THIS, NOT AGAIN.

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:25.005
NO. I WON'T BACK DOWN.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:29.376
I WON'T BLAME MYSELF
BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY FAULT

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:32.879
AND I STILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.314
HERE WE GO.

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:38.318
I SUMMON TO THE FIELD
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.254
HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:42.989
LOOKS LIKE JADEN'S
NOT SCARED ANYMORE.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.958
I HOPE HE
STILL REMEMBERS
HOW TO DUEL

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.361
'CAUSE IF HE DOES,
THEN WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET TO GO HOME.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.032
HMM...

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:54.968
WELL DONE, J.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.536
TO THINK, HERE AT
THE END OF THE ROAD,

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.772
YOU FIND YOUR
INNER STRENGTH AGAIN.

00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:00.974
HMM.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.675
JADEN, COMBINE
THAT INNER STRENGTH

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:06.179
WITH FLAME WINGMAN'S POWER
AND FIND JESSE'S SPIRIT.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.280
WHADDYA MEAN?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.449
BY DISTRACTING YUBEL
WITH WINGMAN'S ATTACK,

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.684
YOU WILL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO ENTER JESSE'S MIND.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.587
ONCE THERE, YOU CAN SEARCH
FOR YOUR FRIEND'S SPIRIT.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.990
HOPEFULLY BY RE-CONNECTING
WITH YOUR FRIEND,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.959
THE EVIL CONTROLLING HIM
WILL BE EXPELLED.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.795
I'M ON IT.
WISH ME LUCK.

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:22.996
WHY THE DELAY?

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.865
YOU'RE NOT STILL
AFRAID, ARE YOU?

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.700
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO, YUBEL.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.403
FLAME WINGMAN,
ATTACK COBALT EAGLE.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:35.708
AH.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.110
YOU'RE ATTACKING ME?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.779
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE EFFECT OF
THE ADVANCED DARK FIELD SPELL?

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:42.015
I'LL JUST SEND AN ADVANCED
CRYSTAL BEAST TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.983
AND THEN THAT'LL BE THAT.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.520
READY?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.191
HERE WE GO.
NOW ATTACK HIM, WINGMAN.

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.392
HUH?

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:56.796
HUH? OH...

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.665
JESSE!

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:04.270
RRGH! HUH?

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.541
JESSE, IT'S JADEN.

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:11.211
THE REAL YOU IS IN HERE
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.979
HELLO?

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.682
MAN, NOBODY'S HOME.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:17.317
I DON'T KNOW HOW
IT'S HAPPENED,

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.119
BUT IT SEEMS YUBEL
HAS TRANSFERRED

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.588
JESSE'S SPIRIT
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:24.157
OH. WELL, THEN
WHERE IS IT?

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.626
RRGH!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.497
[THINKING] IF JESSE'S
SPIRIT'S NOT IN HIS OWN
BODY, WHERE COULD IT BE?

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.132
OH...

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.436
COULD HE BE TRAPPED
IN HIS DECK?

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.972
HA HA HA!
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.540
YOU'RE DWELLING
ON YOUR FRIEND,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.443
AND YOU'RE DOING SO
AT THE EXPENSE
OF YOUR DUELING SKILLS.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:46.479
YOU SEE, YOU JUST
WASTED A TURN WITH
A USELESS ATTACK.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.081
IT DIDN'T DAMAGE ME,

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:50.049
AND NOW WITH
MY MONSTER'S ABILITY,

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:53.686
I CAN PLACE COBALT EAGLE IN
MY SPELL AND TRAP CARD ZONE.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:54.921
IF YOU WANT
TO SURVIVE THIS,

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.123
YOU SHOULD FORGET
ABOUT SAVING YOUR FRIEND.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.925
THIS IS AWFUL.

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:00.927
IF HE FIGHTS,
JADEN RUNS THE RISK

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:02.695
OF DESTROYING JESSE
FOR GOOD.

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:06.132
THEN AGAIN, IF HE FOCUSES
TOO MUCH ON SAVING JESSE,

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.002
HE MAY SLIP UP
AND LOSE THE DUEL.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.503
OH...

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.176
OH...

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.145
RAINBOW DARK DRAGON,
COULD YOU BE THE KEY?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.320
HEH HEH.

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:32.625
[THINKING] SOMEHOW
JESSE'S SPIRIT

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.662
IS TRAPPED IN
THE RAINBOW DARK DRAGON
CARD.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:38.398
I JUST KNOW IT.
I CAN FEEL IT.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.267
NOW I JUST GOT FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.971
I'M PLACING
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.639
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.708
[THINKING] JUST HANG ON
A LITTLE LONGER, JESSE.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.411
I'M GONNA FREE YOUR
SPIRIT FROM THAT CARD.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.113
HA HA HA! DO YOU ENJOY
HURTING YOUR FRIENDS?

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:57.350
YOU MUST BECAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.718
WAS I THE FIRST?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.553
DID I REALLY DESERVE
TO SUFFER?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:04.257
WHY IS IT YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
TOSSING ME ASIDE?

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.261
WHY AREN'T YOU
SAYING ANYTHING?

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:11.264
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME FLIP
AND SARCASTIC RESPONSE?

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.335
DID I HIT A NERVE?

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.604
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO BE SO TIGHT-LIPPED.

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:18.838
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:21.140
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
TOO AFRAID OF THE TRUTH.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.442
HMM...

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.112
WE'LL SEE.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:29.882
I SUMMON
ADVANCED CRYSTAL BEAST
SAPPHIRE PEGASUS...

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.753
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.556
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
A CRYSTAL FROM MY DECK.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:41.394
I CHOOSE TO CALL OUT
MY ADVANCED CRYSTAL BEAST
RUBY CARBUNCLE,

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:43.296
AND NOW WITH RUBY'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:45.031
I'M ABLE TO RELEASE
ALL THE CRYSTALS

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.367
IN MY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD ZONE.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:51.170
COME FORTH,
ADVANCED CRYSTAL BEASTS
RUBY CARBUNCLE...

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.675
AND COBALT EAGLE.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.481
WITH THAT DONE, I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CRYSTAL RELEASE

00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.650
AND EQUIP IT TO PEGASUS,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.586
GIVING HIM 800 MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:08.421
NO.
NOW THEN...

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:11.891
SAPPHIRE PEGASUS,
TAKE DOWN HIS WINGMAN.

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.527
GO, SAPPHIRE DARK HORN.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:19.766
AAH! AAH!

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:23.102
WITH WINGMAN GONE,
COBALT EAGLE ATTACKS YOU.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:25.104
GO, COBALT DARK WING.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:30.476
AAH! AAH!

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.146
YOU HAD ENOUGH,
OR CAN YOU TAKE SOME MORE?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.982
'CAUSE CARBUNCLE'S GOT SOME
RUBY DARK FLASH FOR YA.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:41.454
UH! UH!

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:43.323
UH... MM...

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:46.025
MUST FEEL WEIRD TO BE HURT
BY SOMEONE YOU THOUGHT
WAS YOUR FRIEND.

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.994
WELL, NOW YOU CAN SHARE
IN THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.296
THAT YOU PUT ME THROUGH
ALL THESE YEARS.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:53.366
JADEN, I WANT YOU TO HURT
LIKE I HURT.

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.934
WELL, IF THAT'S
HOW I SAVE JESSE,

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:57.870
THEN BY ALL MEANS,
YUBEL, BRING IT.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.172
OK, THEN.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.474
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU REALLY
WANT TO EXPERIENCE, JADEN,

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:02.809
SO BE IT.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.544
WHAT'S JADEN
AGREEING TO?

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:06.579
IT SEEMS, JADEN IS GOING
TO RISK EVERYTHING

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.915
IN ORDER TO FREE JESSE
FROM YUBEL'S GRIP.

00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:10.249
AND YOU BETTER
BELIEVE YUBEL

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.185
WILL DO EVERYTHING
NOT TO LET GO OF HIM.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.958
I'M GONNA
SAVE YOU, JESSE.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.994
IT'S MY MOVE.
I DRAW.

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:24.364
SWEET. THERE WE GO.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.433
NOW I SUMMON NEO-SPACIAN
GRAND MOLE.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.840
NEXT, I REVEAL
MY TRAP CARD--
COMMON SACRIFICE,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.342
AND THANKS TO THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE 3 MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.712
THE EFFECT OF THIS TRAP
NOW GETS ACTIVATED...

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.880
HUH?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.383
SO NOW THE TWO WEAKEST
MONSTERS ON YOUR FIELD

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:46.419
BOTH GET SENT TO
YOUR GRAVEYARD,

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.389
AND THEN I CAN PLAY A
LEVEL 7 OR ABOVE MONSTER

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.923
STRAIGHT FROM MY HAND,

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.060
SO I'M SUMMONING
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:02.802
NOW, GRAND MOLE, ATTACK
HIS SAPPHIRE PEGASUS.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.842
RRGH!

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:13.045
NOW GRAND MOLE'S SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.681
'CAUSE OF THAT,
NEITHER ONE OF US
TAKES ANY DAMAGE,

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:19.318
BUT BOTH OUR MONSTERS
ARE RETURNED
TO OUR HANDS.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.590
WELL, SINCE MY PEGASUS
WAS KNOCKED FROM THE FIELD,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.428
I'LL SEND THE CRYSTAL RELEASE
EQUIP SPELL TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.196
WHICH LETS ME TAKE A CRYSTAL
FROM MY DECK

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.399
AND PLACE IT IN MY
SPELL AND TRAP CARD ZONE,

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:36.602
AND I CHOOSE ADVANCED
CRYSTAL BEAST AMBER MAMMOTH.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.738
HMM?
YOU READY, NEOS?

00:15:38.738 --> 00:15:41.541
LET'S GO. HUH?

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:46.579
OH, JESSE, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOUR OLD SELF AGAIN.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.915
Neos: IT'S A TRICK,
JADEN.
HUH? YEAH?

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:51.884
YUBEL KNOWS THAT
IF YOU'RE TOO CONCERNED
ABOUT HURTING JESSE,

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.753
YOU WON'T ATTACK
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT,

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:55.988
BUT IN ORDER TO SAVE JESSE
AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS,

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.991
YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:01.627
DON'T LET YUBEL'S
HEAD GAMES STOP YOU.

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:10.336
THANKS, NEOS.
I WON'T. HERE GOES.

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:13.573
NEOS, ATTACK YUBEL
DIRECTLY.

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:15.675
GO, WRATH OF NEOS.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.979
AAH!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.113
WHAT?
HUH?

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:27.019
HA HA HA!

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.488
HA HA HA!

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.423
YOU THINK THAT BY CHIPPING AWAY
AT MY LIFE POINTS,

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:31.824
YOU'RE ACTUALLY HURTING ME.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.925
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:35.361
YOU'RE ONLY
STRENGTHENING MY WILL.

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:39.499
WITH EVERY BLOW YOU DEAL ME,
YOU KEEP REMINDING ME
OF THE PAIN,

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.635
THE PAIN I HAVE CARRIED
IN MY HEART FOR YEARS,

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:43.903
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:46.739
YOU CHOSE TO CAST ME ASIDE
RATHER THAN FIGHT FOR ME.

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:50.843
YOU MADE ME, AND NOW YOU
FIGHT TO DESTROY ME?

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.779
AND SAVE MY FRIEND.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.548
I END MY TURN.

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:58.651
IN THAT CASE,
I'M DRAWING.

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:00.653
HMM.

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:02.188
JADEN, FOR THIS TURN,

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.724
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE,

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:08.261
AND WITH IT, YOU'RE GOING TO
SUFFER AN INCREDIBLE DEFEAT.

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:17.136
COME OUT,
ADVANCED CRYSTAL BEAST

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:18.971
SAPPHIRE PEGASUS.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.244
AND THANKS TO ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.580
I TAKE ADVANCED
CRYSTAL BEAST AMETHYST CAT

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.484
AND PLACE IT OVER HERE,
LIKE SO.

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:34.020
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
CRYSTAL BEACON.

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:37.423
WITH THE POWER
OF THIS SPELL CARD,

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.526
I NOW GET TO SUMMON UP
YET ANOTHER CRYSTAL BEAST,

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.529
SO I'LL CALL OUT
ADVANCED TOPAZ TIGER.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.638
HEH HEH HEH.

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.473
I'VE GOT 3 BEASTS
IN MY GRAVE

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:57.209
AND 4 BEASTS
OUT ON MY FIELD.

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.412
THEN THERE'S THIS--
THE ULTIMATE BEAST.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.514
I CAN ONLY SUMMON IT
WHEN THERE'S A TOTAL

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:04.650
OF 7 ADVANCED BEASTS ON
MY FIELD AND IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.653
THANKS TO YOU,
I'VE GOT THOSE 7.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.925
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.161
GET READY TO COWER.

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:19.131
RISE, MY MIGHTY BEAST
RAINBOW DARK DRAGON.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.071
AAH!

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.343
[THINKING]
OK. THERE IT IS.

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:32.578
I JUST HOPE MY HUNCH
IS CORRECT.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:34.313
HOPEFULLY,
JESSE'S SPIRIT
HAS BEEN LOCKED AWAY

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:37.450
AND TRAPPED
IN THAT DARK DRAGON.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.653
NOW I JUST HAVE TO
GET THROUGH TO HIM.

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:43.489
HEY, JESSE. JESSE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.458
SAY SOMETHING,
BUDDY.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.926
JESSE!

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:48.961
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.096
NOW GET READY.

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:52.965
RAINBOW DARK DRAGON,
ATTACK NEOS

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.434
WITH DARK RAINBOW
REFRACTION.

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.973
AAH! AAH! UH!

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:07.313
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.781
OH...
OH...

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.021
UH... UH...

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.690
OH...
IS HE OK?
GET UP, J.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.992
UH... URGH...

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:28.501
Jesse: JADEN...
HUH?

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.137
JADEN, HELP ME.

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:37.943
JESSE...
UH... RGH...

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.980
YOU ARE IN THERE.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.515
HE CAN BARELY
STAND.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.949
OH, THIS
ISN'T GOOD.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.218
YUBEL HAS
TWO MORE CRYSTAL BEASTS
ON HIS FIELD,

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.888
AND BOTH OF THEM CAN
STILL ATTACK NEXT TURN.

00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:52.858
AND JADEN'S ONLY GOT
300 LIFE POINTS TO HIS NAME.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:55.361
IF ONE OF THEIR ATTACKS
SUCCEEDS, IT'S OVER.

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.996
JESSE, LISTEN UP.

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.699
HANG ON AS LONG
AS YOU CAN.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.736
I'M GONNA SAVE YOU
