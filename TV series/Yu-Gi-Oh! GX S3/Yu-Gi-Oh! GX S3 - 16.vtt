I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S
NEXT, HASSLEBERRY!

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.355
FIRST WE SEARCH THE SCHOOL
FOR MORE STUDENTS,

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.823
THEN WE GATHER
EVERYONE TOGETHER

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.892
AND START COLLECTING
INFORMATION!

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.961

OURSELVES A PLAN!

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.229
NOW WAS THAT
SO HARD?!

UH...

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:13.500
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE USE
THE GYM AS HEADQUARTERS?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.535
Crowler: EXCUSE ME,
BUT WE'RE THE ADULTS,

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:17.237
SO WE'LL CALL THE SHOTS.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.672
NOW LET'S SEARCH
THE SCHOOL FOR STUDENTS

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:20.573

IN THE GYMNASIUM.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.908

Jesse: OKAY, EVERYONE,
NOW LET'S SPLIT UP,

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.814
BUT REMEMBER,
WHEREVER WE ARE,
WE'RE NOT HOME!

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.316

JADEN...DO YOU
REMEMBER YOUR MATCH

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.308
WITH PROFESSOR EISENSTEIN?

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.778
DURING THAT DUEL,
I TRULY BEGAN TO
APPRECIATE HIS BRILLIANCE.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.414
I REALIZED IF I DEDICATED
MYSELF TO HIS TEACHINGS,

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.983
THE KNOWLEDGE I COULD LEARN
WOULD BE LIMITLESS.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:14.420
I THEN FOUND MYSELF
WORKING WITH HIM ON HIS
"UNIFIED DUEL THEORY."

Jaden: WHAT'S THAT?

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:17.623
IT'S THE IDEA THAT'S BASED
ON THE PRESUMPTION

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:20.326
THAT THERE EXISTS
12 DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS.

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:23.363
AND ONE OF THEM HAS A WORLD
WHERE DUEL SPIRITS LIVE!

AS WE EXPLORED WAYS TO
TRAVEL TO THIS DIMENSION,

SOMETHING WENT
TERRIBLY WRONG.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.235

WE HAD PIERCED

FORCE OF COSMIC ENERGY.

THE ENTIRE LAB WAS CONSUMED
BY A POWERFUL LIGHT.

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:39.379
WHEN I REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:43.616
I FOUND MYSELF
IN A SANDY NO MAN'S LAND.

IN THIS DESOLATE WORLD?

EISEN-STEIN WAS
TALKING ABOUT?

TO LIFE OUT THERE.
