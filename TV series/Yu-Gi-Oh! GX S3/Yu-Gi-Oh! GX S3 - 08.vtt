00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.904
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.540
Adrian: REQUESTING ACCESS
TO BIOBAND RESEARCH.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.942
IT'S SOME KIND OF
AN ENERGY VACUUM.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.312
IF IT'S MAXED-OUT,
IT CAN BE DEADLY!

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.948
THANKS FOR SHOWING UP TO
MY FIRST EVER "DUEL

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.717

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.784
ALRIGHT.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.087
IT'S TIME TO DUEL FOR JEWELS.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.490
Students: GAME ON!

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.929
NOW IF VIPER PUTS ME AT RISK,
HE PUTS THE WHOLE

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.398
SCHOOL AT RISK!

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.434
OH NO!

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.137
WITH MY SYSTEM SET TO MAXIMUM,
I'LL WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.339
STUDENT BODY!

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.408
NOW...WHO TO DUEL.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.812
Chazz: I CAN
MAKE THAT DECISION
REAL EASY FOR YOU GECKO!

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.581

CHECK OUT ADRIAN.
HE'S LOSING BIG-TIME.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.561
TRUE...ALTHOUGH...HE
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.496
LOSING HIS COOL.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.933
AS OPPOSED TO CHAZZ
WHO NEVER HAD HIS COOL
TO BEGIN WITH!

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.071
HUH?

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.607
WHATTA YOU SEE WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE CLOUDS CHAZZ?

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.776
TO SOME...CLOUDS ARE
JUST PARTICLES OF MOISTURE

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.244
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.345
BORING!

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.813
WELL NOT TO ME.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.416
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT A
CLOUD...I SEE THE WORLD'S MOST

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:32.352
POWERFUL FORCE!

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.455
AND WHEN I LOOK AT YOU I SEE
THE WORLD'S RICHEST DORK.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.624
NOW WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR
CHECKBOOK...AND GO

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.593
BUY A LIFE!

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:40.727
TALK IS CHEAP.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.330
LIKE YOU!

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.434
NOW WATCH...AS I SACRIFICE
MY FOUR SHEEP CLOUD TOKENS!

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:49.970
TO BRING OUT...
MY NIMBUSMAN!

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.341
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE MY CLOUD
FACTOIDS

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.043
SO HERE'S
ONE FOR YA!

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.945
CUMULONIMBUS CLOUDS
LIKE THIS ONE HERE...

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.182
FORM NEAR THE OCEAN
AND USUALLY CAUSE
REALLY BAD STORMS.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.483
CHAZZ WAS RIGHT.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.152
YEAH HE IS A DORK.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.254
NOW FOR EACH CARD
I SACRIFICED...

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:11.124
NIMBUSMAN GETS TO
ABSORB 500 EXTRA POINTS!

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.564
SCARED YET? JUST WAIT.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:18.999
'CAUSE HERE'S ANOTHER TIDBIT.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.068
AND IT INVOLVES YOUR MONSTERS.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.638
SEE EVERY ATTACK POINT MY
NIMBUSMAN JUST ABSORBED....

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.873
YOUR MONSTER LOSES!

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.008
UH!

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.310
LIGHTNING POWER DRAIN!

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.620
NIMBUSMAN...
ATTACK HIS CATAPULT!

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:44.858
ACTIVATE TRAP!

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:47.194
IT'S CALLED HYPER COAT
AND HERE'S A LITTLE

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:48.962
TIDBIT FOR YOU!

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.665
MY MONSTER'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE!

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.935
BECAUSE HYPER COAT
REVERSES ALL OF YOUR
MONSTERS EFFECTS!

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.471
PLUS IT GIVES MY
CATAPULT A BOOST!

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.839
NOT LIKE HE NEEDS IT,
THOUGH.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.411
STORM'S OVER,
MARSHMALLOW MAN!

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.686
TAKE THIS!

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.122
YOU BIG CUMULO-NINKINPOOP!

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.426
BULLSEYE!

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.996
NO WAY!

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.699
SOMEONE NEEDS A
LESSON IN CLIMATOLOGY.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.335
SOME FORCES OF NATURE
JUST CAN'T BE STOPPED.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.170
FACE IT, CHAZZ.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.672
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO MAN
AGAINST THE NATURAL WORLD,

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.008
MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS WINS.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.209
OH YEAH?

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.245
WELL YOUR LIFE POINTS
WEREN'T SO LUCKY.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:45.318
I'LL THROW DOWN THESE THREE
FACEDOWNS AND KICK BACK.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:49.189
I EXPECTED MORE FROM
A SPOILED RICH KID.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.690
I'M SERIOUS!

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.527
WHILE YOU WERE LYING
ON YOUR BUTT STARING
AT CLOUDS...

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:55.428
MY BUTT WAS WORKING!

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.631
AND SO WAS THE
REST OF MY BODY!

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.467
JUST ADMIT IT!

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.235
YOU HAD EVERYTHING
HANDED TO YOU!

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.104
WELL I EARNED MY DECK!

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:07.040
AND I'M GONNA USE IT
TO SEND YOUR LITTLE
COTTON-CANDY MAN

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.575
BACK TO THE CARNIVAL!

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.745
I CAN'T DESTROY IT,
BUT I CAN REMOVE IT
FROM PLAY!

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:14.381
Jaden: CHAZZ IS GETTIN'
PRETTY WORKED-UP OUT THERE.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.749
Syrus: CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.351
HE FOUND SOMEONE WHO'S
MORE SPOILED THAN HE IS!

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.021
AND HE CAN'T STAND IT.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.355
HE NEEDS TO CHILL!

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.657
AT LEAST HE'S WINNING!

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.625
FOR NOW.
BUT JUST WAIT.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.727
YOU THINK ADRIAN
CAN ACTUALLY WIN?

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.730
HOW CAN HE DO THAT
WITH A DECK FULL OF
WIMPY CLOUD-PEOPLE?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.099
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
AS WIMPY AS THEY LOOK.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.434
YEAH, SY.

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.602
YOU AUGHTTA KNOW
THAT

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:37.704
BETTER THAN ANYONE,
WOULDN'T YA SAY!?

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:40.173
READY GEEK?

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.075
TIME...TO GET CHAZZED!

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.543
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.712
BEFORE YOU "CHAZZ"
ME...WATCH THIS!

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.314
I REVEAL TWO
OF MY FACE-DOWNS!

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.348
BUT HOW!?

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.250
EASY.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.552
I JUST CALL OUT THEIR NAMES
DRAMATICALLY AND THEY POP UP.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:54.688
HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED THIS GAME
BEFORE 'CAUSE IT'S A PRETTY

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.056
COMMON OCCURRENCE.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.258
WATCH.
GO RAIN STORM!

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.560
AND THEN NATURAL DISASTER!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.429
AM I S'POSTA BE SCARED?

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.064
WELL YOU SHOULD BE.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.700
'CAUSE THANKS TO MY RAIN
STORM, I CAN DESTROY ANY CARD

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.268
ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:09.569
Adrian: ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.404
IS TAKE ONE OF
MY CLOUDIAN MONSTERS

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.707
AND LOWER ITS ATTACK
POINTS BY A THOUSAND.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.475
SO GET READY NIMBUSMAN!

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.611
IT'S TIME TO RAIN
ON HIS PARADE!

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.185
AND YOU NEVER WANNA GET
STUCK IN A RAINSTORM

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.720
WITHOUT YOUR HYPER COAT!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.761
MY CARD!!

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.162
IT GETS WORSE, BRO.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.131
'CAUSE NATURAL
DISASTER'S UP NEXT!

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.734
WHICH MEANS EVERY TIME I
DESTROY ONE OF YOUR CARDS...

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.669
YOU LOSE 400 POINTS!

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:43.737
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.106
FEELING UNDER THE WEATHER?

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:51.578
BRING IT!

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.179
YOU SURE?

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.316
YOU SEEM PRETTY ANXIOUS
TO GET TAKEN BY STORM!

00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.184
AND YOUR MONSTER'S NOT
DRESSED FOR THE WEATHER!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.553
'CAUSE WITHOUT HYPER COAT,
YOUR CATAPULT IS WIDE

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.155
OPEN TO TRAPS!

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.158
WHICH MEANS I CAN BLOW HIM
AWAY WITH MY RAIN STORM!

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.695
ALRIGHT!

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.031
GIMME ALL YOU GOT,
DWEEB!

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.467
IF I WERE YOU I'D BE RUNNING
FOR COVER RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:27.047
AAH!

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:30.050
NOW TO GET RID OF YOUR
PESKY FIELD SPELL!

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.118
BY LOWERING NIMBUSMAN'S POWER.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.154
ONE MORE TIME, PAL!

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.756
HIS PUFF-BALL'S GOT
NO ATTACK POINTS NOW!

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.269
HEY...I STILL HAVE MORE
POINTS THAN YOU, GECKO.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.071
AND IT'S MY TURN!

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:53.373
YOU KNOW...YOU HAVE A
REAL KNACK FOR STATING

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:56.977
THE OBVIOUS, PRINCETON.

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.145
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE,
CLOUD-FOR-BRAINS!

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.680
HOW'S THAT
FOR "OBVIOUS!"

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.585
MEET MY DIMENSIONAL
CATAPULT!

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:08.621
THANKS TO THIS SPELL...I
CAN BRING A CARD BACK!

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.191
SPECIFICALLY MY
CATAPULT CANNON!

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.664
SURPRISED?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.100
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH COMBOS PAL!

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.334
CATAPULT CANNON!

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.070
WIPE HIS CLOUD OFF
THE WEATHER MAP!

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:30.610
WE INTERRUPT THIS ATTACK...
WITH A SPECIAL TRAP CARD!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.213
COME ON!

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:36.716
IT'S CALLED MIRAGE TARGET AND
IF I SACRIFICE MY CLOUD...

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.519
YOUR LAST ATTACK IS
AUTOMATICALLY CANCELLED OUT!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.554
PLUS THERE'S A LITTLE BONUS!

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.224
ALL THE ATTACK POINTS OF THE
MONSTER I JUST SENT TO

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:47.694
THE GRAVEYARD GET DIRECTLY
TRANSFERRED TO MY LIFE POINTS!

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.732
NO WAY!

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.734
DO YOU REALIZE THIS WAS ALL
PART OF HIS MASTER PLAN!?

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.302
IMPRESSIVE RIGHT!?

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.570
BIG DEAL.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.472
I'M SURE CHAZZ HAS
A PLAN, TOO.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.741
HE MIGHT.
BUT WHO KNOWS IF
IT'S ANY GOOD?

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.376
EXCUSE ME, CHAZZ!?

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.345
IF YOU HAVE A PLAN...
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.414
TO USE IT!

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:08.615
I END MY TURN!

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.450
THAT WAS SOME PLAN.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.087
NOW...I PLAY...
MY GHOST FOG!

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.221
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.660
ZERO POINTS?!
THAT'S LAME.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.328
SO QUICK TO JUDGE.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.330
HE HASN'T EVEN ATTACKED YET.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.331
"ATTACKED?!"

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:34.340
LOOK...IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO LOSE...THEN FINE!

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.742
HEY CATAPULT!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.278
GRANT HIS WISH AND END THIS!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.382
BIG MISTAKE CHAZZ!

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:45.118
YOU JUST TRIGGERED GHOST FOG'S
ABILITY WHICH MEANS I DON'T

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.087
LOSE ANY LIFE POINTS!

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.055
AND THEN...THE MONSTER
YOU ATTACKED WITH GETS

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.457
A LITTLE GIFT.

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:52.325
IT'S A FOG COUNTER!

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:55.395
IN FACT IT GETS ONE COUNTER
FOR EACH OF ITS LEVELS...

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:57.363
AND I COUNT EIGHT!

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.069
THERE'S MORE.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:06.673
NEXT I PLAY...A SPELL
CALLED DIAMOND DUST CYCLONE!

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:12.512
NO!!!

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.447
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.548
Adrian: OH THAT?

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:18.284
JUST MY CYCLONE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.453
IT AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS
ANY MONSTER WITH FOG

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.355
COUNTERS ON IT!

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:25.291
THEN I GET TO DRAW ONE CARD
FOR EVERY FOUR COUNTERS.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.761
AND JUST IN CASE MATH'S NOT
YOUR SUBJECT...EIGHT DIVIDED

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.397
BY FOUR EQUALS TWO.

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:35.235
AND BEFORE I FORGET, YOU LOSE
ANOTHER 800 POINTS THANKS TO

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.103
NATURAL DISASTER!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.607
AND THE FUN CONTINUES!

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.510
I ACTIVATE...MY QUICK
SUMMON SPELL CARD!

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.747
NOW A MONSTER FROM MY HAND...
IS AUTOMATICALLY SUMMONED!

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.717
AND SO I CHOOSE MY
CLOUDIAN POISON CLOUD!

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.557
AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS...
MY CLOUD IS FILLED...

00:10:57.557 --> 00:10:59.292
WITH A DEADLY POISON!

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:01.628
IF YOU ATTACK...
AND IT EXPLODES...

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.997
YOU LOSE 800
LIFE POINTS!

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.466
SO IF I WERE YOU, CHAZZ...
I'D GIVE IT SOME SERIOUS

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.268
THOUGHT BEFORE YOU OPEN FIRE!

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:10.570
LEMME GUESS: THEN
NATURAL DISASTER

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.674
ACTIVATES...AND I LOSE
THE REST OF MY POINTS?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.477
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CATCH
ON QUICKLY CHAZZ!

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.212
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.389
Adrian: WITH A NATURAL
DISASTER ON THE HORIZON

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.725
AND A POISON CLOUD OVERHEAD...
THE FUTURE'S GRIM.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.428
EXPECT DEVASTATING WINDS...
AND A NINETY PERCENT CHANCE

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.130
OF DEFEAT!

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.666
A MAJOR STORM'S HEADING YOUR
WAY AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN PUT

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:42.001
ON HIGH ALERT!

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.204
LISTEN YOU
AL ROKER WANNABE!

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.139
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
MUCH WORSE!

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.376
YOU DON'T SCARE ME!

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.079
I TRAVELED THE WORLD
TO FIND MY DECK!

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.981
I BRAVED THE ELEMENTS
AND SEARCHED UNDER

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.150
THE TOUGHEST CONDITIONS!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.384
GOT THAT!?

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.120
I EAT PUNKS LIKE YOU
FOR BREAKFAST, GECKO!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.522
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:05.291
STANDING THERE LIKE
YOU OWN THE WORLD.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.526
BUT YA KNOW SOMETHING?

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:08.228
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
"GREATNESS" IS AND YOU

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.662
NEVER WILL!

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.331
I TOOK DOWN
THE SHADOW RIDERS

00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.367
AND THE SOCIETY
OF LIGHT BY MYSELF!

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.070
SO BEATING YOU'S
A CAKE WALK!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.071
WATCH!

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.307
I ACTIVATE
GRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.344
THAT MEANS...I CAN PICK
UP THREE MORE CARDS.

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:27.213
AND THEN...I HAFTA
SEND TWO TO THE GRAVE.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.285
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOOK
FEAR RIGHT IN THE EYE!

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:34.053
THAT'S RIGHT GECKO!

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:36.122
IT'S THE THREE CARDS I
JOURNEYED TO THE ENDS

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.523
OF THE EARTH TO FIND!

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.659
BUT FIRST I NEED THIS!

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:44.364
I ACTIVATE A SPELL CARD
KNOWN AS DESPERADO MANAGER!

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:47.300
IT ACTIVATES IF I'M
HOLDING ONE OR MORE CARDS!

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.535
AND I START BY
DRAWING TWO CARDS!

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:52.338
AND THEN...I CHOOSE THREE
CARDS FROM MY HAND...

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:54.574
AND MOVE 'EM TO THE
TOP OF MY DECK.

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:01.614
NEXT I ACTIVATE...
ENCHANTING ROOM!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.318
SO ALL I HAFTA DO IS PAY 800
LIFE POINTS AND I CAN FLIP

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.720
OVER THE TOP FOUR
CARDS IN MY DECK.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.257
AND IF ANY OF THEM HAPPEN TO
BE LEVEL THREE OR BELOW...

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.293
I CAN AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON THEM TO THE FIELD!

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.298
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT!

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.967
WELL WHATTA YA
KNOW ABOUT THAT!?

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.635
IT'S MY TRIPLE THREAT!

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.538
OJAMA YELLOW...OJAMA
GREEN...AND FINALLY

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.373
OJAMA BLACK!

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.178
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO COOL.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.147
FLAUNTING YOUR
LITTLE CLOUDS.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.616
BUT AS FOR ME...I
LIKE THE THUNDER!

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:38.284
SEE THIS!?

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.386
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
HAS AN EFFECT ON THE WEATHER

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.188
AROUND HERE!

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.556
I'VE GOT OJAMA DELTA
THUNDER!

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.091
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:47.527
IT MAKES YOUR STORM LOOK
LIKE NOTHING BUT A NICE

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:49.395
SUMMER BREEZE!

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.464
'CAUSE NOW...
FOR EVERY
CARD IN YOUR HAND

00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:55.368
OR ON YOUR
FIELD, YOU TAKE 500
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.270
BOYS...SHOW 'IM!

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.971
WHEE!

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.009
OJAMA POWER!

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.516
AND...CHECK THIS!

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.218
ONCE I SEND
OJAMA THUNDER

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:13.386
TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:15.455
EVERY CARD ON YOUR
SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.557
IS DESTROYED
ON THE SPOT!

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.260
Chazz: AH, HELLO!?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.096
HEY, WE'RE ON!

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.135
WELL, WELL.

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:31.270
I GUESS BEING
A SPOILED RICH KID

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.740
DOESN'T PAY
OFF DOES IT?

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.675
ESPECIALLY WHEN
DADDY'S NOT HERE
TO BAIL YOU OUT!

00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:37.043
HA HA.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.078
SO YA THINK I HAVE
IT EASY, HAH CHAZZ?

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.380
AND YOU?

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.482
YOUR LIFE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT HARDSHIPS, RIGHT?

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.117
SORT OF.

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.052
DID'JA EVER THINK THAT MAYBE
WHEN YOU'RE POINTING YOUR

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.122
FINGER AT ME YOU'RE REALLY
POINTING IT AT YOURSELF?

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:52.525
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE...THAT
YOU'RE THE SPOILED ONE?

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:55.361
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR FAMILY!

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.029
THE PRINCETON CORP?

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.499
DOES THAT RING A BELL?

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:02.368
WELL AT LEAST...
YOU HAVE A FAMILY.

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.736
I WAS ALL ALONE.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.538
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT FEELS LIKE!?

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:07.140
I DOUBT IT!

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.343
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST
THING ABOUT HARDSHIP, CHAZZ!

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.479
ALL I HAD WAS THE SKY,
THE CLOUDS...AND

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.381
MY IMAGINATION.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.050
I WAS AN ORPHAN,
ABANDONED IN THE DESERT.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.520
I HAD NOTHING BUT THE
CLOTHES ON MY BACK.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.990
AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I
COULDN'T LAST ANOTHER DAY...

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.425
HE SHOWED UP.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.034
IF GILBERT GECKO
HADN'T RESCUED ME...

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:37.437
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
STANDING HERE TODAY.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.038
OH PLEASE!

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.173
IT'S TRUE CHAZZ.

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:41.507
BUT I DIGRESS.

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:45.311
WE'RE HERE TO DUEL NOT
COMPARE SOB-STORIES!

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.480
WITH THAT...MY MOVE!

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.651
WELL...I HOPED IT
WOULDN'T COME TO THIS...

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.352
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:58.458
I ACTIVATE...MY
WONDER CLOUD SPELL CARD!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.527
SO FIRST...I ELIMINATE
ALL OF ALL MY CARDS!

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:04.096
THAT INCLUDES MY
FIELD AND HAND.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.667
NEXT I DRAW ONE FOR EVERY CARD
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.369
AND THEN...EVERY CARD
IN MY DECK...

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.505
IS REMOVED FROM PLAY!

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.307
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHY I'M DOING THIS?

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.675
SIMPLE.

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:18.377
THANKS TO THE EFFECT OF MY
WONDER CLOUD SPELL...

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:23.616
ANY CARD YOU PLAY THIS TURN
IS AUTOMATICALLY NEGATED!

00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:25.184
I DON'T GET IT!

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:27.286
WELL, HE'S SORTA
"BETTIN' THE FARM."

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:29.989
'CAUSE IF HE'S ABLE
TO DRAW THE RIGHT
CARDS HE WINS.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.624
BUT SINCE HIS
DECK'S GONE IF
HE DOESN'T...

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:33.593
HE LOSES.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.261
THAT'S INSANE!

00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:36.529
BY THE END OF THIS
ROUND...WE'RE GONNA

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:37.563
HAVE A WINNER!

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.131
NO WAY!

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.468
Adrian: THANKS TO YOUR OJAMAS
I DRAW THREE CARDS.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.973
AND THE REST ARE GONE.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:52.712
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
CARD BIG SUMMON CLOUD!

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.448
THE DRAWBACK IS...
TO KEEP THIS CARD...

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:57.483
I NEED TO PAY A PRICE.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:01.053
MY ENTIRE HAND GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD!!

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.723
BUT IF I PAY HALF
MY LIFE POINTS...

00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:06.759
I GET TO SUMMON
A CLOUDIAN MONSTER FIRST!

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.128
YOU'RE IN FOR SOME
NASTY WEATHER!

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.630
'CAUSE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO MEET...

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.366

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.506
NOW ATTACK!

00:17:28.014 --> 00:17:29.549
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.651
WHENEVER MY TYPHOON
ATTACKS...

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:34.554
EVERY MONSTER IS
FORCED TO CHANGE BATTLE MODES!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.756
SO THERE GOES YOUR DEFENSE!

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.092
BUT I NEED
THAT CARD!

00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:44.730
UH!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.199
AAH!

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.479
STILL THINK YOU'RE SO
HIGH AND MIGHTY!?

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.714
'CAUSE FROM HERE...

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.382
IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU CAN'T GET

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.084
ANY LOWER, PRINCETON!

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.319
YOU'RE WASHED UP!

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.587
AH, HEY CHAZZ.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.155
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:11.090
Chazz: WHAT DO YOU THINK?!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.093
WILL SOMEBODY GET ME
A TOWEL ALREADY!

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.328
JUST GREAT.

00:18:15.328 --> 00:18:17.997
I LOST...
I'M SOAKING WET...

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.333
YOU'RE STILL MY
FAVORITE SPOILED BRAT.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.671
Chazz: WHOA.

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:28.341
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME
DOWN, VIPER.

00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:32.411
ADRIAN!

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.581
Ojama Yellow: HEEEELP!
THE BOSS IS SINKING!

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.183
AND I CAN'T SWIM!

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.317
HE'S DROWNING!

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.452
I'LL SAVE HIM!

00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:50.463
Viper: YOU'RE LUCKY ALL I DID

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.265
WAS DRAIN YOUR ENERGY,
MR. GECKO.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.070
OF COURSE, IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE I UNCOVER

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.639
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:04.176
AND WHEN I DO, YOU'LL
NO LONGER BE A NUISANCE.

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.379
CAN'T I PLOT EVIL IN PEACE!?

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.513
WHAT'S THIS?

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:10.349
SEEMS SOMEONE ELSE
WANTS TO DROP IN.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.327
Viper: IF IT ISN'T
AXEL BRODIE.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:25.398
SUCH AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:27.667
DROP THE MANNERS!
FESS UP!

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.435
WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON HERE!?

00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:31.337
STUDENTS ARE
DROPPIN' OFF LEFT
AND RIGHT

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.406
AND ALL FINGERS
POINT AT YOU!

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:36.275
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE, PRIVATE.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.677
CAREFUL AXEL.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.247
YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP
LIKE YOUR FATHER NOW DO YOU?

00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:43.049
HE WAS A GOOD
SOLIDER, TOO.

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:44.984
WELL, UNTIL HE
FORGOT HIS PLACE.

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:46.352
HUH?

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.422
NOW THEN, DO WE HAVE AN
UNDERSTANDING MR. BRODIE?

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:52.491
ALL I UNDERSTAND IS
THAT YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:57.997
AAH!

00:19:57.997 --> 00:19:59.732
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:03.135
I THINK YOU'LL BE MOST PLEASED
WITH THE ACCOMMODATIONS.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.275
I KNOW SCHOOL CAN
PUT YOU TO SLEEP

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.210
BUT THIS
IS RIDICULOUS!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.345
IT LOOKS LIKE
VIPER STRUCK
AGAIN.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.181
Crowler: I'M
BEGINNING TO THINK

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:16.382
THIS IS MORE THAN
JUST THE FLU.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.451
PERHAPS YOU TWO
WERE RIGHT.

00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:19.652
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT
YOU ADMITTED

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:21.187
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

00:20:21.187 --> 00:20:23.355
BUT WHAT ARE WE
S'POSTA DO NOW?

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:25.424
[GASP]

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:27.993
MARCEL!

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:29.628
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD!

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.397
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.599
OUR WORST FEARS
HAVE COME TRUE!

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.734
HUH?

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.074
DUE TO AN UNEXPECTED
EVENT...I HAD TO LEAVE.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.209
GOOD LUCK.

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:44.243
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS!?

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.980
NOW WE'RE IN CHARGE!

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.682
TALK ABOUT BAD TIMING.
