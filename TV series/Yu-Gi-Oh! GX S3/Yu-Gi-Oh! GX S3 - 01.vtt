THERE'S NOT A CARD
IN YOUR DECK

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:15.996
THAT CAN SAVE YOU!

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.964
WELL MAYBE NOT
IN MY OLD DECK,

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.933
BUT THIS ONE'S
ANOTHER STORY!

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.135
IN FACT, WHY
DON'T I SHOW YA!

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:23.603
BY BUSTING OUT
A NEW HERO THAT

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.372
NO ONE'S EVER
SEEN BEFORE!

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.073
WHAT NEW HERO?

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.509
YOU'LL SEE.
BUT FIRST...

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.612
I PLAY THE FIELD SPELL,
NEO SPACE!

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.548
MY DARK CITY!

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.384
THIS CARD
INCREASES THE POWER

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.420
OF MY ELEMENTAL HERO
NEOS BY FIVE HUNDRED!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.156
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF THIS:

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:44.758
WHERE IS NEOS?!

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.461
THE ANSWER IS...

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.829
HE'S RIGHT UP THERE!

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.805
AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE...

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:01.474
HIS ATTACK POINTS RISE!

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.976
SO WHAT?!

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:05.211
IT STILL
DOESN'T STAND UP
TO MY DOGMA!

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.814
NOT YET.
BUT WHO SAID I WAS DONE?

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:09.182
NOW WHERE WAS I?

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.517
OH RIGHT!

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:12.185
I'M CREATING
A NEW MONSTER

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.255
BY COMBINING
THESE TWO TOGETHER!

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.290
THAT'S AGAINST
THE RULES!

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.826
IT'S CALLED
CONTACT FUSION,
AND IT'S LEGIT!

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.896
YA SEE NEO SPACIANS
CAN MERGE...

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.065
WITHOUT
A POLYMERIZATION CARD!

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.766
WAIT A SEC!

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.802
I REMEMBER THIS FEELING.

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.341
IT'S LIKE YEARS BACK

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.810
WHEN I WAS A KID

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.546
AND DUELING
WAS STILL FUN!

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.848
SO THIS IS
YOUR NEW HERO?

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:42.949
THAT'S HIM!

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.285
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLARE NEOS!

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:46.886
'N GUESS WHAT?

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.489
MY FLARE NEOS GAINS
ATTACK 400 POINTS

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:51.658
FOR EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP ON THE FIELD!

00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.426
PRETTY COOL EFFECT RIGHT?

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.328
SO THERE ARE THREE
CARDS ON THE FIELD

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.930
PLUS THE ONE
I JUST PLAYED.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.164
GIVING HIM...

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.166
SIXTEEN HUNDRED
EXTRA POINTS!

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.637
THAT'S ENOUGH TO
BEAT MY DOGMA!

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.006
YUP! THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT!

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.075
FLARE NEOS,
ATTACK!

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.948
I ACTIVATE...
D-SHIELD!

00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.653
WHAT'S THAT!?

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.988
IT'S A TRAP CARD!

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.224
NOW WHEN A DESTINY
HERO'S ATTACKED...

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.959
IT SWITCHES TO
DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.861
AND IT STAYS
ON THE FIELD!

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.729
AWESOME!
PRETTY SWEET TRAP!

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.864
FA'REAL!

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:32.765
THANK YOU.
BUT YOU KNOW,

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.834
FLATTERY'S NOT GONNA
GET YOU ANYWHERE!

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.436
STAND BACK!

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.771
I'M GUESSING THAT
YOUR NEO SPACE FIELD CARD

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.807
KEEPS YOUR MONSTER
FROM VANISHING AGAIN.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.442
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.310
AS LONG AS THIS
CARD'S IN PLAY...

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.613
EVEN THOUGH HE'S FUSED
WITH SOMETHING ELSE...

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.115
NEOS WILL BE STICKIN'
AROUND THIS TIME!

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.483
NOT QUITE.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.952
MY DOGMA AND I HAVE
OTHER PLANS FOR HIM.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.654
FIRST THING'S FIRST.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.823
I SWITCH DOGMA
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.024
SO STAND UP!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.631
AND THEN I'LL EQUIP HIM
WITH THIS SPELL CARD!

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.766
HEAVY STORM BLADE!

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.469
REMEMBER, EVERY TIME
A NEW SPELL CARD
IS PLAYED...

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:11.871
FLARE NEOS GETS
MORE POINTS!

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.239
FOUR HUNDRED MORE!

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.908
YOU THINK I CARE!?

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.409
PLEASE, NOT AS LONG
AS I KNOW THAT

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.278
DESTINY'S GOT MY BACK!

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.612
NOW ATTACK!

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.785
HOW 'BOUT A BIG HAND
FOR THE KING OF SWING...

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.954
MY HEAVY STORM BLADE!

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:30.190
TAKE 'IM
FOR A SPIN, PAL!

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.993
WHENEVER A MONSTER
THAT'S EQUIPPED

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:36.396
WITH HEAVY STORM BLADE
ATTACKS...

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:38.698
EVERY SINGLE TRAP
AND SPELL CARD ON THE FIELD

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.701
IS INSTANTLY DESTROYED!

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.203
NO WAY!

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.640
AND NOW...

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.442
NEOS LOSES
A FEW ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.313
NOW ATTACK!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.485
NO FAIR!

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.087
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.423
OHHH. YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY MY MONSTER

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.158
DIDN'T BITE THE DUST,
AREN'T YOU?

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.826
MAYBE.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:07.994
I HATE TO BREAK
IT TO YA,

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:10.096
BUT IT'S YOUR
OWN FAULT!

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:13.600
SEE THIS!?
YOU SENT IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.535
AND WHEN SPELL CALLING
LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:18.171
I GET TO REPLACE IT
WITH TWO NEW
SPELL CARDS,

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.474
GIVING MY NEOS
A POWER BOOST!

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.009
[THINKING]
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.278
THAT MEANS JADEN WINS.

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.313
AND SARTORIUS SAID
THAT I WAS DESTINED

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.482
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:33.486
COULD IT BE THAT JADEN
IS EVEN MORE POWERFUL
THAN DESTINY?!

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.228
AAH!

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:50.003
I KNEW RIGHT THEN
THAT MY NEW ALIEN
PEEPS FROM NEO SPACE--

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:51.271
THAT'S YOU--

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.574
HAD MY BACK NO MATTER
WHAT STOOD IN MY WAY!

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:57.377
SO IF SOME MANIACAL VILLAIN
SHOWS UP THIS YEAR,

00:12:57.377 --> 00:13:00.380
WHICH IS BOUND TO HAPPEN,
WE'LL BE READY!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.687
NOW WHERE WAS I?

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:10.356
OH YEAH, DAYDREAMING
ABOUT MY OLD DUELS!

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.427
'KAY, LADIES!
MY TURN!

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.998
OHH!

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:20.099
WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.567
HEY WAIT, ARE YOU
A NEO-SPA---

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:22.969
DIG THIS, KID.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.604
I JUST TELL IT
LIKE IT IS.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:25.805
OK.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.876
YOU GOTTA LAY
THAT DASHER ON 'EM.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:31.411
WHY NOT?

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.613
[THINKING]
IS HE GONNA DUEL
OR STAND THERE

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:36.549
AND PONDER HIS PURPOSE
IN LIFE?

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.684
[GASP]

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.752
ALRIGHT,
CHECK IT OUT, GIRLS!

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.854
SINCE DASHER'S
IN THE GRAVEYARD,
I CAN SUMMON

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.423
THE CARD THAT'S
IN MY HAND!

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:44.891
AWESOME!

00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:48.061
NOW I SUMMON MY
NEO-SPACIAN
DARK PANTHER!

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.398
[GROWLS]

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:53.599
NOW HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.401
HE'S NO
ORDINARY CAT!

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.936
AS A MATTER
OF FACT
YA MIGHT SAY,

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.671
HE'S A BIT
OF A COPY CAT!

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.773
'CAUSE I CAN PICK
ANY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:03.710
AND MY PANTHER
WILL COPY ALL
OF ITS ABILITIES!

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.645
AND I THINK I'LL
CHOOSE NONE OTHER

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:08.181
THAN YOUR
DARK CREATOR!

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.215
EXCUSE ME?!

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:10.917
[GROWLS]

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.659
NO!
NO!

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:21.027
IT'S ALL TRUE!

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.162
SO NOW I CAN ACTIVATE
THE FIELD SPELL

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.698
INFINITE
FIEND MIRROR!

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.899
THIS OUGHT TO
EVEN THINGS UP!

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.805
NEXT I'LL GET RID
OF TWO DARK
CREATOR TOKENS

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:35.808
TO SUMMON MY
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.647
TIME FOR SOME
FUSION ACTION!

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.450
SO I'LL MERGE NEOS
WITH MY DARK PANTHER!

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:53.393
MEET MY NEWEST
ELEMENTAL HERO
DARK NEOS!

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.263
OHH!
OHH!

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:59.766
BUT WAIT!
IT HAS TWENTY-FIVE
HUNDRED ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:02.568
IT'S TOO WEAK TO DEFEAT
THE DARK CREATOR!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.438
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT DARK NEOS HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:08.441
IT CAN NEGATE THE ABILITIES
OF ANY OTHER MONSTER!

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.310
INCLUDING DARK CREATOR.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.945
SO THAT MEANS...

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:15.515
YOUR DARK CREATOR'S NOT
INDESTRUCTIBLE ANYMORE.

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:18.851
SORRY, GIRLS!

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.787
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE!

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:22.522
DARK CREATOR TOKEN...

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.157
SHOW 'EM WHAT YA GOT!

00:15:24.157 --> 00:15:26.058
ATTACK DARK CREATOR!

00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:30.897
NO! YOU CAN'T!

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:33.533
IF HE'S GONE, SO ARE
ALL OF OUR TOKENS!

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.606
THEY'RE AS GOOD
AS EXTINCT!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.208
THREE HONKS FOR JAY!

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:43.443
WE'RE DEFENSELESS!

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.545
BUT HOW DID HE MANAGE
TO DO THAT?

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:46.913
DIDN'T YOU SEE?!

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:48.948
FIRST HE DESTROYED
DARK CREATOR.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.651
THAT UNDID THE EFFECT
OF INFINITE
FIEND MIRROR.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.821
NO SPELL CARD,
NO CREATOR TOKENS!

00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.622
AND WITH NO TOKENS LEFT,

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.558
YOU GIRLS ARE
OUT OF LUCK!

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.793
YEAH!?
AND WHY IS THAT!?

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.428
LOOK AT YOUR FIELD!

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.130
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN!

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:08.434
NEOS!
END THIS DUEL!

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.836
ATTACK THEM
DIRECTLY!

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.005
UNH!

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:22.348
HUH. THOSE WERE SOME GOOD
TIMES RIGHT, GUYS!?

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.717
SAVIN' THE WORLD
ONE DUEL AT A TIME!

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.152
LIKE THE TIME YOU
TOOK OUT THAT SATELLITE

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.687
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS!

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.555
TALK ABOUT SWEET!

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.090
YES. HOWEVER,
WITHOUT THE HELP

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.859
OF YOUR DINOSAUR
FRIEND,

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:35.394
THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT
WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN POSSIBLE.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.431
HA HA!
HEY! HASSLEBERRY!

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:41.467
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS
SAYS "THANK YOU!"

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.502
WHO?!
WHAT!?

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.570
UH, HE'S WELCOME!

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.839
OH, AND AH,
"NA-NU-NA-NU!"

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.774
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.376
IT'S ALIEN TALK.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.912
WHEN YOUR FRIEND GOES
NUTS IT'S BEST JUST
TO PLAY ALONG.

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.313
HEH HEH HEH.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:00.953
"DON'T LOOK SO BLUE!"

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:03.189
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY LIKED THAT GIRL!

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.124
WELL NOW THAT I QUIT
THAT LAME CLUB...

WHO'S NEXT?
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:12.031
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR A REMATCH

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.200
SINCE LAST YEAR, JADEN!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.502
YOUR DECK.
IT'S ALL
DIFFERENT NOW.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:18.871
WHERE DID ALL
YOUR OJAMA CARDS GO?

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.073
THOSE FREAKS!?
THEY'RE GONE NOW!

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:24.010
ALRIGHT, OJAMAS,

THAN MY OLD DECK
EVER COULD!

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.388
HA HA HA!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.457
WHEN YOU LOST
TO SARTORIUS,
HE BRAINWASHED YOU!

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.159
AND SINCE THEN,
WE'VE BEEN TRYIN'

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.694
TO SNAP YOU OUT
OF IT!

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.062
YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.564
HEY WAIT A SEC!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.767

LIKE I ALWAYS SAY:

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.878
IF IT CAN'T HIDE
THE DIRT...

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:01.480
THEN I DON'T WANT
IT OVER MY SHIRT!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.582
YEAH!

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.050
I'M TAKING BACK THE DECK

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.886
YOU STOLE FROM ME
BEFORE THE DUEL STARTED.

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:08.821
I NEVER ACTUALLY
STOLE YOUR DECK!

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.389
YEAH, WHATEVER.

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.825

SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE JUST LOST!

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.617
JUST WAIT
UNTIL OUR REMATCH.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.251
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
A FEW NEW TRICKS.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.253

SO IT'S TRUE!

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.709
