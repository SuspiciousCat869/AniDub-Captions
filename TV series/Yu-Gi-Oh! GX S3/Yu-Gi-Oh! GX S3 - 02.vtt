AND LAST, LEADING

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.425
IT'S JESSE ANDERSEN!

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.263
HUH?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.032
THIS IS AWKWARD.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.767
NO IT'S JUST
PLAIN RUDE!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.669

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.338
JESSE?
JESSE ANDERSEN!?

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.573
NO WAY!

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:09.042
HE'S THE KID
WITH THE CRYSTAL BEAST DECK!

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:10.210
CRYSTAL WHAT?

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.744
SPEAK UP, SON!

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.179
WHATTA YOU KNOW?

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.081
A COUPLE 'A YEARS AGO...

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.749
PEGASUS CREATED SOME CARDS.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:19.085
BUT HIS CORPORATION
DIDN'T RELEASE THEM.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.887
MY FAMILY OFFERED HIM
MILLIONS FOR 'EM,

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:22.522
BUT HE REFUSED TO SELL.

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.023
I DON'T GET IT!

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.558
WHAT, ARE THEY MADE
'A GOLD!?

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.494
RULE NUMBER ONE!

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:31.064
NEVER INTERRUPT THE CHAZZ
WHEN HE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LONG MONOLOGUE.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.199
THE LEGEND
OF THE DECK GOES WAY BACK

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.635
TO THE ANCIENT ROMANS.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.871
THEIR EMPEROR, JULIUS CAESAR,

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:41.541
MANAGED TO GATHER SEVEN RARE
JEWELS FROM AROUND THE WORLD,

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.610
ONE FROM EACH PLACE
HE CONQUERED.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.446
BUT WHILE THEY WERE BEING
TRANSPORTED BACK TO ROME,

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.081
THE SHIP WAS CAUGHT
IN A STORM

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:50.283
AND THE JEWELS WERE LOST.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.654
UNTIL PEGASUS FOUND THEM.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.890
THEN HE TOOK
A FRAGMENT OF EACH ONE

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.958
AND CREATED SEVEN NEW CARDS.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.627
THE CRYSTAL
BEAST CARDS?

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:03.096
HOW'D YA' GET SO
SMART, HAYSEED?

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.298
YEAH, THE CRYSTAL
BEAST CARDS.

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:07.667
THEN HE GAVE 'EM AWAY
TO SOME TOURNAMENT WINNER.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.068
SO THAT MEANS

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.937
THIS JESSE KID WAS
THE WINNER, RIGHT!?

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.107
HOW SWEET!

SORRY, FOLKS.

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.651

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:56.656
THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.458
NO, THEY'RE MY FAMILY!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.827
WOW! YOUR CARDS
ARE YOUR FAMILY?!

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:02.795
AND I THOUGHT I
WAS CLOSE TO MINE!

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:06.365
SAM HILL.
THIS KID'S
AS WEIRD AS JADEN!

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.434
YEAH. LOOK
WHO'S TALKING.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.736
I'LL PLACE THIS
HERE FACEDOWN.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.138
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.273
ALRIGHT.
ON THAT NOTE...

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.274
WATCH THIS!

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.214
I PLAY MY NEO-SPACIAN
AQUA DOLPHIN!

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.057
AWESOME!

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.359
AN HONEST TA GOODNESS
NEO SPACIAN!

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.961
I'VE HEARD
ABOUT THESE GUYS!

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.562
BUT I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE!

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:39.198
GOOD ON YA, MATE!

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.734
LEGENDARY BEASTS
VERSUS ALIENS?

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.836
THIS OUGHTA BE GOOD.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.807
NEXT UP, I'LL
SEND ONE CARD
TO MY GRAVEYARD...

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:50.042
SO HIS SPECIAL
EFFECT KICKS IN!

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.377
SONAR WAVE!

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.148
IF THERE'S A MONSTER
IN YOUR HAND

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.351
WITH 300 ATTACK
POINTS OR LESS,

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.119
IT'S INSTANTLY
DESTROYED!

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:02.655
THEN YOU LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.925
SO LETS SEE WHAT YA
GOT THERE, JESS!

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:06.959
OHH!

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.960
[CHATTERS]

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.829
UNH! COME ON!

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.497
NOT MY RUBY!

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.833
HEY THAT'S THE WAY
THE CRYSTAL
CRUMBLES, BRO.

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.635
NOW FOR O-OVERSOUL!

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:19.005
WITH THIS,
I GET TO BRING BACK
THE ELEMETNAL HERO CARD

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:19.939
THAT I JUST TOSSED!

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.742
YOU HAD THIS
ALL PLANNED!?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:24.277
OF COURSE!

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.879
SO GIVE IT UP
FOR ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.454
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TA MEET HIM!

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.590
BUT TALK
ABOUT BAD TIMING!

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.191
IF WE WEREN'T
DUELING RIGHT NOW,

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.193
I'D ASK
FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH.

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:42.528
OH, WELL.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:45.431
THE FUNNY THING IS IT'S
ALSO BAD TIMING FOR YOU!

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:47.333
WHY'S THAT!?

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.770
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE
MY TRIGGER SUMMON TRAP CARD!

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.205
SINCE YOU JUST SPECIAL
SUMMONED A MONSTER,

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.408
I GET TO PLAY ONE TOO!

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.743
IN FACT NOW WE BOTH GET TO
SUMMON A MONSTER AS LONG AS

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.712
IT'S LEVEL FOUR OR BELOW!

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:01.314
MAN, YOU SCARED ME.

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:02.682
'CAUSE FOR
A SECOND THERE,

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.784
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA DESTROY NEOS.

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:06.852
DID YOU SAY "DESTROY"?!

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:09.689
JESSE WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.724
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THE TURTLE'S RIGHT.

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:15.928
DESTROYING AN OPPONENT'S
DECK JUST ISN'T MY WAY.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.363
IF I WIPED OUT
YOUR CARDS

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:18.497
BEFORE YOU COULD
USE 'EM...

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.399
WELL, THAT'S NO FUN!

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.501
SEE, THE REASON I DUEL
IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.704
IS SO I CAN LEARN
NEW STRATEGIES.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.105
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.074
IF I GET RID
OF YOUR CARDS!

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:29.575
SO I'M GIVIN' YOU
THE CHANCE TO SHOW ME

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:30.810
WHAT THEY CAN DO!

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.312
NOW GO AHEAD
AND GIMME ALL YOU GOT!

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.782
ALRIGHT!
NOW YOU'RE SPEAKIN'
THE SAME LANGUAGE!

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.251
IF YOU WANNA SEE
WHAT MY CARDS CAN DO,

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.420
THEN FEAST YOUR EYES
ON THIS!

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.624
I SUMMON MY
NEO-SPACIAN GRAND MOLE!

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.060
AND I PLAY THIS!

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.529
CRYSTAL BEAST
COBALT EAGLE!

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.772
HOLY TOLEDO!

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:01.574
TALK ABOUT A FULL HOUSE!

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:03.909
WE'RE IN
THE BIG LEAGUES NOW.

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.911
THIS KID
SEEMS FAMILIAR.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.081
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S JADEN
WITH A SOUTHERN ACCENT!

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.650
HMM?

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.451
YOU'RE ON, NEOS!

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:14.453
ATTACK HIS
EMERALD TURTLE!

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.260
GRAND MOLE, YOUR
TURN TO SHOW OFF!

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.198
AND BRINGIN'
UP THE REAR,

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.600
MY AQUA DOLPHIN!

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.370
AAH!

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.008
HE DID IT!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.077
HE TOOK OUT THEM
CRYSTAL BEASTS!

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:39.245
NOT QUITE.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.053
WHAT'S THAT!?

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.830
Aqua Dolphin: THOSE
CRYSTAL BEASTS SHOULD
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.465
ACTUALLY THEY WERE!

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.400
BUT THEY HAVE
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.868
GET THIS!

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.604
INSTEAD OF GOING
TO THE GRAVEYARD,
THEY STAY

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.940
BY TURNING
INTO PRECIOUS CRYSTALS!

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.075
YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:12.712
NO FAIR!
I WANT PRICELESS
JEWELS IN MY DECK!

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.246
I MEAN
IS THAT SO WRONG!?

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.481
WHAT A MATCH!

00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.783
AND THESE TWO GUYS ARE
JUST GETTING WARMED UP!

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.454
DUDE,
THAT IS RIGHTEOUS!

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:22.988
YOUR MONSTERS ROCK!

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.290
GET IT..."ROCK"?!

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.958
UH, NOT REALLY.

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.627
BUT IF YOU THINK
THEY'RE COOL NOW,
JUST YOU WAIT!

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.930
MY CRYSTAL BEASTS ARE
FULL OF SURPRISES!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:42.074
HEH HEH HEH!
HA HA HA!
