YOU'RE GOING TO HELP!

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:17.119
WE COULD EAT

THIS DUEL IS LIKE
A THREE RINGED CIRCUS.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.812
JESSE'S DUELING A GUY WHO
WON'T SAY OR DO ANYTHING,

AN ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUE,

WHO'S FLATTER
THAN A PANCAKE...

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.087
NOW IF THEY DON'T
DEFEAT THESE GUYS,

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:37.124
MARCEL'S NOT GONNA LET US GET
TO THE FOOD STORAGE FACILITY,

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.493
AND IF THAT HAPPENS,
WE'LL BE GOING

WITH MY LAST DRAW,
I NOW HAVE SEVEN CARDS

NOT SO FAST,
DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF SILENT PAIN,

AND THAT'S NOT ALL...

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.706

FROM MY HAND.

WHEN SILENT PAIN

COULD BLOW AWAY
MY ANCHOR KNIGHT?

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:37.797
YOU SEE BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.601
I CAN RESURRECT MY KNIGHT
IN DEFENSE MODE.

WITH ANCHOR KNIGHT
STILL ON THE FIELD,

THIS TRAP LETS ME TAKE
THE TOP THREE CARDS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:06:03.323 --> 00:06:04.491

00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:51.254
WELL THAT'S A FIRST.

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.456
NO, HE STARTED RUNNING
INTO THE SCHOOL.

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:55.325
HUH?

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:56.526
INTO THE SCHOOL?!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.595
YEAH, AND I'M
GOING AFTER HIM!

00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:00.597
WAIT UP, BLAIR!

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:01.898
I'M COMING WITH YA!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.233
JADEN!

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:08.438
HURRY IT UP, AXEL!
WE'RE STARVING!

00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:13.643
[THINKING]
SOMETHING'S NOT
RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:14.978
WHY'D MARCEL LURE US
OUT HERE

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.614
WHEN HE COULD HAVE
JUST DUELED US
INSIDE... UNLESS!

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.716
HE WANTED US
ALL DISTRACTED
FOR SOME REASON

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:21.351
I BETTER MAKE
THIS QUICK

00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:22.719
SO I CAN
FIND OUT WHY!

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.821
I SLAP ONE
CARD FACEDOWN...

00:08:25.822 --> 00:08:27.690
AND SUMMON
FIRE TROOPER!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:31.594
HA HA HA!

00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:33.363
YOUR MONSTER JUST
GOT EXTINGUISHED!

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:35.298
PRETTY FUNNY...

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:36.366
HOW'S THIS
FOR FUNNY?

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:38.101
WHEN FIRE TROOPER
IS SUMMONED,

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.636
IT GETS SENT
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.438
BUT NOT BEFORE
DEALING A THOUSAND
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:43.740
AW, SHUCKS!

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.241
MY POINTS WENT DOWN.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.476
STILL A LOT
OF YUKS THOUGH.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.945
'SPECIALLY 'CAUSE BY
TAKING ROUGH FIGHT

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:51.114
OUTTA MY GRAVEYARD
AND REMOVING IT FROM PLAY,

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.550
YOU TAKE THE SAME
DAMAGE I JUST TOOK.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.452
HA HA HA!

00:08:58.354 --> 00:08:59.589
LET'S SEE YA LAUGH
AT THIS MOVE!

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.292
I PLAY THE SPELL
FIRE RECOVERY.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.727
AND SEND ONE
FIRE MONSTER
FROM MY HAND

00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:06.262
TO THE GRAVE...
'N THEN...

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.431
I CAN SUMMON
A DIFFERENT
FIRE MONSTER

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:09.832
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:12.869
THE CARD I GOT RID
OF WAS VOLCANIC
SCATTERSHOT.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.071
NOW THIS IS WHEN
IT GETS FUNNY,

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:16.806
'CAUSE WHEN IT'S
REMOVED SO ARE

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:18.541
FIVE HUNDRED
A' YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:21.244
HA HA HA!

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:23.246
AND NOW FROM MY
GRAVEYARD,

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:24.714
I SUMMON FIRE
TROOPER.

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:26.883
WHICH MEANS THAT
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:28.384
A THOUSAND MORE
LIFE POINTS.

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:30.386
HA HA HA!

00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:32.589
AND NEXT...

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.757
THIS JUST ISN'T
FUNNY ANYMORE!

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:37.427
THAT'S TOO BAD CAUSE I'M
JUST GETTING WARMED UP!

00:09:38.027 --> 00:09:39.963
BECAUSE I PLAY MY
SPELL FIRE RECOVERY
WHICH ALLOWS

00:09:40.964 --> 00:09:42.332
ME TO SEND
SCATTERSHOT
TO THE GRAVE.

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:45.368
HA HA HO HO!

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.104
[THINKING]
THIS GUY'S MATERIAL
IS PRETTY GOOD.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.241
IF HE KEEPS THIS UP,
ALL MY LIFE POINTS
ARE GONNA CRASH AND BURN!

00:09:52.242 --> 00:09:53.243
HA HA HA!

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:56.045
GIMME A SEC
TO CATCH MY BREATH!

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.849
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING...
OH THE TEARS OF A CLOWN!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.252
THOSE'LL BE REAL
TEARS SOON ENOUGH...

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:04.520
'CAUSE I GOT ONE LAST
SURPRISE FOR YOU...

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:07.023
NOW I'LL SUMMON
SCATTERSHOT.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.025
IT'S YOUR MOVE,
JOKER!

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:11.628
I SEEN BETTER SURPRISES
IN A JACK-IN-THE-BOX!

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:13.029
[THINKING]
LITTLE DOES HE
KNOW THAT I GOT

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.631
A SURPRISE FOR HIM.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.397
IF I USE MY TRAP CARD
TO RETURN ROUGH EXPLODER

00:10:17.397 --> 00:10:19.600
TO THE GRAVEYARD,
HE'LL GET CAUGHT
IN THE FALLOUT...

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.335
AND I'LL BE LAUGHING
ALL THE WAY TO VICTORY.

00:10:21.935 --> 00:10:22.936
MY MOVE!

00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:24.304
I DRAW.

00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:25.973
WHY YA LEAVIN'?

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.875
BECAUSE I WON.
THIS IS THE REAL
SURPRISE.

00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:29.376
WHEN THIS TRAP
IS PLAYED YOU LOSE

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:30.744
A THOUSAND OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:32.212
ONCE YOU DRAW
A CARD.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:34.414
I GUESS I BOMBED!

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:41.922

00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:43.524

00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:49.563
WHERE AM I?

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.099
LISTEN UP.
I THINK THIS
DUEL'S A DECOY.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.101

SILENCE.

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.508
THIS DUEL WILL CONTINUE,
OR I'LL SET

00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:02.843

JUST STUN.

00:11:03.844 --> 00:11:04.845
HEY!

00:11:07.814 --> 00:11:08.782

HEY, BRODIE, ARE

00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:17.291

GIVING US THE FOOD?

00:11:18.292 --> 00:11:19.293

[THINKING]
TIME FOR ACTION!

00:11:38.008 --> 00:11:38.409
[THINKING]
I MUST FIND MARCEL

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:40.144
AND TALK SOME SENSE
INTO HIM.

00:11:40.878 --> 00:11:41.879
[MEOW]

00:11:42.446 --> 00:11:43.447
VICE CHANCELLOR!

00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:45.416
WAIT UP, BLAIR!

00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:46.984

THE DUEL GHOULS.

INTERFERING WITH MY PLANS.

00:12:03.067 --> 00:12:04.468
AT THIS RATE,
WE'RE NEVER GONNA EAT.

00:12:04.802 --> 00:12:05.803
I'D EAT VEGETABLES

00:12:06.303 --> 00:12:07.304
HMM.

00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:09.673
[THINKING]
IF THIS DUEL'S

00:12:09.873 --> 00:12:11.442
N' THEM BLOKES
AREN'T GONNA

BY SENDING
ONE MONSTER CARD
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:28.959
I CAN CALL OUT
A TYPE AND LEVEL
OF A MONSTER.

00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:31.195
THEN YOU GOTTA
TAKE A CARD

00:12:31.562 --> 00:12:33.163
AND SEND IT STRAIGHT

00:12:34.164 --> 00:12:35.499
MATCH A LEVEL
WARRIOR-TYPE
MONSTER!

00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:39.770
UNBELIEVABLE!

00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:42.206
PERFECT!

00:13:03.026 --> 00:13:04.795
I'M CAN CHANGE
A MONSTER FROM
THE CENOZOIC ERA

00:13:05.095 --> 00:13:06.096
TO THE MESOZOIC ERA.

00:13:06.964 --> 00:13:08.298
SO I'LL DEVOLVE
MY FOSSIL WARRIOR!

00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:10.701
DEVOLVE?
INTO WHAT?!

00:13:11.702 --> 00:13:13.137
INTO
SOMETHING STRONGER

00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:15.539
LIKE FOSSIL WARRIOR
SKULL KNIGHT!

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.708
THEN I FURTHER
DEVOLVE IT!

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:19.710
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:20.277 --> 00:13:21.245
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT!

00:13:22.112 --> 00:13:23.480
IT'S WORTH EVERY
POINT TO BRING OUT

00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:25.282
MY FOSSIL WARRIOR
SKULL KING!

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:27.718
YEAH!!
SKULL KING!!

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:29.720
SMACK THIS GUY DOWN!

00:13:29.853 --> 00:13:30.254

MY KNIGHT'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE...

00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:49.773
BY SENDING ONE SPELL CARD
TO MY GRAVE,

00:13:50.774 --> 00:13:53.410
MY ANCHOR KNIGHT RETURNS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.015
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D DO THAT!

00:13:58.782 --> 00:13:59.783
HOW COME?

00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:01.919
SO I COULD SEE
SKULL KING
STRUT HIS STUFF!

00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:04.254
HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY ALLOWS HIM
TO ATTACK AGAIN

00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:05.923
WHEN A MONSTER'S
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:14:06.623 --> 00:14:07.624
IF IT'S
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:09.459
THE EXTRA POINTS
ARE DEALT STRAIGHT
TO YOU.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.461

00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:33.217
NOW IT'S ALL UP
TO JESSE!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.821
STILL YOUR MOVE.

00:14:38.655 --> 00:14:39.456
[THINKING]
IF I CAN'T TURN THINGS
AROUND THIS TURN,

00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:41.458
I'M A GONER.

00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:44.127
MAYBE A CHANGE
OF SCENERY
MIGHT HELP!

00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:48.732
I'M ACTIVATIN'
THE FIELD SPELL CARD

WHEN I SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMON SAPPHIRE
