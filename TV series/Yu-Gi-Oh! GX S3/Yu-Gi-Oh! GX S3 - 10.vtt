00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.647
EVERYONE'S GOT
DIFFERENT STRENGTHS!

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.649
WRONG AGAIN!

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.352
YOU CAN MASTER ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD, JADEN.

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:14.954
IT JUST TAKES PRACTICE
AND DEDICATION.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.024
WELL, IF THAT'S
THE CASE, WHY DID
YOU FAIL THE PROS?

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.427
THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT!

00:09:20.427 --> 00:09:23.329
THE REASON I NEVER
PERFECTED MY DUELING
SKILLS WAS

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.166
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD
TIME TO PRACTICE.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.201
I WAS TOO BUSY EARNING
MY DEGREE...

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:33.640
SO I COULD TEACH
UNGRATEFUL BRATS
LIKE YOU!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.545
[VIPER CHUCKLING SINISTERLY]

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.647
PARDON THE INTERRUPTION.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:41.648
VIPER?!

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.616
YES, IN THE FLESH.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:47.587
WELL, ACTUALLY IN
THE HOLOGRAM TO BE
TECHNICALLY ACCURATE.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.458
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE INSPIRATION.
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.992
LET HER GO!

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.862
THAT POWER RESTS
WITH YOU, JADEN.

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:58.431
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LOSE.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.068
YOU SEE, EVERY TIME
PROFESSOR STEIN
LOSES LIFE POINTS,

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.671
THE WATER LEVEL
RISES ACCORDINGLY.

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:07.073
AT ZERO, SHE GOES UNDER.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.975
LEAVE HER ALONE!
I MEAN IT!

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.010
ALEXIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS!

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.114
JADEN'S RIGHT, VIPER!
I CAN'T CONDONE THIS GAME.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.382
CAN'T YOU? THINK, STEIN.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:19.319
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW
SHE BETRAYED YOU?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.323
HEY, ALEXIS,
WANT TO CUT
CLASS

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:24.858
AND GO TO
THE MALL
WITH US?

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.727
THEY'RE HAVING
A SALE ON BOOTS
AND MINISKIRTS!

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.663
PLEASE.
LITTLE MISS PERFECT
BLOW OFF A CLASS?

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.432
YEAH.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.201
ACTUALLY,
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.204
I MEAN, YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MANY BOOTS AND MINISKIRTS,

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.808
RIGHT? BESIDES,
PROFESSOR STEIN
IS KIND OF DULL.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.743
UGH, HOW COULD YOU?

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.713
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE DIFFERENT!

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.615
NOW MY LAST HOPE
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.618
AT THIS ACADEMY IS GONE.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.786
SO ON WITH
THE DUEL, JADEN!

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.856
Jaden, thinking: IF
I LOSE, THEN VIPER
GETS ALL MY ENERGY!

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:59.425
BUT IF I WIN, THEN
ALEXIS IS A GONER!

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:06.432
Viper, thinking:
THAT'S RIGHT, JADEN.
GIVE IN TO YOUR ANGER.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:10.670
THE MORE VINDICTIVE
YOU BECOME, THE MORE
ENERGY YOU EXPEL.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.675
IT'S TIME TO EXPECT
THE UNEXPECTED.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.977
TO START WITH,
I'M NOT GOING TO DRAW.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.846
WHEN SCAB BLAST'S
IN THE GRAVEYARD...

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.447
I CAN ADD IT TO MY HAND

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:24.551
IN LIEU OF DRAWING
FROM MY DECK, OF COURSE.

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.586
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT IT DOES?

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.988
HERE'S A REMINDER!

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.795
ALL RIGHT, CLASS,
LESSON TWO.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.797
MY GIFT OF
THE MARTYR SPELL.

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.732
I SEND ONE MONSTER
TO THE GRAVE

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.769
AND, IN TURN, ALL OF THAT
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:45.705
TRANSFER TO THE MONSTER
OF MY CHOOSING.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.108
SO I SACRIFICE
AIR HUMMINGBIRD

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:52.478
AND GIVE HIS POWER
TO BURSTINATRIX!

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.647
AND NOW SHE ATTACKS!

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:58.151
TAKE DOWN HIS MARINER
WITH FLAME STORM!

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.421
[SCREECHES]

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.206
Syrus: IT'S BEEN
OVER AN HOUR!

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:21.908
WHERE IS
EVERYONE?

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:24.777
HOUSTON, WE
HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:25.812
WHAT'S UP?

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:27.480
THE POWER'S BEEN CUT!

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.917
THE POWER,
AS IN OUR ONLY
TICKET BACK HOME?

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.586
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
THE HERO, RIGHT, SY?

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.656
WELL, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.529
LOOK! IN THE SKY!
IT'S A BIRD!

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:46.332
IT'S A PLANE!
IT'S A HERO SIGNAL!

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:48.501
SO WHEN ONE OF
MY MONSTERS
IS DESTROYED,

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:52.572
I GET TO SUMMON
AN ELEMENTAL HERO
UP TO LEVEL 4!

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.474
SPARKMAN, COME ON DOWN!

00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:01.047
BUT WAIT! THERE'S
A LOT MORE! WATCH!

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:04.584
I ACTIVATE
SPARK BLASTER!

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.224
TAKE THAT, TEACH!

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:14.027
MY SPARK BLASTER
JUST SWITCHED
YOUR MONSTER'S MODE!

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:16.195
YOUR SCAB SCARKNIGHT
MAY BE POWERFUL,

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.830
BUT LET'S SEE
HOW HE DEALS

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.499
WITH BEING FORCED
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.571
IMPRESSIVE, MR. YUKI.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:28.107
YOU DISCOVERED A WAY
TO DESTROY MY MONSTER

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.576
WITHOUT DESTROYING
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:34.280
WHICH MEANS
YOUR FRIEND IS SAFE.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.549
SPARKMAN,
ATTACK SCARKNIGHT!

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.820

I'VE GOT A TRAP--

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.755
VICTIM BARRIER!

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.125
NO WAY!

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.594
WHEN ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS IS ATTACKING,

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.763
THIS CARD CHANGES THE TARGET!

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:52.165
AAH!

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.270
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.440
THIS ISN'T FUNNY,
VIPER! AAH!

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.342
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:03.443
ALEXIS!

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.977
EYES ON ME.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.879
WHENEVER MY
VICTIM BARRIER IS IN PLAY,

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.216
MY SCAB SCARKNIGHT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.356
NOT AGAIN!

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.726
THIS WHOLE STEALING
MY MONSTER THING
IS GETTING REAL OLD!

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.494
I'M THROWING DOWN
A FACE-DOWN.

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:22.729
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.933
ALEXIS!

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.035
ARE YOU OUT THERE?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.437
OLLIE, OLLIE OXEN FREE!

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:33.239
SHIRLEY?

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:35.675
Hassleberry: SHE MUST
SENSE SOMETHING.

00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:37.276
GUESS WE SHOULD
FOLLOW HER.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.813
Jim: WHAT DID YOU
FIND, GIRL?

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.582
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING UNDERGROUND!

00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:44.884
ALL I HEAR IS WATER.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.253
MAKES SENSE. IT IS TIME
FOR SHIRLEY'S BATH.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.455
BUT THERE'S MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.657
Alexis: MORE IMPORTANT
THAN RESCUING ME?

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.661
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE LEX!

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.467
THAT WATER MUST HAVE
A SOURCE!

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.902
LIKE THAT
WATERFALL WE SAW?

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.746
NOW WHAT?

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.382
HOLD THIS, MATE.
SIT TIGHT!

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.996
SOMEONE PLEASE...

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:31.330
HELP ME!

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.632
SORRY.

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.968
BUT I'D RATHER RESCUE
MY SCAB BLAST SPELL CARD!

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.004
AND THEN
I'LL SWITCH HIS MODE

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:40.606
TO ATTACK POSITION!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.508
AND NOW FOR
MY NEW SPARKMAN!

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.844
ATTACK JADEN DIRECTLY!

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.113
HOLD ON, BRO!

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.817
I ACTIVATE
MY HERO EMERGES
TRAP CARD!

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:53.052
NOW YOU HAVE
TO PICK A CARD
FROM MY HAND.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:56.088
IF IT'S A MONSTER
CARD, THEN I GET
TO SUMMON IT!

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.356
WHICH ONE'S
IT GONNA BE?

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.493
THE LEFT!
GOOD CHOICE!

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:03.296
YOU PICKED
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.869
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK
YOUR LIFE POINTS ARE SAFE.

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:12.305
AS USUAL,
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.540
I ACTIVATE MY SCAB BLAST!

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.614
Jaden, thinking:
I CAN STILL WIN,

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:24.016
BUT THAT MEANS
I LOSE A FRIEND!

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.675
HEY, YOU DID IT!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.845
AND JUST IN TIME!
THANKS, JIM.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.313
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
AWAY WITH IT

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.949
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS.

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:01.521
SWEET! THEY SAVED HER!
NOW I CAN GO ALL OUT!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.923
READY, PAL?
LET'S DO IT UP!

00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:06.225
ATTACK SCAB SCARKNIGHT!

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.227
I PLAY A TRAP!

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.929
GO, SCAB SCREAM!

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:13.199
SINCE NEOS HAS OVER
2,000 ATTACK POINTS,

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.736
IT'S INSTANTLY DESTROYED,
AND I DON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE!

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:19.572
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE
SLEEPING THROUGH LIFE.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:22.141
SO I'M PUTTING YOU
TO SLEEP PERMANENTLY.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.053
WHAT'S THAT?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.426
HOLD ON.
WHERE DID SCARKNIGHT GO?

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:41.727
AND WHO'S THAT GUY?

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:44.330
ARE WE CONFUSED
AGAIN, JADEN?

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.400
A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON
SHOULD CLEAR THINGS UP.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.235
IN THE
NOT-SO-DISTANT PAST,

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.771
SCARKNIGHT WAS
AN IMPENETRABLE HERO,

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:56.042
MUCH LIKE KING KHAMUDI
OF THE 15th DYNASTY.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:02.148
THIS POWERFUL WARRIOR BROUGHT
ME COUNTLESS VICTORIES.

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:11.557
BUT LIKE ME, SCARKNIGHT
WAS PUSHED TOO HARD.

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.492
[ROARING]

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.600
SOON, I LOST EVERYTHING--

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.603
MY FANS, MY CONFIDENCE,

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:27.740
AND, AS YOU CAN
PROBABLY TELL,
MY ENTHUSIASM.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.208
[CROWD BOOING]

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.477
AH! YOU'RE A HACK.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.414
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB!

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.415
EAT MY SHOE!

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:44.523
Stein: IT WAS
THEN THAT SCARKNIGHT
TRANSFORMED

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:48.961
INTO A BITTER, HARDENED
VERSION OF HIS FORMER SELF,

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.764
AND NEITHER OF US
WERE THE SAME AGAIN.

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:57.503
WE BOTH GAVE UP SO MUCH
FOR OUR LOVE OF DUELING.

00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:01.507
BUT IN THE END, I'M AFRAID
IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.342
HUH? WHAT?

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.411
SORRY.
I JUST ZONED OUT.

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.714
YOU KNOW,
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER?

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:11.350
CHILL OUT.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.919
ANYWAY,
I PLAY COCOON LARVA!

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:18.791
THEN I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACE-DOWN

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.394
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:22.962
TIME FOR YOUR FINAL LESSON--

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:25.331
SELF-SACRIFICE.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.199
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
GIVING UP A PART
OF YOURSELF

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.402
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE,

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:31.337
SOMETHING I KNOW
ALL TOO WELL,

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.540
AND SO DOES
MY SCARKNIGHT,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.476
WHICH IS WHY HE'S GOING
TO SELF-DESTRUCT!

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:42.982
AND WHEN HE DOES, YOU
AND I WILL LOSE THE REST
OF OUR LIFE POINTS!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.192
ACTIVATE TRAP!

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.602
Syrus: WHAT'S THAT?!

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.037
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT!

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:10.009
HOW UNCHARACTERISTICALLY
INTELLIGENT OF YOU.

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:12.945
YOU PLAYED COCOON VEIL.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.380
SO YOU WIN.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.349
BUT AS AKNADIN
ONCE SAID TO KING ATEM...

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:20.319
"HE WHO SITS ON HIGH HAS
THE FARTHEST TO FALL."

00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:23.656
SCARKNIGHT.

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.759
PROFESSOR!

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.602
NO.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.003
OH, MAN.

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.071
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:45.911
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.714
[VOICE OF CHILD]
JADEN, I'VE MISSED
YOU SO MUCH!

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:53.085
BUT SOON, YOU'LL BE
ALL MINE AGAIN.
