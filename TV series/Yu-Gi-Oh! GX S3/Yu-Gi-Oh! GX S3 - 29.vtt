WEBVTT

00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.637
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.573
Hassleberry: WHERE'D
THAT PORTAL TAKE
US TO, BASTION?!

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.676
AN ALTERNATE
DIMENSION BUT NOT
THE ONE FROM BEFORE.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.845
AH, A HUMAN.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.082
WHAT'S A PATHETIC
LITTLE WORM LIKE
YOU DOING UP HERE?

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.683
LOOKIN' TO TAKE
YOU DOWN!

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.853
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM!

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.221
WHEN YOU DUEL HERE,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.823
THERE'S MORE AT STAKE
THAN JUST LOSING THE GAME.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.792
SIMORGH,
FINISH HIM OFF!

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.027
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN!

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.295
FOR WHAT?

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.063
FOR MY WINGED
CREATURE TO ATTACK!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.742
MY ENERGY
WILL NOW BE ABSORBED
AND SENT TO THE STARS.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.778
PROMISE ME YOU WILL
DEFEAT THE SUPREME KING!

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.786
THIS WILL LEAD YOU
TO ANOTHER REALM
IN THIS WORLD.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.256
PERHAPS YOU WILL
FIND YOUR FRIEND
JESSE UP THERE.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.925
Jaden, thinking:
DON'T WORRY, JESSE.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.826
I KNOW YOU'RE
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.663
AND NO MATTER WHAT'S
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR,

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.966
WE'LL FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH
AND GET YOU BACK HOME.

Syrus: THAT'S GOT
TO BE THE BIGGEST DOOR
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.199
Jim: YEAH, I WONDER WHAT
IT'S TRYING TO KEEP IN.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.800
Atticus: DON'T YA
MEAN KEEP OUT?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.502
HE'S RIGHT.
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:19.239
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF JESSE'S IN
THIS WORLD, RIGHT, JAY?

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.009
Jaden: OH, HE'S HERE.
I FEEL IT IN MY GUT.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:30.150
WHOA. TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PLACE, GUYS.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.619
Chazz: WHAT'S TO LOOK AT?
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.454
AND IT SMELLS
LIKE ONE, TOO!

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.923
Syrus: YEAH, KIND OF REMINDS
ME OF THE SLIFER DORM.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.825
THIS PLACE
SEEMS DESERTED.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.627
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:44.398
I'M NOT SURE, ALEXIS,
BUT I HAVE A FEELIN'
IT WASN'T GOOD.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.067
THAT'S FOR SURE.
THIS PLACE IS
IN SHAMBLES.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.468
Alexis: LOOK UP THERE!

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.770
Atticus: IS THAT
A SHOOTING STAR?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.271
Syrus: I THINK
IT'S A COMET.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.273
Alexis:
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:57.244
AAH!

00:02:57.244 --> 00:03:00.247
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, JIM?
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:04.985
YOU OK?

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.154
SAY SOMETHING, DUDE.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.823
SORRY, MATES. I'M A-OK.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.858
JUST GOT A BIT WOBBLY
THERE FOR A SEC.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.660
MUST'VE LOOKED UP
TOO FAST.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.063
OH, MAN. THAT HAPPENS
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.931
SOMETIMES I GET
WHIPLASH!

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.534
IT'S THEM COMETS!
CAN'T TAKE MY
EYE OFF THEM.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.203
WELL, WE NEED YA
TO TUNE IN DOWN HERE!

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.472
DID YOU SAY TUNE?
WHAT DO YOU FEEL
LIKE HEARIN'?

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:26.907
OH, BOY.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.942
Hassleberry: SO WHAT'S
OUR PLAN OF ACTION?

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.445
Chazz: MIGHT AS WELL
CHECK OUT THE SIGHTS.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:33.146
Jim, voice-over:
SO IT'S ALMOST TIME.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.649
I DIDN'T THINK IT
WOULD BE THIS QUICK.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.951
Axel: THIS PLACE
COULD BE DANGEROUS.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.420
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD ALL GO
RUNNING AHEAD.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.888
I'LL SCOUT AROUND.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.291
YOU GUYS GO BACK
THROUGH THE DOOR
AND WAIT THERE.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.859
HEY, UH...

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.627
WHERE IS THE DOOR?!

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.067
SO MUCH FOR GOING BACK.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.837
GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING BACK, SYRUS.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.305
JESSE'S IN THIS WORLD.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:00.440
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.076
TOO TRUE! SO LET'S GO
FIND OUR FRIEND!

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.212
Axel: ALL RIGHT.
WE MOVE TOGETHER.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.747
AND NO UNNECESSARY
CHATTER.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.282
Syrus: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY UNNECESSARY CHATTER?

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.084
Axel: DUMB QUESTIONS
LIKE THAT.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.519
I THOUGHT THERE ARE
NO DUMB QUESTIONS.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.887
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.922
WHICH TEACHER
WAS ALWAYS MESSING
THAT SAYING UP?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.424
PROFESSOR STEIN?

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.458
OH, YEAH.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.428
SHIRLEY SENSES
SOMEONE NEARBY.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.330
WANNA CHECK IT OUT?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.232
GUESS
THAT'S A YES.

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:30.070
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.738
THIS PLACE HAS SEEN
BETTER DAYS.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.708
Axel: LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
RANSACKED THE JOINT.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.744
Syrus: AM I THE ONLY
ONE WHO REALLY DOESN'T
LIKE IT HERE?

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.846
Jim: I'M PRETTY SURE I
DON'T LIKE IT HERE EITHER.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.519
WAS THAT--STAY HERE.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.454
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.357
JADEN, WAIT!

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:51.792
TALK AND RUN, AXEL.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.660
THAT KID MIGHT
KNOW SOMETHING.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.062
I UNDERSTAND, BUT
I'M COMIN' WITH YOU.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.131
IT COULD BE A TRAP
OF SOME KIND.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.133
WELL, LET'S
FIND OUT.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.903
HEY, KID.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.838
OHH!

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.744
SCARR
SEE LITTLE SCRAP!

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.978
[CHUCKLING]

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.415
YOU NOT EVEN WARRIOR.
YOU LITTLE SEEDLING.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.017
WHY YOU STILL HERE?

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:19.786
IT NOT MATTER.
WE PLAY CATCH!

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.291
YOU FUN.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.561
I DUEL YOU AND SEND YOU
TO THE STARS.

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.764
NO. NO. DON'T.
NOT TO THERE!

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.732
PLEASE.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.267
Jaden, thinking:
I BETTER HELP THIS KID

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.002
BEFORE HE WINDS UP
GETTING STAR STRUCK!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.508
NOW, IF THAT KID
DUELS AND LOSES,

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.710
HE'LL GET SENT
TO THE STARS LIKE
THAT LAST GUY.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.178
AND THAT CAN'T
HAPPEN.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.849
WHOA. HOLD UP. WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOIN', DON'T.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.283
Jaden: HEY, UGLY!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:53.753
PICK ON SOMEONE
YOUR OWN SIZE OR CLOSER
TO IT AT LEAST.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.289
WHAT THIS? MORE
FUN FOR SCARR?

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.490
EASY, NOW.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.826
MORE KIDS?
HOW YOU SURVIVE?

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.528
YOU PROTECT THEM ALL?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.496
YOU LOOK LIKE
STRONG WARRIOR.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.999
I TAKE YOU TO OUR CAMP.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.767
BUT ME NO NEED
REST OF YOU!

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.237
ME END YOU ALL RIGHT HERE.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.706
ME SEND YOU
TO THE STARS.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.875
YOU SIT TIGHT,
STRONG ONE. YOU NO RUN.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.710
HEY, KID, TAKE COVER.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.711
OK!

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.115
I DEAL WITH HIM LATER
AND THEN THEM.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.317
NOT A CHANCE, GOT THAT?

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.286
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GETTIN' PAST ME!

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:27.654
JADEN...

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.724
LET ME AT 'EM! I'LL
TAKE HIM DOWN FOR YA, SARGE!

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.259
HE DON'T SCARE ME!

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.127
STAY BACK! I CAN'T
LET YOU DUEL.

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:36.796
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:38.331
BUT-BUT, SARGE--

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.900
Jaden: I MEAN
IT, HASSLEBERRY.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.401
YOU GUYS GET OUT OF HERE.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.136
NO STOP SCARR!

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.405
EVEN IF FRIENDS RUN,
I FIND THEM.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.274
STRONG ONES GO TO CAMP,

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:49.643
WEAK ONES TO THE STARS.

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:51.645
NO ONE ESCAPE
THE DARK FIENDS.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:54.214
NOW START
WITH YOU, SO DUEL!

00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:57.450
GAME ON!
GAME ON!

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.487

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.122

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:04.858
ME SUMMON
ARCHFIEND SOLDIER!

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.593
ME FACEDOWN ONE CARD.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.994
ME NO GO NO MORE.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.763
NOW YOU GO.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.399
DON'T LET ME DOWN,
DECK!

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.768
I DRAW!

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.570
NOW GET READY
BECAUSE I'M PLAYIN'
POLYMERIZATION!

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.507
WITH THIS CARD,
I CAN TAKE ELEMENTAL
HERO SPARKMAN

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.809
AND ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN
FROM MY HAND

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.144
AND FUSE THEM
TO SUMMON

00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:26.780
ELEMENTAL HERO
THUNDER GIANT!

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.082
THE BIGGER THEY
ARE, THE HARDER
THEY ROCK!

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.985
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
THUNDER GIANT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:35.455
SINCE YOUR MONSTER'S
GOT LESS ATTACK POINTS
THAN HIM,

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.923
MY THUNDER GIANT
CAN TAKE IT DOWN!

JADEN'S TAKING

HE NEEDED BACK-UP!

GO, JADEN!

Alexis, thinking:
JADEN'S REALLY GOIN'
AFTER THAT MONSTER.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.854
IT'S LIKE HE'S DUELING

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.956
AS THOUGH HIS LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT
OR SOMETHING.

HE'S TRYIN' TO MAKE IT

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.494
SO THAT JADEN
CAN'T SUMMON ANYTHING.

AND NOT ONLY THAT,
WITH THAT
DEVOURER BLOB,

IF JADEN MANAGES
TO FUSE,

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.135
THE MONSTERS
WILL HAVE ZERO

I SURE HOPE THAT

SINCE NECROSHADE'S
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.247

MY NEOS IS A LEVEL 7.
