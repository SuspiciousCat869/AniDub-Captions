AH, NOT ANOTHER
FUSION CARD!

00:17:57.877 --> 00:18:01.847
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO WILDHEART.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.085
HIS WILDHEART
IS IMMUNE TO TRAPS,

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.287
SO THERE GOES
GRAVITY GAIN.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.056
FORTUNATELY,
TWINHEADED BEAST

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:13.292
CAN STILL TAKE HIM
OUT IN A FIGHT!

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:16.362
WHICH MEANS...
JADEN'S FINISHED!

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.131
[GASPS]
SYRUS.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:21.400
IT'S ME.
BASTION?!

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.536
SO HOW'S JADEN
DOING THESE DAYS?

00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:25.371
WE HEARD THAT
HE HAD TURNED HIMSELF

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:27.773
INTO SOME SORT OF
DARK AND EVIL RULER!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.008
BASTION!

00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:31.377
HE CERTAINLY ISN'T PLAYING
THE PART VERY WELL.

00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:33.980
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE'S RULER OF ANYTHING.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.182
HE ISN'T THE KING.

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:37.783
AT LEAST NOT ANYMORE.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.052
BUT HE'S STILL HAUNTED
BY ALL THE DARK MEMORIES,

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.654
AND HE'S LOSING
BECAUSE OF IT!

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.556
AH!
HE'S LOSING?!

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.461
Syrus:
THAT'S RIGHT, BASTION,
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE!

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.030
YOU SEE HE'S AFRAID
TO USE ANY FUSION CARDS

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.798
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE DESTRUCTION THEY CAUSED

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.634
WHEN HE WAS THE SUPREME KING!

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:57.637
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.072
BUT IF HE DOESN'T
PLAY ONE NOW,
HE'LL LOSE.

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.874
[Jaden thinking]
I CAN'T GET PAST IT.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.645
THESE CARDS, THEY CAUSED
TOO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:08.781
I WON'T....I WON'T
USE THEM EVER AGAIN!

[SCREAMING]

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.593
ALL THOSE POOR PEOPLE...

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:22.395
I CAN'T RISK IT.

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:24.096
WHAT IF TURN DARK AGAIN...
