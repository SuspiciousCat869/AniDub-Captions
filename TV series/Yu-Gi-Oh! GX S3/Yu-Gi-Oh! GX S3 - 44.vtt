00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:39.259
EVEN YOUR HAND IS EMPTY.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.994
IT MAY BE...

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:45.165
BUT IF THIS IS
MY LAST MATCH,
I'M GONNA MAKE IT COUNT!

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:46.399
OH, REALLY?

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.068
Zane: YOU KNOW IT!

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.669
YOU SEE...I'VE DUELED

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.338
ALL OVER
THIS CRAZY WORLD,

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.206
IN ALL SORTS OF PLACES.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.008
I'VE BATTLED
IN STADIUMS...

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:56.609
AND UNDERGROUND ARENAS.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:57.978
N' YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.814
LOOKING BACK, I REALIZE
I HAD ALL THE GLORY...

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.384
[GROANS] BUT
I MISSED OUT ON HAVING
ANY OF THE FUN!

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.654
SO IF THIS IS
THE LAST DUEL
I EVER TAKE PART IN...

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.789
I CAN GUARANTEE...

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.992
THAT WHETHER
I WIN OR LOSE

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.427
I'M GOING TO ENJOY
EVERY LAST MOVE.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.462
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.230
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.132
I'M SORRY!

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:20.667
SORRY THAT
IN YOUR LAST DUEL...

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.269
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET ANY OF THE FUN
OR THE GLORY THIS TIME.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.841
OHH. COME ON ZANE!

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.810
YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO HIM BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR TURN TO SHINE!

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.545
YOU CAN DO IT, ZANE!

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:36.416
[CHUCKLES]
YOU KNOW IT, SY!
I DRAW!

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.485
HMM...

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:40.553
AND PLAY
CYBER VALLEY!

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.756
NOW, HOW DO YOU PLAN ON
BEATING ME WITH THAT?!

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.257
THAT CARD'S USELESS.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.559
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO
ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS!

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.129
BUT IT HAS 3 VERY
SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.797
AND I GET TO CHOOSE
ONE OF EM...

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:52.732
[GROWLS]
AND I CHOOSE...

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.668
CYBER VALLEY'S
SECOND ABILITY!

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.003
AND HERE'S
WHAT IT DOES.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.671
BY REMOVING
MY CYBER VALLEY

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.573
AND MY CYBERNETIC
HIDDEN TECHNOLOGY

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.608
FROM THE GAME,

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:04.277
I GET TO DRAW
TWO CARDS.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:07.280
AND NOW, I THINK
I'LL ACTIVATE
ONE OF THEM.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.548
WITH OVERLOAD FUSION,

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.817
IF I REMOVE
MY 3 CYBER DRAGONS,

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.318
AS WELL AS
BARRIER DRAGON

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.220
AND MY CYBER
LASER DRAGON...

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.423
THIS SPELL LETS ME
FUSION SUMMON...

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:19.659
MY CHIMERATECH--
FORTRESS DRAGON!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.396
[ROARS]

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.865
AND WITH HIM OUT,
YOU DON'T STAND
A CHANCE!

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.400
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.602
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR DRAGON'S JUST AS WEAK
AS THE LAST ONE!

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.938
AND JUST
AS DANGEROUS!

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.139
YOU SEE, EVEN THOUGH

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.041
MY CHIMERATECH
FORTRESS DRAGON

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.376
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
BITE TO DESTROY

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.344
A MONSTER
WHEN IT ATTACKS,

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.147
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
SURE DOES MAKE UP
FOR IT!

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.483
WHENEVER IT ATTACKS,
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.585
TAKE 400 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.820
WELL, BRING IT ON.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.488
OH, I INTEND TO...

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.557
'CAUSE FOR
EVERY MONSTER
I SACRIFICED,

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.392
MY CHIMERATECH NOW
GETS TO ATTACK YOU

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.827
THE SAME
NUMBER OF TIMES!

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:55.562
YOU WANT ME
TO BRING IT ON...

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:57.063
CONSIDER IT BROUGHT!

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.566
NOW LET'S
START THE COUNTDOWN
TO YOUR DEMISE!

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:03.236
GO, SONIC SCREECH!
[ROARS]

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:04.604
[YELPS]

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.741
AND THERE'S 4 MORE
WHERE THAT
CAME FROM!

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.212
ATTACK!

[ROARS]

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.114
AAH!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.116
AND WE'RE NOT
DONE YET!

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.620
[ROARS]
AAH!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.523
HOW YA FEELIN?!
HIT'EM AGAIN!

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:24.691
[ROARS]

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.660
AAH!

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.129
SO IS THAT
ALL YOU GOT?!

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.363
NOT AT ALL!

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.299
I HAVE ONE MORE
ATTACK LEFT!

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.536
CHIMERATECH,
END THIS NOW!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.006
[ALL GROANING]

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:43.009
ZANE? JESSE?!

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.922
[GASP]
DISAPPOINTED?

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:57.790
BET YOU THOUGHT
THE DUEL WAS OVER.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.092
BUT THANKS TO THIS,

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.728
YOU AND I AREN'T FINISHED
DUELING EACH OTHER JUST YET!

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:04.130
BEFORE YOUR CHIMERATECH'S
FOURTH ATTACK,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.566
I ACTIVATED THE TRAP CARD
RAINBOW LIFE!

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:07.967
NOW, DUE TO ITS EFFECT,

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.035
ALL THE DAMAGE
I WOULD HAVE

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.436
TAKEN FROM THOSE
FIRST ATTACKS

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.871
GETS ADDED
TO MY LIFE POINTS,

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:15.942
AND THE ONLY DAMAGE I TAKE
IS FROM YOUR LAST ATTACK.

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:19.612
AAH!

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:22.515
UHH!

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.118
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:26.519
SO, TELL ME, ZANE,

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.488
WAS THAT MOVE
A REAL HEART STOPPER?

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.657
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING TOO GOOD!

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:34.027
LISTEN UP-- AS LONG
AS I HAVE A CARD
LEFT TO PLAY,

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.662
IT AIN'T OVER!

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:39.599
[GASP] BUT ZANE!
YOUR HAND'S EMPTY!

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:41.134
ALL RIGHT...

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.303
IF PLAYING A FACEDOWN
IS THE BEST YOU CAN DO,

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.872
THEN MAYBE
I SHOULD PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY!

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.341
NOW THEN,
LET'S END THIS!

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.344
RAINBOW DARK DRAGON,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.613
[GROWLS, ROARS]

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.615
[GROWLS] I PLAY
THE SPELL...

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.217
DIMENSION EXPLOSION.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.285
I RETURN ONE FUSION
MONSTER TO MY DECK

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.921
AND ANY MONSTERS
WE REMOVED COME BACK!

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.224
SO THAT MEANS,
BY REMOVING CHIMERATECH,

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:07.427
I CAN SUMMON BACK
A COUPLE MORE DRAGONS!

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:08.428
BUT THEN...

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:11.497
FOR THE PRICE OF
ONE DRAGON, YOU GET 4!

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.970
THAT'S RIGHT, AND WITH
CYBER VALLEY BACK,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.005
I ACTIVATE ITS FIRST
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:21.207
BY REMOVING
THIS DRAGON FROM PLAY,

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:24.010
NOT ONLY CAN I DRAW
A CARD FROM MY DECK...

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.946
BUT THE BATTLE PHASE
IS OVER!

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.087

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.391
HE'S CERTAINLY LIVED UP
TO HIS REPUTATION,

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:41.494
BUT I HAVE ONE ADVANTAGE
HE DOESN'T-- TIME.

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:44.998
AND FROM THE LOOKS
OF THINGS, HE WON'T
BE AROUND MUCH LONGER!

THE POOR BOY
KEEP DUELING?!

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:49.936
HE'S A FIGHTER.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.237
AND HE'LL
KEEP FIGHTING!

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.438
BUT HE WON'T LAST...

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.606
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.774
YEAH!

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.875
WE CAN'T GIVE UP!

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.310
HE'S BEEN THROUGH WORSE!

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.612
AND HE'LL FIND A WAY
TO WIN THIS BATTLE!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.014

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:02.115

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.320

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.491
WHAT DOES THAT DO?

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:14.560
[THINKING] MORE THAN
YOU'LL EVER KNOW!

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:19.499
NEXT, I'LL
ACTIVATE THE MAGIC

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:21.668
WITH THIS SPELL CARD,
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON

WITH ANOTHER
CYBER DRAGON

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.373
I CAN FUSE 3 OF THEM

EQUAL TO OUR MONSTERS'
