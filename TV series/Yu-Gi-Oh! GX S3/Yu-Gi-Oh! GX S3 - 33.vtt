YOU CARE
ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:14.361
I MEAN, I'M ALL ALONE NOW,

HANG ON!
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS!

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.843
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.378
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO.

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:33.313
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT I'M NOT THERE.

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:34.748

HEY, SY, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING RID OF ME

WE'VE BEEN
FRIENDS FOR
FAR TOO LONG, BUDDY.

THEY'VE DROPPED.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.869
A DUEL ISN'T OVER TILL
THE LAST CARD IS PLAYED.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.172
YOU GOTTA
KEEP IT TOGETHER

I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO GAVE UP, JADEN.
YOU ARE!

WHAT WOULD YOU DO, J,

BUT THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN CONTROL IS YOU.

NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, SY,

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:56.823
A FRIEND IS STILL A FRIEND.

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:59.058
I'D HAVE YOUR BACK
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.794
YOU'D DO THE SAME
FOR ME, WOULDN'T YOU?

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.064
OF COURSE.

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.033
OF COURSE WHAT,
SYRUS?

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.301
AAH!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.136
Zane: YOU KNOW WHAT DREAMS
ARE, LITTLE BROTHER?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.971
THEY'RE HOW WE TELL
OURSELVES THINGS,

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.372
THINGS WE DON'T
WANT TO HEAR.

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.208
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO, SY.

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.009
YOU HAVE TO SET
THINGS STRAIGHT
WITH JADEN.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:26.719
Syrus: SO, ZANE,
HOW DO I SET THINGS
STRAIGHT WITH JADEN?

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:29.188
WELL, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE EASY, SY.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:30.423
IT'LL TAKE GUTS

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:32.658
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BE BRUTALLY
HONEST WITH HIM,

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.694
BUT THAT'S
NOTHING NEW TO YOU.

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:36.963
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
HAD THE GUTS TO TRY
AND SET ME STRAIGHT?

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.201
Syrus: WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, ZANE?

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.503
THIS ISN'T A DUEL.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.238
IT'S SICK.

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:47.039
JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.641
TRUST ME.

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:50.710
WHEN I STARTED DUELING
IN THE UNDERGROUND,

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.278
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.081
BUT THEN I DISCOVERED
THE PLEASURE OF PAIN.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.949
DUELS AREN'T ALL
FUN AND GAMES.

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.184
THEY HURT!

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.785
THEY'RE ABOUT ENDURING
ANGUISH

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.988
AND MAKING YOUR
OPPONENT SUFFER!

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:03.589
YOU DON'T MEANT THAT.

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.224
YOU USED TO CARE,
ZANE,

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.994
AND YOU USED TO HAVE
RESPECT FOR YOUR OPPONENTS.

00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.929
RESPECT IS FOR LOSERS.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.063
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.298
I'LL PROVE IT.

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:13.566
YOU JUST WATCH.

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:14.634
MY MOVE!

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:17.403
Zane: YOU STOOD UP
TO ME THAT DAY,

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.972
AND NOW YOU'LL HAVE
TO DO THE SAME THING
WITH JADEN.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:23.042
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE
THAT SAME STRENGTH
TO GET HIM BACK.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.745
YOU WERE WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR ME.

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.247
WHY AREN'T YOU
WILLING TO FIGHT FOR
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.549
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.551
YOU JUST MIGHT BE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM,

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.053
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.289
WAIT. HANG ON.

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:37.823
WHAT IF HE'S LIKE
YOU, ZANE?

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:40.126
WHAT IF HE
DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE?

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.628
Zane:
YOU'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:43.629
DON'T GO.

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:46.299
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:47.466
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:50.937
SY, LIKE I SAID,
YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.606
YOU CAN DO THIS
ON YOUR OWN.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.978
Yellow: I FEEL
FOR YOU, SY.

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.283
WAIT!

00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:06.619
MY DUEL DISK.

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.296
HMM?

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:20.166
FINALLY.

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:21.801
HOW WAS YOUR
LITTLE HEART-TO-HEART?

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.336
ANY SUCCESS?

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.004
WE'LL SEE.

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:26.172
HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:27.573
I MEAN, WE'LL SEE.

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.608
HOLD UP.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.242
YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE HIM ALL ALONE?

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.377
WAIT.

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.015
[THINKING]
I CAN'T WAIT.

00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:37.883
I'M RUNNING OUT
OF TIME,

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:40.620
AND I STILL HAVE
SOMETHING I NEED TO DO.

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:43.222
SLOW DOWN,
ZANE.

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:45.958
WAIT FOR ME.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:49.862
HMM.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:51.998
WHERE YOU GOING?

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.433
WHAT IF THAT WAY
IS DANGEROUS?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.137
AHH... AHH...

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.739
[SOBBING]

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.040
THAT WAY'S PERFECT!

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.608
GOOD CHOICE, SYRUS.

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:06.412
Yellow: OH! OH, NO,
NOT WATER AGAIN.

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:08.180
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T SWIM.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.715
HEY, I'VE GOT
AN IDEA.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.283
HOW ABOUT WE
BECOME BEST FRIENDS,

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.886
AND THAT WAY, WE'LL
PROTECT EACH OTHER?

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.488
HEY, HAVE YOU
MET SYRUS?

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.156
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND,

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.791
MY BEST FRIEND
SYRUS.

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:20.292
WE GO EVERYWHERE
TOGETHER...

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:22.728
[THINKING]
JUST LIKE ZANE SAID,
I'VE GOT TO BE STRONG

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:25.197
IF I PLAN ON GETTING
MY BEST FRIEND BACK.

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.833
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH,
BUT I KNOW I CAN DO IT.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.102
JADEN'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE
BY MY SIDE

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.570
TO HELP ME OUT.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.939
HE'S COME TO MY RESCUE
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.409
AND IT'S TIME I PAY
HIM BACK.

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:38.077
I'M NOT GONNA
LET HIM DOWN.

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:40.579
NOT NOW, NOT TOMORROW,

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.580
NOT NEVER.

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.051
I KNOW I CAN HELP
MY PAL OUT

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:46.252
AND IT'S TIME
I GOT STARTED.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.923
HMM, JUST LIKE THAT COMET'S
COURSE HAS STAYED STEADY,

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.358
SO WILL MINE.

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:54.927
JADEN SAID HE WOULDN'T REST
UNTIL HE FOUND JESSE,

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.562
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:59.932
I'M NOT STOPPING
UNTIL I FIND MY FRIEND.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:03.102
THIS WORLD IS A SCARY PLACE,
BUT IT'S NOT SCARIER

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:05.271
THAN THE THOUGHT
OF LOSING MY FRIEND FOREVER.
