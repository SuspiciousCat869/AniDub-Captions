00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.468
BESIDES, I'M GOING TO BE
DUELING JADEN SOON.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.637
BUT FIRST, I NEED
TO REGAIN MY ENERGY.

00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:01.241
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I WILL FEED OFF YOUR DARKNESS.

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:03.977
GAME ON!

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:05.578
THE FIRST MOVE IS MINE!

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.580
I DRAW.
AND I'M PLAYING

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.883
THE SPELL CARD KNOWN
AS TRIANGLE FORCE.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.918
WITH THIS CARD ACTIVATED,

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.721
I CAN DRAW TWO EXACT
COPIES FROM MY DECK

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.057
AND ACTIVATE THEM AS WELL.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.327
BUT YOU SEE, ADRIAN,
THIS IS JUST A MEANS
TO AN END.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.164
'CAUSE BY SENDING ALL THREE
CARDS TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:28.234
I CAN SUMMON THE LORD OF
STRIKING THUNDER, HAMON!

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.071
AH!

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.406
BEHOLD THE STORM!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:38.311
AND BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE
RECKONING OF MY SACRED BEAST.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.579
WELL DONE.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.014
BUT DON'T THINK
I'M SCARED.

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:42.749
BECAUSE...
WITH ONE MORE CARD,

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.819
EXODIA WILL BE COMPLETE.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.020
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.790
NEXT UP, I ACTIVATE
MY HAND DESTRUCTION!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.093
AND WITH THIS,
WE BOTH HAVE TO SEND
FOUR CARDS

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.928
FROM OUR HANDS
TO OUR GRAVEYARDS...

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.297
AND THEN REDRAW
FROM OUR DECKS.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:59.432
[EVIL SNICKER]
NOW, THEN...

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.302
IF YOU WERE GOING FOR EXODIA,
THAT'S GOT TO HURT!

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:03.536
HUH.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.571
HA HA.

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:06.539
ESPECIALLY AFTER
ALL YOU DID--

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.909
HAVING USED YOUR DEAREST AND
CLOSEST FRIEND ECHO,

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.211
WHO, BY THE WAY,

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:13.513
APPARENTLY HARBORED
VERY STRONG FEELINGS FOR YOU.

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:14.948
HUH.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.950
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.952
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
THE POWER OF EXODIA

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.820
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE...

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.158
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ECHO'S
LOYALTY AND YOU LET YOUR
DARKNESS DESTROY HER.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.364
AND NOW IT SEEMS HER SACRIFICE
IS ALL FOR NOTHING...

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.868
THE POWER THOSE CARDS
CAN RELEASE IS NOW BURIED
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.303
GO ON,
DISCARD THEM.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.343
I'D SAY "MAYBE NEXT TIME,"
BUT THERE WON'T BE A NEXT TIME.

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:44.744
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:46.412
I DRAW!

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:47.413
HUH.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.715
AT THIS MOMENT,

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:52.285
I ACTIVATE THE RITUAL
OF THE ULTIMATE
FORBIDDEN LORD!

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:55.889
AND IT'S THANKS TO YOU
THAT I CAN PLAY
THIS SPELL CARD.

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:57.957
YOU MADE ME DISCARD
MY HAND...

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.394
PUTTING ALL FIVE
FORBIDDEN CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.596
SO NOW I GET TO
ACTIVATE THIS SPELL.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.998
FIRST THINGS FIRST,

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.067
ALL THE FORBIDDEN CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD
RETURN TO MY HAND..

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.569
I PUT THREE OF THEM--

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.905
THE LEFT ARM, THE LEFT
LEG, AND THE RIGHT LEG--

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:15.708
BACK INTO MY DECK,
THEN RESHUFFLE.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.677
AS FOR THE OTHER TWO,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.146
I RESEND THEM
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:23.583
AND TO MY FIELD,
I WILL NOW SUMMON...

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:26.853
EXODIOS, THE ULTIMATE
FORBIDDEN LORD!

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.221
AH!

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.458
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:43.469
WITH MY EXODIOS
ON THE FIELD,
VICTORY WILL BE MINE!

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.140
HOW COME ITS ATTACK POINTS
AREN'T DETERMINED?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.975
MY OTHER CARDS
WILL DETERMINE THAT.

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:50.577
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:53.079
FOR EVERY FORBIDDEN CARD
I HAVE IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.881
IT GETS 1000 POINTS.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.383
SO WITH TWO EXODIA PARTS
IN MY GRAVE,

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.620
MY EXODIOS GETS
2000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.921
HA HA!

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:05.225
THAT FLEA'LL BREAK
AGAINST THE POWER OF HAMON!

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.928
NOT WHEN I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL BURDEN
OF THE MIGHTY!

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:11.798
ITS EFFECT ROBS ALL
THE MONSTERS ON YOUR
FIELD OF ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:14.100
100 POINTS
FOR EACH LEVEL.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.835
AND SINCE HAMON
IS LEVEL 10,

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.637
IT LOSES 1000 POINTS!

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:21.674
THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE HARDER THEY FALL!

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.875
AND ONE MORE THING,

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.911
WHEN EXODIOS ATTACKS
ANOTHER MONSTER,

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.146
AN EXODIA PART IS SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.649
GIVING IT A THOUSAND
MORE ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:32.385
SO OUR MONSTERS ARE
NOW EQUAL OPPONENTS.

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:34.887
THAT MAY BE.
BUT HERE'S THE KICKER--

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:36.990
EXODIOS CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.991
AH!

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.426
EXODIOS, ATTACK HAMON!

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:49.269
I ACTIVATE
THE DELTA BARRIER TRAP CARD!

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.672
AND ITS EFFECT TRIGGERS
THE OTHER COPIES OF IT
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:55.074
AND WHEN I'VE GOT THREE DELTA
BARRIERS ON MY FIELD,

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:57.010
THEN DURING MY TURN,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.713
ONE OF MY MONSTERS CAN DEFLECT
AN ATTACK, NO MATTER HOW
POWERFUL THE OPPONENT.

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.248
SO IN OTHER WORDS,

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.717
YOUR ATTACK
WON'T DESTROY HAMON.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.586
AAH!

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.624
THAT ATTACK
WASN'T THE POINT.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.992
THE POINT WAS
TO DISCARD.

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:15.261
DUE TO EXODIOS' ABILITY,

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.764
WHEN ALL FIVE
EXODIA PARTS
ARE IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.966
EXODIA BECOMES COMPLETE.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.234
AND THIS DUEL IS OVER.

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:22.735
OH, ADRIAN...

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.971
YOU JUST CAN'T LET GO
OF EXODIA, CAN YOU?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.040
WHY WOULD I?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.641
YOUR MOVE.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.043
ALRIGHT, THEN.

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:34.047
I SEND THREE TRAP CARDS
FROM MY FIELD TO MY GRAVE,

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.049
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
MY SECOND SACRED BEAST!

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:39.052
URIA, LORD OF
SEARING FLAMES!

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:43.423
AND LIKE YOUR EXODIOS,
URIA'S STRENGTH RELIES
ON OTHER CARDS AS WELL.

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:44.924
SO CHECK THIS OUT.

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:47.060
FOR EVERY TRAP CARD
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.763
MY SACRED BEAST GAINS
A THOUSAND ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.700
BUT BECAUSE OF MY BURDEN
OF THE MIGHTY SPELL CARD,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.802
URIA LOSES
A THOUSAND OF'EM.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.339
NORMALLY THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.607
BUT I'VE GOT
AN EQUIP SPELL READY!

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.043
I ACTIVATE ETERNAL REVERSE!

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.979
SO URIA WON'T BE LOSING
ANY ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:10.316
WITH THIS CARD,
EACH TURN I FORCE
A CARD FACEDOWN,

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:13.486
AND THEN MAKE THAT SPELL
OR TRAP CARD USELESS.

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.888
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:18.057
IF YOU SOMEHOW OUT-POWER
URIA IN BATTLE...

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:19.959
IT'LL BE SAFE.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:23.396
BY SENDING ETERNAL REVERSE
TO THE GRAVEYARD, I CAN
NEGATE URIA'S DESTRUCTION.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.465
AS FOR YOUR BURDEN
OF THE MIGHTY CARD,

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:26.899
NOW THAT IT'S FACEDOWN,

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:29.869
THE SPELL'S NO LONGER
AFFECTING HAMON, EITHER.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.905
SO BOTH MY MONSTERS
GET THEIR ATTACK POINTS BACK.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.777
AND NOW,
TIME TO TAKE OUT THAT CARD.

00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:40.413
I ACTIVATE URIA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:44.150
ONCE EVERY TURN,
THIS SEARING BEAST CAN
OBLITERATE ONE FACEDOWN SPELL

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.153
OR TRAP CARD ON YOUR FIELD.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.188
GO, TRAP DESTRUCTION!

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.760
AAH!

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.496
AND NOW, 'CAUSE I DON'T
WANNA LEAVE ANYONE OUT,

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:58.231
HAMON, LORD OF
STRIKING THUNDER...

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.832
ATTACKS EXODIOS!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.568
GO, CERULEAN SKYFIRE!

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:09.976
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:13.379
EXODIOS CAN'T BE
DESTROYED!

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:16.048
MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU'LL
STILL TAKE SOME DAMAGE.

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.117
AAH!

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.352
[CHUCKLING]

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.387
AAH!

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.757
WHAT NOW, ADRIAN?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.692
I THINK YOU KNOW...

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.094
YUBEL.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.695
BETTER BRACE YOURSELF,

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.831
EXODIOS IS COMING
FOR URIA,

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:34.000
WHICH MEANS I CAN SEND
ONE MORE EXODIA PART

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.068
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:40.373
WITH ONE MORE CARD ADRIAN'LL
HAVE EVERYTHING HE NEEDS
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:42.575
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:45.578
GO, EXODIOS!
ATTACK!

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.883
HMM. HUH?

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.253
LIKE I SAID EARLIER,

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.722
BY SENDING ETERNAL REVERSE
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:58.791
I CAN PREVENT
URIA'S DESTRUCTION.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.027
WELL, I STILL ACHIEVED
MY GOAL.

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:04.130
AND NOW ALL I NEED
IS JUST ONE MORE CARD.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.032
EXODIOS'LL ATTACK
ON MY NEXT TURN...

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:07.266
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.968
EXODIA WILL BE COMPLETE.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.203
HA HA!

00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:12.905
AND THEN THE THRONE WILL
BE YOURS, IS THAT IT?

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.307
HOW WONDERFUL.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.242
YOU'LL RULE THIS
WRETCHED DIMENSION.

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:18.978
THE VERMIN LIVING HERE
WILL CALL YOU THEIR KING.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.413
[CHUCKLING]

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.448
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND
RATHER SAD, THOUGH?

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.283
NO ONE WILL BY HAPPY
FOR YOU, ADRIAN.

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:25.785
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.653
YOU DESTROYED
YOUR ONLY FRIEND ECHO!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:28.654
HUH.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.360
YOU MIGHT COMPLETE EXODIA
AND DESTROY ME.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.461
BUT WILL IT MATTER?

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.064
THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER

SHE'D RATHER BE
BY YOUR SIDE.

BUT IF YOU WANNA
KID YOURSELF, GO AHEAD!

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:04.524
I ACTIVATE,
THE SPELL DUAL GATE!

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:05.958
BY TAKING THIS CARD...

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.728
AND REMOVING IT FROM PLAY ALONG
WITH MY OTHER DUAL GATE CARD

00:17:08.728 --> 00:17:10.096
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:12.031
I CAN DRAW TWO NEW CARDS.

NEXT, I SUMMON TO THE FIELD

WHEN ILLUSION BRIGADIER IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED...

I GET TO SUMMON A BRIGADIER
TOKEN FOR EVERY OTHER MONSTER
ON MY FIELD.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:26.045
SO WITH TWO SACRED BEASTS
ALREADY THERE, I GET TWO!

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.654
AND HERE'S THE BEST PART--

00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:38.024
FOR EACH BRIGADIER,
YOU GET HIT FOR 300
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:44.163

YOUR LIFE POINTS GET WIPED OUT.

00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:46.926
YOU CAN'T DESTROY IT
IN BATTLE.

AND ONCE EVERY TURN,
IF IT'S IN ATTACK MODE,

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:54.967
IT DEALS TEN THOUSAND POINTS
OF BATTLE DAMAGE TO ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.435
HUH?

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.272
IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE SHOW.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.641

HUH? WHAT?!

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:11.484
I HAVEN'T ATTACKED YET,
SO THIS IS STILL MY MAIN PHASE,

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:14.553
AND DURING IT,
ARMITYLE CAN MOVE TO
THE OPPONENT'S FIELD.

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:16.555
BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:17.923
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.458
N' WHILE IT'S OVER THERE..

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.793
AND ITS ABILITY ACTIVATES..

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:23.462
IT CAN BREAK THROUGH
EXODIOS'S DEFENSE.

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:26.098
GO, PHANTOM OF FURY!

AT THE END OF THE TURN,
ARMITYLE REMOVES ALL
OTHER MONSTERS FROM PLAY...

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:35.508
SO SAY ADIOS TO EXODIOS.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.509
