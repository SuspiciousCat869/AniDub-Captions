00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.227
GUESS YOUR FRIENDS.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.196
UNTIL HE RUNS OUT
OF FOOD THAT IS!

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.164
[GROWLING]

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.800
GOOD GIRL, WANT S'MORE?
HOW 'BOUT THESE!

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:22.802
WITH CREAM FILLING!

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.706
WHOA! THAT'S QUITE A SET
OF MOLARS YOU GOT THERE.

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.042
Jim, voice-over:
I REMEMBER NOW...

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.778
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW FAST
SHIRLEY TOOK TO JADEN

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.614
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY HAD
A SPECIAL CONNECTION.

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:36.883
BUT EVERYONE FEELS
THAT WAY ABOUT JADEN.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.285
HE'S EVERYONE'S FRIEND.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.888
I THINK THAT SHIRLEY'S
LIKE ME.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:43.890
[GRUMBLING]

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.459
SHE LIKES
TO EAT.

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:53.967
[GROAN]

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:54.968
JADEN.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:56.269
Woman:
YOU'RE AWAKE.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:57.737
HMM... WHO?

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.507
MY NAME IS CLARET.
[CHUCKLE]

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:02.876
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
"YOUR FRIEND,"

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.245
NEVER LEFT YOUR SIDE
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.380
HMPH. SHE'S PROTECTIVE.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.382
[GROWLS]

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:10.984
SO YOU'RE ALIVE!

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.887
I HOPE THAT YOU FEEL
NO ILL WILL TOWARD ME.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:15.889
I AM SORRY.

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:17.791
NO HARM, NO FOUL RIGHT?

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.160
I'M AFRAID THE FRIEND
YOU SEEK...

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:22.162
HAS NOT BEEN SEEN.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.097
HE'S RIGHT, JIM.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.699
NO ONE HERE IN
THE VILLAGE KNOWS
OF HIS WHEREABOUTS.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.668
WHICH MEANS...

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:29.202
UH-OH.

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:30.804
"UH-OH" IS RIGHT.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:34.074
JADEN IS NOW A PRISONER...
OF THE KING!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.943
THIS DOES NOT BODE WELL
FOR YOUR COMRADE.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.079
IT'S BEST
IF YOU STAY HERE!

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.915
YOUR FRIEND,
CANNOT BE HELPED.
HMM?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.983
NO ONE HAS EVER
BEEN RESCUED

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:46.686
FROM THE SUPREME
KING'S TOWER.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:48.822
STAY WITH US,
AND HELP COMBAT

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:50.824
THE FIENDS
WHEN THEY RETURN!

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:52.826
WE NEED HEROES.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.661
AND I AM
BUT ONE MAN.

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:56.663
WILL YOU STAY
AND FIGHT?

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.733
[LAUGHS] BURGUNDY!
YOU SHOULD JUST RELAX!

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.536
"RELAX?"
[LAUGHS]

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.139
WE CAN'T STAY.
WE HAVE'TA LEAVE.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.241
BUT YOUR FRIEND...
IS LOST.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.410
HE'D DO EVERYTHING
TO SAVE US,

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:12.245
AND NOW WE HAVE
TO DO THE SAME!

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:13.847
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.182
YOUR FRIEND
CANNOT BE FREED!

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.985
IF YOU GO,
YOU WON'T COME BACK.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.521
I GUESS THEN...
THIS'LL BE GOOD-BYE.

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:23.523
HMM.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.060
Nero: GOOD LUCK!

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.595
I'LL PROTECT THE VILLAGE!

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:30.396
DON'T YOU WORRY!

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.632
JUST WHO
IS THIS... "JADEN?"

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.634
WELL HE MUST BE
THEIR HERO.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.103
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY
FIGHT A LOSING BATTLE?

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:41.107
BECAUSE, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE
BETWEEN DESTRUCTION...

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:44.911
AND, THE HOPE
FOR OUR TOMORROWS.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:47.814
YOU'N'ME...

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.382
AGAINST A WORLD
OF MONSTERS?

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.785
OH, YEAH. THOSE ARE
JUST THE ODDS I LIKE!

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.189
JIM, READY
TO GIVE THIS KING
THE ROYAL TREATMENT?!

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.725
YEP! LET'S GO!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.938
TAKE THE ROAD
HEADING NORTH.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:14.407
IT WILL LEAD YOU TO
THE SUPREME KING.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.043
YOU WILL SEE A TOWER,
BUT BE CAREFUL.

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:21.414
IT'S SURE TO BE HEAVILY GUARDED
BY THE FIENDS OF THE DARK ARMY.

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.217
Axel: HOLD UP, JIM.

00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:26.219
LOOK!

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.253
THAT'S OUR PLACE!

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.425
WELL WHAT D'YA SAY WE GO
AND FIND OUR MATE JADEN!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.427
Axel: LET'S DO IT.

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.595
HANG ON!

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:39.399
WHAT DO YOU MAKE
A'THIS AXEL?

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:40.967
SEEMS EMPTY.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.368
TOO EMPTY.

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:43.670
SO YOU RECKON
IT'S A TRAP.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.471
IT SURE FEELS
THAT WAY.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.674
WHAT ARE
YOU THINKIN'
WE SHOULD DO?

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.809
I'M THINKIN'
WE SHOULD FIND OUT!

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.148
HMM, STILL NOT A FIEND
IN SIGHT...

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.484
Axel: LOOK AT ALL
THE DUEL DISKS, JIM.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.621
UNBELIEVABLE. I WONDER WHERE
ALL THE OWNERS COULD BE.

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:03.623
[KOZAKY LAUGHS]
HMM?

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.225
THE DUELISTS YOU ASK FOR

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.293
HAVE ALL BEEN SENT...
FAR AWAY.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:10.697
BUT I CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR YOU BOTH TO JOIN THEM.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:13.800
ALL IT TAKES IS FOR YOU
TO CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL.

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:15.768
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:17.370
SO YOU MEAN
THEY'VE ALL BEEN

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.072
SENT... TO THE STARS?!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.674
[LAUGHS]

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:25.211
BUT NOT BEFORE BEING DRAINED
OF ALL THEIR DUEL ENERGY.

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:28.281
THE SUPREME KING IS ABSORBING
ALL OF THIS POWER...

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:30.683
SO THAT HE CAN
FINALLY SUMMON UP:

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:34.420
THE GREATEST DUEL MONSTER
CARD EVER CREATED!

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.123
I'M AFRAID WHOEVER
YOU CAME TO FIND...

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.459
IS ONE WITH THE STARS!

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.195
WAIT! ARE THERE ARE
NO DUELISTS LEFT?

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.197
THAT'S RIGHT!...

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.898
THE SUPREME KING
HAS DUELED THEM ALL,

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.034
AND THEY'VE ALL
BEEN DEFEATED!

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.537
NOTHING QUITE WARMS
THE ROTTING CEREBELLUM

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.807
AS WATCHING A DUELIST
DISSOLVE INTO STARDUST...

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.010
AS YOU'LL DISCOVER
SOON ENOUGH!

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.078
HEE-HA-HAAA!
DOES THAT MEAN...

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:00.747
JADEN LOST HERE?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.018
UHH... UHH.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:07.020
NO WAY! SORRY!
[GRUNT]

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.088
BUT JADEN'S JUST
TOO GOOD TO LOSE!

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.057
HE'D DE-THRONE
YOUR KING IN A SEC!

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:12.725
BITE YOUR TONGUE!

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.661
THE SUPREME KING'S
INVINCIBLE!

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.630
HE WILL NEVER BE BEATEN!

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.466
THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO PROVE
THAT THEORY WRONG?

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.335
YOU BET!
WHAT SAY WE GO

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.971
AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES
TO THIS KING FELLA.

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.341
I'M MOST CERTAIN THAT
HE WOULD LOVE TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:30.343
BUT YOU SEE...

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.879
HE'S TENDING TO SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS...

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.883
I'M AFRAID THE SUPREME KING
HAS LEFT HIS THRONE!

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.653
HE'S TAKEN HIS ARMY TO DESTROY
THE LAST HUMAN VILLAGE!

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.655
[LAUGH]

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.557
THEY'RE DEFENSELESS!

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.626
EXACTLY!
THANKS TO YOU TWO!

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:50.363
YOU RAN OFF, LEAVING THEM
RIPE FOR THE PICKIN'!

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.365
WE HAVE TO GO!

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.100
THEY'RE GOING TO
NEED OUR HELP!

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.536
YOU'RE RIGHT.
[LAUGHS]
NOT SO FAST!

00:13:57.537 --> 00:13:59.405
I WON'T LET YOU MEDDLE
IN THE KING'S AFFAIRS!

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:03.009
[SNICKER] I'LL TRY
TO MAKE THIS QUICK.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.011
I WANT TO WATCH...

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.480
WHEN THE SUPREME KING
DESTROYS THE FINAL VILLAGE!

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:09.482
HE'S MINE!

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.516
FORGET IT AXEL...
[GROWL]

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.951
THIS ONE'S PERSONAL!

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.686
TAKE HIM DOWN!

00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:15.488
Kozaky and Jim: GAME ON!

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.491
I'LL MAKE THIS AS
"QUICK" AS POSSIBLE.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:20.693
I PLAY MY...
WEATHERING SOLDIER:

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:22.695
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:24.230
[GROWL]

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:25.798
AND LEAVE IT AT THAT!

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.568
I GUESS IT'S MY TURN...
[GIGGLE]

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:32.605
SO FIRST I'LL PLAY:
CHAOS RIDER GUSTAPH!

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:35.775
[ROAR]

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.244
AND THEN, I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD
DOUBLE SUMMON.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.680
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
A SECOND MONSTER

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:42.682
DIRECTLY TO MY FIELD
THIS TURN!

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.650
AND I'M CHOOSING...

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:46.352
ANOTHER CHAOS RIDER GUSTAPH!

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.454
[SNARL]

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.224
JIM'S ONLY GOT ONE MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE...

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.760
AND THAT MEANS THAT
ONE OF THOSE CHAOS RIDERS

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.061
CAN ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.063
AND I HAVE MORE
SURPRISES IN STORE!

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.799
FOR INSTANCE:
THE RITUAL SPELL CARD...

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.236
REVIVAL OF DOKURORIDER!

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.407
NOW BY SACRIFICING A LEVEL 6
MONSTER IN MY HAND...

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.510
LIKE MY GADGET SOLDIER...

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:12.912
I HAVE THE POWER...
TO SUMMON...

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.215
A NEW MONSTER TO THE FIELD:
DOKURORIDER!

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:18.718
COME FORTH!

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.389
BUT WAIT, I'M NOT DONE,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.325
BECAUSE NOW I REMOVE
TWO SPELL CARDS
FROM MY GRAVE

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.595
TO MAKE MY GUSTAPH
600 POINTS STRONGER!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.900
UH-OH! LOOKS LIKE
HE'S PUTTING TOGETHER
AN ENTIRE BIKER GANG.

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:37.370
AND I'M GOING TO
RIDE WITH THEM...
ALL THE WAY TO VICTORY...

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:41.441
RIDERS... MOW DOWN
THIS HUMAN'S LIFE POINTS!

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.186
OHH!

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:55.888
UHH!
[SCREECHING]

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.523
UHH.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.126
[LAUGHS]

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.561
UHH.

00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:02.728
HAH!
UHH!
