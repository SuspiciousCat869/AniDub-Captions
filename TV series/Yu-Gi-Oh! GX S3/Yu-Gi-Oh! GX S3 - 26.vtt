00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.104
Narrator: LAST TIME
ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.506
Marcel: HELLO JADEN...

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.141
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL...

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.811
...MEET ME IN FRONT
OF DUEL ACADEMY.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.515

THE STUDENTS FROM MY CONTROL,

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:19.152
BUT SHOULD YOU LOSE--
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS--
WILL SERVE ME FOREVER!

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.722
JESSE...ONCE
WE GET TO THE SURFACE,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.092
YOU AND AXEL HAVE GOT
TO FIND THE RAINBOW
DRAGON CARD!

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.995
[LAUGHS] GLAD TO SEE
YOU MADE IT.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.463
Jaden: THAT'S NOT
MARCEL, BLAIR.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.131
HE'S BEING USED
BY SOMETHING

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.433
AND I THINK IT'S TIME
WE FOUND OUT BY WHAT!

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.902
NOW, NOW.
...EVERYTHING WILL BECOME

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.470
MUCH CLEARER SOON ENOUGH...

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.440
STARTING RIGHT NOW,

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.283
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE REAL!

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.784
ALRIGHT!

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.820
I COMPLETED THE CRYSTAL
BEAST DECK!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.056
Jesse: I WANT INTO

[GROANS] WHAT HAPPENED TO ME...
HOW DID I GET OUT HERE...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.411
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
WAS THE SACRED BEAST CARDS
BEING RELEASED...

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.047
THREE SACRED BEASTS!
BREAK YOUR SEAL!

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.963
THE CARDS...
THEY'RE HIS...

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.865
THAT RUIN WASN'T THERE BEFORE.

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:47.768
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S DUELING...

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.836
ALRIGHT THERE JESSE,
NO PRESSURE OR ANYTHING

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.272
BUT OUR FATE HANGS ON
THIS ONE DUEL.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.808
BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE
I SAID, NO PRESSURE.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.743
I KNOW, J.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.046
READY?!
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.881
I DRAW!

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.383
I PLAY THE SPELL--
THE CRYSTAL TREE!

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.919
NOW IF I SLAP A CARD
IN MY SPELL AND TRAP ZONE...

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.355
CRYSTAL FRUIT
GROWS ON MA' TREE.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.923
AND IF YA THINK
THAT'S SWEET...

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.993
WAIT'LL YOU SEE THIS MOVE--
I SUMMON--

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:16.530
CRYSTAL BEAST
AMBER MAMMOTH!

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.898
[TRUMPETS]

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.633
SINCE YOUR MONSTER
HAS NO ATTACK POINTS.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.535
I'M SENDIN' MY BEAST
OVER TO STOMP OUT

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.236
A TON OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.639
MAMMOTH!--STAMPEDE AHEAD!

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.774
[GROWLING]

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.309
HUH. NICE TRY!

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.344
BUT YOUR PACHYDERM
IS ABOUT TO GO ON

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.280
THE ENDANGERED
SPECIES LIST!

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.716
I PLAY THE TRAP CHAOS FORM!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.719
BY TRIGGERING THIS CARD,
I GET STRONGER...

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.620
YOU SEE JESSE...
THIS CARD CAN GAIN

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.456
THE SAME ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS...

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.292
AS A RANDOM MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.294
[CHUCKLES]

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.530
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR WOOLY BEAST

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.532
IS ABOUT
TO BECOME EXTINCT!

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:56.903
CHAOS FORM HAS CHOSEN--
RAVIEL, LORD OF PHANTASMS!

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.139
UH, JADEN...ANY TIPS?

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.809
JUST ONE, BUDDY--
HANG ON FOR DEAR LIFE!

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.944
HUH.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.381
I'M PLAYIN' A SPELL CARD!
MY CRYSTAL FLASH!

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.916
NOW BY PLACIN'
A CRYSTAL BEAST

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.651
'N MY SPELL AND TRAP
CARD ZONE...

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.688
YOUR BIG OL' ATTACK
CAN'T DO SQUAT TO ME, BUB.

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.791
'N I CHOOSE!--
THE COBALT EAGLE CRYSTAL!

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.127
SO NOW MY TREE
BEARS SOME FRUIT!

00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:27.701
WHEW! THAT THERE
WAS A CLOSE ONE.

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.736
THAT'S IT FOR ME THIS TURN.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.072
I'M UP, THEN.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:35.175
I SUMMON--ELEMENTAL
HERO...BUBBLEMAN!

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.546
AND HE'S ABOUT TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE...

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.748
YOU SEE WHEN BUBBLEMAN'S
THE ONLY CARD ON MY FIELD...

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:45.385
I CAN DRAW TWO MORE CARDS.
SWEET!

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.954
I ACTIVATE--POLYMERIZATION!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.724
NOW I FUSE BUBBLEMAN
WITH ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.894
TO FORM...
ELEMENTAL HERO--MARINER!

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.565
AND NOW BY PLACING
A CARD FACEDOWN,

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:01.168
I CAN ACTIVATE
MARINER'S SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.769
BRACE YOURSELF.

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.404
'CAUSE WHEN I HAVE
A CARD FACEDOWN

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.373
IN MY SPELL AND TRAP CARD ZONE,

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:09.743
MY MARINER
CAN ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.479
MARINER!
SINK THAT LOSER!

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.014
ANCHOR'S AWAY!

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:18.718
MARCEL...

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.988
HA HA. "SINK ME"?
DON'T THINK SO, JADEN.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.124
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOING DOWN.

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:27.027
AND MY NEXT MOVE'LL HAVE YOU
SWIMMING WITH THE FISHES!

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.128
OH!

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.729
THAT AIN'T
GONNA HAPPEN, PAL!

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.032
YA WANT J, YOU GOTTA
GO THROUGH ME.

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:33.767
'N THAT WON'T BE EASY.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:35.702
[LAUGHS] WE'LL SEE!

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.941
FIRST I'LL SACRIFICE
MY PHANTOM OF CHAOS--

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:44.010
SO THAT I CAN CALL FORTH...
DARK SUMMONING BEAST!

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.916
AGAIN WITH
ZERO ATTACK POINTS?

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.819
THERE'S MORE TO IT--
KEEP YOUR GUARD UP,
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.956
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
TO HELP JESSE NOW...

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.924
THE STAGE HAS ALREADY
BEEN SET...

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.895
WATCH NOW AS I DISCARD
MY SUMMONING BEAST.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:04.297
OH! WHAT'S THIS?

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:06.933
OH!

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.401
WHAT ARE YOU DOING...?

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.338
ACTIVATING MY BEAST'S...
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:14.207
I'M TOSSING DARK
SUMMONING BEAST ASIDE...

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.643
JUST LIKE JADEN
TOSSED ME ASIDE...

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.178
AND IN DOING SO...

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:20.213
I GET TO INSTANTLY SUMMON--

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.449
ALL THREE
OF THE SACRED BEASTS!

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:23.617
YOU'RE WHAT?!

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:25.252
THIS IS THE POWER OF PAIN.

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:28.622
SOON, YOUR FRIEND WILL FEEL
THE HURT YOU MADE ME FEEL.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.695
SACRED BEASTS RISE UP!

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.264
LORD OF PHANTASMS!

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:40.600
LORD OF STRIKING THUNDER!
LORD OF SEARING FLAMES!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.935
AAH!

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.003
OH!

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:47.274
WELL I'LL BE...

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:53.179
Marcel: COWER
BEFORE RAVIEL...

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:58.184
HAMON...
...AND THE MIGHTY URIA!

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.319
INCREDIBLE!

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.087
AW, MAN.
ALL THREE!

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.689
THOSE THINGS ARE HUGE!

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.758
NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.160
I PLAY
URIA'S SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.195
UPON BEING SUMMONED,
HE CAN DESTROY

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.998
ONE TRAP OR SPELL CARD.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.668
LUCKY FOR ME, YOU JUST
TOOK OUT DUMMY MARKER--

00:07:14.668 --> 00:07:17.537
WHEN ITS DESTROYED
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES--

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:22.943
'N BECAUSE OF THAT--
I GET TO DRAW...
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.444
YOU ARE LUCKY JADEN.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.179
BECAUSE ON THE TURN
WHERE MY DARK BEAST

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.214
SUMMONS THE SACRED BEASTS,

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.216
THEY CANNOT MAKE
ANY ATTACKS.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.585
SO YOU'VE BEEN SPARED
THIS ROUND...

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.487
NOW I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN...

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.022
AND END MY TURN.

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.161
[LAUGHS]
WHAT'S FUNNY?

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.464
[LAUGHS]

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.632
WHAT'RE YOU GIGGLING AT?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.033
THIS RULES!

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.369
I MEAN
WE'RE DUELIN'...

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:50.704
THE SACRED BEASTS!

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:52.973
THIS IS THE STUFF
DUELISTS DREAM ABOUT!

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.774
THIS IS
WHAT WE LIVE FOR!

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.142
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.944
HMM. YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.713
HE THINKS THIS "RULES"?

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.948
IF THOSE...
JOKERS LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.484
NONE OF US ARE EVER GETTIN'
OUT OF THIS DIMENSION.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.953
LET'S SEE HOW GREAT
JADEN'S PAL THINKS THIS IS

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.722
AFTER I CRUSH HIM...

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:12.125
HERE WE GO.
IT'S MY TURN...

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.528
AND FIRST OFF, I'LL SWITCH

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:26.586
FINALLY...MY TRANSFORMATION
IS COMPLETE...

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:29.155
I AM AS REAL AS THE REST OF YOU.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.623
I HAVE NO USE FOR HIM...

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:32.592
I'M SICK OF THIS
LUMP OF FLESH.

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.660
YOU WANT HIM?...
THEN YOU CAN HAVE HIM!

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.629
MARCEL! OH!

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:38.564
BLAIR! YOU OK?

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.032
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.100
OH!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.368
WHAT IS THAT...

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.536
I DON'T BELIEVE IT...

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:49.408
JADEN...WE'RE
FINALLY REUNITED...

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:52.512
WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM?

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.281
LOOK INTO MY EYES...

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:58.417
AND REMEMBER...

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.853
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG...
WE WERE A TEAM...

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.756
WHEN YOU HURT, I HURT.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.725
AND I DID SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:11.864
BACK THEN,
YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.200
YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THAT EVERYTHING I DID,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.668
I DID FOR YOU.

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:18.504
AND I WASN'T GOING TO LET
ANYONE COME BETWEEN US.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.907
I WAS YOUR FRIEND,
YOUR GUARDIAN...

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:22.575
YOUR AVENGER.

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.176
AND HOW DID YOU REPAY ME?

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.746
BY LETTING THEM
GET THEIR HANDS ON ME.

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:29.048
YOU LET THEM SEND ME AWAY.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.384
BUT DESTINY HAD
A DIFFERENT PLAN,

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:35.621
AND IT BROUGHT ME
BACK TO YOU...

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.391
OH NO...
YOU CAN'T...YUBEL?

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.427
HOLD UP--YOU KNOW
THAT...THAT THING?

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.195
I DO...

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.698
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
TO REMEMBER...

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:46.766
I'M HURT.

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:49.035
I NEVER FORGOT.
HOW COULD I?

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.937
YOU HAD THEM SEND ME AWAY,

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:53.105
YOU DECIDED TO ALIENATE ME,

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:55.274
BUT NOW WE'RE
FACE TO FACE AGAIN...

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.742
AND YOU AND I...

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.045
WE HAVE SOME
CATCHING UP TO DO...

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:01.547

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:03.482
UNLEASH YOUR FURY ARMITYLE...

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:07.453
WIPE THEM ALL OUT
BUT LEAVE JADEN FOR ME!

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.722

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.867

EVERY CRYSTAL BEAST
ON THE FIELD,

AND FOR EACH BEAST
IT ABSORBS

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:02.341

STOPPING NOW WILL ONLY
REDUCE THE ENERGY SPIKE--

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.912
