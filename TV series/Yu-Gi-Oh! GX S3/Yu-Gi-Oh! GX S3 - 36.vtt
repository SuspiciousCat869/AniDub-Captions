BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

MAYBE HIS DUELING CAN.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THE JADEN WE KNOW BACK

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.874
IS TO DUEL HIS DARK HALF

GO NEEDLE BURST!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.905
FOSSILS SHOULD
STAY IN THE GROUND.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.642
EHH! AAH!

I SUMMON ULURU,
THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT,

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.455
TO THE FIELD!

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:09.823
THIS TRAP MONSTER
CAN ACTIVATE

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:13.326
BECAUSE ULURU'S

IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.427

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.799

COME ON, AXEL, YOU CAN'T
LET THIS FEAR CONQUER YOU.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.014
YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME IT
AND STAY FOCUSED

ARE TALKING.

IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.

BECAUSE WHEN
I UNCOVER A FOSSIL, MATE,

I SEE THE SPIRIT OF WHAT
IT ONCE USED TO BE,

HOW IT LIVED BEFORE BEING
TRAPPED AND BURIED.

IT GAINS DEFENSE POINTS
EQUAL TO THOSE

DRAW ANOTHER CARD.

IF NOT, THIS DUEL'S
FINISHED, AND SO AM I.

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.743

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.853
HUH?

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:24.424
I REMOVE MY SKULL BONE
AND SKULL KNIGHT FROM PLAY.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.263
SO THEN I CAN SUMMON UP
