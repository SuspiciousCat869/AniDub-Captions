WEBVTT

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.469
Jaden:
LAST TIME ON...

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.372
Yubel: NOW LET'S FINISH
WHAT WE STARTED.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.341
HMM.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.210
JADEN, I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.479
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, SYRUS.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.016
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.552
I HAVE TO USE THE POWER
OF THE SUPREME KING.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.154
HE'S A PART OF ME,
AND I'M A PART OF HIM,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.524
AND TOGETHER, WE'RE
GOING TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:24.992
THINK AGAIN.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.627
SAY HELLO
TO TERROR INCARNATE.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.563
IT'S TIME
YOU MET YOUR FATE.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.199
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN. HA!

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.969
HEY, JESSE, I'M SORRY I
GOT YOU INTO THIS MESS,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.041
BUT KNOW I PLAN ON
MAKING IT UP TO YOU

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.309
BY WINNING THIS!

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.911
NOW, PRISMA,

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.746
WITH THE POWER
THAT YOU POSSESS,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.514
I TRANSFORM YOU
INTO JESSE'S

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.117
MOST POWERFUL BEAST...
RAINBOW DRAGON.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.454
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO STOP ME.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:55.989
THAT MAY BE,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.624
BUT NOW I PLAY
POLYMERIZATION,

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.861
AND I FUSE
RAINBOW DRAGON
AND NEOS

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.597
SO THAT I CAN CALL UPON
THE MIGHTY RAINBOW NEOS.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.200
THIS FUSION OF
FRIENDSHIP

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.372
IS GOING
TO CONQUER YOU

YUBEL, YOUR
TERROR INCARNATE

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.339
IS NO MATCH FOR THE
POWER OF MY MONSTER.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.942
MY RAINBOW NEOS HAS
3 SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.745
AND TO ACTIVATE
ONE OF 'EM,

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.481
I JUST SEND A CARD FROM
MY DECK TO MY GRAVE,

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.684
AND THEN EVERY CARD
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD MUST
RETURN TO YOUR DECK.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.819
EVERY CARD?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.389
WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE FORCED
TO GIVE UP SOMETHING, TOO.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:38.125
THAT'S RIGHT, SO
I SEND MY NECROSHADE
TO THE GRAVE.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.062
RRGH...

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.130
WAS THAT
A GOOD MOVE?

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.598
WITH NO CARDS
IN THE GRAVEYARD,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.199
YUBEL'S LOTUS
CAN'T RESURRECT,

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.135
SO, YEAH, THAT
WAS A GOOD MOVE.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.704
SHE CAN'T ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.706
WHICH MEANS NEOS
IS SAFE FOR NOW.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.741
THAT'S
FANTASTIC.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.245
[CHATTERS]
REALLY?
HUH?

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.647
IT'S JADEN.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.683
LOOKS LIKE
MY RAINBOW DRAGON
HELPED HIM.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.084
HMM.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.953
JADEN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.489
YOU STILL DON'T SEE
WHAT I'VE DONE FOR YOU,

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.725
AND FOR THAT,
I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.594
SOON YOU'LL SEE
THE ERROR OF YOUR WAYS.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.563
AND SO WILL YOU.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.999
I SEND ONE CARD
TO MY GRAVEYARD

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:20.901
TO ACTIVATE THE ARM
HOLE SPELL CARD.

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.505
WITH THIS, I CAN NOW
CHOOSE ONE EQUIP
SPELL IN MY DECK

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.874
AND THEN ADD
THE CARD TO MY HAND.

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:30.444
IN EXCHANGE,
I CAN'T SUMMON
A MONSTER THIS TURN,

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.579
BUT I CAN ACTIVATE
MY RAINBOW VEIL,

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:36.850
AND I EQUIP THIS SPELL
TO MY RAINBOW NEOS...

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.687
AND SINCE I HAVE
THIS VEIL OF PROTECTION,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.222
I'M SAFE TO ATTACK.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.291
GO, RAINBOW
RADIANCE.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.460
AH, DID YOU FORGET?

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.962
DAMAGE TO ME
BECOMES DAMAGE TO YOU.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:50.897
NOT WITH
MY RAINBOW VEIL.

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:53.300
SEE, WITH ITS SHIELD
OF SECURITY,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.802
NEOS CAN NEGATE
YOUR MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.071
ALL RIGHT!

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.706
WE MIGHT BE GOING
HOME AFTER ALL.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.341
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.377
BECAUSE I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN...

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.581
THE TRAP FIEND ROSE.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:09.816
WHEN EQUIPPED
TO MY MONSTER,

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.685
FIEND ROSE ALSO
SERVES AS A SHIELD.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.187
IT PROTECTS MY YUBEL
TERROR INCARNATE

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:16.123
BY NEGATING ALL
THE BATTLE DAMAGE

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.024
YOUR PRECIOUS RAINBOW NEOS
CAN DISH OUT.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.193
OH...

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.196
BUT SHOULD MY ROSE
LEAVE THE FIELD,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.100
MY TERROR INCARNATE
HAS TO GO WITH IT.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.071
UH... AAH!
AAH!

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.106
UH!

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:35.308
OH, WELL.
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.012
THAT'S ASSUMING, OF COURSE,
THERE IS A NEXT TIME.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.447
HUH.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.650
THAT YUBEL HAS BEEN
ONE-UPPING JADEN
THIS WHOLE DUEL.

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:46.753
WELL, HOPEFULLY, HE'LL
BREAK HER DEFENSES SOON.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.322
IF NOT, JADEN'S LIFE POINTS
DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.559
I END MY TURN.
AS YOU MUST.

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:55.862
I DRAW, AND SINCE
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.765
I CAN ACTIVATE THE POWER
OF MY SPELL CHRONICLE.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.369
WITH 3 CARDS LEFT FOR YOU
TO CHOOSE FROM, JADEN,

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:03.870
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE?

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.940
HOW 'BOUT MYSTICAL
SPACE TYPHOON?

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.510
A MOST EXCELLENT PICK.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.146
I'LL USE IT RIGHT AWAY,
AND WITH ITS POWER,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.283
I'LL RENDER YOUR RAINBOW NEOS'
PROTECTION USELESS.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.686
AAH!

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.760
OH, NO!
MY RAINBOW VEIL!

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.396
NOW WITH THAT
EQUIP SPELL LIFTED,

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.464
I CAN USE MY SPECIAL
ABILITY AGAIN.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.401
DO YOU THINK I WANTED
ALL OF THIS TO HAPPEN?

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:36.036
WELL, I DIDN'T.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.471
I JUST WANTED THE TWO OF US
TO BE TOGETHER, JADEN.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.340
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU
FOR ETERNITY.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.075
YET YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:44.044
I'M SO SORRY...

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:46.947
BUT YOU BROUGHT THIS FATE
UPON YOURSELF,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.716
AND NOW, RAINBOW NEOS,
LET US FINISH THIS.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:53.987
ATTACK ME WITH YOUR
RAINBOW RADIANCE,

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:59.292
AND TOGETHER, WE'LL SEND
JADEN OFF TO OBLIVION.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.566
YOU SHOULDA SAVED
THE MENACING VICTORY
SPEECH, YUBEL,

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.735
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.605
YOU SEE, IF I
TAKE NECRO GARDNA
OUT OF MY GRAVEYARD

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.440
AND REMOVE IT
FROM PLAY,

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.176
I CAN NEGATE
YOUR ATTACK.

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.279
UH! THIS DUEL IS OVER.
JUST ACCEPT IT.

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.616
WHEN THE LAST LIFE POINT
EXPIRES,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.651
THAT'S WHEN THE DUEL
IS OVER, YUBEL.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:26.453
SO ACCEPT THAT.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.488
IT'S MY MOVE. I DRAW...

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.558
AND I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL FIFTH HOPE.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.195
WITH THIS CARD,
I CAN TAKE ALL
THE ELEMENTAL HEROES

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.099
FROM MY GRAVE AND
RETURN 'EM TO MY DECK.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.238
Jaden: THEN I SHUFFLE
AND DRAW TWO NEW CARDS.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.374
SINCE YOU ACTIVATED
ANOTHER SPELL CARD,

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.709
SPELL CHRONICLE GAINS
ONE MORE UNIT OF POWER,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.444
AND SO THE STORY
CONTINUES.

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.413
THEN LET ME
ADD A PLOT TWIST

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.248
BY SUMMONING
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.519
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
RAINBOW NEOS'
SECOND ABILITY.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:02.923
BY SENDING CLAYMAN
TO MY GRAVE,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.326
YOUR BEAST IS DESTROYED
AND REMOVED FROM
THE FIELD OF PLAY.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.361
AH! WHAT?

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:10.730
IT'S NOT YOUR
LUCKY DAY, YUBEL,

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.366
'CAUSE THE ONLY
THING AT THE END
OF THIS RAINBOW

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.334
IS A WORLD OF HURT.

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.604
RAINBOW NEOS, RID
THE FIELD OF THAT
TERROR INCARNATE.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.642
YUBEL, YOU'VE GOT NO
MONSTERS ON YOUR FIELD,

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.277
NO TRAP OR SPELL CARDS.

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.846
EVEN YOUR GRAVEYARD
IS TOTALLY EMPTY.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.015
LET'S STOP THIS
BEFORE I HURT YOU AGAIN.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.618
BRING MY FRIENDS
BACK TO THIS
DIMENSION RIGHT NOW!

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:33.887
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.257
WHY WOULD I DO THAT,
WHEN YOU'VE JUST DESTROYED
MY TERROR INCARNATE?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.794
WHEN THAT BEING IS DESTROYED,
A STRONGER FORM DESCENDS.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.330
THE ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE
IS UPON YOU.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.199
THE WHAT?

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:48.635
YOU HAVEN'T
DESTROYED ME, JADEN.

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:55.041
YOU'VE ONLY
MADE ME STRONGER.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.679
AHH!

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.486
IF YOU ATTACK ME,
ALL DAMAGE WILL BE DEFLECTED.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.124
MY WRATH WILL CONSUME
YOUR ATTACKING MONSTER,

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.493
AND THEN YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:18.498
WILL BE DEALT STRAIGHT TO YOU
AS LIFE POINT DAMAGE.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.301
THAT'S BAD,
RIGHT?

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:22.569
YEAH.
THAT'S REALLY BAD.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.070
Jaden: YUBEL,

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:25.105
I PLAY A FACEDOWN.

00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:29.409
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:30.777
THE END HAS BEGUN...

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.480
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.682
AND SOON, JADEN,
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.018
IN THE DARKEST CORNER
OF THE DARKEST DIMENSION,

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.820
AND ONCE THERE, NO ONE WILL
HEAR YOUR CRIES OF AGONY...

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.892
NO ONE, THAT IS,
BUT ME!

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.732
AND NOW, RAINBOW NEOS,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.736
TIME TO SEND YOUR FRIEND
TO OBLIVION.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.507
I DON'T THINK SO 'CAUSE
I ACTIVATE THIS TRAP...

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:02.642
ALCHEMY CYCLE,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.778
AND BECAUSE OF
THIS CARD'S EFFECT,

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.814
FOR THIS TURN,
RAINBOW NEOS' ATTACK
POINTS BECOME ZERO.

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.717
RRGH!

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:21.161
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WHY'D HE DO THAT?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.997
THERE WAS NO WAY
TO SAVE RAINBOW NEOS.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.499
THIS WAY, AT LEAST
JAY SAVED HIMSELF.

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.601
JADEN, AT IT AGAIN,
ARE WE?

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.704
JUST AS YOU
SENT ME AWAY,

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.607
YOU GO AND DO THE SAME
TO YOUR RAINBOW NEOS.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.843
IS NO ONE SAFE THAT
DARES PROTECT YOU?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.878
YUBEL, THE ONLY
THING NOT SAFE

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.747
ARE YOUR PRECIOUS
LIFE POINTS.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.183
I SENT YOU AWAY
HOPING TO HELP YOU,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.651
BUT THAT WAS THEN.

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.786
NOW, DUE TO MY
ALCHEMY CYCLE'S EFFECT,

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.856
I CAN DRAW ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.693
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.629
I'M UP, THEN.

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.999
USING MY
NECROSHADE'S ABILITY
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.969
I CAN SUMMON OUT
AN ELEMENTAL HERO
WITHOUT A SACRIFICE,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.371
SO HERE COMES
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.643
NEXT, I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.346
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.081
THIS IS IT.
MAN, I CAN'T WATCH.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.885
COME ON.
JADEN NEEDS YOU,
SYRUS.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:21.788
BUT IT WON'T
BE ENOUGH.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.959
TRY ALL YOU WANT,
BUT IN THE END,

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:28.461
YOU WILL FAIL YOUR FRIENDS,
JUST AS YOU FAILED ME...

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.998
AND SOON, THE 12 DIMENSIONS
WILL FINALLY BECOME ONE.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.235
AT THAT TIME, YOU WILL
FINALLY FEEL MY PAIN.

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:38.171
THE FLAMES ARE
CALLING YOUR NAME.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.508
BASK IN THE FIRES
OF REVENGE.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:43.710
UH-OH.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.911
IF JAY CAN'T STOP THIS,

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.014
NEOS IS GONNA ATTACK,
AND JAY'LL LOSE.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.251
UH!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.123
JADEN, GIVING UP NOW

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.591
COULD SAVE YOU
CONSIDERABLE PAIN.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.261
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO YOUR OWN ADVICE.

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.496
I PLAY MIRAGE TUBE,
AND NOW THIS SPELL

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.933
ABSORBS YOUR
MONSTER'S BLAST
AND THEN LEAVES YOU

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:08.234
WIDE OPEN FOR
A COUNTERSTRIKE

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.069
FROM THE MONSTER
YOU ATTACKED.

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.172
GO, NEOS.
SHE CAN'T STOP US
THIS TIME.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:15.608
AAH!

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:17.210
THIS'LL BE LOUD.

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:18.578
[EXPLOSION]

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.247
DID YOU SERIOUSLY
THINK I'D GIVE UP?

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.516
I'VE PLAYED ALL
YOUR SILLY GAMES.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.052
I BROUGHT THE PAIN
TO YOUR DUEL GHOULS.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:27.453
I TRAVELED TO
THIS DIMENSION.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.689
I LEARNED TO CONTROL
THE SUPREME KING'S POWER,

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.659
AND NOW ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS TO FINISH YOU OFF.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.861
BUT SHOULD YOU WIN,
WHO'LL PROTECT YOU?

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:36.496
PROTECT ME?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.298
HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED
IT YET, JADEN?

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.400
I'VE ALWAYS STRIVED
TO SHELTER YOU FROM HARM,

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.835
EVEN IT MEANT HURTING
THOSE CLOSEST TO YOU,

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:44.404
AND I WON'T STOP,

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:47.207
NOT UNTIL YOU ARE SAFE
FROM EVERY EVIL,

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:50.610
AND TO ENSURE THAT,
I WILL CREATE A WORLD
FOR JUST YOU AND ME,

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.780
ONE WHERE YOU WILL BE PROTECTED
UNTIL THE TIME COMES

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:56.015
WHEN YOU MUST USE THE POWER
OF THE SUPREME KING

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:57.617
TO FIGHT THE GREAT EVIL.

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.421
YOU SEE, THERE'S
MORE TO THIS STORY
THAN YOU REALIZE.

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:05.258
JADEN! AAH!

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:07.627
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:12.498
WHERE AM I?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.169
OH...

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:21.374
IS THAT...

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:22.875
YUBEL, NOW LISTEN.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.211
I MUST EXPLAIN
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.579
YES, SIR.

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.448
AT THE DAWN OF TIME,
THE UNIVERSE

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:30.016
WAS BORN OF LIGHT
AND DARK ENERGY.

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:33.620
AT FIRST, CHAOS AND EVIL
RULED THE WORLD UNDER
THE POWER OF LIGHT.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:35.955
AFTER COUNTLESS MOONS
HAD PASSED,

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.657
THE DARK ENERGY
RESTORED ORDER

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:38.958
AND BANISHED THIS EVIL,

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:41.861
BUT, YUBEL, LIGHT WAVES
OF CHAOS AND EVIL

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.565
NOW SEAR THROUGH SPACE
LOOKING TO RETURN ONE DAY.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.734
ONLY ONE PERSON
CAN STOP THEM,

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:51.304
THE ONE BORN
WITH THE POWER OF
THE SUPREME KING IN HIS HEART.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.240
THE ONE IS HERE.
IT IS MY SON, THE PRINCE,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.243
BUT HE'S A TEMPORARY
VESSEL FOR THE POWER.

00:12:58.044 --> 00:12:59.078
IT SHALL PASS
THROUGH TIME.

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:02.015
AS IT DOES,
SOMEONE MUST FOLLOW
AND PROTECT THE VESSELS.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.517
PLEASE, MY KING.
LET THAT PERSON BE ME.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.620
SO SOME PRINCE
WAS THE SUPREME KING, TOO.

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:09.656
WHO WAS HE?

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.492
Man: YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO PROTECT
THE WILL OF THE SUPREME KING.

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:15.962
TO ENSURE YOUR MIGHT, YOU MUST
RECEIVE THE DRAGON'S HEART.

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:20.333
[DOOR OPENS]
HUH?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.201
DON'T DO THIS.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.239
THAT'S WEIRD.
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:28.574
STOP IT.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.210
OH, MAN.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:33.179
OW!

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.082
IT'S LIKE ME AND
YUBEL IN THE PAST
OR SOMETHING.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.618
I REMEMBER.

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:41.754
WHY'D YOU DO THIS?

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.256
TELL ME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:44.924
OF COURSE NOT,
BUT JUST KNOW

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.827
THAT I DID THIS
IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOU.

00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.262
I WILL ALWAYS
PROTECT YOU.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:51.364
OK, BUT THIS
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.500
YOU WERE MY FRIEND, BUT
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:55.935
I PROMISE NEVER
TO FORGET YOU,

00:13:57.103 --> 00:14:01.341
TO ALWAYS KEEP YOU
BY MY SIDE.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:06.846
Jaden: SYRUS.
RIGHT HERE.

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:10.316
GOOD. NOW LISTEN.

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:12.919
I GOTTA GO.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.854
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.022
WHAT?

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:18.224
WHEN YOU SEE EVERYONE,
TELL 'EM I'M SORRY.

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:20.626
I'M SORRY
FOR EVERYTHING, COOL?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.261
NO, NOT COOL!

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.230
IF I'M GOING BACK,
SO ARE YOU.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.165
YOU CAN'T
STAY BEHIND.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.434
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
TO OUR WORLD TOGETHER.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:29.936
STAY BEHIND?
BUT WHY?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.572
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.
I MEAN, I HEAR YOU.

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.041
I REALLY WANNA GO CHILL
AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:36.776
BUT I CAN'T, NOT NOW.

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:40.580
I'VE GOTTA HELP AN OLD FRIEND.
I'VE... I GOTTA HELP YUBEL.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.583
HUH?

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.356
LATER, BRO.

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:53.793
JADEN, NO!

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.267
JADEN, COME BACK.

00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:06.639
I CAN'T LEAVE HERE
WITHOUT YOU. I WON'T.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.047
HMM.

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:17.550
YUBEL, YOU OK?

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.420
OK? WHY, OF COURSE.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.089
I'M GREAT.
I'VE NEVER FELT STRONGER.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.892
NOW LET'S FINISH OUR DUEL
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.262
SINCE YOU ACTIVATED
MIRAGE TUBE,

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.964
THAT SPELL FULLY CHARGES
MY SPELL CHRONICLE,

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:34.567
AND NOW YOU MUST
CHOOSE AGAIN.

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.370
ONLY TWO LEFT.
WHICH WILL YOU PICK?

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:40.740
I ASSUME YOU'LL PICK
GRINDER GOLEM,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.409
THINKING THAT MIGHT LEAVE YOU
WITH A FIGHTING CHANCE.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:44.710
AM I RIGHT?

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.512
I SELECT SUPER
POLYMERIZATION.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:49.816
RRGH! WHAT WAS THAT?
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.985
I'LL TEACH YOU.
I ACTIVATE CHAIN MATERIAL.

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:57.824
FROM MY DECK, MY GRAVE,
MY FIELD, AND MY HAND...

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.893
I CAN GATHER EVERY SINGLE
MONSTER LEVELS 1 THROUGH 12

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:05.131
TO USE AS FUSION MATERIAL.

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:18.878
HA HA HA!

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.981
NOW I ACTIVATE
SUPER POLYMERIZATION,

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.884
AND WITH ITS POWER,
I WILL BREAK THE BOUNDARIES

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.719
OF TIME AND SPACE AND
UNITE THE 12 DIMENSIONS.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:30.623
WHEN THE 12 DIMENSIONS
BECOME ONE,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.192
THE ENSUING EXPLOSION
WILL CREATE A NEW WORLD,

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:37.497
ONE WHERE ONLY YOU
AND I SHALL EXIST.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:43.936
UH...
UH...

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.005
WOW. FIREWORKS?
DID JADEN WIN?

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:47.907
I HOPE SO.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:49.842
WHAT IN BLAZES?

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.245
JADEN.

00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:02.255
OH...
AH...

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:05.458
WHAT? OH... HMM.

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:09.562
AH, SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.534
AGH!

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.176
HA HA HA!

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.245
I'VE DONE IT.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.214
BY DESTROYING
YOUR REALITY, I'VE WON.

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:30.650
YOUR WORLD IS NO MORE.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.818
YOU AND I WILL FINALLY
BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:34.787
NOT QUITE.
WHAT?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.890
UH!

00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:40.326
SUPER POLYMERIZATION
ISN'T FUSING
ANY DIMENSIONS,

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:41.727
NOT TODAY, ANYWAY.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.262
I CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.231
INSTEAD, IT'S
GOING TO FUSE US.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.066
FUSE US?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:49.902
YOU SEE, I ALREADY
ACTIVATED THIS CARD.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.572
A COUNTER TRAP?

THOSE DON'T WORK ON
SUPER POLYMERIZATION.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.510
THAT'S WHY I'M USING IT
AGAINST CHAIN MATERIAL.

00:17:58.678 --> 00:17:59.879
WITH THIS CARD,
I'M THE ONE

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.514
WHO GETS TO PICK
WHICH MONSTERS

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.149
WILL FUSE WITH SUPER
POLYMERIZATION.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.184
HEY, YUBEL,
I GET IT.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.453
YOU STARTED OFF
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS,

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:08.788
BUT YOU
LOST YOUR WAY.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.823
NOW I'M GONNA
HELP YOU FIND IT.

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:12.124
YOU'VE BEEN ALONE...

00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:13.993
SO ALONE.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.095
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE ALONE
ANYMORE, YUBEL.

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:19.165
I KNOW WHAT
YOU SACRIFICED
AND WHY YOU DID IT.

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.268
I'LL HELP YOU FIND
THE RIGHT PATH
AGAIN,

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:24.103
AND TOGETHER,
WE'LL FIGHT AS ONE.

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.206
YOU WORKED HARD
TO PROTECT ME, AND I
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.941
FROM NOW ON,
THE SUPREME KING

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.811
AND THE GUARDIAN
WILL BE THE SAME SPIRIT.

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:34.513
DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS FOR ME,
BUT LET'S FIND OUT.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.451
I ACTIVATE
SUPER POLYMERIZATION.

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:47.326
I FUSE MY SPIRIT
WITH YUBEL'S.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.300
AH!

JADEN.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:12.318
JADEN! OH!

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.287
THE SACRED WILL
OF THE SUPREME KING

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.790
AND MY SPIRIT
ARE NOW UNITED AS ONE.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.461
THE GUARDIAN WILL STAND BY
THE KING'S SIDE FOR ETERNITY,

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.065
AND WHEN OUR NAMES
ARE CALLED,

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.601
WE WILL FIGHT
THE WAVES OF CHAOS

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.405
AND SAVE THE WORLD.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:38.411

QUICKLY, GO, GO!

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.204
I HOPE
EVERYBODY'S OK.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.173
OH, NO.
THIS COULD BE BAD.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.241
OH...
AH.
HUH?
