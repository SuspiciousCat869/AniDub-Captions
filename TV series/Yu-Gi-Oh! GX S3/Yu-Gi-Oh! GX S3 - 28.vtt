LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.377
Jaden: DID WE
MAKE IT BACK?

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.378
YES, WE'RE HOME.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.281
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE
ACTUALLY DID IT.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.282
CAN YOU, JESSE?

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:16.650
HELLO?!

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:17.985
THE DUEL...

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.287
HE SAID HE WAS
GIVING HIS ALL.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.288
OH, NO...
JESSE!

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.926
Bastion: A PORTAL IS
TRYING TO OPEN AGAIN

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.261
BETWEEN OUR
TWO DIMENSIONS!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.062
Axel: JADEN, WAIT!

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.131
Bastion: IT'S TOO
DANGEROUS!

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.432
I HAVE TO RESCUE JESSE!

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.535
BUT I'M NOT EVEN
SURE THAT THIS
PORTAL LEADS

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.670
TO THE SAME ALTERNATE
DIMENSION WE CAME FROM!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.207
THAT MAY BE, BUT IT'S A RISK
I'M WILLING TO TAKE.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.775
YEAH, WELL...
NOT ALONE, YOU'RE NOT.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.776
WAIT UP!

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.379
NO, I'VE ALREADY INVOLVED
JESSE IN THIS.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.548
I'M NOT GONNA
INVOLVE YOU GUYS, TOO!

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.516
WELL, I HATE TO BREAK
THE NEWS, MATE,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.484
BUT IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:51.485
WE'RE FRIENDS.
SO...

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.022
WE'RE INVOLVED
WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT.

TAKE US TO, BASTION?!

AN ALTERNATE DIMENSION...

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.971
BUT NOT THE ONE
FROM BEFORE.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.139
HMM.

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:24.044
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WE NEED A READ
ON THIS PLACE.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:25.312
TIME FOR A LITTLE RECON.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.481

HEH HEH...
STAY BEHIND.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:28.782
AHH, ME TOO.

THINGS OUT FIRST.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.166
HEY, WHERE'S JADEN?

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:47.834
HE'S NOT HERE.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.902
HUH?
HUH?

WHERE EVER COULD WE BE?

HOW DID I LET THIS HAPPEN?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.848
LET'S GO!

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.850
CATCH YA LATER, PARTNER!

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.486
AAH! AAH!

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.023
IF YOU'RE HERE, JESSE,

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.325
I PROMISE I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU...

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.394
AAH!

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.596
BUT SOMEBODY BETTER
CATCH ME FIRST!

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.664
UNH!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.199
OHH.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.234
THAT HURT.

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:22.903
HUH?

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.572
WHOA, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.741
HUH? SOME PRINTS!

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.081
JADEN MIGHT BE
IN A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.082
HUH? TRAIN TRACKS?!

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.951
I WONDER WHERE THEY LEAD.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:38.952
HA HA HA!

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.756
WHOA, WHAT WAS
PUSHING THAT CART?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.224
IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE
THAT LAST WORLD,

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.559
I BETTER BE READY.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.560
HMM. AAH!

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:48.495
AXEL?!

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:51.331
I WOULDN'T DRAW TOO
MUCH ATTENTION YET.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.933
WE'RE HERE
TO FIND JESSE,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.869
AND IT'LL BE EASIER
IF THERE'S NO
INTERFERENCE.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.043
BUT HOW? MY CALCULATIONS
SHOULD BE CORRECT.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.378
WHAT AM I MISSING?

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:07.614
CARRY THE ONE, AND THEN...

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.517
HOLD UP. THIS CAN'T BE,
UNLESS...

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.620
I RECALCULATE MY FINDINGS
BASED ON THIS NEW READING.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.024
AH, YES, PERFECT,
THE BREAKTHROUGH I NEEDED!

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.863
DID YOU ALL
HEAR SOMETHING?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.531
JUST YOUR KNEES KNOCKIN'!

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:25.532
UNH!

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.736
NOT EXACTLY
THE BREAKTHROUGH I MEANT.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.606
AAH! IT'S YOU!

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.846
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
OUT OF THIS CAVERN.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.181
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE WORRIED.

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.182
BUT JESSE!

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.885
I GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT
HE'S NOT DOWN HERE.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:45.886
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.122
BUT DOING THIS
ON YOUR OWN IS
WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:50.323
WE'RE ALL HERE TO HELP.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.926
SO LET'S FIND A WAY BACK
TO OUR FRIENDS FIRST!

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:53.927
OK?
OK!

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.297
WAIT!

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.498
TANIA?!

00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.599
THAT YOU, JADEN?!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.434
YOU KNOW HER, J?

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.104
YEAH! WE HAD ONE HECK
OF A DUEL!

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.173
AAH!

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:07.674
HA!

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.812
Jaden: GLAD YOU COULD
JOIN US, BASTION.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.447
Bastion: SO TANIA,
A PORTAL OPENED
IN YOUR WORLD

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.183
AND BROUGHT YOU
TO THIS DIMENSION?

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.585
YES, AND IT HAPPENED
TO OTHERS AS WELL.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:19.586
HUH?

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.490
Tania:
AND WHEN WE ARRIVED,
WE WERE ALL FORCED DOWN HERE.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.691
Jaden: BUT WHERE IS HERE?!

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:27.093
Tania:
IT'S A NEW WORLD OF SOME KIND.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.830
A WORLD THAT APPEARS TO
BE RUN BY DUEL MONSTERS.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.132
OR AT LEAST
A SELECT FEW OF THEM.

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:34.034
SEE THOSE WINGED BEASTS
DOWN THERE?

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.671
THEY SEEM TO BE
THE ONES CALLING
ALL THE SHOTS.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.307
SO, CAN WE DO ANYTHING
TO HELP STOP THEM?

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:43.210
I'M WORKING ON IT.
I'VE GOT MY SOLDIERS
GOOD TO GO,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.377
BUT WE NEED A DISTRACTION.

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.281
STRAIGHT AHEAD IS
THE WINGED BEASTS' HEADQUARTERS.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.050
WE'RE PLANNING
TO AMBUSH THEM,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.019
BUT WITH ALL THOSE KURAMAS
PLAYING GUARD DUTY DOWN THERE,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.455
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.125
Axel: WHERE I'M FROM,
IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO ATTACK
UNDER COVER OF NIGHT.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.160
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
POWERS THOSE LIGHTS?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.161
UH-HUH.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.530
SO DO YOU HAVE
A PLAN?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.931
YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I DO.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:06.433
Tania: THIS WAY!

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:10.637
OHH!

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:12.906
PICK UP THE PACE,
OR ELSE!

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:15.275
YOU! FASTER!

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.844
AAH!

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:18.879
HEH HEH! NOW!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.547
AAH!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.048
SOMEONE SAVE ME!

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.118
WE GOTTA HELP HIM!
STOP!

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:28.755
IF YOU GO NOW,
YOU'LL END UP JUST
LIKE THEM, JADEN!

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.525
Tania: UP THERE IS
THE POWER SOURCE FOR THE LIGHTS.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.802
WE GOTTA KEEP
THAT GUARD BUSY.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.305
HERE'S WHAT
I'M THINKIN'.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.240
CUT THE POWER,
CUT THE LIGHT!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.543
AND WITHOUT LIGHT,
THOSE WINGED BEASTS
WON'T SEE US COMING!

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.445
EXACTLY! NOW I'LL
DISTRACT HIM

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.381
WHILE YOU CUT
THE POWER.

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.149
HOW 'BOUT YOU DEAL
WITH THE LIGHTS,

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.017
AND I DEAL WITH HIM!

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:58.018
JADEN!

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.954
AXEL, YOU'RE
THE MAN WITH THE PLAN.

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:04.291
I'LL KEEP 'EM BUSY,
WHILE YOU PULL THE PLUG!

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:05.859
HERE WE GO!
STOP HIM!

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.961
DUELING HERE IS
NOT THE SAME!

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:08.962
HUH?

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:10.330
HEY, BIRDBRAIN!
HUH?

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.898
AHH, A HUMAN.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.770
WHAT'S A PATHETIC
LITTLE WORM LIKE YOU
DOING UP HERE?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.305
LOOKIN' TO TAKE
YOU DOWN!

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.242
DOWN TO WHERE?
YOUR HUMAN LEVEL?

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.312
LISTEN UP!
WHO GAVE YOU AND YOUR
FEATHERED FRIENDS

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.680
THE RIGHT
TO BOSS EVERYONE?

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:28.848
RIGHT?
YOU MEAN PLEASURE.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:30.317
HA HA HA!

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.385
HUMANS NEVER UNDERSTAND
THEIR PLACE

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.055
IN THE PECKING ORDER,
BUT I'LL TEACH YOU.

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.656
IS THAT SO?
THEN EDUCATE ME!

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.558
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM!

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:39.859
WHEN YOU DUEL HERE,
THERE'S MORE AT STAKE

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.328
THAN JUST LOSING
THE GAME.

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:42.329
YOU CHALLENGE ME?

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.564
NOW WHO'S
THE REAL BIRDBRAIN!

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:46.066
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.901
SO BE IT.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.737
PREPARE TO GET SWOOPED
OFF YOUR FEET, PAL!

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.007
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:55.842
BUT, JADEN!

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.211
WHEN YOU DO BATTLE
IN THIS WORLD,

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.280
THE DAMAGE YOU TAKE
IS FOR REAL!

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.816
ONCE YOUR LIFE
POINTS FALL TO ZERO,

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.017
THEN IT'S GAME OVER.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.620
AND YOU GET SENT AWAY
STRAIGHT TO THE STARS!

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.621
TO THE STARS?!

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:12.726
THAT'S RIGHT AND THERE'S
NO COMING BACK,
YOU INSOLENT HUMAN!

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.760
YOU THINK
WE'RE PLAYING?

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.562
IT'S NOT A GAME,
JADEN.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.865
YOU SEE, THE ONLY WAY
TO BATTLE IS FOR YOU

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.401
TO PUT ALL OF YOUR
PRECIOUS DUEL ENERGY
ON THE LINE.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.402
DON'T DUEL, JADEN!

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.704
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!
LISTEN TO ME.

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:27.640
WE JUST DON'T
KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
THIS WORLD YET!

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.110
I'M SORRY, IT'S
TOO LATE FOR YOUR
FRIENDS TO SAVE YOU,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.444
SO PREPARE TO DUEL!

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:35.215
AND NOW, THE ONLY WAY
THE DUEL CAN BE STOPPED

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.752
IS IF YOU BEAT ME,
OR IF I BLAST YOUR
ENERGY TO THE STARS!

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:45.191
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
THERE'LL BE NO MORE DUELING
FOR YOU EVER AGAIN!

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.128
YA KNOW, IF YOU
THINK THAT

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.562
THESE STAKES
ARE SCARING ME,

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.698
THEN YOU'VE TOTALLY
FLOWN THE COOP.

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:53.767
NOW LET'S GET
STARTED.

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.102
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WAIT AROUND,

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.805
SO GET READY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GET SCRAMBLED!

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.607
YOU CRACK ME UP!

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.910
WELL, I TRIED!
BUT THIS DUEL'S
GOING TO HAPPEN!

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.814
AND IN THIS BATTLE,
LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION!

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:09.549
I'LL TAKE THE HONORS.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.550
CAW!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.988
I PLAY SUMMON STORM!

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.324
IF HE PAYS 800
OF HIS LIFE POINTS,

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.461
HE CAN INSTANTLY SUMMON
A WIND ATTRIBUTE MONSTER!

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.067
LIKE MY WHIRLWIND PRODIGY!

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.471
GET READY
TO BE BLOWN AWAY!

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.406
BECAUSE BY SACRIFICING
MY WHIRLWIND PRODIGY,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.743
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
ANOTHER WIND MONSTER!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.244
AAH!

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.947
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MY PRODIGY

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.217
AND HELLO
TO MY SIMORGH
BIRD OF DIVINITY!

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:48.121
Bastion: TWENTY-SEVEN
HUNDRED ATTACK POINTS?!

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.757
THANK GOODNESS HE
CAN'T ATTACK THIS TURN!

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.359
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
COUNT ON THAT!

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.761
I LAY A FACEDOWN

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:56.930
AND PLAY
THE SPELL LEVEL TAX!

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.865
BUT BEFORE FINISHING...
HA HA HA...

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:01.201
I ACTIVATE MY SIMORGH'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.305
NOW WE EACH TAKE
A THOUSAND POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.406
DURING EVERY END PHASE!

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:07.974
A THOUSAND POINTS?!

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.809
GO, DIVINE WIND!

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.813
[SCREECHING]

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.182
[GROANING]

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.651
JADEN!

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.956
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.428
BUT YOU SAID WE BOTH
TAKE DAMAGE

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:29.762
FROM ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.797
THAT IS TRUE!

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.232
BUT I'M PROTECTED!

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.169
AS LONG AS I HAVE
A SPELL CARD AND A TRAP CARD

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:38.471
OUT THERE ON THE FIELD,
WHICH I DO!

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.208
[THINKING]
HANG IN THERE, JADEN

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.310
'CAUSE YOU AND I BOTH
GOTTA BE LIGHTS OUT

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.945
IF WE EVER WANT TO
GET OUTTA HERE!

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.888
ALL RIGHT, PAL,
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.658
[THINKING]
HMM, NOW IF I FUSE
MY BUBBLEMAN

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.794
WITH MY CLAYMAN TO
FORM ELEMENTAL
HERO MUDBALLMAN.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.498
HE'D HAVE ENOUGH
ATTACK POINTS TO
TAKE DOWN HIS SIMORGH,

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:09.702
BUT, IF I SUMMON
A LEVEL 5 MONSTER
OR ABOVE,

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.704
THAT LEVEL TAX
SPELL CARD OF HIS

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:14.240
WILL WIPE OUT
THE SAME NUMBER
OF LIFE POINTS

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.409
AS MUDBALLMAN'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.647
AND WITH HIS
SIMORGH'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.848
WAITING
IN THE WING,

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.684
I'D BE AN ATTACK
AWAY FROM LOSING
THE DUEL.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.986
IT LOOKS LIKE
JADEN'S NOT SURE
WHAT TO DO.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.821
WELL, WITH LEVEL TAX
STILL IN PLAY,

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:32.659
JADEN HAS TO BE
VERY CAREFUL WHAT HE
SUMMONS OUT TO THE FIELD.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.827
NOW I SEE!
WITH THAT SPELL
CARD ACTIVATED,

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.596
JADEN CAN'T FUSE
ANY MONSTERS!

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.933
AND WITHOUT ANY
FUSIONS HE'S GOING
TO HAVE TO FIND

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:41.234
ANOTHER WAY TO WIN!

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.204
[THINKING]
OKAY JAY, DON'T
LET THE FEAR

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:46.239
OF GOING
TO THE STARS
GET TO YOU.

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:47.240
FIRST THINGS FIRST!

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.943
WE GOTTA STOP
SIMORGH'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.480
DON'T WORRY... I KNOW
JUST WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.716
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.586
"HOW WILL I EVER WIN,
IF I CAN'T SUMMON OUT

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.653
A HIGH-LEVEL MONSTER?"

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.589
HA HA HA!

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.725
I'M PLAYIN'
MY BUBBLEMAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:12.732
AND DUE TO HIS ABILITY,
I GET TO DRAW TWO MORE CARDS!

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.902
[THINKING]
PERFECT! THESE'LL PROTECT ME

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.503
FROM SIMORGH'S ATTACK!

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.905
IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.473
GO, DIVINE WIND!

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:22.609
[GROANING]

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.944
Bastion:
LOOK! JADEN'S SAFE!

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.747
FOR NOW.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.583
BUT, BASTION, SOMETHING
IN THE AIR IS TELLING ME

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.285
THAT THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE A BREEZE!

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:34.654
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT JADEN WON'T
JUST BLOW OVER!

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:36.623
CAW! I PLAY
TORNADO BIRD!

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.594
BY PAYING 600 LIFE POINTS,
I CAN ACTIVATE TORNADO'S

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.929
SPECIAL ABILITY...
WING REQUITAL!

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.500
AND FOR EVERY
WINGED-BEAST MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.369
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:50.937
CAW!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.939
OF COURSE,
TO USE THEM,

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.575
I HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL MY NEXT TURN!

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:56.976
BUT IN THE MEANTIME...

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.781
SIMORGH WILL TAKE OUT
YOUR BUBBLEMAN

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:05.585
WHILE TORNADO BIRD
BLOWS AWAY SOME
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:07.387
UGH!

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:12.859
BEFORE I END MY TURN,
I LAY DOWN TWO FACEDOWNS.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.129
AND NOW MY DIVINE
WIND TAKES EFFECT!

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:21.401
OHH! PHEW.

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:23.536
PATHETIC!
YOU HAVE NO OFFENSE,

00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:27.106
AND YOUR DEFENSE
WON'T PROTECT YOU
FROM ME FOREVER!

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.107
I'M UNDEFEATABLE!

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:32.045
IT'S THE OLDEST
LAW OF NATURE...

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.413
ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE!

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.849
AND THE WEAK GET
SENT TO THE STARS!

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:37.850
HA HA HA!

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.586
HUH?

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:42.422
ALL RIGHT.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.757
TIME TO SHOW
YOU SOME OFFENSE!

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.393
I PLAY THE SPELL
GRACEFUL CHARITY

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:48.861
AND DRAW
THREE CARDS!

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.399
NOW I'LL SEND
THESE TWO CARDS
TO MY GRAVE

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.968
AND SUMMON
NEO-SPACIAN
GRAND MOLE!

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.306
ALL THAT
FOR A LEVEL THREE?

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.575
THERE'S MORE TO HIM
THAN MEETS THE EYE!

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.110
BUT YOU'LL FIND
OUT SOON ENOUGH!

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.579
'CAUSE MY GRAND
MOLE'S ABOUT TO DIG
ME OUT OF TROUBLE.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:07.914
HE BEST DIG DEEP.

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.317
NOW, GRAND MOLE,
IT'S TIME TO RUFFLE
SOME FEATHERS!

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.188
ATTACK HIS SIMORGH,
BIRD OF DIVINITY!

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.325
AND DUE
TO HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.761
AFTER ATTACKING,
BOTH MONSTERS
RETURN TO OUR HANDS!

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.396
HA! I DON'T THINK SO!

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.398
I PLAY A TRAP!

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:27.767
OH, NO, IF HE EQUIPS
THAT TO SIMORGH,

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:28.735
THEN JADEN'S MOLE'LL...

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:29.902
BE DESTROYED!

00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.406
IT ALSO NEGATES
THE EFFECTS OF ITS ATTACK.

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:36.275
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MOLE'S
NOT SO GRAND AFTER ALL.

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:41.981
UGH! NOT MY MONSTER!

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:44.083
HA HA HA!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.219
THIS DOESN'T
BODE WELL!

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:48.588
WITH ONE CARD,
HE THWARTED
JADEN'S PLAN.

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:49.822
WHAT COULD BE NEXT?

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:52.525
LOOKS LIKE YOUR WEAK
MONSTERS ARE AS INEFFECTIVE

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:53.760
AS YOUR STRONG ONES!

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.928
IT'S TIME I END
THIS

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.397
WITH MY
ICARUS ATTACK!

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:00.566
NOW BY SACRIFICING
MY TORNADO BIRD,

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.770
THE TWO PROTECTION CARDS
YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIELD

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.837
ARE AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROYED!

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:06.973
[SCREECHES]

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.376
OHH!

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.613
AND TO KEEP
THINGS EXCITING,

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:14.914
I PLAY EXPLOSION WING!

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.583
NOW WITH THIS TRAP
IN PLAY,

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.186
FOR EVERY CARD THAT WAS
DESTROYED THIS LAST TURN,

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:21.754
YOU TAKE 500 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:22.422
FIVE HUNDRED?!

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.323
JADEN LOST
HIS THREE CARDS!

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:27.994
AND THAT MEANS HE TAKES
FIFTEEN HUNDRED
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.597
AAH!

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.032
JADEN!
JADEN!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.267
[GROANING]

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:39.405
[THINKING]
IF I DON'T WIN THIS,
I'LL NEVER FIND JESSE.

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.408
[THINKING]
FIGHT BACK, JADEN!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.678
I JUST NEED A LITTLE
MORE TIME SO THAT I CAN GET

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.413
TO THE TOP AND TURN
OFF THESE LIGHTS

00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:50.516
AND WITHOUT ANY FURTHER
ADO, YOU LITTLE WORM,

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:54.454
IT'S TIME I SENT YOU
TO MEET WITH THE STARS!

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:57.256
HOW 'BOUT WE JUST
PUT THAT TRIP
ON HOLD?

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.691
I PLAY
TWO FACEDOWNS!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.626
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
GETS TO LIVE

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:02.428
TO DUEL ANOTHER ROUND!

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.831
UNH! UGH!

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:08.734
I HOPE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
UP YOUR SLEEVE, JADEN,

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:11.270
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
BIRD'S ABOUT TO BLOW AWAY

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.738
THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974
IT'S BEEN QUITE
ENTERTAINING WATCHING YOU

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.609
SQUIRM THROUGHOUT
THIS DUEL.

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:19.011
YOU'VE PUT UP
QUITE THE FIGHT.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.181
BUT NOW I INTEND TO BLAST
YOU AWAY ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:26.085
[THINKING]
THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.588
IN MY DECK THAT CAN
CLIP THIS GUY'S WINGS.

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.123
SIMORGH,
FINISH HIM OFF!

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:37.897
THIS IS GOOD-BYE!

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.699
NOW GO WITH DIVINE WIND!

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.035
I PLAY MY TRAP!
A HERO EMERGES!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.605
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.908
'CAUSE MY LEVEL TAX SPELL
CARD IS STILL IN PLAY!

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.143
SO, AS SOON AS YOUR
HERO EMERGES,

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.613
YOUR FEW REMAINING
LIFE POINTS

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.816
WILL BE COMPLETELY
DESTROYED JUST LIKE YOU!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:16:59.919
IS THAT A FACT?

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:04.056
OKAY, THEN GO RIGHT
AHEAD AND PICK
THE HERO I GET.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.025
HA HA HA!
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.394
BUT I'LL CHOOSE
THE MIDDLE.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.497
HMM. LOOKS LIKE I
GET WINGED KURIBOH!

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:14.233
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.201
[CHIRPS]

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:17.336
WITH THAT
LITTLE FUR BALL?

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:21.374
HA HA! IT MEANS YOUR DECK'S
WEAKER THAN I BELIEVED!

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.976
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE
IN A HEAP OF TROUBLE!

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.578
WITH WINGED KURIBOH,
YOUR LEVEL TAX

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.113
IS ABOUT
TO GET REFUNDED!

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.315
'CAUSE BIG SURPRISES
ARE OFTEN FOUND

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:30.316
IN SMALL PACKAGES!

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:32.685
REMEMBER!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.221
LEVEL TAX DOESN'T
AFFECT LEVEL ONE MONSTERS.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.422
AND GUESS WHAT!

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.324
I GOT
ANOTHER SURPRISE.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.059
I ACTIVATE
TRANSCENDENT WINGS!

00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:43.329
THIS SHOULD EVEN
THE PLAYING FIELD,

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:44.830
DON'T YA THINK,
WINGED KURIBOH?

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:45.965
[CHIRPS]

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.834
IT CAN'T...
BUT HE'S JUST
LEVEL ONE!

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.003
HMM.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.807
NOT AFTER I
SEND TWO CARDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:55.875
NOOOO!

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.111
[CHIRPS]

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:02.848
WINGED KURIBOH'S
NOW A LEVEL 10?!

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:05.217
AND, BASTION,
EVEN WITH LEVEL TAX
SPELL CARD,

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:07.620
JADEN'S GOT ENOUGH
POINTS TO SURVIVE!

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:11.657
AAH! UNH!

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:15.795
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN!
FOR WHAT?

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.230
FOR MY WINGED
CREATURE TO ATTACK!

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.566
NOW MY EVOLVED
WINGED KURIBOH'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.201
DESTROYS
ALL YOUR MONSTERS!

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.937
AND YOU GET HIT
FOR ALL THEIR
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.938
WHAT?!

JADEN!

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.121
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.423
I THINK.

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:46.759
THANKS, BUD.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.498
[THINKING]
NOW TO KILL THOSE LIGHTS!

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.281
THE DARKNESS WORKED!
IT DID.

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.282
[CHIRPS]

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.284

OH, NO. OH.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.058
WHAT'S... GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.262
MY ENERGY
WILL NOW BE ABSORBED

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.698
AND SENT TO THE STARS.

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:28.067
BEFORE I GO,
I BEG OF YOU

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:31.137
PLEASE, DO ALL YOU CAN
TO DEFEAT <i>HIM.</i>

ALL OF THIS
IS <i>HIS DOING.</i>

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.376
HE MUST BE STOPPED
BEFORE HE DOES
ANY MORE HARM.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:41.213
PROMISE ME YOU WILL
DEFEAT THE SUPREME KING!

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.176
THIS WILL LEAD YOU
TO ANOTHER REALM
IN THIS WORLD.

PERHAPS, YOU WILL FIND
YOUR FRIEND JESSE UP THERE.

I ASSURE YOU IT'S
NOTHING LIKE THAT AT ALL.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.469
SHE MIGHT HAVE
VITAL INFORMATION

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:40.139

USE TO GET US HOME!

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:44.076
