SO, MY POWERS REVEALED
THAT YOU'VE MET MY BEASTS!

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.332
NOW THEN,
TELL ME...

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.968
WHAT DID YOU TALK
ABOUT WITH THEM?

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.370
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
ON DOING?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.007
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M NOT LETTING IT HAPPEN!

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.680

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:38.785

THE ONE I'M LOOKING
TO TEACH A LESSON TO.

NO!

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.774
NEXT TIME, YOU MIGHT
THINK TWICE BEFORE
GOING BEHIND MY BACK

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.542
WITH MY BEASTS.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:04.544
YA GOT THAT?
THESE ARE MY MONSTERS!

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.246
SO DON'T GO

IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:14.454
Jaden, thinking:
DON'T WORRY.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.990
I'LL FREE YOU GUYS
FROM THE DARKNESS
SOON ENOUGH!

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.559
Jaden: ALL RIGHT,

HE'S BACK
IN THIS!

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:18.418
BUT HE'S GOT QUITE
A WAYS TO GO. YUBEL
STILL HAS THE EDGE!

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.487
AND NOW I PLAY

FINE. BRING IT.

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.286

WOW!

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.764
AND THAT'S NOTHING
COMPARED TO HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY, SYRUS,

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.399
BECAUSE ONCE A TURN,
HE POWERS UP

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.568
AND THEN CAN DESTROY

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.670
ALL THE SPELLS
AND TRAPS ON THE FIELD.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.171

DOWN AND OUT!

I KNOW THE LAST TIME
I PLAYED IT,

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:56.549
I WAS THE SUPREME KING.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.118
