WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.570
LAST TIME ON YU-GI-OH! GX...

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.138
IT'S WORKING.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:09.142
ZANE AND JESSE HAVE
CREATED ENOUGH DUEL ENERGY
TO WIDEN THE PORTAL.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.812
WE MUST DEPLOY
THE MISSILE CONTAINING
THE RAINBOW DRAGON!

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.780
WE SEE THE MISSILE.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.349
Jesse: DUEL GHOULS!

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.885
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DUEL OUR WAY OUT!

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.152
AAH!

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.587
JADEN?!

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.222
WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY?

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.259
I THINK WE JUST FOUND
OUR WAY OUT, GUYS!

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.361
HELLO, JADEN.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.497
SO IF YOU'D
LIKE TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.433
MEET ME IN FRONT
OF DUEL ACADEMY.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.602
NOW IF YOU WIN,
I'LL RELEASE
ALL THE STUDENTS

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.104
FROM MY CONTROL,

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:41.542
BUT SHOULD YOU LOSE,
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
WILL SERVE ME FOREVER!

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.110
SO WHAT DO YOU
RECKON, JADEN?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.512

JADEN, HOPE YOU'RE READY,
'CAUSE I'VE WAITED FOR
THIS DUEL A LONG TIME.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.580
EVER SINCE CRASH LANDING

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.216
AND FINDING MYSELF DEEP BENEATH
THE EARTH'S CRUST,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:00.921
MY ONE AND ONLY DESIRE
HAS BEEN TO MAKE YOU PAY
FOR SENDING ME AWAY,

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.292
AND NOW IT APPEARS THAT DAY
IS FINALLY HERE.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.995
Alexis: SO JADEN
HAS TO REACH MARCEL
WITHIN 30 MINUTES?

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.429
Axel: YEP,
AND IF HE DOESN'T,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.932
OUR FRIENDS WILL BE
SENT AWAY FOREVER!

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.235
HE'S RIGHT,
SO WE BETTER FIND
THAT RAINBOW DRAGON.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.237
AND FIGURE OUT HOW
TO UNLOCK ITS POWER.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.473
SO, BASTION,
WHAT YA RECKON?

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.775
YOU THINK THIS CARD
WILL GET US HOME?

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:25.212
AFTER ALL IT
TOOK TO GET IT,
IT HAD BETTER!

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.480
Bastion, thinking: THAT'S
IF I CAN FIGURE OUT

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.516
WHAT EISENSTEIN
WAS TRYING TO TELL ME.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.151
[TRANSMISSION SOUND FAILING]
THE CARD MUST BE...

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.619
WITH ENERGY.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.255
DEAR ME. SOMEONE
PLEASE COME IN!

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.024
IF ONLY I HAD BEEN
ABLE TO GET
MORE INFORMATION

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.226
BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION
WAS LOST.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:43.597
Alexis: JADEN,
THIS DUEL MUST BE A TRAP!
WE CAN'T TRUST THIS GUY.

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.966
I'D SAY SHE'S GOT
A VALID POINT THERE, MATE.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.234
BUT DO WE HAVE
A CHOICE?

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.869
HE'S GOT
THE UPPER HAND NOW.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.371
SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
HAVE TO PLAY BY HIS RULES.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.106
BUT HE DOESN'T
PLAY FAIR.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.409
WELL IT'S
A RISK THAT I'M
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.245
I CAN'T CHANCE
LOSING ALL OUR
FRIENDS FOREVER.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.479
I GOT TO DUEL
THIS GUY!

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.683
WELL, THEN, SARGE,
I'M GOIN' WITH YOU!

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.817
Alexis: ME, TOO.

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:07.421
Blair: ME THREE! WE'RE
GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER!

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.588
I'M GOING ALONE.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:09.690
YOU'RE WHAT?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.859
IT'S JUST NOT
SAFE. MARCEL'S
TOO POWERFUL.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.894
HUH?
HMM?

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.562
HOW COME?

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.998
Jaden: WELL, I
TRIED TO STOP HIM,
BUT, YOU SEE, I--

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.434
I WAS TOO LATE.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:24.004
MARCEL WAS ABLE
TO GET THE THREE
SACRED BEAST CARDS.

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.006
Blair: YOU CAN'T BLAME
YOURSELF, JADEN.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.442
YOU TRIED
EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:30.377
Alexis: SO WHAT IF HE'S
GOT THE SACRED BEASTS?

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.012
YOU BATTLED THEM BEFORE!

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.847
RIGHT! AND YA
BEAT THEM.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:36.483
SO YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO TAME THOSE
BEASTS AGAIN!

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:39.219
BUT LAST TIME, BANNER
GAVE ME A SPECIAL CARD.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.521
WITHOUT SABATIEL
THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE,

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.624
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DEFEAT THEM ON MY OWN.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.260
THOSE SACRED BEASTS
ALMOST HAD ME FOR DINNER.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:54.267
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.203
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.805
THAT'S IT! I FIGURED IT OUT!

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.140
Hassleberry:
FIGURED WHAT OUT?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.342
Bastion: WHAT EISENSTEIN
WAS TRYING TO TELL US

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.578
BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION
CUT OUT.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.548
REMEMBER? HE WAS GOING
TO EXPLAIN HOW
TO UNLOCK THE DRAGON.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.883
THE SACRED BEASTS,

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.485
THEY'RE OUR TICKET
OUT OF HERE.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:12.919
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.454
THOSE THINGS
ARE SO STRONG!

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.689
I KNOW!

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.325
THE KEY MUST BE
SUMMONING THE DRAGON
DURING A DUEL,

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.460
WHERE ITS POWER
COULD BE RELEASED.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.930
THAT DRAGON WOULD HAVE
TO BE IN A PRETTY
POWERFUL BATTLE NOW.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.200
INDEED IT WOULD.
AND HERE'S HOW.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.602
THE RAINBOW
DRAGON MUST GO

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:31.938
UP AGAINST
THE THREE
SACRED BEASTS.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.273
YOU SURE?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.109
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
IF THE RAINBOW DRAGON
FOUGHT THEM,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.545
THEN MAYBE
THE ENERGY RELEASED

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:42.115
WOULD AWAKEN ITS FULL POWER
AND OPEN THE PORTAL.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.684
AND THEN WE COULD
GO BACK HOME.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.621
EXACTLY! NOW THAT
DRAGON CARD HAS
TO BE SUMMONED.

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.657
OF COURSE WE HAVE
TO FIND THE CARD
FIRST, BUT...

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.092
Jesse: THERE'S
NO TIME TO WASTE.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.227
I'M GOING TO FIND
THE RAINBOW DRAGON.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.763
AND WHEN I DO,
THOSE BEASTS WON'T
KNOW WHAT HIT THEM!

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.098
SO YOU STALL MARCEL,

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.866
AND THEN I'LL JOIN YOU
WITH THE CARD.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.268
SOUNDS GOOD.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.270
I'LL GO WITH YA, JESSE.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.406
Jim: WE GOT COMPANY,
THE KIND THAT
DROOLS AND DUELS!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.809
Hassleberry:
THEY'RE SLOUCHING DOWN
THIS TUNNEL, TOO.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.544
CAN WE ESCAPE THROUGH
THAT TUNNEL, AXEL?

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:12.979
NO DICE.
WE'RE SURROUNDED.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.382
Hassleberry:
IT'S AN AMBUSH.
GET READY,

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.950
'CAUSE WE GOT TO GET
JADEN TO THAT DUEL

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.585
BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT!

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.054
AT LEAST WE'VE GOT
A GAME PLAN NOW.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.355
LOT OF GOOD THAT IS.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.391
BECAUSE IT'S
GAME OVER IF WE
CAN'T ESCAPE.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.865
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.234
THOSE DUEL GHOULS
ARE CLOSING IN FAST!

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:35.802
Jim: SO LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:39.272
AGREED! JESSE, ONCE
WE GET TO THE SURFACE,

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.909
YOU AND AXEL HAVE GOT
TO FIND THE RAINBOW
DRAGON CARD!

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.678
WILL DO!

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.380
GUYS, WE GOT
NO TIME TO LOSE.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.716
SO GET READY TO GET
YOUR GAME ON!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.153
TIME TO RAM ON
THROUGH!

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.890
EVERYONE FALL IN
BEHIND ME!

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.292
STAY TOGETHER!
I'LL COVER OUR BACKS.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.894
AND I'LL BACK
THAT UP!

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:05.265
ALL RIGHT, GANG,
LET'S SHOW THESE
GHOULS HOW TO DUEL!

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.868
Hassleberry: YOU HEARD
THE MAN! CHARGE!

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.117
KEEP GOING. I'LL HOLD
THESE GUYS OFF.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.385
BE CAREFUL!

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.188
SAY G'DAY TO MY FOSSIL
WARRIOR SKULL KNIGHT!

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.559
CHECK IT OUT!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.561
THAT'S WHERE WE
GOT TO GO!

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.063
Bastion: ANCIENT GEAR
SOLDIER AT 9 O'CLOCK!

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.367
Hassleberry:
THAT SOLDIER'S NO MATCH
FOR MY DARK DRICERATOPS!

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.735
NOW, YOU THREE, GO!

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.169
Jaden: WAY TO EARN
YOUR STRIPES, HASSLEBERRY!

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.139
ALL RIGHT, BIG GUY, TEAR
THAT HUNK OF JUNK UP!

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.143
DUEL...

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.545
WHOA!
OH!

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.414
Bastion: WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.515
AH!

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:00.787
Jaden: THANKS FOR
THE BACK-UP, LEXI!

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.956
[ALEXIS GASPS]

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.461
[BLAIR SCREAMS IN DISTANCE]

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.630
LOOKS LIKE JADEN'S IN
A MUCK OF TROUBLE.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.167
QUICK, ALEXIS. LET'S
GIVE HIM SOME BACK-UP!

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.435
THIS SHOULD HELP!

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.306
CYBER ANGEL,
LEND 'EM A HAND!

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.044
JESSE, LET'S FIND
THAT DRAGON!

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.712
ALL RIGHT! THIS WAY.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.182
NOT WORTH IT!

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.418
LET'S DUEL, JADEN.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:32.686
Jaden: HERE THEY COME!

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:33.820
DON'T DO IT, J!

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.190
YOU HAVEN'T
GOT THE TIME!
NOW GET TO MARCEL!
