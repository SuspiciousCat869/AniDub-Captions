THAT'S DIRECTLY OVER
THE NURSE'S OFFICE!

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.541
AND THE CEILING!

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.176
IT'S OPEN!

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.545
MISS FONTAINE, BLAIR,
YOU IN HERE?

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.185
ARE WE TOO LATE?

YOU GUYS ARE OKAY!

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.360
SUPER! BOY ARE WE
GLAD THOSE THINGS
DIDN'T GET IN HERE.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.562
WE WERE AFRAID
WE WOULDN'T
MAKE IT IN TIME.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.097
WE BROUGHT
THE FIRST AID KIT!

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:19.032
BLAIR, YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALRIGHT NOW!

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.501
THANK YOU JADEN,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.541
HA HA HA!

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.878

TO BECOME ONE OF US!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.017
SO THEN...
CARE TO DUEL?

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.519
Jaden: OH, NO!
THEY TURNED YOU TOO!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.855
BUT IT'S NOT TOO
LATE TO SAVE BLAIR!

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.858
SO YOU'RE ON!!

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.659

AT LEAST IT CAN BE...

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.398
UNDERSTAND THIS...

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:52.932
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN!

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.769
TOO BAD...GUESS IT'S
THE HARD WAY THEN.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:58.571

MUCH FUN FOR YOU.

A TASTE
OF HER OWN MEDICINE.

MORE POINTS.

BUT IT ONLY LASTS
THE DURATION OF A TURN

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.430
WHENEVER YOU TAKE DAMAGE
FROM AN EFFECT.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.632
NO WAY!

STRONGER THAN

I'LL JUST PLAY

TO THEIR ORIGINAL STATE.

THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL BE ABLE
TO REMEDY THE SITUATION!
