WEBVTT

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.937
Pegasus:
AH, THE RAINBOW DRAGON TABLET.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.074
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ELUDED
MY DETECTION ALL THESE YEARS.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.842
MR. PEGASUS,
AS YOU REQUESTED,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.377
HERE IS YOUR CYBER
DESIGN INTERFACE

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.445
AND VIRTUAL
SIMULATOR.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.351
Pegasus: NOW,
MY DEAR RAINBOW DRAGON,

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.419
WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL BE ABLE
TO RETURN JADEN

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.688
AND THE REST OF DUEL ACADEMY
TO OUR WORLD.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.857
HOW I'VE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.426
IT'S TIME TO FINALLY
MAKE THIS CARD A REALITY.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.399
Zane: ALL RIGHT, JESSE.
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO DUEL.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.868
Jesse:
YOU KNOW IT.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.737
NOW, REMEMBER
WHAT EISENSTEIN SAID.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.673
THIS DUEL HAS TO CREATE
ENOUGH DUEL ENERGY

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.543
TO EXPAND THE PORTAL
BETWEEN OUR TWO WORLDS

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.312
SO THAT WE CAN SEND YOU
THE RAINBOW DRAGON CARD.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.480
LET'S GET
OUR GAME ON.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.187
[THINKING]
OH, I'M TOO LATE.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.790
MARCEL ALREADY HAS
THE SACRED BEAST CARDS.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.091
I BETTER GO FIND HIM.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.429
AH. HE MUST'VE ESCAPED
THROUGH THERE.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.797
WONDER WHERE THIS LEADS TO.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.467
WHERE AM I? HUH?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.840
HELLO, JADEN.
TRESPASSING, ARE WE?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.577
YOU KNOW THIS OFFICE
IS OFF-LIMITS
TO STUDENTS, DON'T YOU?

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.246
NOT YOU, TOO.
I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.248
HA HA HA!

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.417
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO RUN, JADEN.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.086
HA HA HA!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.254
Banner: JADEN.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.956
PROFESSOR BANNER.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.757
YOU MUST GET
TO THE TENNIS COURT.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.493
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE FOUND
A WAY BACK HOME.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.795
OH, LET'S GO.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.697
I HATE THAT CAT.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.533
WATCH OUT! AAH!

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.101
[SCREECH]
AAH!

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.640
LATER, CROWLER.
I GOT THE WORLD TO SAVE.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.747
[THINKING] SO, JADEN'S GONNA
TRY TO SAVE THE WORLD...AGAIN.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.119
THAT'S TOO BAD
BECAUSE THE ONLY ONE

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.521
WHO IS GOING TO NEED
ANY SAVING IS HIM.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.691

Pegasus: AREN'T YOU JUST
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I'VE EVER CREATED?

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:13.627
I THINK A DAB OF BLUE

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.595
WILL REALLY BALANCE
THIS COLOR SCHEME OUT.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.898
OH, YES. THIS IS MAGNIFIQUE.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.866
ALL IT NEEDS
IS A FEW FINISHING TOUCHES,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.535
AND VOILA.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:24.171
OH, YES.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:27.774
EVERYONE,
THE RAINBOW DRAGON CARD
HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.409
GET IT TO EISENSTEIN.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.011
I'M ON IT.
TRANSMITTING.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.219
Man: PROFESSOR,
WE'RE RECEIVING THE DATA

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.487
FOR THE RAINBOW
DRAGON CARD.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.559
OH, EGGZELENT.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.563
NOW, HAVE ZEM TRANSFER
ZHIS IMAGE TO A CARD
RIGHT AWAY.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.733
[THINKING]
I HOPE ZHAT JESSE
CAN KEEP UP WITH ZANE.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.901
Eisenstein: ATTENTION.
VE HAVE ZHE RAINBOW DRAGON.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.437
NOW YOU BOTH MUST DUEL
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER DUELED BEFORE.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.173
REALIZE, SHOULD EIZHER ONE
OF YOU FORFEIT OR DROP OUT,

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.608
ZHE PORTAL VILL BE LOST,

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.810
AND SO VILL THE CHANCES
OF YOU GETTING HOME.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.946
HMM.
YOU READY?

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.149
MORE THAN EVER.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.087
THEN LET'S DO THIS.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.656
I PLAY THE SPELL
GRACEFUL CHARITY,

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.659
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
3 CARDS FROM MY DECK,

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.163
AND IN RETURN,
I SEND TWO CARDS
FROM MY HAND TO THE GRAVE.

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:26.867
NOW I SUMMON
PROTO-CYBER DRAGON,

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.804
AND NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL OVERLOAD FUSION.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.874
THIS ALLOWS ME TO REMOVE
ANY FUSION-MATERIAL MONSTERS

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.209
FROM MY FIELD
OR GRAVEYARD.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.845
THEN I CAN SUMMON
A MACHINE-TYPE MONSTER.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.247
THAT'S
QUITE THE MOVE.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.215
JESSE SURE HAS HIS WORK
CUT OUT FOR HIM.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:45.552
BY REMOVING PROTO-CYBER,
CYBER PHOENIX,

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:47.721
AND CYBER OUROBOROS,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:51.591
I CAN THEN SUMMON
CHIMERATECH OVERDRAGON.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.127
BY SACRIFICING
THOSE 3 MONSTERS,

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.731
MY CHIMERATECH
GAINS 800 ATTACK POINTS
FOR EACH ONE,

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:01.735
FOR A TOTAL
OF 2,400 POINTS,

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.403
BUT IT DOESN'T
STOP THERE.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.971
MY OVERDRAGON

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.341
CAN NOW ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY
3 TIMES PER ROUND.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.144
UM, DID YOU SAY
3 ATTACKS PER ROUND?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.479
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.481
BY REMOVING MY OUROBOROS
FROM PLAY,

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:18.185
I CAN SEND A CARD
TO MY GRAVEYARD AND DRAW.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:21.421
I PLAY FUTURE FUSION.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.690
WITH THIS,
IF I SEND FUSION MONSTERS

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.992
OVER TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.395
WHEN I'M IN MY SECOND
STANDBY PHASE,

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.998
I CAN THEN SUMMON
CYBER END DRAGON.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.668
ZANE SURE IS KEEPING UP
HIS END OF THE BARGAIN.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.469
NOW IT'S UP TO JESSE.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.539
HOPE HE'S READY
'CAUSE IF HE DOESN'T FIGHT BACK,

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.975
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO GET HIM BACK.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.516
CRIKEY. THIS
ZANE FELLA'S
ONE BAD DINGO.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.218
"BAD DINGO?"
HONESTLY.

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:54.421
I REALLY THINK YOU MAKE ALL
THIS STUFF UP AS YOU GO ALONG.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.489
I HOPE JESSE IS UP
FOR THIS DUEL.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.858
HE BEST BE.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.393
HEY, STOP WORRYING
ABOUT JESSE.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.796
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE
NO GHOULS GET IN.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.564
Hassleberry:
YOU GOT IT.

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.533
I GOTTA HAND IT
TO YA, ZANE.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.435
YA SEE, I HEARD
YOU WERE GOOD,

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:09.970
BUT SO FAR, YOU'VE
BEEN GREAT.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.438
YOUR CYBER
END DRAGON

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.006
IS GONNA BE
QUITE THE CHALLENGE.

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:14.474
HOPE YOU DON'T LOSE

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.977
BEFORE I GET A CHANCE
TO TAKE IT DOWN.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.813
HOW DARE YOU
TALK TO ME THAT WAY?

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.848
HOPE THAT DECK OF YOURS
CAN BACK IT UP.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.284
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.253
YOU WANT IT?
THEN YOU GOT IT.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.856
I SUMMON CRYSTAL BEAST
AMETHYST CAT.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.062
AND NOW I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD
CRYSTAL RELEASE,

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.431
WHICH GIVES MY KITTY
SOME EXTRA CLAWS,

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.901
AS IN 800 ADDITIONAL
ATTACK POINTS,

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.135
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.536
THANKS TO HER
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:44.938
IF I SLICE
HER ATTACK POINTS,

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.407
SHE'S ALLOWED
TO ATTACK RIGHT NOW.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.611
[SCREECHES]

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.649
[SCREECHES]

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.017
HMM.

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.489
Man on radio:
PROFESSOR,

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.858
THE RAINBOW DRAGON
CARD IS READY.

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:07.794
IT'S BEING LOADED INTO
A MISSILE AS WE SPEAK.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.665
GUT. IZ ZHAIR ANY CHANGE
IN ZHE SIZE OF THE ZHE PORTAL?

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.533
BASED ON PRELIMINARY
READINGS,

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.868
EVERYTHING
IS THE SAME,

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:16.236
NOTHING
HAS BEEN ALTERED.

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:18.104
ZHAY MUST
RAISE THEIR GAME.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.173
VE NEED MORE
DUELING ENERGY,

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.042
ZO ZHEY MUSN'T
HOLD BACK.

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:23.777
IF THEY DON'T INCREASE
ZHAIR INTENSITY,

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.378
ZHE PORTAL
WILL CLOSE.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.014
I PLAY THIS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:31.518
PLEASE. I DOUBT
ANY FACEDOWN YOU HAVE
CAN STOP THIS.

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:35.588
I FUSE MY CYBER DARK HORN,
DARK KEEL, AND DARK EDGE,

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:41.895
AND NOW I'LL CREATE
CYBER DARK DRAGON.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.263
WITH HIS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.198
IF THERE'S A DRAGON
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.434
HE CAN ABSORB
ITS ATTACK POINTS,

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:48.868
SO THAT MEANS

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.371
CYBER DARK DRAGON'S
STRENGTH INTENSIFIES,

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.243
AND THEN FOR EVERY
MONSTER IN MY GRAVE,

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:59.279
HE GAINS ANOTHER
100 POINTS,

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.648
SO MY DRAGON
GETS EVEN STRONGER.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.049
CYBER DARK DRAGON,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.851
ATTACK WITH
DARK CYBER STREAM.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.962
AAH!

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.364
RGH!
UH!
AAH!

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.932
HANG TOUGH,
JESSE.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.034
AAH!
WHAT
AN ENERGY SPIKE.

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:24.471
UP THERE.
WHAT IS IT?

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:26.873
HUH?
HUH?

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:31.611
Bastion: THAT ATTACK
HAS TRIGGERED SOMETHING.

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.146
THE PORTAL.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.382
I BELIEVE IT LOOKS
AS THOUGH IT'S
BEGINNING TO WIDEN.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:37.117
[PANTING]

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:38.918
WITH MY AMEYTHYST CAT
DESTROYED,

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:41.488
IT BECOMES
A CRYSTAL IN MY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD ZONE,

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:45.525
AND 'CAUSE CYBER DARK
DRAGON ALSO TOOK OUT
CRYSTAL RELEASE,

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.961
I'M ALLOWED
TO SEARCH MY DECK
FOR ANOTHER CRYSTAL...

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.096
LIKE RUBY.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.866
THOSE WON'T HELP.
NOTHING CAN STOP MY ATTACKS.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.934
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE WIDE OPEN.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.470
CHIMERATECH OVERDRAGON,
ATTACK.

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:01.674
HUH.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.276
THIS SURE
WON'T BE PRETTY.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:07.013
DON'T FORGET, THIS ATTACK
IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.485
PROFESSOR BANNER,

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.554
AREN'T THE TENNIS COURTS
THE OTHER WAY?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.689
WHERE EXACTLY
ARE YOU TAKING US?

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.926
Banner: DON'T FOLLOW ME.
I'M STUCK INSIDE A CAT.

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.094
HUH?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.931
SO, WHERE'S PHARAOH
TAKING US?

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.834
[MEOW]
TO A FISH? HUH?

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:32.572
HELLO AGAIN.
IT'S RUDE TO RUN OFF.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.108
CROWLER, LISTEN.
WE'RE--HUH?

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:38.545
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:42.415
I GUESS I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TEACH
YOU SOME MANNERS.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.717
YOU AND WHAT ARMY?

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.319
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.521
Jaden: OH, THAT ARMY.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.524
HEH HEH HEH!
HA HA HA!

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.592
OH...

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:57.730
OH!

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.432
BETTER GET
YOUR GAME ON, JAY,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.867
OR YOU'LL BE LONG GONE.

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.775
Jaden: EASY NOW, FELLAS.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.278
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DUEL MY WAY OUT OF THIS.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.913
HUH? WHOA!

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.852
UH! OHH! HUH?

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:20.186
BONAPARTE?

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.188
JADEN, THERE'S
A SECRET WAY OUT.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.890
A NETWORK OF
UNDERGROUND PIPING

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.291
LEADS OUT
OF THIS ROOM.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.627
UH, BUT WHERE
DOES IT LEAD TO?

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.362
IT LEADS TO
THE TENNIS COURTS,

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.964
WHERE THE REST
OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.966
YOU MUST HURRY.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.300
NOW, I'LL STAY BEHIND

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.702
AND MAKE SURE
NO DUEL GHOULS

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.137
FOLLOW YOU
BACK THERE.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.571
BE CAREFUL.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.547
IF THIS ATTACK HITS JESSE,
THIS DUEL'S OVER.

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:49.115
Jesse: NOT SO FAST.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.518
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN
CRYSTAL PAIR.

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:57.190
Jesse: SORRY, ZANE,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.791
BUT WITH TWO CRYSTALS
ON THE FIELD,

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.326
MY CRYSTAL PAIR
TRAP CARD

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.895
CANCELS YOUR ATTACK.

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:04.664
IT ALSO LETS ME PICK OUT
ANOTHER CRYSTAL.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.000
NOT A BAD COMBO.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.302
Hassleberry:
NOT BAD AT ALL.
WAY TO GO, JESSE.

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:10.904
HUH?

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:12.238
DUEL GHOULS.

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.606
WE CAN'T LET 'EM
STOP THIS MATCH.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.642
Zane: WE DON'T HAVE
THE DUEL ENERGY WE NEED.

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.477
BUY US SOME TIME.

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:18.845
HMM.
HMM.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.713
HUH!
AGH!

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.649
HMPH.
HMPH.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.018
Hassleberry: WE NEED
TO BUY US A MIRACLE.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.086
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.456
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.592
Axel: YEAH?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, HASSELBERRY.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.528
I DON'T HAVE ANY MIRACLES,
BUT MAYBE THIS WILL DO.

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:41.601
Axel:
IF YA CAN'T STAND THE HEAT,
THEN GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:42.869
HEH!

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.439
UH! HUH?
AGH! HUH?

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.674
ALL RIGHT.

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.842
TIME TO DEAL OUT
A LITTLE DINO DEFENSE.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.844
GO, BLACK STEGO!

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.346
THE PERIMETER'S SECURE,

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:55.048
BUT FOR HOW LONG,
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:01.421
IT'S STILL MY GO,
SO I SUMMON

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.823
CRYSTAL BEAST
SAPPHIRE PEGASUS.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.961
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.196
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
WE SLAY SOME DRAGONS?

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.731
YOU READ MY MIND.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.066
NOW SHOW 'EM
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.068
N' DO YOUR THING,

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.136
AND, ZANE, IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT,

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:19.372
WHEN MY PEGASUS IS
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD,

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:21.874
ANOTHER CRYSTAL GETS
SUMMONED, AS WELL,

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:24.777
LIKE SO,
AND NOW I ACTIVATE

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:27.914
RUBY CARBUNCLE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.984
SEE, WHEN
HE'S IN MY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD ZONE,

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.486
I'M ALLOWED TO
SUMMON EACH OF THE
CRYSTAL BEASTS

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:34.954
THAT ARE THERE,
AS WELL.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.890
EEH!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.459
GO,
RUBY RAMPAGE.

00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:45.131
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
AMETHYST CAT,

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.034
EMERALD TURTLE,
AND AMBER MAMMOTH...

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:55.875
AND FINALLY,

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.845
I'LL THROW DOWN
A COUPLE OF FACEDOWNS.

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.546
NICE MOVE.

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:03.716
NOW, THIS IS WHAT I WAS
HOPING FOR--A CHALLENGE.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.885
NOW PREPARE YOURSELF.

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.421
THIS IS THE MOMENT
YOU'VE BEEN EAGERLY AWAITING.

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:10.323
WITH THE EFFECT
OF FUTURE FUSION,

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:13.092
I CAN NOW SUMMON
CYBER END DRAGON.

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.296
UH...

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.998
HUH?
HUH?

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.167
LOOK OUT.
OHH...

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.502
HUH.
HUH.

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.977
[ROARS]

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.346
ALL RIGHT.
TIME TO SEE
HOW GOOD I AM.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.251
CYBER END?

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:41.821
UH, JESSE, I THINK
I NEED TO CHANGE MY SHELL.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.057
OK. THAT'S
JUST GROSS.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.892
NOW ALL OF Y'ALL
LISTEN UP.

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.427
I GOT MYSELF
A STRATEGY

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:49.562
THAT'S GONNA
PROTECT US ALL
FROM THAT THING,

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.531
AND IT STARTS
WITH THIS--

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:53.166
MY CRYSTAL FORTRESS.

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.738
YA SEE, WHEN THIS
TRAP CARD IS ACTIVATED,

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:01.341
EACH CRYSTAL BEAST
THAT I HAVE ON THE FIELD

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.543
IS COUNTED
AS 1,000 POINTS.

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:04.811
WHEN TOTALED,
ANY MONSTER

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:06.612
WITH LESS ATTACK POINTS
CAN'T ATTACK.

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.748
SO, JESSE'S SAFE
FROM ZANE'S DRAGON.

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:11.384
ASTER,
LET ME REDEFINE

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:14.120
THE DEFINITION
OF "SAFE" FOR YOU.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.522
NOW I CAST POWER LOAD.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.727
THANKS TO THIS SPELL,
MY CYBER END DRAGON

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:23.129
GAINS 400 POINTS
FOR EACH ATTACK

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.866
THAT MY CHYMERATECH
AND CYBER DARK DRAGON
COULD MAKE,

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:30.069
SO WITH AN EXTRA
1,600 ATTACK POINTS,

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.571
CYBER END
IS STRONG ENOUGH

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.840
TO SEND A LITTLE
FURY YOUR WAY.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.275
YOU CAME CLOSE TO PUTTING
AN END TO MY DRAGON.

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:39.178
TOO BAD YOU
AND YOUR CRYSTALS
CAME UP SHORT.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:42.715
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR CRYSTAL FORTRESS
IS ABOUT TO BE CONQUERED.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.389
AH! NOT GOOD.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:54.727
THIS SHOULD PROVIDE A NICE
LITTLE SPIKE IN DUEL ENERGY.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.896
HERE IT IS--

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.366
CYBER END DRAGON
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE.

00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:05.671
SAVE ME, JESSE.

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.140
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.575
'CAUSE I'M PLAYIN'
AMBER CRYSTAL CIRCLE.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.986
YOU SEE,
WHEN AMBER MAMMOTH
IS ATTACKED

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:22.155
AND THIS TRAP
IS PLAYED,

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:24.891
HIS ATTACK POINTS GET
PUMPED UP TO THE NUMBER
OF ATTACK POINTS

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:26.526
THE REST
OF MY BEASTS TOTAL,

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:28.060
AND THAT GIVES HIM
THE SAME STRENGTH

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.996
AS YOUR CYBER END
DRAGON'S ATTACK.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.569
AAH!

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:38.204
AH!
AH!

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:39.972
AH!
AH!

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:44.811
UH!

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.679
Eisenstein: ZHE PORTAL!

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.850
Bastion:
IT'S BEGINNING TO WIDEN.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.259
Eisenstein:
IT'S VERKING.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.395
ZANE UND JESSE HAVE CREATED
ENOUGH DUEL ENERGY

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:04.030
TO VIDEN THE PORTAL.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.466
THE READING'S
GETTING STRONGER.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.034
GET READY.

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:11.037
WE MUST DEPLOY ZHE MISSILE
CONTAINING THE RAINBOW DRAGON

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.905
BEFORE ZHE PORTAL
DISAPPEARS.

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.774
SEND IT THROUGH
ON MY MARK.

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:16.209
Man: WE'RE LOCKED
ON THE TARGET.

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.510
ZHEN FIRE.

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:25.918
THE MISSILE HAS LAUNCHED
SUCCESSFULLY.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.620
NOW VE VAIT

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.323
AND HOPE IT FINDS
ITS VAY TO DHEM.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.058
AAH!
AW!

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:35.061
THE POWER SURGE
IS SHORT-CIRCUITING
THE CONSOLE.

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:37.997
WELL-PLAYED, JESSE.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.298
AH!

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.301
BASTION...
IS THAT...

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:43.803
IT IS.

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.806
THE DRAGON. RIGHT.

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:48.608
WE SEE THE MISSILE.

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:49.909
ONCE WE ACQUIRE
THE CARD,

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.177
HOW DO WE
TRIGGER THE POWER

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.646
OF THE RAINBOW DRAGON
TO WIDEN THE PORTAL?

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.616
THE CARD MUST BE...
WITH ENERGY.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.687
DEAR ME, SOMEONE
PLEASE COME IN.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.089
AH!
HUH?

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:04.457
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.295
UH, GUYS, DOES ANYBODY
KNOW OF ANOTHER WAY
OUT OF HERE?

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:11.364
NOPE.
THE ONLY WAY OUT'S
THROUGH THEM.

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:15.701
HUH? BASTION,
UP THERE.
AH.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.870
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.172
DUEL...
DUEL...
DUEL...

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:21.674
DUEL GHOULS.

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:23.175
BY THE LOOKS
OF THINGS,

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.977
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DUEL OUR WAY OUT.

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:28.381
HUH? RRGH! AAH!

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.249
NEOS!

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.218
WHERE'D HE
COME FROM?
JADEN?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.353
ALL RIGHT.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.322
HUH.

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:38.324
WHAT'S UP,
EVERYBODY?

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:40.927
I THINK WE JUST FOUND
OUR WAY OUT, GUYS.

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:44.497
I FEEL IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE OF SCENERY...

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.269
SO I'LL PLAY
MY HOUSE OF SAND FIELD SPELL.

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:57.076
AND NOW TO GET EVEN.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.844
I KNOW IT WAS
YOUR DECISION, JADEN,

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:01.414
TO SEAL ME UP AND SEND ME AWAY,

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.317
BUT WE WERE DESTINED
TO BE REUNITED.

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.419
I KNOW YOU NEVER WANTED
TO SEE ME AGAIN,

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.721
BUT FATE HAD
A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR US.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:10.823
IT WAS GIVING ME
A SECOND CHANCE,

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.825
PROVIDING ME WITH PROTECTION

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:15.728
AND A RENEWED HOPE
OF SEEING YOU AGAIN.

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:17.363
HA HA HA!

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.537
AND WHEN I SEE YOU,
REVENGE WILL BE ALL MINE.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.442
Jesse: JADEN, WHERE
IN TARNATIONS ARE WE?

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.210
Jaden: I'M NOT
EXACTLY SURE.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.613
IT'S SOME SORT
OF UNDERGROUND
TUNNEL SYSTEM.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.881
LOOKS LIKE IT
GOES ON FOREVER.

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.017
HOW DID YOU
FIND IT?
YEAH, JAY.

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:40.620
WHAT MADE YOU COME DOWN
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.388
BONAPARTE.
HE SHOWED IT TO ME

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:44.256
WHEN HE RESCUED ME
FROM CROWLER.

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:46.459
CROWLER?
HUH?
HUH?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.995
OH, NO. IF THEY'VE GOT HIM,
WE'RE DONE FOR.

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.329
NO, WE'RE NOT.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.064
NOW, YOU CAN'T START
THINKING LIKE THAT.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.000
WE MADE IT THIS FAR,
DIDN'T WE?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.835
WE JUST NEED
THAT CARD.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:57.370
WE FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO GET HOME.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.373
PEGASUS WAS ABLE TO CREATE
THE RAINBOW DRAGON CARD,

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:02.942
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO GET US BACK TO OUR WORLD.

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:05.544
WELL, DID HE
GET IT TO YOU?
MM-HMM.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.346
HE SENT IT TO US
IN A MISSILE

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:08.848
THROUGH
AN INTER-DIMENSIONAL
PORTAL,

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:10.349
AND WITH THE POWER
OF THE CARD,

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.585
WE'LL WIDEN THAT PORTAL
TO GET US ALL HOME,

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:15.354
RIGHT, BASTION?

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:16.989
AH.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.958
[THINKING] OF COURSE,
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CARD IS

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.394
OR EVEN HOW TO USE IT,

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:23.929
AND WITH THE TRANSMISSION
TO EISENSTEIN LOST,

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.665
WE MAY NEVER KNOW.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.199
Jesse:
WELL, THEN WHAT
ARE WE WAITING FOR?

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.368
LET'S FIND THAT
DRAGON AND GET HOME.

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:31.470
[FEEDBACK]

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.772
Marcel on P.A.:
HELLO, JADEN.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.677
I WANTED TO APPLAUD YOU FOR
ELUDING MY GHOULS ALL THIS TIME.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.247
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D LAST,

00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:43.516
BUT I THINK ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.285
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:48.921
MEET ME
IN FRONT OF DUEL ACADEMY.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.556
NOW, IF YOU WIN,

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.958
I'LL RELEASE ALL THE STUDENTS
FROM MY CONTROL,

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.393
BUT SHOULD YOU LOSE,

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.897
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
WILL SERVE ME FOREVER.

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:00.332
SO, JADEN, DO YOU AGREE
TO MY TERMS?

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.702
AS AN ADDED INCENTIVE,

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.804
YOU HAVE ONLY 30 MINUTES
TO GET UP HERE.

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:06.205
OTHERWISE, I'LL SEND
YOUR DUEL GHOUL FRIENDS

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.473
AWAY FOREVER.

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:08.474
[FEEDBACK]

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.612
Bation: HE'S NOT GIVING US
MUCH OF A CHOICE NOW, IS HE?

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.514
SO, WHAT DO YOU
RECKON, JADEN?

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:17.583
HRGH!

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:19.852
IF HE WANTS A DUEL,
HE'S GOT ONE.
