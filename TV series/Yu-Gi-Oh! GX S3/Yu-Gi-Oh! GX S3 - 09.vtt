JOIN THE PARTY.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.074
I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN,

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:09.842
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:12.445
TELL ME.
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE BETRAYED

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:15.081
BY EVERY ONE OF
YOUR MONSTERS?

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:17.283
NOT UNLIKE
KING AKUNUMKANON

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:20.319
AT THE END OF THE EARLY
DYNASTIC PERIOD, RIGHT?

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.522
SAY WHAT?
ENOUGH WITH ALL
THE ANCIENT HISTORY!

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.691
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY DUELING
IN THE PRESENT?

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:29.261
IGNORANCE AND POWER ARE
A DEADLY COMBINATION,

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.564
AND YOU POSSES BOTH...

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.598
FOR NOW.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.200
BUT BEFORE LONG,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.969
YOUR POWER WILL BELONG
TO VIPER!

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.505
