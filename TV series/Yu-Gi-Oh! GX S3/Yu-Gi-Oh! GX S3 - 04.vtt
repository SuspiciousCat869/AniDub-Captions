00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:12.124
READY FOR THIS?

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:16.028
I ACTIVATE MY BLAZE
ACCELERATOR!

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.029
WHAT'S THAT?

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.864
MY SECRET WEAPON.

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:23.069
IT FIRES OUT
PYRO-TYPE MONSTERS
WITH 500 POINTS OR LESS.

00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:25.137
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
FOR YOURSELF!

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:28.040
I'M LOADING UP
VOLCANIC SHELL!

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:35.181
NOW FIRE!

00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:39.418
I ACTIVATE
MY DE-FUSION
SPELL CARD!

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.357
NICE MOVE, SARGE!

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:45.558
YEAH. GOOD THINKING!

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.960
YOU MAY HAVE DODGED
THAT BULLET, SON,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.229
BUT YOU CAN'T PULL
THE SAME TACTIC TWICE!

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.497
SO BRACE YOURSELF!

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.433
BUT YOU CAN'T
ATTACK ME AGAIN
UNTIL YOUR NEXT TURN!

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.901
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:59.639
I ACTIVATE
VOLCANIC SHELL'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.475
I PAY 500 POINTS!

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.044
IN EXCHANGE, I CAN
FIRE ANOTHER ONE NOW!

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:08.481
LOADING UP
VOLCANIC SHELL NUMBER TWO!

00:19:14.854 --> 00:19:18.457
FIRE AWAY!

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:21.560
UH! MY BURSTINATRIX!

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.995
CAN WE SPEED THIS UP?

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.664
I'M KIND OF SHORT
ON TIME HERE!

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.699
YOU HOLD TIGHT,
LITTLE MAN!

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:27.867
[GROWLS]

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:31.003
I'LL TOSS ONE CARD
FACE-DOWN AND TAKE A BREAK.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.073
NOW, YOU BETTER
DO SOMETHING BEFORE
THAT ROPE TAKES A BREAK.

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.641
Jaden, thinking:
HE'S RIGHT.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.510
BUT DID HE
REALLY GO THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.380
JUST TO DUEL ME,
OR IS AXEL UP
TO SOMETHING ELSE?
