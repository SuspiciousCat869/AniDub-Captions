WEBVTT

00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.770
LAST TIME
ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.475
ADRIAN, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO BE AN ELITE OPERATIVE FOR
THE GECKO FINANCIAL GROUP?

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.012
QUIT STALLIN'! TIME'S UP!
NOW HAND OVER THAT CARD!

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.548
EARN IT!
NO MORE GAMES!

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.756
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.791
Jaden: HEY,
SOMETHING'S MOVING!

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.193
IT'S VIPER!

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.694
WHERE COULD HE BE GOIN'?

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.830
YA THINK HE WANTS US
TO FOLLOW HIM?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.066
WELL,
LET'S FIND OUT!

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.469
Boy of Light:
ADRIAN...

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.071
DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY GAMES?

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.407
I CAN READ YOUR MIND.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.710
IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME
TO PLAY.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.847
AND THIS GAME IS
JUST GETTING STARTED.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.286
Viper:
JADEN, WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE,
I WILL COMPLETE MY MISSION!

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.187
Jaden:
I'M NOT HELPING YOU
WITH ANYTHING!

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.823
GOT THAT?

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.459
WE'LL SEE.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.461
Jim: LOOKS LIKE HE'S
TAKING US TOPSIDE, MATES!

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:07.000
THE ONE I WANT
IS JADEN YUKI!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.604
LOOKS TO ME
LIKE IT'S TIME TO GET
YOUR GAME ON, VIPER!

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:13.674
TO START,
I'LL SUMMON VENOM SNAKE!

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.445
CAREFUL OF HIS BITE.
YOU SEE, ONCE PER ROUND,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.548
MY SNAKE CAN STRIKE ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS DIRECTLY.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.352
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
VENOM SWAMP.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.154
WELCOME TO THE MUCK.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.822
WITH THIS FIELD SPELL,

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:32.859
ALL MONSTERS THAT ARE
NON-VENOM ARE POISONED.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.429
SOON YOUR ENERGY WILL
BE ALL MINE

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.864

Viper: HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY VENOM SWAMP SO FAR?

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.802
THIS SNAKE PIT BITES!

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:50.037
HA HA HA HA!

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:52.839
MY VENOM SWAMP IS
A TREACHEROUS PLACE
TO PLAY.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.008
JADEN, YOU SHOULD WATCH
WHERE YOU STEP.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.415
Adrian: LET ME DOWN.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.116
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:07.120
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE JADEN PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.123
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO,
VIPER,

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.993
AND THEN YOU'LL GET
YOUR REWARD.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.561
[THINKING]
IT SHALL BE DONE.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.997
GAME ON! AND I PLAY

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.966
A SPELL CARD:
POLYMERIZATION!

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.636
AND WITH IT,
I'LL FUSE ELEMENTAL
HERO SPARKMAN

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:25.572
AND BLADEDGE
TO FORM...

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.774
ELEMENTAL HERO
PLASMA VICE!

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.078
PLASMA?

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.412
THAT'S QUITE
THE SOLDIER!

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.914
HE MUST BE
A NEW RECRUIT!

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:36.016
NOW! PLASMA VICE,

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:38.118
ATTACK WITH
PLASMA PULSATION!

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.025
UH!

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:48.295
ALL RIGHT!
GOOD SHOT, JAY!
WAY TO BITE BACK!

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.667
IMPRESSIVE MONSTER.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:57.070
ENJOY IT NOW.
IT WON'T BE AROUND MUCH LONGER.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.140
I PLAY...
MY SNAKE WHISTLE!

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.944
WHEN YOU ATTACK AND DESTROY
A REPTILE MONSTER, GUESS WHAT?

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.880
THIS TRAP LETS ME CALL
UPON ANOTHER ONE!

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.582
BUT I'M NOT DONE!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.284
NEXT I REVEAL A FACEDOWN!

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.720
THE TRAP,
DAMAGE EQUALS REPTILE!

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.090
WITH THIS IN PLAY,
I CAN SUMMON ANY MONSTER
I CHOOSE TO THE FIELD.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.762
OF COURSE, ITS ATTACK POINTS
MUST TOTAL THE DAMAGE I TOOK
FROM YOUR PLASMA VICE'S ATTACK.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.630
WHAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.633
THAT'S TWO MONSTERS
YOU HAVE TO FACE.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.237
HERE'S ONE!
VENOM BOA!

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.974
AND NOW THE SECOND!
VENOM SERPENT!

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.476
AND DON'T FORGET,
AT THE END OF EACH TURN,

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.746
VENOM SWAMP'S EFFECT
ACTIVATES,

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.983
WHICH MEANS NOW
A SNAKE INJECTS
YOUR MONSTER WITH POISON,

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.685
DRAINING
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:46.720
OH, NO!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.188
IF THOSE SNAKES
KEEP ATTACKIN',

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.123
JADEN WON'T LAST
MUCH LONGER.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.658
WE GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO HELP HIM!

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.593
ANYBODY GOT
ANY BRIGHT IDEAS?

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.862
I SAY WE DO
A LITTLE SEEK
AND DESTROY!

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.030
JAY DOESN'T NEED
ANY HELP!

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.999
SHOW HIM
WHO'S DA MAN!

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.469
[THINKING]
I WOULD IF I WASN'T
SO SWAMPED RIGHT NOW.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.372
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN.
I DRAW!

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:08.475
BUT FIRST,
MY VENOM SERPENT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.844
WHICH ALLOWS MY SWAMP
TO RELEASE YET ANOTHER SNAKE

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.013
TO DRAIN YOUR PLASMA'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.553
AND NOW, VENOM BOA
INFLICTS TWICE THE PAIN,

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:22.122
AS HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
ALLOWS TWO MORE SNAKES

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:25.392
TO DRAIN 1,000 OF YOUR
HERO'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.027
THEY'RE EATING HIM
ALIVE!

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:29.362
DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY ANTI-VENOM?

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.965
PLASMA SURE
COULD USE SOME
OVER THERE.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.836
AND NOW, I SACRIFICE
BOTH MY VENOM SERPENT

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.737
AND MY VENOM BOA!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.875
THEIR LOSS IS MY GAIN!

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.812
COME FORTH, VENOMINON,
THE KING OF POISONOUS SNAKES!

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:55.822
HEY!

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.490
[THINKING]
IT'S GOT ZERO
ATTACK POINTS?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.627
RUBY, THAT SNAKE MUST
HAVE ONE HECK OF
A SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:03.230
AND I HAVE A FEELING
VIPER'S GONNA SHOW
WHAT IT IS!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.269
[THINKING]
WHAT'S THAT
VENOMINON GONNA DO

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.338
WITHOUT ANY
ATTACK POINTS?

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.506
MY KING MAY LOOK WEAK
RIGHT NOW,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.942
BUT FOR EACH ONE OF
HIS REPTILE SUBJECTS
IN MY GRAVE,

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.712
HIS HIGHNESS GAINS
500 POINTS.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.749
WITH THREE ALREADY THERE,
HE GAINS 1500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.784
NOW HE GETS
THE ROYAL TREATMENT!

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.090
VENOMINON! ATTACK!

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.758
GO, FANGED VENOM!

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.533
AND FINALLY,
I SHALL PLAY A FACEDOWN.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.003
IT'S YOUR TURN, JADEN.
GOOD LUCK.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.940
Jesse: VIPER!

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.742
I'M NOT BUYING
ALL OF THIS!

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.745
ME AND RUBY HERE ARE
SMELLIN' SOMETHING FOUL
IN THE AIR!

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.446
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR SWAMP!

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:56.716
WHO ARE YOU WORKIN' WITH?
NO MORE LIES!

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.119
NOW 'FESS UP!
SPILL THE BEANS,

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.855
AND YOU TELL US
WHAT THIS IS REALLY
ALL ABOUT!

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:04.190
YA GOT THAT, VIPER?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.626
MY, MY, WHAT EVER
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:09.329
DON'T PLAY DUMB, VIPER!
UH, YEAH.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.731
WE'RE TOO SMART
TO FALL FOR
THAT OLD TRICK.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.133
AT LEAST
THEY ARE.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:16.303
WELL, THEN, SINCE
YOU'RE ALL SO EAGER
TO FIND OUT...

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:17.470
I'LL SAY!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.307
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
SHOW AND TELL?

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.342
CRIKEY!
EWW!

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:25.178
WHATCHA GOT THERE,
A CASE OF POISON OAK?

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.546
A FEW YEARS AGO,

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:29.749
I WAS THE LEADER OF
AN ELITE SPECIAL FORCES TEAM.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.885
SOMETHING HAD
CRASH-LANDED ON EARTH,

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:35.221
AND WE WERE THE GUYS SENT
TO PICK UP THE PIECES.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.723
WHAT WAS IT?

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:39.826
OUR INTEL WAS VAGUE,
BUT OUR MISSION DIRECTIVES
WERE CRYSTAL-CLEAR:

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:42.095
RECOVER THE ITEM
AND DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:44.931
THE MATTER WAS CONSIDERED
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.633
CLASSIFIED?

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.973
Viper: THE ORDERS WERE SIMPLE,
BUT CARRYING THEM OUT
PROVED DIFFICULT.

00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.841
SOMETHING HIT US,
AND WHEN I AWOKE,

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:59.913
I FOUND THAT OUR TRANSPORT
WAS HEAVILY DAMAGED.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:03.817
MY TEAM WAS BADLY INJURED,
SO I CONTINUED ON ALONE.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.452
I HAD NEVER FAILED
A MISSION,

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:09.389
AND I WASN'T PLANNING
ON STARTING NOW.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.890
AFTER WALKING FOR HOURS,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.028
I FINALLY REACHED
THE TARGET'S COORDINATES.

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.197
I WASN'T SURE
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:20.333
BUT SOMETHING INSIDE ME
TOLD ME I WAS CLOSE.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.703
I COULD FEEL THE PRESENCE
OF SOMETHING EXTREMELY POWERFUL.

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:30.443
AND THEN,
IT CALLED OUT TO ME.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.446
Boy of Light:
PLEASE. HELP ME, VIPER.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.782
IT KNEW MY NAME.

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:39.419
SAVE ME, AND I PROMISE

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.889
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT,

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.459
EVEN...THE ONE YOU MISS.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.228
QUIET!

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:52.332
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.000
HIM WHO?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.068
WHO'S HIM?

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:58.338
Syrus: ANYBODY ELSE
AS CONFUSED AS I AM?

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:03.343
Viper: THE CREATURE PROMISED
TO BRING BACK MY SON.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:05.678
PEARSE!

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.114
I COULD SEE HIM RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME,

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.849
AND THEN HE WAS GONE.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.688
FOR REAL?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.257
I ONCE HAD A FAMILY,

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.993
AND I FOUND IT IN
THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:22.128
IT WAS ONE OF
MY FIRST TOURS OF DUTY.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.964
MY SQUAD AND I WERE EVADING
CAPTURE FROM THE ENEMY.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:28.368
WE WERE HEADING
TO OUR RENDEZVOUS POINT
TO BE AIRLIFTED TO SAFETY.

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.904
IT WAS THEN THAT I HEARD
A BABY CRYING,

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.840
SO I BROKE FORMATION TO SEE
WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.744
BUT WHILE I WAS GONE,
MY TEAM WAS AMBUSHED
AND TAKEN CAPTIVE.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.413
I SAVED THIS CHILD
AT THE COST OF MY MEN,

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.982
SO I MADE A VOW
TO ALWAYS PROTECT HIM.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:46.352
A BOND HAD BEEN CREATED
THAT WOULD LAST A LIFETIME,

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.154
OR SO I THOUGHT.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.689
WHOA!

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.958
THESE DUEL MONSTER CARDS
ARE AWESOME!

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.593
CAN WE PLAY
A QUICK GAME, DAD?

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.129
AS SOON AS I GET HOME
FROM WORK, YOU BETCHA!

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.531
DON'T LOSE TRACK
OF THOSE CARDS NOW.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:02.335
YES, SIR,
ANYTHING YOU SAY!
THANK YOU, DADDY!

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:05.105
HA HA!
OH! WHOA, NO!

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.607
Viper: AND SOON THE WINDS
OF FATE CHANGED, TOO,

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.944
AND MY SON BECAME
VERY ILL.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.712
AND NOW
THIS STRANGE CREATURE

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.316
WAS GIVING ME THE CHANCE
TO GET MY BOY BACK.

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:20.086
I COULDN'T SAY NO,
NO MATTER WHAT I HAD TO DO.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:22.055
Boy of Light: IT'S TRUE.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.058
WE BECAME THE BEST
OF FRIENDS THAT DAY.

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.227
THAT THING HE FOUND
WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:31.898
YES, AND MY NEW FRIEND
WAS TO DO MY BIDDING.

00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:35.635
Viper: I AGREED TO HELP IT,
AND IT AGREED TO HELP ME!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.036
YOU'VE BEEN SUCKING
ALL THIS ENERGY

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.339
FOR SOME CREATURE
TO BRING YOUR SON BACK?

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.308
HOW MANY MORE STUDENTS
ARE YOU WILLING
TO SACRIFICE FOR HIM?

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.843
JUST ONE MORE.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.446
FOR, YOU SEE, MY PLAN
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.214
JADEN IS THE LAST.

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.816
NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MATE!

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.018
THAT CREATURE'S GOT
YA THINKIN' FUNNY.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.254
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:55.855
YA GOTTA
BREAK FREE!

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.357
YEAH!
PSST!

00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:59.859
SYRUS, LISTEN.
GET READY!

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:01.561
READY FOR WHAT?

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.563
I GOT MYSELF A PLAN!

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:05.431
WE'RE GONNA HELP
THE SARGE OUT!

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.501
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
TRY AND EVEN OUT
THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.136
YOU DISTRACT VIPER.
MMM?

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:13.740
AND I'LL PILE-DRIVE
THE POISON
OUTTA HIM.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.910
Boy of Light:
THAT'S CHEATING!

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.011
ABORT THE MISSION!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.279
SYRUS!

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.747
Jesse: THE SNAKES
HAVE GOT A HOLD
ON THOSE TWO!

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.415
LOOK OUT!

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:23.716
OH, NO!

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.255
DID I MENTION I'M
AFRAID OF SNAKES?

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.757
SIMMER DOWN THERE,
PRIVATE!

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.825
MIGHT BE A HOLOGRAM.

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:34.093
SORRY, FELLAS!

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:36.329
BUT SHIRLEY HAS
A DIFFERENT OPINION.

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.899
THANK YOU, SHIRLEY!

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.735
I LEFT THE BAYOU
TO GET AWAY
FROM THIS!

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.705
WATCH OUT!

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.340
Hassleberry:
UNLESS ANYONE HERE IS
A SNAKE CHARMER,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.609
WE'RE ALL ABOUT
TO BE SNAKE CHOW!

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:55.815
ONCE I DEFEAT YOU,

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:59.352
YOUR DUEL ENERGY
WILL RESURRECT MY SON
AND WE'LL BE REUNITED!

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:02.989
NOW THEN,
LET'S FINISH
WHAT WE STARTED!

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:04.424
[THINKING]
IF ONLY I COULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.359
TO DRAIN THIS SWAMP
OF HIS.

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:10.597
THEN MAYBE I COULD
SLITHER MY WAY OUT
OF THIS MESS.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:11.864
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.299
[THINKING]
THE MORE LIFE POINTS
YOU LOSE,

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.401
THE MORE LIFE
MY SON REGAINS!

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.771
AND THE MORE YOU SUFFER,
THE HAPPIER IT WILL BE.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:26.112
Boy of Light:
SOON YOU'LL HAVE
WHAT YOU DESIRE, VIPER.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:30.283
NOW MAKE JADEN PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO ME.

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:31.551
WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:34.153
HAVE MY SNAKES
CONSTRICTED YOUR MOVE?

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.756
NO WAY!
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.792
SO GET READY,

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:45.031
'CAUSE NOW I'M GONNA
PLAY ELEMENTAL HERO
BUBBLEMAN!

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:48.001
AND SINCE HE'S ALL ALONE,
HIS ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.070
WHICH ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW TWO MORE CARDS!

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.841
AND THE FIRST CARD
I PLAY IS BUBBLE ROD!

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:59.379
THIS GIVES MY ELEMENTAL HERO'S
ATTACK POINTS A BOUNCE!
AN 800-POINT BOUNCE!

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:05.918
WAY TA BUBBLE UP
THOSE ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:10.089
AND NOW,
FOR THE SECOND CARD,
"R"-- RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE!

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:13.660
THANKS TO THIS, FOR EVERY
HERO MONSTER THAT I HAVE
IN PLAY ON THE FIELD,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.963
I GET TO DESTROY ONE
OF YOUR SPELLS OR TRAPS!

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:17.997
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.098
WAY TO GO!

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.901
JADEN CAN DRAIN
THAT VENOM SWAMP
FOR GOOD!

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:23.036
[CHUCKLING]

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.405
SUCH A PREDICTABLE MOVE,
JADEN,

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:26.873
AND IT WON'T WORK.

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:31.277
NOW I PLAY...
SNAKE DEITY'S COMMAND!

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:35.782
WITH THIS TRAP,
I'LL SACRIFICE ONE VENOM
MONSTER TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:39.185
AND THEN YOUR SPELL CARD
IS DESTROYED!

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.089
YOU SNAKE!

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:44.190
THANK YOU!

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.626
NOW, WITH ONE MORE
REPTILE MONSTER IN MY GRAVE,

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:50.663
VENOMINON'S ATTACK POINTS
INCREASE ONCE AGAIN!

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.768
I PLAY A FACEDOWN.

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.337
IT'S YOUR GO.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.938
NOT JUST YET, JADEN.

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:01.607
OR DID YOU FORGOT
ABOUT MY VENOM SWAMP?

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.743
REMEMBER, AT THE END
OF EACH TURN,

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:06.546
IT CAN DRAIN YOUR MONSTER
OF 500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:12.819
AW, MAN!
POOR SARGE!

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.787
MY TURN! I DRAW!

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:18.124
VENOMINON!
ATTACK WITH FANGED VENOM!

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.963
OH, YEAH?!

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.765
TRY THIS ON
FOR SIZE!

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.200
I PLAY A TRAP.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.103
AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE KNOWN AS
A HERO EMERGES!

00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:33.072
NOW YOU'RE FORCED
TO CHOOSE A RANDOM
CARD FROM MY HAND.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.874
AND HERE'S
THE FUN PART--

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.943
IF YOU HAPPEN
TO PICK
A MONSTER CARD,

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.945
I CAN CALL IT
TO THE FIELD!

00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:41.581
IF I MUST MAKE
A CHOICE, THE LEFT!

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:43.716
WELL, YA WIN SOME,
YA LOSE SOME!

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.652
YOU CHOSE A MONSTER.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.755
GO, ELEMENTAL
HERO NEOS!

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:49.922
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.824
SINCE YOU DESTROYED
BUBBLE ROD
LAST ROUND,

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.694
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK!

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:56.896
OH, YEAH!
HE'S ON A ROLL NOW!

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.899
SY, HE'S STILL GOT
THAT FIELD SPELL!
HUH?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:04.203
HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH.
NOW MY VENOM SWAMP
ATTACKS YOUR NEOS.

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.276
Syrus: NEO'S ATTACK
POINTS JUST GOT BIT!

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:14.080
[CHUCKLING]
NOTHING IS IMMUNE
TO MY SWAMP'S POISON.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.849
IT'S OVER.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.151
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.986
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:24.957
I SUMMON NEO-SPACIAN
AQUA DOLPHIN!

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.592
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.195
CHECK OUT
MY NEO-SPACIAN EXTENT!

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:31.297
NOW, BY SENDING
MY AQUA-DOLPHIN
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:35.468
MY EXTENT SPELL CARD
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
A LEVEL-FOUR MONSTER.

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:38.638
AND I'LL PLAY...
NEO-SPACIAN MARINE DOLPHIN!

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:43.576
WAY TO SEND IN
THE MARINES, JADEN!
HOO AH!

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:47.680
I'LL JOIN NEOS
AND MARINE DOLPHIN
WITH CONTACT FUSION...

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.921
TO CREATE THE ONE,
THE ONLY

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:57.590
ELEMENTAL HERO
MARINE NEOS!

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.693
WHAT A MONSTER!
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW HE HELPS OUT!

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.029
LET ME SHOW YA HOW
HE'S GONNA HELP ME OUT.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:06.132
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
LETS ME DESTROY A CARD
IN YOUR HAND.

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:09.869
SPLENDID.

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:13.506
IT APPEARS YOU DESTROYED
MY VENOM SNAKE,

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:17.276
WHICH MEANS VENOMINON
GETS MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:20.947
LOOKS LIKE JADEN HAD
THE WRONG ATTACK
COORDINATES.

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:25.117
DON'T WORRY!
NEOS IS STILL STRONGER THAN
THAT SLIMY SERPENT OF HIS!

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:28.721
YOU KNOW IT!
MARINE NEOS,
ATTACK VENOMINON!

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:39.098
YES! HE DESTROYED IT!

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.201
THE KING HAS LEFT
THE BUILDING!

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.636
[CHUCKLING]

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:45.571
[LAUGHING]

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:46.839
HUH?

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.512
I'M AFRAID MY KING'S
REIGN OF TERROR IS
FAR FROM OVER!

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.579
SAY WHAT?

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.881
HE LIVES!

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:59.218
WATCH CLOSELY
AS MY VENOMINON
RECLAIMS HIS THRONE!

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:02.288
ALL THAT'S NEEDED IS
A SMALL SACRIFICE.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:04.657
I REMOVE
ONE LOYAL SUBJECT
FROM PLAY,

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.693
AND VENOMINON RULES
THE SWAMP ONCE AGAIN!

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.733
HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE REVIVED AS WELL--

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:17.203
FIVE HUNDRED POINTS
FOR EACH REPTILE
IN MY GRAVE,

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.739
WHICH ADDS UP
TO YOUR TOTAL
DESTRUCTION!

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:27.914
JADEN'S GONNA PAY
FOR HOW HE WRONGED ME.

00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:30.583
[THINKING]
WHAT DOES THIS THING HAVE
AGAINST JADEN?

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.920
AND WHAT DOES IT HAVE
TO DO WITH ME AND
THE CARD I'M AFTER?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.489
WELL, I'LL GET
MY ANSWERS SOON ENOUGH.

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:39.091
VIPER THINKS
HE HAS ME CAPTURED,
BUT LITTLE DOES HE KNOW

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:42.328
THAT NOT TOO FAR
FROM HERE, I HAVE BACKUP!

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:45.765
AND THEY'RE JUST WAITING
TO RECEIVE THEIR ORDERS

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:49.769
FROM AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE.

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:51.404
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.373
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO PLEASED
TO HAVE VENOMINON BACK.

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:55.508
THIS STINKS!

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:57.743
THAT KING OF HIS
DON'T KNOW WHEN
TO QUIT!

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.011
NOR DO I!

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.347
ONCE AGAIN YOUR TURN
HAS ENDED, JADEN,

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:03.683
WHICH MEANS
MY SWAMP STRIKES!

00:18:03.683 --> 00:18:05.217
ATTACK HIS NEOS

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.986
AND DRAIN
HIS ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.796
MARINE NEOS!

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:17.997
HE'S BEEN SWAMPED!

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:19.699
I DRAW...

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:22.635
AND PLAY THE CARD
VENOM SHOT!

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:25.104
WITH THIS,
BY DISCARDING ONE SNAKE,

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.173
WHILE VENOMINON IS
ON THE FIELD,

00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:30.610
I CAN STRIKE YOUR NEOS
WITH TWICE THE POISON,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.112
AND THAT'S PRECISELY
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO!

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.313
OH, NO!

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.194
NO, NOT AGAIN!

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.467
OF COURSE, AFTER PLACING
MY VENOM SERPENT
INTO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:58.771
VENOMINON GAINS
AN ADDITIONAL 500
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:58.771 --> 00:18:59.939
NO WAY!

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:02.441
NOW HE'S
STRONGER THAN
JADEN'S MARINE!

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:03.509
Jim:
WATCH OUT, MATES.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.411
HE'S GONNA TAKE
A CRACK AT HIM!

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:07.380
NOW GO, VENOMINON!

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.915
DESTROY MARINE NEOS
WITH FANGED VENOM!

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.289
HANG IN THERE, SARGE!

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:19.358
BITE YOUR TONGUE,
OR THEY'LL DO IT FOR YOU!

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.164
JADEN!

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.699
COME ON!

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.067
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP,
MATE!

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:29.568
IT AIN'T OVER YET!

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:32.872
NOT YET, BUT SOON ENOUGH,
YOU'RE THROUGH.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:34.473
MY MISSION'S COMPLETE.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:38.077
YOU WERE QUITE
THE CHALLENGE.
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:41.547
AS A CONSOLATION,
THERE'S SOMEONE WHO'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU AFTER THIS DUEL,

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.717
SOMEONE WHO'S HAD
THEIR EYE ON YOU
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:47.420
HA HA HA HA!

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.489
[THINKING]
WHO COULD HE BE
TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.159
Boy of Light:
OH, DON'T WORRY, JADEN.

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.895
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH,

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:59.699
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO PAY
FOR DISCARDING ME THE WAY
YOU DID.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.468
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO PAY DEARLY.

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:05.905
YOUR SUFFERING HAS
ONLY JUST BEGUN.

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:07.406
