00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.970
LAST TIME ON...

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.206
YOUR DAYS OF SENDING PEOPLE
TO THE STARS ARE OVER, YUBEL.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.343
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
SO LEAVE JESSE OUT OF THIS

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.944
AND DUEL ME
IN YOUR TRUE FORM.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.547
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
WITH THIS BODY,

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.116
I GET TO FORCE YOU
TO FIGHT YOUR FRIEND.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.918
RISE, MY MIGHTY BEAST.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.921
RAINBOW DARK DRAGON!

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:22.923
OK, THERE IT IS.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.292
I JUST HOPE
MY HUNCH IS CORRECT.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.427
JESSE!

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.365
LOOK UP THERE, GUYS.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.033
THE DARKNESS
IS LEAVING!

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.402
[GROANING]

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.140
JESSE!

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.442
HA HA HA HA.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.846
WHAT... HAPPENED?

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.248
HA HA HA HA.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.920
HE RESCUED YOU. OF COURSE,
I ALWAYS KNEW HE WOULD.

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.222
YOU SET THIS ALL UP.
BUT WHY?

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:59.326
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH. HA HA HA.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:01.929
JESSE!

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.968
AND NOW, MY DEAR JADEN,

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.371
A NEW DUEL WILL BEGIN
IN OBLIVION.

JESSE, ARE YOU OK?

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.507
COULDN'T BE BETTER. AH...

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.144
OK, I PROBABLY COULD BE
BETTER, BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.213
I'LL BE FINE.
IT TAKES MORE

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.382
THAN A HOSTILE
SPIRIT TAKEOVER

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.883
TO KEEP
THIS BOY DOWN.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:31.084
THANKS FOR SAVING
MY HIDE, JADEN.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:32.886
WELL, IF IT
WEREN'T FOR ME,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.954
YOUR HIDE WOULDN'T
HAVE NEEDED SAVING.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:35.956
YOU DID IT!

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:37.057
CAN WE
GO HOME NOW?

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:38.592
NOT YET, CROWLER.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.293
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:42.562
YOU'RE GOING TO DUEL
AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.197
HMM.

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.867
COME, JESSE. YOU MIGHT
WANT TO GET BACK.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.935
ALL RIGHT, YUBEL,
WHAT'S THIS

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.303
DUELING IN OBLIVION ABOUT?

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.806
IF IT'S A FIGHT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR, I'M UP FOR IT.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.908
LOOK AT YOU.
IS THAT JADEN TALKING,

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.044
OR IS THAT
THE SUPREME KING?

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.080
WELL, EITHER WAY, SINCE
YOU'RE UP FOR A CHALLENGE,

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:04.217
LET'S HAVE THIS DUEL.
FOLLOW ME IF YOU DARE.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.219
[GASP]

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.656
HMM.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:10.957
JADEN, WAIT.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:12.259
HUH?

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.460
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING?

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.929
COME ON, PAL.
YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.931
WELL, THEN HERE.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.768
I'M GUESSING YOU WON'T
LET ME COME WITH YOU.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:23.603
SO TAKE MY DECK,

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:24.938
AND GIVE THAT YUBEL
A LITTLE PIECE OF MY MIND.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.940
CAN YOU DO THAT?

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.210
HMM. THANKS, JESSE.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.879
NOW GET SOME REST
AND REGAIN YOUR STRENGTH.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.581
RIGHT.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.550
YOU SURE YOU SHOULD GO?
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.752
IT'S PROBABLY
SOME KIND OF TRAP.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.154
THERE COULD BE A HUNDRED
FIENDS WAITING FOR YOU

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.589
OR SOME SCARY MONSTER.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.593
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.564
GOING UP.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.211
AH! WHERE'D SHE GO?

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.113
AAH!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.914
HUH?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.716
IT'S YOUR MOVE, JADEN.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.818
OH, MAN.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.820
THAT DUEL.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.555
THAT'S WHEN I PLAYED
MY YUBEL CARD,

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.124
AND MY FRIEND
COLLAPSED.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:18.925
UH!

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.026
HUH?

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.263
Yubel: I DID IT
ALL FOR YOU, JADEN.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.265
HUH?

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.833
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW CLOSE WE WERE,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.902
HOW I ALWAYS STOOD BY
AND PROTECTED YOU,

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.938
HOW I MADE SURE NO ONE WOULD
BREAK OUR BOND AS FRIENDS?

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.840
I REMEMBER.
NO ONE WOULD DUEL ME.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.042
AND ALL MY FRIENDS
STOPPED COMING AROUND

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.611
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
I WAS CURSED.

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.079
I WAS SO LONELY.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.281
I'D SIT ALL BY MYSELF
IN THE SCHOOL LUNCHROOM.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:42.983
BUT YOU HAD ME, JADEN,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.051
AND I WOULD NEVER
HAVE ABANDONED YOU

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.887
THE WAY THOSE KIDS
ABANDONED YOU.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:48.889
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.158
BUT DESPITE
MY LOYALTY TO YOU,

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.527
YOU DECIDED
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS,

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:56.163
AND YOU CAST ME ASIDE
AND SENT ME AWAY,

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.866
SO VERY FAR AWAY.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:01.968
IS THAT HOW YOU
REPAY ME,

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.038
BY LOCKING ME IN A ROCKET
AND SHOOTING ME INTO SPACE?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.974
IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE
HEARTLESS THAN THAT.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.510
THAT'S NOT IT.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.445
SO WE COULD STILL
BE FRIENDS.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.314
I HOPED THE WAVES
OF COSMIC MATTER

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.415
IN SPACE COULD FIX YOU.

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.083
WELL, THEY DID,
SO TO SPEAK.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.518
THERE ARE MANY TYPES
OF ENERGY WAVES

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.520
COURSING THROUGH
THE GALAXY, JADEN.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.123
THOSE PRECIOUS NEO-SPACIAN
CARDS YOU DREW

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.658
ABSORBED ONE KIND
OF ENERGY.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.060
THAT'S WHAT GAVE THEM
THEIR STRENGTH

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.695
AND ENHANCED
THEIR SPIRITS.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.363
AS FOR ME,
LET'S JUST SAY

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.933
THAT I ABSORBED
A DARKER FORM OF ENERGY.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.269
THE MORE MY POWER INCREASED,
THE MORE PAIN I FELT.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.806
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING...
THE COSMIC WAVES HURT YOU,

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.309
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.745
I MEAN WHY DIDN'T YOU USE
YOUR POWERS TO BREAK AWAY?

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.081
I TRIED, JADEN.
WITH ALL MY MIGHT,

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:49.816
I TRIED REACHING
OUT TO YOU,

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:51.651
BUT THEN ONE DAY
IT WAS LIKE

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:53.320
THERE WAS A WALL
BETWEEN US,

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.088
AND THEN
YOU WERE GONE.

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:56.923
HUH! WAIT A MINUTE.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.360
YOU KNOW,
I REMEMBER.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.030
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO HAVE
THESE NIGHTMARES.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.032
[GASPS]

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.701
AAH!

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.069
THEY WERE
SO TERRIBLE

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.271
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GET BACK TO SLEEP.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.607
IT WAS YOU.
YOU WERE CONTACTING ME

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.075
BY ENTERING MY DREAMS.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.077
AND THOSE DREAMS
WERE SO INTENSE

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.880
THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH
ALL SORTS OF TREATMENTS

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.047
TO STOP THEM
FROM HAPPENING.

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:22.816
EVENTUALLY,
THE NIGHTMARES STOPPED.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.151
THAT MUST BE THE WALL
YOU FELT BETWEEN US.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.954
YES, YOU FORGOT
ABOUT ME,

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:29.990
BUT I WAS STILL
OUT THERE.

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:32.559
SOON I BROKE AWAY
FROM THE ENERGY WAVES.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.162
SOON ALL WAS
PAIN AND FIRE.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.465
BUT WITH ALL THAT
PAIN AND ANGER,

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.701
I COULD FEEL MYSELF
BECOMING WHOLE.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.871
THAT WAS
WHEN I UNDERSTOOD.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.007
YOU WANTED ME
TO GROW STRONG.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.276
YOU WANTED ME
TO BECOME WHOLE.

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:51.544
YOU KNEW THAT
I HAD TO EXPERIENCE

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:53.313
ALL THAT HURT
AND SHAME AND TERROR

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.982
IN ORDER TO BECOME
AS POWERFUL AS I NOW AM.

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.817
YOU WANTED OUR BOND
TO BE STRONGER

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.419
THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.924
YOU KNEW THE HURT
WOULD MAKE ME POWERFUL.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.661
ONCE I FIGURED THAT OUT,
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:10.230
I HAD TO REPAY YOU
THE ONLY WAY I COULD.

00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:12.465
I HAD TO HELP YOU
GROW STRONGER,

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.734
THE SAME WAY YOU
HELPED ME GROW STRONGER.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.003
I KNEW THAT IF I
COULD DO THAT,

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.306
WE WOULD BE
AS WE WERE, TOGETHER,

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:21.308
NO ONE COMING
BETWEEN US.

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:23.310
WE WOULD BE
BEST FRIENDS AGAIN.

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:25.512
SO TO BRING
THAT PAIN UPON YOU,

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.514
I MADE YOUR
FRIENDS SUFFER.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.482
I CRASHED DIMENSIONS
TOGETHER.

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.953
I FILLED YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
WITH FEAR AND CONFUSION.

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.355
AND NOW IT SEEMS
MY GIFT HAS WORKED.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:36.890
YOU BECAME
THE SUPREME KING,

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.659
MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU
EVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.595
AND YOU'RE HERE,
YOU'RE MINE,

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:48.535
AND WE'RE TOGETHER
FOREVER! HA HA HA!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.174
WHAT'S JADEN
DOING UP THERE?

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:58.745
HEY, PROFESSOR CROWLER.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:00.347
HUH?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.815
DO YOU MIND
HANGING ONTO THIS?

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.384
NO PROBLEM.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:06.653
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SYRUS, WAIT!

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.989
YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING
JADEN UP THERE...

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.991
ARE YOU?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.193
I CAN'T WAIT
DOWN HERE, PROFESSOR.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:15.462
MY BROTHER ASKED
FOR ME AND JADEN

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.464
TO KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.266
BUT DIDN'T HE ALSO SAY
STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.235
NO! DON'T!

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.304
SYRUS! OJAMA!
COME ON, JESSE.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:26.139
WE CAN'T LET
THEM DO THIS.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:27.540
SIMMER DOWN, TEACH.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:29.709
YOU JUST LET THEM
DO THEIR THING,

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:30.910
AND YOU DO YOURS.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.512
BUT, JESSE...

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.514
LISTEN HERE. EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO PLAY OUT

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.116
AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO
PLAY OUT.

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:37.417
SO RELAX, WILL YOU?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.185
IS THIS, LIKE,
A DESTINY THING?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.520
UH-HUH.

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:42.222
OH, IN THAT CASE,

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.290
LET'S WATCH THINGS
PLAY OUT FROM HERE,

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.926
BECAUSE THAT PORTAL UP THERE
IS LOOKING PRETTY SCARY.

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:53.700
I GUESS THERE'S
NO TURNING BACK NOW.

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:55.168
AND THAT'S TOO BAD,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.370
BECAUSE SOMETHING
WEIRD IS COMING OUR WAY!

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:58.638
LOOK OUT!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.373
UH!

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.342
AH!

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.046
IS THAT CHAZZ
OVER THERE?

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.247
IT IS!

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.816
HEY, SYRUS, IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, HELP ME.

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:11.818
UH! HELP YOU HOW?

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:13.753
HOLD ME, WILL YOU?!

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.723
IT'S A GHOST!
IT'S A GHOST!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:30.136
SHALL WE SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL, JADEN?

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.106
WELL, ARE YOU READY
TO FACE ME HEAD-ON?

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.775
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
USING JESSE AS COVER,

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.011
I'M COMING AT YOU WITH
EVERYTHING I GOT!

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:40.480
I WOULDN'T WANT IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.582
NOW GIVE ME
YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.019
OH, I WILL, YUBEL.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.388
LET'S DO THIS!

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.492
AND TO START
THINGS OFF...

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:57.163
I'LL FIRST SUMMON OUT
SAMSARA LOTUS.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.399
NEXT, I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:04.304
AND THEN I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CHRONICLE SPELL CARD.

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.440
AND THIS CARD WILL BRING US
EVEN CLOSER, JADEN.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.976
IT'S A SCROLL
THAT NOTES THE FUTURE.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.645
WHEN IT'S PLAYED,
I AM TO SELECT 5 CARDS

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:14.747
IN MY DECK
AND REMOVE THEM.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:16.749
HUH?

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.018
YOU SEEM TO BE
A BIT CONFUSED.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.020
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:24.157
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
SOON ENOUGH.

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.060
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:29.829
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
THIS IS IT.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.398
I'M GOING TO NEED
ALL OF YOU TO PITCH IN

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.467
IF WE'RE GOING TO
WIN THIS DUEL

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:35.886
AND DEFEAT YUBEL.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:41.608
IT'S GOING TO BE GAME ON
WITH THIS MOVE, YUBEL!

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:44.110
I PLAY POLYMERIZATION

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.446
AND FUSE MY AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.416
TO FORM ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.153
AND WITH THAT, MY SPELL
CHRONICLE ACTIVATES.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.588
YOU SEE, EACH TIME
MY OPPONENT USES A SPELL,

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.125
MY CHRONICLE SCROLL
GAINS A UNIT OF SPELL POWER.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:02.195
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
BUT THEN NEITHER IS THIS!

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:08.301
FLAME WINGMAN, ATTACK SAMSARA
LOTUS WITH INFERNAL RAGE!

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:14.641
THAT ATTACK NOW TRIGGERS
MY SPELL SINISTER SEEDS.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.343
WITH MY LOTUS DESTROYED,

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.246
THE EFFECT OF MY SPELL CARD
PLANTS SINISTER SEEDS,

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.448
WHICH THRIVE OFF
DAMAGE I TAKE.

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:24.017
THE MORE DAMAGE
YOU INFLICT,

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:25.952
THE STRONGER
THE PLANTS THAT SPRANG

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.520
FROM MY SINISTER SEEDS
WILL GROW.

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:30.323
WITH YOUR ATTACK, YOU GAVE
MY SEEDS 2,000 POINTS.

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:32.892
AND FOR EVERY THOUSAND
POINTS OF DAMAGE,

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.661
ONE FLOWER TOKEN GROWS.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:38.665
AS FOR ME, I ONLY TAKE DAMAGE
FROM WHATEVER POINTS ARE LEFT.

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.267
FINE, THEN. I'LL JUST
PLAY A CARD FACEDOWN

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.269
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.573
MY MOVE, THEN.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.342
NOW BY SACRIFICING
MY 2 FLOWER TOKENS,

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:52.145
I CAN SUMMON REGENERATING
ROSE IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:54.914
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
BUT IT'S GOT THORNS.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.584
BY "THORNS,"
DO YOU MEAN ZERO
ATTACK POINTS?

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.185
THAT'S VERY CUTE,
JADEN.

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:01.421
ACTUALLY, THIS ROSE'S
STRENGTH BECOMES EQUAL

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.657
TO THE MONSTER
THAT IT ATTACKS.

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.261
SO YOU WANT THEM
TO DESTROY EACH OTHER.

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.263
HA HA HA.
YOU DON'T HAVE

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:12.699
MUCH OF A GREEN THUMB,
DO YOU, JADEN?

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.634
WHEN REGENERATING ROSE
IS DESTROYED,

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.203
IT PLANTS 2 ROSE TOKENS
ON THE FIELD.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.839
SO THIS ATTACK WILL
TAKE OUT FLAME WINGMAN

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.941
AND LEAVE YUBEL
WITH 2 NEW ROSE TOKENS.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.610
I CAN'T LET THEM
TAKE ROOT.

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.379
BEFORE YOU ATTACK,
I'M ACTIVATING...

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.381
THE DE-FUSION
SPELL CARD!

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.583
WITH THAT, I DE-FUSE
FLAME WINGMAN

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.852
AND RESUMMON AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:36.022
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:38.024
LUCKY FOR YOU, JADEN,

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.859
BECAUSE IF THIS
REGENERATING ROSE

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:41.828
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:43.663
IT DOESN'T GAIN
ANY ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.665
YOUR SPELL MAY HAVE
SAVED YOU FOR NOW,

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.368
BUT REMEMBER,
BECAUSE YOU ACTIVATED

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.371
YOUR DE-FUSION SPELL'S
ABILITY, THE SPELL CHRONICLE

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:53.506
GAINS ANOTHER UNIT
OF POWER.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.875
SO ALLOW ME
TO THANK YOU, JADEN,

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.678
FOR HELPING MY SPELL
CHRONICLE TELL ITS STORY.

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.514
BECAUSE OF YOU, THE FIRST
CHAPTER HAS BEEN WRITTEN.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:02.515
FIRST WHAT?

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.484
YOU SEE, THE SPELL
CHRONICLE SCROLL

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:05.852
TELLS THE STORY
OF A DUEL.

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:07.654
FOR EVERY 2
SPELL CARDS ACTIVATED,

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.289
ANOTHER CHAPTER UNFOLDS.

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:11.090
FOR EVERY CHAPTER,
YOU GET TO CHOOSE

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:12.725
ONE CARD THAT I
REMOVE FROM PLAY

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.361
AND ADD THE SELECTED CARD
BACK TO MY HAND.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.430
AND JADEN, YOU NOW HAVE
THE CHANCE TO PUT

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:20.266
THE CARD I TOOK FROM YOU
IN OUR LAST DUEL INTO PLAY.

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:22.235
NO WAY!

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:25.571
IT'S TRUE, JADEN.
I HAVE SUPERPOLYMERIZATION,

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.174
THE SUPREME KING'S
VERY OWN CALLING CARD.

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:30.777
WITH IT, I CAN UNITE
THE 12 DIMENSIONS.

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:34.547
SO COME ON, ACCEPT MY GIFT
OF HARDSHIP, PAIN, AND FEAR.

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.582
CHOOSE
SUPERPOLYMERIZATION.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.251
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:40.086
SUPERPOLYMERIZATION.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.822
WHAT IS YUBEL PLANNING
ON DOING WITH THAT CARD?

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.892
I'M PRETTY SURE I DON'T
WANT TO FIND OUT.

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:48.728
I SELECT ZERO SPRITE!

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:50.730
OH, WELL.

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:53.499
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, JADEN.
YOU'RE SO STUBBORN.

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:56.369
NO MATTER.
I CAN BE VERY PATIENT.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.172
I HAVE WAITED YEARS.
WHAT'S A FEW MORE ROUNDS?

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.074
I END MY TURN.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:02.975
THEN IN THAT CASE...

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:04.977
I SUMMON
TO THE FIELD

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.680
ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN!

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:10.483
AND NEXT UP,
I ACTIVATE

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.553
THE EQUIP SPELL CARD...
SPARK BLASTER!

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:16.089
SO MY SPELL CHRONICLE
GAINS MORE POWER.

00:14:16.923 --> 00:14:18.524
MAYBE SO, BUT WITH
A BLAST FROM SPARKS,

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.727
THAT REGENERATING
ROSE OF YOURS

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.196
IS ZAPPED INTO
DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.599
THAT'S A SHAME.

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.668
NOW MY ROSE'S SPECIAL
ABILITY CAN'T BE ACTIVATED.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.170
IT ONLY WORKS
WHEN IT'S IN ATTACK MODE.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.106
IN THAT CASE,
IT'S HISTORY.

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.274
SPARKMAN, LET'S
WHACK THAT WEED

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:38.077
WITH STATIC
SHOCKWAVE!

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.883
MY ROSE MAY HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED,

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:45.518
BUT DON'T FORGET,
IT LEAVES

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.754
2 ROSE TOKENS
IN ITS PLACE.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:49.756
IT'S YOUR MOVE, YUBEL.

00:14:50.323 --> 00:14:51.891
VERY WELL.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.660
THEN BY LAYING DOWN
THIS FACEDOWN, IT'S TIME.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.662
TIME FOR WHAT?

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.164
TIME TO SACRIFICE
THE 2 ROSE TOKENS

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.900
ON MY FIELD
TO SUMMON YUBEL.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:05.571
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:09.675
DID YOU JUST
SUMMON YOURSELF?

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.980
YES, JADEN. AND NOW
PREPARE TO FEEL MY FURY!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:19.919
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
JADEN,

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.521
THAT ANY DAMAGE
MY YUBEL RECEIVES

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.923
GETS DEALT
STRAIGHT TO YOU.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.726
NOW SPARKMAN, LET'S
SHOW HIM WHAT I MEAN.

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:29.128
DON'T DO IT!

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.967
HA HA HA.
THE PAIN I FEEL,

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.438
IT BECOMES
YOUR PAIN AS WELL.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.813
WE ARE FINALLY ONE!
MY PAIN IS YOURS.

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:49.849
MY SWEET SUFFERING,
ALL MY SORROW...

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.318
I SHARE IT ALL
WITH YOU, JADEN.

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.687
AAH! AH...

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.857
OH, MAN. SO EVEN IF I
ATTACK THAT YUBEL CARD,

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.493
IT WON'T TAKE
ANY DAMAGE. ONLY I DO.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:03.863
HA HA HA. AND DURING
THE END PHASE OF MY TURN,

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:07.066
THE LOTUS IN MY GRAVEYARD
BLOOMS TO MY FIELD,

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:10.069
BUT IF I DON'T SACRIFICE
ANOTHER MONSTER ON MY FIELD

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.637
DURING THE END PHASE,

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.773
THEN MY LOVELY DOPPELGANGER
WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.010
SORRY, SAMSARA LOTUS.
I NEED TO DO SOME GARDENING.

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:21.914
WITH THAT, I END MY TURN.

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:24.150
HMM... I'VE GOT TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:25.585
TO DESTROY
THAT YUBEL CARD

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:29.322
BEFORE I DO ANY MORE
DAMAGE TO MYSELF.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.825
IT'S MY GO! HUH!

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:34.827
HUH.

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.829
I SWITCH SPARKMAN
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.031
THEN I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.733
AND THAT'S IT
FOR THIS TURN.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.301
THAT'S IT?
COME NOW, JADEN.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.003
DON'T GET
BORING ON ME.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.005
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ATTACK ME JUST NOW?

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.508
LISTEN, YUBEL, I KNOW
I MADE YOU SAD AND LONELY,

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.277
AND I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO
GO THROUGH IT ALONE.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.280
IF I COULD, I'D GO BACK
AND UNDO EVERYTHING I DID.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.750
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME, JADEN.
YES, YOU CAUSED ME PAIN,

00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.919
BUT THAT PAIN MADE ME STRONG.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.787
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL SORRY.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.389
I WANT YOU
TO FEEL PAIN!

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.424
SO YUBEL IS
CLEARLY LOOKING

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:06.926
TO GET EVEN
WITH ME

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.194
NO MATTER WHO
SHE HAS TO HURT,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.396
BUT SHE'S THE WAY
SHE IS BECAUSE OF ME.

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.298
SHOULDN'T I WANT
TO HELP HER?

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.133
WAIT A SEC.
THINK ABOUT

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.068
ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
YUBEL HAS DONE.

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:18.471
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HER,
YOU'D BE CHILLING OUT

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.472
BACK AT THE SLIFER DORM.

00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:21.474
YOU SHOULDN'T WANT
TO HELP HER.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.542
YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY.

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.845
HA HA HA.
GUESS IT'S MY TURN.

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:29.315
AND SINCE YOU WON'T
ATTACK, I THINK I WILL.

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:32.385
I PLAY THE TRAP
HERO BARRIER!

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.054
NOW, WITH THE ELEMENTAL
HEROES ON MY FIELD,

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.456
THE POWER OF THIS TRAP
CARD NEGATES ANY ATTACKS

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.192
FOR THE DURATION
OF THIS TURN.

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:42.762
REMEMBER ZERO SPRITE?
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.665
THIS IS THE CARD
THAT YOU SELECTED.

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:48.968
AND ONCE ZERO SPRITE
ACTIVATES,

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:50.970
IT BECOMES
AN EQUIP CARD

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:53.706
AND LOWERS ITS RECIPIENT'S
ATTACK POINTS TO ZERO.

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:55.708
THEN WHAT?

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:56.809
AND THEN THIS...

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.477
THE EQUIPPED MONSTER
CAN ATTACK TWICE.

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.746
THE FIRST TIME, THE TIME
THAT YOU'RE NEGATING,

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.014
IT HAS NO ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:03.950
MAN, EVERY TIME
I MAKE A MOVE,

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.018
SHE'S ONE STEP
AHEAD OF ME.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.454
THE FIRST STRIKE
IS RENDERED USELESS,

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:10.756
BUT THE SECOND STRIKE
IS A DIFFERENT MATTER.

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:12.558
SPARKMAN'S ORIGINAL
DEFENSE POINTS

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.360
ARE DEALT TO YOU
DIRECTLY!

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:16.495
AAH!

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:20.967
HA HA HA HA.

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:23.803
IF I DON'T DESTROY THAT
CARD SOON, I'M DONE FOR.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.911
I SAW THEM, JADEN.

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:32.678
SAW WHO?

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:34.013
CHAZZ AND
THE OJAMAS.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.582
THEY WERE THERE IN THESE
WEIRD COSMIC BALLOONS.

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:38.718
WE TALKED TO THEM.

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:41.954
AAH! SYRUS, SOMETHING
ELSE IS FORMING!

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.290

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.293
GET US OUT
OF HERE!

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:48.527
AND BE QUICK,
WOULD YOU?

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:50.763
IT'S MY BROTHERS!

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:52.765
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE OK?

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE FOUND YOU!

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:56.035
[MUTTERING]

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.604
NO, WE'RE NOT OK!
WE'RE TRAPPED, YOU BALL OF SNOT!

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.973
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
HE INSULTED ME!

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.142
THAT MEANS
IT REALLY IS CHAZZ.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:04.710
HE'S OK, SYRUS.

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:06.112
[SIGHS]

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:08.180
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?
I JUST SAID I'M NOT OK.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.816
WE'RE ALL TRAPPED
IN SOME CRAZY DIMENSION.

00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:13.653
YOU'VE GOT TO SAVE US, MAN.
BUST US OUT OF HERE.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.655
BUT HOW, CHAZZ?

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.956
YEAH, HOW?
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:18.858
SOMEWHERE
REALLY DARK.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.459
SOMEWHERE
REALLY BRIGHT.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:21.927
WELL, UH...

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:23.129
IT'S FREEZING COLD.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.330
I'M BURNING UP.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.931
Chazz: KNOCK IT OFF!

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:27.099
YA!
YA!

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:29.201
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE WE ARE.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:30.870
EVERYTHING
IS UPSIDE-DOWN.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.439
THEN THE NEXT SECOND,
IT'S ALL RIGHT-SIDE-UP.

00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:34.940
AND IT'S ALL
YUBEL'S DESIGN.

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.110
IF JADEN TAKES HER OUT,
WE'LL ALL BE FREE.

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.448
YOU CAN SAVE EVERYONE, JADEN.
JUST WIN THIS BATTLE.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:44.617
SEBASTIAN WAS RIGHT
ALL ALONG.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.286
MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.588
HE SAID YOU HAD TO
CONTROL THE SUPREME KING.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.991
YOU CAN'T BE AFRAID
OF THAT POWER.

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:53.392
OH.

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:54.994
LISTEN, YOU WON'T
LIKE IT,

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.529
BUT YOU AND
THE SUPREME KING,

00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:58.030
YOU'RE 2 SIDES
OF THE SAME COIN.

00:19:58.631 --> 00:19:59.632
YOU'RE
THE SAME PERSON.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.967
THE SUPREME KING
IS SOMEWHERE
INSIDE OF YOU.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:03.436
NO WAY.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.071
YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT
EVERYTHING YOU DID?

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:07.306
WELL, THEN THIS
IS YOUR CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.508
YOUR CHANCE TO PUT RIGHT
WHAT YOU MADE WRONG.

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:12.311
SURE, THE SUPREME KING
PART OF YOU IS STRONG
AND POWERFUL,

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:13.879
BUT IF YOU LEARN
TO CONTROL IT,

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.247
THAT POWER IS YOURS.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.917
WOW! OH...

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:20.052
ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE A MOVE?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.587
HUH?

JADEN?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.591
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GIVE UP, ARE YOU?

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:26.926
AFTER ALL
I'VE DONE FOR YOU?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.661
I NEED YOU TO STEP UP.

DON'T WORRY. I'M GOING
TO STEP UP, YUBEL.

SCARED OF MY ANGER.
