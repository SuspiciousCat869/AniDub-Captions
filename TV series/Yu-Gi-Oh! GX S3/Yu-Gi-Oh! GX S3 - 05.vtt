"LAST TIME ON YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:04.417
PROFESSOR VIPER HAS
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:07.140
FEAST YOUR EYES
ON MY NEWEST
INVENTION--

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:09.232
THE BIOBAND.

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:12.221
AND STARTING NOW, YOU'RE
ALL REQUIRED TO WEAR ONE.

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.380
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,
YOU'LL TAKE PART

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.999
IN A SERIES OF
SURVIVAL DUELS.

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.320
NOW, I TRUST YOU
REMEMBER OUR PLAN.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.279
DUEL AGAINST
JADEN, RIGHT?

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.836
I WANT HIM
SO FRIGHTENED
FOR HIS LIFE

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:27.895
THAT HE UNLEASHES
EVERYTHING HE'S GOT!

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:30.784
YOUR MISSION IS
TO PUSH JADEN BEYOND
HIS THRESHOLD

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.005
AND DRAIN EVERY
OUNCE OF HIS POWER.

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:40.282
SY!

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.769
AND THE FUN CONTINUES.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.983
IF YOU LOSE,
HE TAKES THE FALL.

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:54.960
THERE'S ONLY ONE
PERSON THAT'S GOING
DOWN, AND THAT'S YOU!

JADEN, HELP!
SY!

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:10.669
LET HIM DOWN,
BRODIE!

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.256
"LET HIM DOWN," HUH?
CARE TO RECONSIDER?

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:16.879
IT'S ALL GOOD, SOLDIER.
JUST CHILL,

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.570
'CAUSE THIS DUEL'S
AS GOOD AS WON!

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:23.654
CHECK THIS OUT!
IT'S MY FLARE SCARAB!

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:28.602
DID I MENTION HE'S GOT
A SWEET EFFECT?

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:31.225
FOR EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP ON YOUR FIELD,

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.978
FLARE SCARAB GETS
400 EXTRA POINTS!

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:40.623
Axel, thinking:
THESE ARE THE SAME MONSTERS
HE USED AGAINST JESSE.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.450
I WASN'T IMPRESSED
THEN EITHER.

00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:44.542
THEIR EFFECTS ARE LAME,
AND THEIR ATTACK POINTS

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:46.102
ARE EVEN
LAMER.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.991
WHAT GOOD IS A FIELD
FULL OF WEAK MONSTERS?

00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:52.777
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S DUMB ENOUGH
TO ATTACK ME WITH THOSE!

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:54.504
I ATTACK!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.091
AVIAN, TAKE HIM OUT!

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.740
I DON'T THINK SO,
'CAUSE I PLAY FIREWALL!

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:05.696
FIRST I TAKE VOLCANIC SHELL

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:08.917
AND REMOVE IT FROM PLAY.

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:15.492
THEN MY TRAP CANCELS
YOUR ATTACK!

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.208
OH, YEAH? BIG DEAL.
I STILL HAVE FLARE SCARAB!

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:25.920
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
I STILL HAVE ANOTHER
VOLCANIC SHELL LEFT!

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.868
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
ONE-UP ME, DON'T YOU?

00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:32.396
SHOW-OFF.

00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:35.882
Jesse, thinking:
AXEL'S UP TO SOMETHING.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.141
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO,

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:40.066
'CAUSE I WAS HOPIN'
FOR A CHALLENGE.

00:03:41.063 --> 00:03:42.325
OH, PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:44.782
THAT TOUGH GUY
ATTITUDE IS
JUST AN ACT.

00:03:45.778 --> 00:03:49.298
I CAN TELL
YOU'RE HAVING FUN,
AND SO AM I, BRO!

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.616
SORRY TO BUTT IN,
BUT WHILE YOU TWO GUYS
ARE BUSY WHOOPING IT UP,

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:56.903
JUST REMEMBER SOMEONE'S LIFE
IS HANGING BY A THREAD!

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.158
Axel, thinking:
THE PROFESSOR'S
GONNA BE THRILLED.

00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:01.752
THANKS TO MY STRATEGY,

00:04:02.748 --> 00:04:04.641
JADEN'S PLAYING
RIGHT INTO VIPER'S HANDS.

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:07.298
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
HE KEEPS ATTACKING,

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:10.319
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR
ME TO TURN UP THE HEAT.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.371
ALL RIGHT.
STAND BACK!

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.128
I PAY 500 LIFE POINTS.
SO MY FIREWALL

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:18.821
STAYS ON THE FIELD!

00:04:19.817 --> 00:04:21.909
AND NEXT, I PLAY THIS--
MY FIRE SOUL!

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:23.536
AND AS SOON
AS IT ACTIVATES,

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.559
MY OPPONENT
IS ALLOWED TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM HIS DECK.

00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:27.953
THANKS A LOT, MAN!

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.548
THAT'S MY KIND OF SPELL!

00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:31.141
IT GETS BETTER.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:35.061
ONCE I FIND A PYRO-TYPE
MONSTER IN MY DECK,
THE REAL FUN STARTS,

00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.015
'CAUSE IF I
REMOVE IT FROM PLAY,
HALF ITS ATTACK POINTS

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:39.411
COME OUT OF YOUR SCORE!

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:40.872
SAY WHAT?

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:43.429
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH ME,
YOU PLAY WITH FIRE...

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:46.119
LITERALLY!

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:50.735
AH, MAN.
AT THIS RATE,

00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:54.188
I'M GONNA BE GOING
DOWN IN FLAMES.

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:01.063
Axel, thinking:
JADEN'S CARDS DON'T HOLD
A CANDLE TO MY FLAME DECK.

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.317
THAT BOY'S GONNA
CRASH AND BURN. WAIT!

00:05:05.314 --> 00:05:08.169
I CAN'T BEAT HIM YET!
VIPER WANTS ME
TO DRAG THIS OUT.

00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:11.125
SO, UH, ARE YOU GONNA
STARE AT ME ALL DAY?

00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:14.578
COME ON. LET'S SEE
WHAT ELSE YA GOT.

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:18.328
Thinking: WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THIS KID?!

00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:21.217
HE GETS HIS BUTT WHIPPED,
THEN HE SMILES
AND ASKS FOR MORE?

00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:24.139
DEEP DOWN, HE'S
GOT TO BE SWEATIN' THIS.

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:27.891
ALL HE HAS GOIN'
FOR HIM ARE A COUPLE
OF WEAK MONSTERS.

00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:30.648
HOLD UP.

00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:33.702
I BET HE'S GONNA
SACRIFICE THEM
TO BRING OUT NEOS,

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:35.861
JUST LIKE HE DID
AGAINST JESSE.

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:40.477
I GOTTA PROTECT MYSELF
BY PLAYIN' BURIAL FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:44.097
BUT IF HE TRIES
TO DESTROY MY FIREWALL,

00:05:45.093 --> 00:05:45.957
I NEED SOME BACKUP
SUPPORT.

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:48.946
THAT'S WHERE
MY FIRE TRAP COMES IN.

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:53.727
THIS CANCELS OUT ANY
CARD THAT TRIES TO DISARM
ONE OF MY TRAP CARDS.

00:05:56.318 --> 00:05:57.613
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

00:05:58.609 --> 00:05:59.539
Axel: THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:00.966
Axel, thinking:
ATTACK ALL YOU WANT.

00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:02.892
YOU'LL NEVER GET
THROUGH TO MY TROOPS.

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.482
AND JUST LIKE
PROFESSOR VIPER ORDERED,

00:06:06.478 --> 00:06:08.803
I'M GONNA WEAR YOU
DOWN, JADEN.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.788
AXEL LOOKS DISTRACTED,
SO NOW'S OUR CHANCE.

00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:14.183
FORWARD MARCH.

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:18.001
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU STOPPED
STARING INTO SPACE!

00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:21.556
I PLAY THIS--
THE SPELL CARD
FAKE HERO!

00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:23.581
NOW I CAN SUMMON
A NEW MONSTER,

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:26.437
AS LONG AS IT'S
GOT "ELEMENTAL HERO"
IN ITS NAME,

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.492
LIKE ELEMENTAL
HERO NEOS!

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:36.964
Hassleberry: SHAZAM!
JADEN JUST BROUGHT
OUT THE BIG GUNS!

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.454
HEY, SARGE! WHAT ARE
YOU WAITIN' FOR?

00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:41.812
OPEN UP A CAN OF NEOS
ON THIS GUY!

00:06:42.808 --> 00:06:44.967
UM, YOU DO REALIZE THAT HE
CAN'T ATTACK, DON'T YOU?

00:06:45.963 --> 00:06:47.558
HE NEEDS TO WAIT
UNTIL HIS NEXT TURN.

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:48.949
UH, I KNEW THAT!

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:52.802
EXCUSE ME. STILL DOWN HERE!

00:06:53.798 --> 00:06:54.661
MAYBE I CAN'T ATTACK,

00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.152
BUT I CAN DO THIS!

00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:00.340
NEOS, SCARAB,
COMBINE TO CREATE

00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:03.627
ELEMENTAL HERO FLARE NEOS!

00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:08.077
COUNT UP YOUR SPELLS
AND TRAPS,

00:07:09.073 --> 00:07:12.594
'CAUSE EACH ONE
GIVES FLARE NEOS
400 EXTRA POINTS!

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:17.210
Axel, thinking:
IS HE PREDICTABLE OR WHAT?

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.863
Jaden, thinking: NOW
THAT AXEL'S GRAVEYARD IS
OUT OF FIRE MONSTERS,

00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:23.719
HIS FIRE WALL
CAN'T STOP ME.

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:26.076
FLARE NEOS,
DIRECT ATTACK!

00:07:27.073 --> 00:07:28.733
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:33.216
Axel: I ACTIVATE BURIAL FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION!

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:36.039
IT LETS ME TAKE
THREE MONSTERS
THAT ARE OUT OF PLAY

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:38.695
AND ADD 'EM TO MY GRAVE.

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:41.054
THEN JUST LIKE BEFORE,

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.743
I REMOVE MY
VOLCANIC SHELL FROM PLAY

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.835
AND ACTIVATE FIREWALL.

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:49.455
AND I'M SENDING
IN MY AVIAN AGAIN!

00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:51.880
DEJA VU.

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:56.163
IF YOU'RE GONNA REPEAT
THE SAME MOVES,
THEN SO WILL I!

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:57.556
[SCREAMING]

00:07:58.552 --> 00:08:00.112
TIME TO BREAK
THIS CYCLE...

00:08:01.109 --> 00:08:02.936
WITH THIS,
MY CONTACT OUT!

00:08:03.932 --> 00:08:04.629
SAY WHAT?

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:07.419
IT'S ABOUT TIME ONE
OF US TRIED SOMETHING
ORIGINAL, RIGHT?

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:09.544
I WAS GETTING BORED.

00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:11.769
NOW I CAN UN-FUSE
FLARE NEOS.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:15.090
AND SINCE
NEOS AND SCARAB
ARE IN MY DECK,

00:08:16.086 --> 00:08:16.850
NOW I CAN SUMMON THEM.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:18.242
HUH?

00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:19.896
Axel, thinking:
I'M BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND

00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:23.051
WHY VIPER'S SO
INTERESTED IN THIS KID.

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:25.807
FLARE NEOS, SEPARATE!

00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:36.268
NEOS, ATTACK!
COSMIC CRUSH!

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:40.850
Axel: I REMOVE
MY FLAME EMPEROR
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.906
TO ACTIVATE FIREWALL!

00:08:44.902 --> 00:08:48.289
FLARE SCARAB,
TIME TO PICK UP WHERE
NEOS LEFT OFF.

00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:50.847
NO!
I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE!

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:54.433
AND DON'T FORGET THAT
FOR EVERY SPELL AND TRAP
CARD YOU HAVE IN PLAY,

00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:57.621
SCARAB GETS
400 MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.628
HA HA HA!

00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:07.550
SWEETNESS!
ABOUT TIME YOU LOST
SOME MORE POINTS!

00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:09.111

00:18:20.184 --> 00:18:21.779
Axel: MY MISSION
IS COMPLETE.

00:18:23.473 --> 00:18:25.531
[GROANING]

00:18:30.114 --> 00:18:32.306
Axel, thinking:
SOMETHING'S...NOT RIGHT.

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:36.755
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, VIPER?

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.339
Jesse: JADEN!
Syrus: SAY
SOMETHING!

00:18:42.335 --> 00:18:43.464
Hassleberry:
GET UP, SARGE!

00:18:50.703 --> 00:18:51.898
Fontaine:
SO WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENED OUT THERE?

00:18:52.895 --> 00:18:53.327
Jesse:
HE WAS DUELING.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.021
THEN HE JUST
PLUMB COLLAPSED!

00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:58.607
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
I JUST LOOKED AT HIS STATS.

00:18:59.604 --> 00:19:01.230
NO ONE FALLS INTO
A STATE OF COMPLETE
UNCONSCIOUSNESS

00:19:02.226 --> 00:19:03.057
JUST FROM DUELING!

00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:05.947
WELL,
THINGS DID GET
PRETTY INTENSE.

00:19:06.943 --> 00:19:08.204
YES, BUT STILL,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.865
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:12.986
HE MUST HAVE
A PREEXISTING CONDITION.

00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:15.178
Jaden:
HEY. WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:16.174 --> 00:19:18.764
UH, WHY IS EVERYONE
STARING AT ME LIKE THAT?

00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:20.558
YOU'RE AWAKE!

00:19:21.554 --> 00:19:23.181
SO ARE YOU.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

00:19:24.178 --> 00:19:26.402
JADEN! I'LL NEVER
LEAVE YOUR SIDE!

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.026
I'M QUITTING
THE OBELISK DORM!

00:19:30.022 --> 00:19:31.118
BLUE WAS NEVER
MY COLOR ANYWAY.

00:19:32.114 --> 00:19:34.938
ONCE I'M BACK, I'LL KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU 24/7!

00:19:35.934 --> 00:19:42.455
I'LL MAKE SURE NOTHING LIKE
THIS HAPPENS TO YOU AGAIN!

00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:43.636
THAT'S NICE.

00:19:43.636 --> 00:19:44.204
JADEN?!

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:46.306
HE'S FINE.
JUST SLEEPING.

00:19:47.307 --> 00:19:48.541
