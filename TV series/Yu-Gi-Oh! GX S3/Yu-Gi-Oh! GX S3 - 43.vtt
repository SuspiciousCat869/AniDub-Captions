00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.069
SORRY FOR GRABBING
YOUR ARM LIKE THAT.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.637
AND ALL THE BIG YELLING.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.306
JUST TRYIN'
TO PEP TALK YA.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.674
YOU'VE GOTTA FACE
YOUR FEARS, JADEN.

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.345
BUT IF HE CAN'T CONTROL
THE SUPREME KING...

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:26.980
HE'LL TAKE OVER AGAIN...

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.983
AND THIS TIME--WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO STOP HIM.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.823
THERE WE GO,
NICE AND COMFY.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.892
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:40.994
WHAT'S THE POINT?
I'M DONE.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:42.228
HUH?

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.496
IT'S OVER, CROWLER.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.198
MY HEART'S GONNA GIVE.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.300
IT MAY BE OVER
FOR ALL OF US, MY BOY.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.868
WE'RE NEVER
GETTING BACK HOME.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.104
I WISH I HAD DONE MORE
WITH MY LIFE.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.573
I SHOULD'VE LEARNED
HOW TO PLAY THE VIOLIN.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.509
I SHOULD'VE
TOLD SWEET JULIE
HOW I FELT ABOUT HER.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.611
I SHOULD'VE CLIMBED
EVERY MOUNTAIN!

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.347
AND THEN WRITTEN
MY NOVEL.

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:04.417
BUT NO--I WAS
TOO BUSY TEACHING.
NOT THAT I MINDED, ZANE.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.720
CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE
AND BLAH BLAH BLAH.
YOU KNOW.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.222
EVEN SO...
YOU HAVE REGRETS...

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.691
IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN
IT WOULD END LIKE THIS.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:15.462
I WOULD'VE FOUND TIME
TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST.

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:16.763
LIE DOWN, REST UP.

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:18.565
YOUR HEART CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE STRESS.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:21.468
MAYBE NOT.
BUT WE HAVE
SOME COMPANY ARRIVING.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.535
LOOK OVER THERE.
HUH?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.175
AAH!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.118
IT'S--!
IS THAT REALLY--?!

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.595
IT'S JESSE!
YOU'RE OK!

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:50.630
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.166
HA HA! I JUST KNEW
YOU WERE OK!

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.235
I REFUSED TO GIVE UP--

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:56.836
WHAT'S WRONG, ZANE?

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.538
YOU SHOULD
STAY BACK, PROFESSOR.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.877
SO WHERE IS JADEN?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.779
OH, HE'S AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:08.815
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST--
YOU'VE GOT SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.617
HMPH.
SO, TELL US--

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:11.684
WHAT'VE YOU BEEN UP TO?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.354
BESIDES LOSING
YOUR SOUTHERN DRAWL?

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:17.090
NEVER YOU MIND, ZANE.
A NEW DAY DAWNS.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.591
DOES IT REALLY?

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.694
BEFORE LONG--THE FABRIC OF
ALL THINGS WILL BE UNDONE.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:22.796
THEN REWOVEN.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.864
SO THAT ALL DIMENSIONS
WILL BECOME ONE.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.967
THE GREAT EYE
WILL SEE ALL.
[LAUGHS]

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.669
YEAH, OK. I'D
ASK YOU TO EXPLAIN

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.471
WHAT THAT ALL MEANS.

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.472
BUT YA KNOW WHAT.

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:33.473
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.541
I'D RATHER HAVE A DUEL

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:36.543
THAN SIT THROUGH
A LECTURE!

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:38.545
SO, YOU READY TO GET
YOUR GAME ON?

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:41.014
WAIT. YOU CAN'T
DUEL JESSE, ZANE.

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:43.450
YOU'RE IN NO CONDIT--
I'M NOT GOING TO
LEAVE HERE WITH REGRETS.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.085
MY TIME HERE IS LIMITED.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.121
WHEN IT'S UP, I DON'T WANNA
BE SAYING "I SHOULD'VE."

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.090
YOU UNDERSTAND.
DON'T YOU?

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.992
WELL, YES, BUT, BUT--
THERE'S A CHANCE
WE CAN SAVE YOU.

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.261
THERE'S ALSO A CHANCE THAT
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.429
I'M NOT WAITING.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.697
AHH.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:00.467
THIS DUEL MIGHT BE THE THING
THAT SENDS ME TO THE STARS.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.303
BUT BETTER THAT
THAN TO FADE AWAY
WHILE LYING DOWN.

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:04.504
I LIVE TO DUEL.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.239
AND THIS COULD BE
THE ULTIMATE BATTLE.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:09.109
[THINKING] AFTER ALL,
AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO ADMIT IT...

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.077
JESSE WAS ONE OF
MY GREATEST OPPONENTS.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.549
YOUR CYBER END DRAGON
IS GONNA BE
QUITE THE CHALLENGE.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.052
HOPE YOU DON'T LOSE...
BEFORE I GET A CHANCE

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:21.087
TO TAKE IT DOWN.

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.089
HOW DARE YOU TALK
TO ME THAT WAY.

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:25.391
HOPE THAT DECK OF YOURS
CAN BACK IT UP.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.460
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.761
HERE IT IS!

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:33.366
CYBER END DRAGON!
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.434
SAVE ME, JESSE!

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:35.902
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK,

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:38.338
'CAUSE I'M PLAYING
AMBER CRYSTAL CIRCLE.

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:47.113
THAT EXCITEMENT.
I'VE ONLY EVER
FELT IT TWICE.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:50.150
WHEN I DUELED JADEN,
AND WHEN I DUELED JESSE.

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.155
ONLY JESSE AND I NEVER GOT
TO FINISH OUR DUEL PROPERLY.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.689
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU REALLY ARE

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.824
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE HIM,

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.392
AND THAT'S
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.828
IF YOU HAVE JESSE'S POWERS,
THEN BRING 'EM ON!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.863
SO I CAN SETTLE
MY FINAL SCORE.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.065
HA. WITH PLEASURE.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.535
FOR YOU SEEM LIKE
A VERY LONELY SPIRIT, ZANE.

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:10.703
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU AND I HAVE IN COMMON.

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:13.406
YOU CAN BE THE FIRST ONE
I SAVE.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:15.608
I'M HERE TO SAVE
ALL THE LONELY SPIRITS.

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.177
TO UNITE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.444
SO THAT NO ONE
FEELS THE PAIN...

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:19.879
THAT JADEN MADE ME FEEL.

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:26.019
BUT, BUT--!
PROFESSOR--GET BACK.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.321
IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET
BURNED--TAKE COVER, WORM.

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.156
AAH! OH DEAR!

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.561
Jesse and Zane: GAME ON!

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:37.363
I HAVE THE FIRST MOVE.
LET'S BEGIN.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.899
I ACTIVATE THE ADVANCED
DARK FIELD SPELL!

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:50.877
THEN I SUMMON AN ADVANCED
CRYSTAL BEAST--AMETHYST CAT!

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:51.878
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:59.118
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:04.557
IF ZANE WINS, THEN
JESSE LOSES AND--

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.326
IF JESSE WINS,
ZANE LOSES!

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.294
EITHER WAY,
ONE OF 'EM
GOES TO THE STARS!

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.370
[ALL GASP]

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.805
Bastion: ISN'T THAT--?

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:21.474
IT LOOKS LIKE ZANE!
WHO'S HE DUELING?

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.575
HE'S DUELING!?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.910
THAT'S BAD, RIGHT?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.978
Tania: LET'S GO!

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:30.183
IT'S MY TURN.
I DRAW!

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.754
YOU MUST NOT THINK
VERY MUCH OF ME.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:38.024
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU SUMMON
A LITTLE KITTY LIKE THAT?

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:40.093
YOU'LL FIND OUT IF YOU MANAGE
TO LAST LONG ENOUGH.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.327
I AIM TO!

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.462
[THINKING] AND IT
SHOULDN'T BE HARD

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:45.031
'CAUSE CRYSTAL BEASTS
HAVE LOW ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.500
THAT BEING SAID--
THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.801
KEEP THEM AROUND
ON THE FIELD

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.637
AFTER THEY'VE
BEEN DESTROYED.

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:53.306
HE'S TRYING
TO PLAN A COMBO
USING ADVANCED DARK.

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:54.807
BUT IF I PLAY
MY CARDS RIGHT,

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:57.310
I CAN TAKE HIM DOWN
BEFORE HE LINES
THINGS UP.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.078
YOU CAN'T SCARE ME,
YOU KNOW.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.880
MY FATE IS WRITTEN!

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.449
I SUMMON--CYBER DRAGON!

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.753
Jaden: ZANE!...
HEY, ZANE!...

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:09.188
IS THAT YOU, JADEN?
AND BASTION!

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.823
YOU'RE HERE!...
AND...AND WHO'S HE?

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:17.030
Jaden: JESSE!

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.331
ZANE, NO!

00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:20.967
SOMETHING'S WEIRD.
HE LOOKS KINDA FREAKY.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.702
HEY! THAT'S
MY BIG BROTHER

00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:24.137
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, YOU KNOW.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.938
I-I WAS
TALKING ABOUT JESSE!..

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.541
I MEAN, LOOK AT
THOSE EYES, WOULD YA?

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.876
CYBER DRAGON!

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.245
SLAM THAT KITTEN
WITH STRIDENT BLAST!

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.320
Jesse: AMETHYST CAT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.721
WHEN IT'S DESTROYED
IN BATTLE...

00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:43.756
INSTEAD OF BEING SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD--

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:46.159
IT STAYS IN MY
SPELL AND TRAP CARD ZONE.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.427
AS A CRYSTAL.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:50.163
HEY--WEREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO LOSE
LIFE POINTS?

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.497
NORMALLY, I WOULD'VE...

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.032
BUT THIS ADVANCED
DARK FIELD SPELL

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.201
HAS SOME REALLY NICE PERKS.

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:58.271
FOR INSTANCE--IF
AN ADVANCED CRYSTAL BEAST
IS DESTROYED,

00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.106
I CAN NEGATE
THE DAMAGE COMING TO ME

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:02.842
BY SENDING A CRYSTAL BEAST
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.078
IF YOU WANT TO DAMAGE ME...
TRY HARDER.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.780
HMPH! I THINK I CAN
MANAGE THAT.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.149
NOW--I PLACE
A CARD FACEDOWN.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.317
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.885
WHY ARE THEY
DUELING?

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.189
JESSE--THEN ZANE SAID--
...I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.990
JESSE, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU!

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.326
WHAT ARE YOU--?
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.462
WHY ARE YOU
DUELING ZANE?

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:24.197
MY BROTHER'S
GOTTA STOP THIS...

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.665
HE CAN'T TAKE IT.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.767
WHY NOT, SY?

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:28.935
Crowler: THOSE
UNDERGROUND DUELS

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.937
SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN
A TOLL ON ZANE'S HEART.

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:32.805
HIS DUEL ENERGY
IS LEAVING HIM.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.774
THIS BATTLE
COULD BE HIS END.

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:37.343
UNDERGROUND DUELS?
SY?

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.644
[GROANS]

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.613
HEY, GUYS!
KNOCK IT OFF,
WOULD YA?!

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:43.249
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

I SELECT RUBY CARBUNCLE
AND PLACE IT FACEDOWN...

NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE M FORCE SPELL CARD!

THIS SPELL GIVES

500 EXTRA ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.302
THOSE POINTS
ARE GOING TO PEGASUS.

BUT AMETHYST CAT,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

CAN POUNCE PAST YOUR MONSTER
AND ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

FOR THIS PRIVILEGE,

THAT MUCH DAMAGE.
