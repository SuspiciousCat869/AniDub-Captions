WILL BATTLE TO A DRAW?

THE FIVE TOWERS
ARE CONSIDERED
MONSTER CARD ZONES,

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.454
WHICH MEANS, BY MOVING
MY KING TO A NEW TOWER

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.257
HE'S SAVED,
BUT THE FORMER TOWER
IS OFF LIMITS.

MUST HAVE YOU CONFUSED.

OF MONSTERS YOU CAN PLAY

FOR A KING WHO HAS
ONE ATTACK POINT.

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:27.734

WHEN MY FOG KING
ATTACKS ANOTHER MONSTER,

YES, I CAN,

ANOTHER CREST COUNTER.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.293
HOPING THAT THAT SAME COSMIC
MATTER WOULD MAKE HER SAFE
TO USE AGAIN.

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:15.562
SO IS THAT WHAT'S CAUSING
ALL OF THIS?

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.398
THE ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS?
THE LOSS OF MY FRIENDS?

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:22.002
IS IT ALL BECAUSE OF
WHAT I DID TO THAT CARD?!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.303
Syrus:
JADEN?

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:25.105
JADEN!
HUH?

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.074
LOOK!
THERE!

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.613
WOW!
IT'S A BRIDGE!

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.981
IT'S PURPLE!

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.784
THAT MEANS FRIENDLY...
RIGHT?

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:41.988
OJAMA, SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.225
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.127
OH, YES, I REMEMBER NOW.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:50.964
WE WERE DISCUSSING
HOW THE DARKNESS IN YOU
IS THE KEY TO MY VICTORY.

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:54.167
I WONDER HOW ECHO WOULD FEEL
KNOWING THAT THE KEY TO
UNLOCKING YOUR REIGN

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:56.770
WOULD BE THE SAME KEY
THAT SEALS YOUR FATE.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.405
IT'S QUITE TRAGIC,
ISN'T IT!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.674
BUT WHAT'S WORSE

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:04.477
IS THAT IN THE END, YOU TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF HER FEELINGS.

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:07.647
YOU SENT HER TO THE STARS,
JUST AS I WAS.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.549
YOU SEE, WE BOTH
WERE BETRAYED

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.751
BY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.420
HOW COULD YOU, JADEN?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.523
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT,
YUBEL?!

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.891
WHAT DID HE DO?

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.567
HE LEFT ME

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.035
ALL ALONE,

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.204
AND SO NOW

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:34.574
HE'S GOING TO SUFFER FOR
ALL THE WRONG THAT HE DID TO ME

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.344
AFTER THE DARKNESS IN YOU
RESTORES MY POWER!

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:44.384
Syrus: ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.752
Jaden: NOPE!

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.986

THIS ENDS HERE AND NOW!

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.007
FOG KING, IT'S TIME.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.709
ATTACK HIS BRIGADIER

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.611
AND GIVE HIM
THE ROYAL TREATMENT.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.486
ARGH!

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.356
NOW HE GETS ONE MORE
CREST COUNTER

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.758
AND 800 MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.496
AND NEXT I'LL
LAY DOWN 3 FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN.

LOOK AT YOU KNEELING
TO ME ALREADY.

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.707
SO, TELL ME,
YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT,

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:42.342
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
A BIT WINDED.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:43.877
JUST WAIT.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:47.347
BEFORE LONG, THE DARKNESS
IN YOU WILL GIVE ME
ALL THE POWER I NEED.

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.083
ADRIAN, YOU ARE THE KEY
TO MY REVENGE.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.584
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:54.020
I GIVE YOU NOTHING!

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.556
HA HA!
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:58.591
YOUR EMOTIONS
WILL DESTROY YOU.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.859
YOU POOR THING,

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.529
THE VERY DARKNESS YOU
ALLOWED TO ENVELOP YOUR HEART

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.898
WHEN YOU OBTAINED EXODIA
IS THE SAME POWER

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:07.967
THAT WILL END YOUR CHANCES
OF RULING THIS WORLD!

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:13.439
HA HA!
AND SOON, I'LL BEAT JADEN!

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.242
ALL RIGHT, THEN, MY MOVE!

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:19.546
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
AKASHIC RECORD!

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:22.248
WITH THIS,
I DRAW TWO NEW CARDS.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.783
AND IF THEY'VE BEEN USED,

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.785
I HAVE TO REMOVE THEM
FROM THE GAME.

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.254
FORTUNATELY
THESE ARE ALL NEW!

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:31.691
AND NOW I PLAY THE SPELL
NIGHTMARE SHUFFLE!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:35.228
WITH THIS I SELECT ONE RANDOM
CARD THAT'S IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.667
NEXT, I PLACE THE CARD
I CHOSE FACEDOWN.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.468
THEN WHEN IT'S
MY TURN AGAIN,

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:46.272
I HAVE TO PLAY THAT FACEDOWN
AND START THE PROCESS ALL OVER.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.942
SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH
BUT HERE'S THE SCARY PART.

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:51.477
DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF NIGHTMARE SHUFFLE,

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:55.014
NEXT ROUND, WHEN I HAVE TO
ACTIVATE THAT FACEDOWN CARD,

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.483
IF I DON'T MEET
ITS REQUIREMENTS,

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:01.688
THEN ALL THE CARDS IN MY HAND
AND ON MY FIELD ALL GET SENT
TO THE GRAVE!

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:03.556
SO IT'S ALL OR NOTHING
THEN.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.992
WHICH IS ONLY WAY
I KNOW HOW TO DUEL.

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:08.228
YOU HAVE TO LIVE LIFE
TO THE FULLEST!

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.129
HA HA!

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.432
OR IN YOUR CASE,
THE DARKEST.

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:14.200
I HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU FELT

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.738
WHEN THE LAST OF ECHO'S DUEL

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.373
WERE YOU PROUD OF THE FACT

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:24.377
THAT YOU WERE FINALLY ABLE
TO EMBRACE YOUR SELFISH
DESIRES FOR POWER?

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:26.212
LETTING THE DARKNESS
OUT OF YOUR HEART

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:28.648
MUST HAVE BEEN
AN AWE-SHATTERING MOMENT.

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:31.884
DID IT FEEL GOOD USING YOUR
FRIEND AS A MEANS TO AN END?

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.153
SHOW ME THE DARKNESS
IN YOUR HEART.

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.122
ALLOW ME A GLIMPSE
OF THE POWER

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:39.092

TO MY FULL STRENGTH.

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.062

WHAT'S THIS?

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.431
NO!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.833
THE DARKNESS, IT'S GONE!

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:50.503
THAT'S BECAUSE I NEVER
ALLOWED IT TO TAKE HOLD
OF ME.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:51.871
BUT HOW?!

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:54.974
YOU SEE, YUBEL,
EVERYTHING I DID

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:58.478
WAS TO CREATE A WORLD
VOID OF PAIN
AND SUFFERING,

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:01.914
A SAFE WORLD WHERE
DARKNESS CAN'T EXIST!

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:04.250
[GRUNTS]
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.785
THIS DREAM OF YOURS

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.921
IS NOTHING
BUT COMPLETE NONSENSE!

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.958
IT IS THE DREAM OF A FOOL,
NOT A KING!

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.359
AND NOW I AM GOING
TO SEE TO IT

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:17.664
THAT MY VISION BECOMES
YOUR NIGHTMARE, DEAR ADRIAN!

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.499

YOUR POWER...

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:25.638
AND EVEN YOUR PRECIOUS EXODIA
CANNOT HELP YOU WIN!

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.940
THIS WORLD WILL
NEVER BE YOURS,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.109
AND I AIM TO SEE TO THAT
RIGHT NOW!

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:35.415
PREPARE TO WITNESS THE POWER
THAT YOU SO STUPIDLY
TURNED AWAY!

YOU'VE WASTED
TOO MUCH OF MY TIME!

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.653
I PLAY GRAVE SQUIRMER!

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.256
NOW PUT AN END
TO HIS FOG KING!

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.676
YOU ARE DEAD WRONG!

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.345
'CAUSE THAT ABILITY WORKS

ONLY ON ANY CREATURES
THAT ARE ALIVE AND KICKING.

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.718
AND MY GRAVESQUIRMER IS MOST
CERTAINLY NEITHER OF THOSE.

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.853
AND WITH HIM IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.122
ADRIAN, I'LL SEARCH THE FIELD

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.324
AND DESTROY ONE CARD,

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.560

TO MY GRAVEYARD,

AND WHEN I DISCARD ALL
THE CARDS IN MY HAND...

I GET FOUR CARDS
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

WILL BE MINE!

TO THE GRAVE,

AS WELL AS THE ONLY CARD
IN MY HAND.

YES, IT CAN!
AND IT IS!

SO WITH THE POWER OF

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:38.504
I WILL CORRECT
THE WRONGS OF MY PAST!

BREAK THE SEAL!
AH!

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.680

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.817
AND A SECOND BREAK THE SEAL
TRAP CARD TO MY GRAVEYARD,
