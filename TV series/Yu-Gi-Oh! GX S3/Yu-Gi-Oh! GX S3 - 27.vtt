SURE, HE WAS
A FINE DUELIST,

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.506
BUT I WAS MOST INTRIGUED
BY SOMETHING

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:54.975
I HEARD
FROM HIS PARENTS--

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.743
THAT WHEN JADEN
WAS A YOUNG BOY,

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:59.412
HE HAD A DEEP CONNECTION
WITH A DUEL SPIRIT.

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:01.014
[ALL GASP]
LET ME GUESS.

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.248
A SPIRIT NAMED YUBEL.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.450
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.986
BUT THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY
THAN JUST THAT.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.888
YOU SEE, JADEN'S PARENTS
WERE RARELY HOME

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.857
BECAUSE OF LONG HOURS AT WORK.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.494
SO, JADEN WOULD INVITE VARIOUS
NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDS OVER

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.197
AND SPEND ALL OF HIS
FREE TIME DUELING.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.265

NOBODY CAN KNOW FOR SURE.

BUT I DO KNOW EACH TIME
JADEN PUT YUBEL IN HIS DECK...

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:23.957
BAD THINGS WOULD ALWAYS HAPPEN
TO HIS OPPONENTS.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.626
EVENTUALLY, EVERYONE IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD GOT SPOOKED

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.996
AND REFUSED TO DUEL JADEN
SO LONG AS HE HAD THAT CARD.

WHAT'D THE SARGE
GO AND DO?

WOULD HAVE IT...

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.936
...KAIBACORP WAS
ACCEPTING CARD SUBMISSIONS

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.605
DURING THIS SAME TIME.

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.007

WOULD BE SHOT INTO SPACE

AND INFUSED WITH
SPECIAL COSMIC MATTER.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:47.013
JADEN SUBMITTED A DESIGN
FOR NEOS WHICH WAS ACCEPTED.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:50.183
BUT HE ALSO
CONVINCED KAIBACORP
TO SEND UP YUBEL.

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:53.153
HE LOVED THAT CARD SO MUCH
HE COULD NEVER
GET RID OF IT.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.355
INSTEAD, HE HOPED
THE COSMIC INFUSION

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.290
WOULD MAKE HER
SAFE TO USE.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.660
AND SO, TWO SATELLITES
WERE SENT INTO SPACE.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.596
ONE WITH YUBEL
AND THE OTHER, NEOS.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.198
THE COSMOS
DID THEIR THING...

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:07.600
AND MADE NEOS A GREAT SUCCESS.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.469
BUT, YUBEL, ON THE OTHER HAND...

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.639
WELL, WE'RE JUST NOW
LEARNING THE EFFECTS.

HAS ANY TRUE INSIGHT INTO.
