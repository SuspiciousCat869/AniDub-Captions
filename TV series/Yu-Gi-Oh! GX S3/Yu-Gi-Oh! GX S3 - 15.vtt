00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.370
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.406
JADEN, WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE,
I WILL COMPLETE MY MISSION!

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.979
Jim: LOOKS LIKE HE'S
TAKING US TOPSIDE, MATES!

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.251
IT'S TIME TO GET
YOUR GAME ON, VIPER!

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.787
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
VENOM SWAMP!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.489
WELCOME TO THE MUCK!

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.094
COME FORTH, VENOMINON
THE KING OF POISONOUS SNAKES!

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.762
GO, FANGED VENOM!

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.435
Jesse: VIPER, WHO ARE
YOU WORKIN' WITH?
HUH?

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.204
A FEW YEARS AGO...

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.274
I WAS THE LEADER
OF AN ELITE SPECIAL
FORCES TEAM.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.242
SOMETHING HAD CRASH-LANDED
ON EARTH,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.412
AND WE WERE THE GUYS SENT
TO PICK UP THE PIECES.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.781
THAT THING HE FOUND
WAS YOU WASN'T IT!

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.552
YES, AND MY NEW FRIEND
WAS TO DO MY BIDDING...

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.954
ONCE I DEFEAT YOU,
YOUR DUEL ENERGY

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:56.690
WILL RESURRECT MY SON,
AND WE'LL BE REUNITED!

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.225
YOU'VE BEEN SUCKING
ALL THIS ENERGY

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.227
FOR SOME CREATURE
TO BRING YOUR SON BACK!

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.930
HOW MANY MORE STUDENTS
ARE YOU WILLING TO
SACRIFICE FOR HIM?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.631
JUST ONE MORE.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.567
JADEN IS THE LAST.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.870
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY
FOR DISCARDING ME
THE WAY YOU DID, JADEN...

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.006

OKAY, VIPER...
MY TURN!

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.015
AND I SUMMON
CARD TROOPER!

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.884
THAT TIN CAN
WON'T HELP YOU.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.453
NOT WITH A MEASLY
400 ATTACK POINTS.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.390
WELL, THIS TIN CAN
HAS GOT SOME REAL
HEART INSIDE OF IT!

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.025
HE CAN GET STRONGER.

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:40.093
THANKS TO HIS
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.262
SEE, IF I SEND
THE TOP 3 CARDS
OF MY DECK

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.699
TO THE GRAVE,
HE GAINS 1,500
ATTACK POINTS.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:46.933
PATHETIC!

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.770
THAT RUST BUCKET IS STILL
NO MATCH FOR MY KING!

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.572
VENOMINON IS
FAR TOO STRONG!

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.708
NOW THAT YOUR END
PHASE HAS BEGUN...

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.511
CARD TROOPER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY IS
NO LONGER IN EFFECT.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.446
IT'S SNAKE BAIT NOW!

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.949
ALL THE POINTS YOUR MONSTER
GAINED ARE LOST,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.985
AND THEN MY VENOM SWAMP
ACTIVATES AND INFLICTS

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.953
SOME MORE DAMAGE.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.957
NOW WITH YOUR CARD TROOPER
ALL OUT OF ATTACK POINTS...

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.893
MY FIELD SPELL
DESTROYS IT!

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:16.363
SAY GOOD-BYE!
HA HA HA!

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.331
UNH!

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.834
BUT NOT BEFORE
HIS SECOND ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.003
SEE, IF HE'S DESTROYED,
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD!

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.605
LIKE SO!
I END MY TURN.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.207
SHRUG IT OFF, JAY!

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.042
MAYBE THAT CARD WILL
HELP YOU NEXT TIME!

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.445
BUT THE SARGE HAS GOT TO
MOUNT A BETTER OFFENSIVE.

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:33.080
ONE MORE ROUND
LIKE THE LAST ONE,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.681
AND JADEN COULD BE
A GONER!

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.916
COME ON...

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.517
HEH HEH HEH!

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.919
IT'S MY TURN.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.055
[THINKING]
SOON I WILL HAVE DRAINED
ALL THE ENERGY WE NEED.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.158
AND WITH JADEN'S HELP,
I'LL BE REUNITED WITH MY SON,

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.660
ALL THANKS TO IT!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.230
MAKE HIM PAY,
AND THEN YOU TWO CAN PLAY.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.132
HA HA HA!

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.601
IT WON'T BE
LONG NOW, MY SON.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.969
MY TURN...

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.271
AND MY VENOMINON
ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY...

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.640
GO, FANGED VENOM!

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.175
NOT SO FAST,
BIG GUY!

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.778
I PLAY NECRO GARDNA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.313
SINCE HE'S
IN MY GRAVEYARD...

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:08.148
I CAN REMOVE HIM
FROM PLAY,

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:11.118
AND THEN HE CAN BLOCK
ANY VENOM YOUR SNAKES
SHOOT MY WAY.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.988
YOU'RE SIMPLY
PROLONGING THE INEVITABLE.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.523
FACE IT, JADEN,

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.892
NO CARD YOU HAVE
CAN SAVE YOU NOW.

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:21.361
I PLAY A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:24.164
POOR JADEN.

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:25.365
I HATE TO AGREE
WITH VIPER,

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.767
BUT HE MIGHT
HAVE A POINT.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.201
Jesse: NO WAY!

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.203
NOW SEE HERE!
IT AIN'T OVER!

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.272
JADEN'S ALWAYS GOT
A TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE,

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.175
NO MATTER HOW TOUGH
VIPER'S CARDS ARE!

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.743
[THINKING]
JESSE'S RIGHT,
MY CARDS HAVE NEVER

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.178
LET ME DOWN BEFORE!

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:39.546
AND I'M ABOUT TO
SHOW EVERYONE

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.615
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET ME DOWN THIS
TIME EITHER!

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.388
HERE WE GO!
IT'S MY TURN!

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.824
JUST WHAT I WAS
HOPING FOR!

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:53.827
I ACTIVATE:
THE SPELL
MIRACLE FUSION!

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:55.695
IF I HAVE ANY HEROES
IN MY GRAVE,

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.831
THIS SPELL LETS ME
REMOVE TWO FROM PLAY.

00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:00.734
AND IN THEIR PLACE I GET
TO SUMMON A NEW MONSTER...

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.202
SO I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE,

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:05.906
AND YOU CAN SAY HELLO TO
MY ELEMENTAL HERO WILDEDGE!

00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:13.246
LOOK AT ALL
OF HIS ATTACK POINTS!

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.849
HE'S GOT MORE THAN
VIPER'S VENOMINON DOES!

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.385
YEAH, SY,
BUT IF JADEN
DESTROYS VENOMINON,

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.220
THEN VIPER'LL
RESURRECT HIM!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.621
RIGHT, I FORGOT.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.623
Jesse: DON'T WORRY!
Both: HUH?

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.325
WILDEDGE HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.927
N'THAT SNAKES TOAST.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.461
YA SEE, THAT
HERO'S UNIQUE.

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.064
IT CAN ATTACK ANY
MONSTER ONCE PER ROUND.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.501
SO WHEN VENOMINON REAPPEARS,
HE COUNTS AS A NEW MONSTER,

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.970
AND THEN WILDEDGE
CAN ATTACK HIM AGAIN!

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.004
OH, YEAH!

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.172
THERE'S MORE!

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.841
WHEN VENOMINON'S
RESURRECTED,

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.809
VIPER HAS TO REMOVE
A REPTILE MONSTER

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.811
IN HIS GRAVE
FROM THE GAME!

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:48.615
WHICH MEANS VENOMINON
IS 500 POINTS WEAKER
EACH TIME HE COMES BACK!

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:50.250

AND NOW, IT'S THAT TIME
OF THE DUEL AGAIN

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.572
FOR MY VENOM SWAMP
TO ACTIVATE!

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.908
WHICH MEANS 500
ATTACK POINTS ARE GONE

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:56.509
FROM YOUR MONSTER.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:59.546

HA HA HA!

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:05.051
THERE'S NO ESCAPING
MY SWAMP!

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:07.821
AND NOW...MY TURN!

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.489
VENOMINAGA...

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.624
ATTACK WITH
VENOM VAPOR BLAST!

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.466
SORRY, WILDEDGE!

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:20.667
AND YOU'RE NEXT!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.402
NOW TO UNLEASH
ITS TRUE POWER!

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:23.803
STRIKE JADEN!

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.705

YOU SEE THAT?!

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.210
NO!

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.180
SO WOOZY...

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.181
CAN HARDLY...

SEE STRAIGHT!

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.688
HA HA HA!
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE
JUST BEEN POISONED!

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:48.061
THAT PAIN YOU FEEL IS
MY VENOMINAGA'S POISON

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.596
COURSING THROUGH YOUR BODY.

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.832
IN THREE ROUNDS,
HER SPECIAL
ABILITY KICKS IN...

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.734
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS
GO TO ZERO!

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:55.735
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.837
IF IT'S TRUE,
HE'S ONLY GOT
3 TURNS

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.406
TO BEAT THIS SNAKE,

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.808
OR VIPER'S GONNA GET
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:03.143
OH, NO!

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.513
THIS DUEL IS SO MUCH FUN,

I CAN'T TAKE
MY EYE OFF IT...

THIS GAME MIGHT BE
ALL THE DISTRACTION

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.317
'CAUSE I SURE DID.

AND MY ELEMENTAL
HERO SPARKMAN

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.571
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
AND ADD THEM TO MY HAND.

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.574
THEN I GET TO PLAY
POLYMERIZATION

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:11.111
AND FUSE SPARKMAN
WITH ELEMENTAL
HERO NECROSHADE

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.639
WITH NECRO SHOT,
I CHOOSE 3 MONSTER CARDS
FROM YOUR GRAVE...

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.908
AND YOU GOTTA REMOVE
THEM FROM PLAY FOR GOOD!

LOSES SOME BITE!

00:10:57.557 --> 00:10:59.659
LIKE 1,500
POINTS OF BITE!

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:06.332
WHICH MEANS,
MY DARKBRIGHT
CAN FINISH HER OFF!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.201
GO, DARK FLASH!

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:19.179
SURE NECRO IS DESTROYED
WITH YOUR MONSTERS,

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.048
BUT THAT'S GONNA
WORK FOR ME TOO!

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.284
BECAUSE NOW THAT
NECRO'S IN THE GRAVE...

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.586
I GET TO SEND
A MONSTER THERE TOO.

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:29.189
AND THAT MEANS MY
ELEMENTAL HERO DARKBRIGHT

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.891
WILL AUTOMATICALLY SWITCH
RIGHT INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.194

BE DESTROYED SO EASILY?

TO DO IT.

THERE'S NO CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL WIN

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.619
BECAUSE AFTER YOU GO,
VENOMINAGA'S EFFECT
SEALS YOUR DOOM.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:17.023
A DOOM YOU'LL
SHARE WITH NO ONE!

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.426
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DUEL FOR
NO ONE BUT YOURSELF!

ALWAYS HAVE BEEN,

DON'T YOU SEE THAT

OF THE NEEDS OF OTHERS.

THAT MUST BE
AN EASY WAY TO LIVE,

LOOKING OUT FOR YOURSELF

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:43.649
AND NEVER CARING
FOR ANYONE ELSE.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.818
IT'S A LIFESTYLE
UNFAMILIAR TO ME.

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:47.720
I EXIST FOR MY SON.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.856

MORE FIREPOWER
