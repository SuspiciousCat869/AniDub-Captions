WEBVTT

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.604
Man: ATTENTION, WE WILL BE
ARRIVING AT THE TARGET ZONE

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.339
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.540
Pegasus:
HOW EXHILARATING
TO THINK THAT WE'LL

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.908
SOON BE
FACE TO FACE

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.277
WITH THE RAINBOW
DRAGON'S STONE TABLET,

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.946
AND ONCE WE POSSESS IT,
WE CAN USE ITS POWER

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.548
TO RESCUE JADEN
AND THE OTHERS

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.150
AND RETURN THEM BACK
TO OUR WORLD.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.953
PEGASUS, I'M SURPRISED
AT HOW EXCITED YOU ARE.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.789
I MEAN, YOU'VE WORKED
WITH SO MANY
MONSTERS BEFORE,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.092
AND YET THIS TABLET
SEEMS SO SPECIAL.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.361
WELL, YOU SEE,
THE RAINBOW DRAGON
HAS BEEN LOST

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.162
FOR HUNDREDS
OF YEARS,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.465
ITS WHEREABOUTS
A MYSTERY
TO THE WORLD!

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.166
THE STONE TABLET
EVEN MANAGED

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.403
TO ELUDE MY
ARCHEOLOGICAL TEAM,

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.107

PLAN OF YOURS WORKS OUT.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.845
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T,

Man: GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ESTABLISHED VISUAL CONTACT
WITH OUR LANDING SITE.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.482
WE SHOULD BE
ON THE GROUND MOMENTARILY.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.592
AH. AT LAST.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.996
THE STONE TABLET'S JUST
DOWN HERE, MR. PEGASUS.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.400
HUH?

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.137
THIS MUST BE IT!

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.805
IT'S REMARKABLE!

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.908
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD
ALREADY STARTED EXCAVATING.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.378
WE HAVEN'T. HMM.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:31.952
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
POP UP AGAIN, MS. ECHO.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.554
SO YOU AND THE GECKO
FINANCIAL GROUP

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.057
SOMEHOW BEAT US
TO THE DISCOVERY.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:40.627
IT APPEARS YOU'VE BEEN
QUITE THE BUSY BEE.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.795
I'LL SAY!

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.797
THANKS FOR THE HELP
IN GETTING
THINGS STARTED.

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:46.199
BUT IF ITS OK
WITH YOU, WE'LL
TAKE OVER FROM HERE,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.035
NOW PLEASE
MOVE ALONG.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:50.237
NOT A CHANCE.
THIS TABLET IS
NOW THE PROPERTY

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:52.472
OF THE GECKO
FINANCIAL GROUP.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.473
SAY WHAT?

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.108
MY DEAR SWEET ECHO.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.411
WHY MUST WE BE
SO SELFISH?

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.613
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR NEGOTIATION.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.515
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE
CAN BOTH BENEFIT

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.050
FROM A MEETING
OF THE MINDS.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.619
NOW IF WE WORK
TOGETHER TO
EXCAVATE THE TABLET,

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.523
WE CAN USE ITS POWER
TO BRING BACK OUR SCHOOL
AND YOUR FRIEND.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.192
SO YOU SEE IT'S
A WIN WIN SITUATION.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.095
NO! NOBODY'S WINNING
ANYTHING TODAY!

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:17.130
SIMMER DOWN, BOYS.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.067
IT'S JUST A REMOTE
SWITCH OF SOME KIND.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.569
LOOK! IT APPEARS SHE'S
BOOBY-TRAPPED
THE PERIMETER

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.204
WITH SHORT CIRCUIT
TRAP CARDS.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.872
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.475
I'M DESTROYING
THE STONE TABLET!

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:29.643
[ALL GASP]

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.011
HEH.

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.480
CAN YOU FEEL
THEIR POWER, ADRIAN?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.482
OH! SO IT IS TRUE.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.184
THAT'S RIGHT, ADRIAN.

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:42.322
WITHIN THIS CASE LIE
THE THREE SACRED BEASTS.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.725
AND WHY DO YOU
WANT THEM?

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.693
JUST WHAT ARE
YOU AFTER HERE?

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.362
MORE POWER!
WHAT DO YOU THINK!?

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.298
POWER FOR WHAT?

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.100
SO I CAN HAVE
MY REVENGE.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.202
[THINKING]
ONCE I HAVE
THE THREE SACRED BEASTS,

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.471
I'LL FINALLY HAVE ALL
THE PIECES I NEED

00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:00.774
TO MAKE JADEN PAY
FOR THE PAIN HE
HAS CAUSED ME.

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:03.610
QUESTION--WHAT ABOUT
THE AGREEMENT WE HAD?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.145
YOU OWE ME!

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.014
OF COURSE. BUT WHAT IF
I COULD OFFER YOU MORE?

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.884
IF YOU DUEL ME
AND YOU WIN,

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:14.755
THE THREE SACRED
BEAST CARDS IN THIS CASE
WILL BE ALL YOURS.

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.825
WITH THEM YOU COULD
EVEN RULE THIS WORLD.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.499
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
ADRIAN?

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.768
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO LOSE!

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.536
THOSE CARDS ARE
GONNA BE ALL MINE.

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:32.472
LET'S DO THIS!

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.846
FINE THEN!

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.248
GAME ON!
GAME ON!

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.663
GET READY TO LOSE.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.931
I DRAW!

00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:02.469
AND SUMMON MAD RELOADER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.106
AND THEN I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.274
HMM.

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:08.708
HEH HEH HEH!

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:09.876
Jaden, thinking:
I GOTTA FIND MARCEL

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:13.180
BEFORE HE GETS THOSE
SACRED BEASTS.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.582
DUEL.
DUEL.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.617

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.086

Bastion: NOW REMEMBER
WHAT EISENSTEIN SAID.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.706
WE NEED TO GET
TO THE TENNIS COURTS!

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.141

I'M FINALLY GONNA MEET

DON'T GET PAST
THE DUEL GHOULS!

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.418
MUST DUEL.

WE'VE GOTTA REACH

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.968
OR WE'LL ALL BE
DUEL GHOULS!

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.636
COME ON,
PICK UP THE PACE.

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:11.571
Alexis: I DON'T THINK I CAN
RUN ANY FASTER!

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.206
DUEL.

MON DIEU!
WE'RE DONE FOR!

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.383
WE'RE
THE GROWN-UPS.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.818
WE HAVE TO ACT
LIKE IT.

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.219
NOW WE HAVE TO
STALL THESE GHOULS

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.787
SO THE KIDS
HAVE A CHANCE.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.723
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP
AND DUEL.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.125
ALRIGHT, SHOW

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.328
YOU BUNCH
OF MINDLESS
DROOLING BRATS.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.365
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF DUEL GHOULS.

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.767
IT'S NOT AS
THOUGH THEY'LL GET
THEIR FEELINGS HURT.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.402
WILL YOU BE OK?

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.837
WE WILL BE FINE.

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.405
I'LL BE HERE WITH HIM.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.640
WE'RE GONNA GIVE
THOSE GHOULS

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.508
A DOUBLE DOSE OF DET--

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:51.478
BONAPARTE,
YOU CANNOT STAY
AND DUEL WITH ME.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.246
FOR YOU SEE, YOU
MUST GET THE KIDS

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.848
TO THE TENNIS
COURTS.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.549
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.852
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.887
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.689
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL
THESE GHOULS

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.724
IN THE ART
OF DUELING!

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.362
IT'S TIME.
NOW OFF YOU ALL GO!

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.164

Pegasus: ECHO,
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.554
Echo: DON'T TAKE
ANOTHER STEP, PAL!

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.423
I'M SERIOUS, PEGASUS!

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.224
TAKE YOUR MEN

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.660
OR THIS TABLET'S
REALLY GONNA BE HISTORY.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.629
OK, NOW, LET'S
TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.898
YOU CAN'T DESTROY
THE TABLET.

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.766
HEAR ME OUT.
IF YOU EVER
WANT TO SEE

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.569
YOUR FRIEND AGAIN,
YOU MUST
RETHINK THIS.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.104
THERE'S NOTHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.007
THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T
WANT HIM TO COME BACK.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:56.509
BUT WHY!?

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.178
IT'S MY TURN.

00:07:58.178 --> 00:07:59.646
I DRAW.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.816
NOW I ACTIVATE
A SPELL CARD--
SUMMON CLOUD.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.018
WITH IT I CAN
CALL UP A LEVEL
4-OR-BELOW

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.953
CLOUDIAN MONSTER
FROM MY HAND.

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:09.389
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A STORM BREWING.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.391
AND SPEAKING
A'STORMS,

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.626
THIS NEXT MOVE'S
GONNA BLOW YOU AWAY.

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:16.162
FIRST I'M GONNA PLAY
CLOUDIAN SHEEP CLOUD!

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:23.103
AND THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE EXPLODING CLOUD
SPELL CARD.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:24.604
NOW I CAN DESTROY
ONE MONSTER

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:26.139
ON THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:30.176
AND THEN TAKE DAMAGE
EQUAL TO THAT CARD'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.445
WITH MY SHEEP CLOUD
HAVING ZERO
ATTACK POINTS,

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.148
I'M SAFE 'CAUSE MY LIFE
POINTS TAKE NO DAMAGE.

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:36.750
BUT WITH SHEEP CLOUD
COUNTING SHEEP

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.353
IN MY GRAVEYARD,
I CAN SUMMON TWO
SHEEP CLOUD TOKENS,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.356
AND AFTER THAT,
I'LL SACRIFICE
BOTH CLOUD TOKENS

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.891
TO CALL FORTH...

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.094
CLOUDIAN EYE
OF THE TYPHOON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:54.467
NOW, EYE OF THE TYPHOON,
ATTACK HIS MAD RELOADER!

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.781
YA SEE, WHEN EYE
OF THE TYPHOON SENDS
A STORM ONTO THE FIELD,

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.383
IT SWITCHES
EVERY MONSTER'S
BATTLE POSITION.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.886
SO NOW YOUR
RELOADER'S
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.587
SO I'LL ATTACK.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.057
GO PERFECT STORM!

00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.731
NICE MOVE BUT WHEN
RELOADER GETS DESTROYED
IN BATTLE,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.733
I'M ALLOWED TO TAKE
TWO CARDS FROM MY HAND,

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:30.637
SEND 'EM TO MY DECK,
AND THEN DRAW
TWO NEW CARDS.

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.105
AND THEN I HAVE TO
REDUCE

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.374
MY EYE OF THE TYPHOON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:36.810
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.612
FINALLY I PLAY
A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:43.216
WELL PLAYED,
JUST AS I HAD EXPECTED.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.952
I KNEW THIS DUEL WOULD BE
A GREAT CHALLENGE.

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:48.121
YOUR WISH TO ACQUIRE
THE SACRED BEASTS

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.390
HAS YOU FOCUSED
MORE THAN EVER.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.725
BUT WHY DO YOU
NEED SUCH POWER?

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.527
WHAT CAN YOU
HOPE TO GAIN?

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.796
PERHAPS IT'S NOT WHAT
THE POWER CAN GIVE YOU

00:09:56.796 --> 00:10:01.201
BUT RATHER WHAT THE POWER
CAN REPLACE.

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:02.869
Adrian: BEFORE
YOU WERE BORN,

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:05.205
I WAS HEIR
TO THE COMPANY.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:07.240
BUT NOW
I'M A NOBODY.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.275
ADRIAN, THAT'S
NOT TRUE.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:13.413
Marcel: BUT IT WAS TRUE,
AND YET YOU CHOSE
TO STAND BY HIS SIDE

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:16.983
AND DO ALL THAT
AN OLDER BROTHER SHOULD DO.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.786
YOU VOWED NEVER TO
HOLD IT AGAINST HIM.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.289
IT WAS SO GOOD
OF YOU BOTTLE UP
YOUR TRUE FEELINGS.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:27.494
AND IT'S SO CLEAR NOW
WHY YOU'RE FIGHTING
SO HARD FOR THIS POWER.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.762
YOU'VE BEEN SECOND BEST
ALL YOUR LIFE.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:32.532
AND NOW YOU WANT TO
BE NUMBER ONE.

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:35.802
IT'S JUST TOO BAD
THAT IT WILL LEAD
TO YOUR UNDOING.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.471
THE ONLY UNDOING
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
PLACE DOWN HERE

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:42.442
IS ME UNDOING THE SEAL
THAT CONTAINS THOSE
SACRED BEASTS!

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.324
I'M WARNING YOU, PEGASUS.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.528
IF YOU OR ANY
OF YOUR HENCHMEN
TAKE A STEP CLOSER,

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:05.098
I'M GONNA TURN THIS
RAINBOW DRAGON TABLET
INTO A PILE OF RUBBLE!

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:08.902
UNDERSTOOD.
BUT WHY RISK YOUR
FRIEND'S SAFE RETURN?

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.470
BECAUSE IN THIS WORLD,
POOR ADRIAN

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.438
WILL NEVER
TRULY BE HAPPY.

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.507
I HAVE BEEN HIS CLOSEST
FRIEND ALL HIS LIFE,

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.577
AND I KNOW THAT
HE IS BETTER OFF
IF HE NEVER RETURNS.

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:19.012
WHATEVER DO
YOU MEAN?

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.847
WHY WOULD ANYONE
BE BETTER OFF?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.216
PLEASE, YOU MUST
LISTEN TO REASON!

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:26.452
NO! YOU SEE,
IF ADRIAN COMES BACK,

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:27.720
NOTHING CHANGES.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.722
HE GOES ON AS NORMAL.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.891
AND WHAT'S SO
WRONG WITH THAT?

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.893
HE WAS NOT
BORN TO SERVE.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.196
ADRIAN
WAS BORN TO RULE.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.565
COURAGE, INTELLIGENCE,
AND HONOR--

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:39.866
NOBODY HAS MORE,

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.834
AND NOBODY IS MORE
UNDERAPPRECIATED.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.169
HE HAS SUCH VALUE!

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.171
ADRIAN CAN'T SEE,
BUT HE--

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:47.373
HE SHOULD HEAD
THE GECKO FINANCIAL GROUP.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:52.278
AND THEN ONE DAY,
HE CAN RULE
THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.782
OK. I WAS KIND OF WITH YOU
UNTIL THAT LAST BIT.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:57.951
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:00.186
THE WORLD NEEDS
PEOPLE LIKE ADRIAN.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.689
HE'S A BORN LEADER,
AND HE KNOWS IT,

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.924
BUT STILL, HE STEPS DOWN.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.459
HE SWALLOWS HIS PRIDE.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.229
HE DOES EVERYTHING HIS
FAMILY TELLS HIM TO.

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.565
AND THEN IN RETURN,
HE ASKS FOR NOTHING FROM THEM.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.734
AS LONG AS HE IS SECOND
IN LINE IN THIS WORLD,

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.703
ADRIAN WILL BE
ALWAYS BE OVERLOOKED.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:19.105
HE'LL NEVER BE AS
GOOD AS HE CAN BE.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.207
HE'S GOT TO LEARN TO
PUT HIMSELF FIRST.

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:22.742
IT'S FOR HIS OWN GOOD,

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.978
WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T
LET HIM RETURN HERE.

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:28.615
IT'S HIS CHOICE.

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:31.884
HE'S CONFUSED,
HIS CHOICES ARE IRRATIONAL.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.886
ONCE HIS BROTHER WAS SICK,

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.455
AND NONE OF THE DOCTORS
COULD FIGURE OUT

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:36.723
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH HIM,

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.158
BUT ADRIAN DID
BECAUSE HE'S
BRILLIANT.

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:41.461
HE COULD HAVE
DONE NOTHING.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:43.863
WITH HIS BROTHER SICK,
HE WOULD'VE ONCE AGAIN
BECOME HEIR

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.198
TO THE GECKO FAMILY.

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:46.633
BUT INSTEAD...

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:47.867
Adrian: I NEED TO SAVE
MY BROTHER.

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:48.901
I KNOW WHAT'S
WRONG WITH HIM,

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.671
BUT THEY WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.807
I BEG YOU--THE LIST
OF MEDICINES I GAVE YOU.

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:56.843
LET ME HAVE THEM, PLEASE.

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.478
MY BROTHER NEEDS THEM.

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.880
WITHOUT THEM,
HE WILL ONLY GET WORSE.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.549
PLEASE. YOU MUST HELP ME.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.493
YOU'RE AWAKE!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OK.

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:19.732
HE COULD HAVE HAD IT--

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.335
THE GECKO COMPANY,
THE WHOLE WORLD--

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:24.270
BUT HE'S HIS
OWN WORST ENEMY,

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.839
WHICH IS WHY HE CAN
NEVER COME BACK HERE.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.174
WHERE WERE WE?

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:30.243
AH, YES.
IT'S MY TURN,

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.413
AND I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN,
AND THAT'S IT.

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:36.082
ADRIAN, IF YOU WANT POWER,
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT.

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:38.318
IN YOUR WORLD, THEY'VE
DENIED YOU THE GLORY

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.919
YOU DESERVE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.088
BUT WE'RE NOT
IN YOUR WORLD ANYMORE.

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.556
WE'RE IN MY MINE.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.824
AND I'M THE ONLY THING
STANDING

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.060
BETWEEN YOU
AND TRUE POWER.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.494
HOLD NOTHING BACK!

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.564
BEAT ME IF YOU CAN!

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.634
I WON'T LET YOU USE
THIS TABLET, PEGASUS.

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.836
DESTROYING IT IS
THE ONLY GUARANTEE I HAVE

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.638
OF ENSURING ADRIAN
A BETTER LIFE.

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:01.774
SO SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR
PRECIOUS RAINBOW DRAGON!

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:02.775
DON'T DO IT!

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:04.744
DROP THE REMOTE.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.612
ON MY MARK!

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.348
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.551
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING,
I'M NOT PLAYING AROUND!

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.186
NOW!

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:19.192
THAT'S HOW IT'S
DONE, BOYS!

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.664
PEGASUS!
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY!

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:26.799
I'M SORRY, ADRIAN!

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.070
MY TURN!

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.538
READY?!

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.574
WITH THIS BEING
THE STANDBY PHASE,

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:36.175
I MUST TAKE A CARD
FROM MY HAND

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.944
AND SEND IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.747
OR ELSE SUMMON CLOUD
GETS DESTROYED,
BUT YA KNOW?

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.482
I THINK IT'S
SERVED ITS PURPOSE.

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.217
SO I'LL LET THIS
CLOUD DISSIPATE

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.752
AND KEEP
ALL MY CARDS.

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:47.320
NOW THAT I'VE
CLEARED THE AIR,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.022
I THINK IT'S ONLY
FAIR FOR YOU TO DO
SO AS WELL.

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:52.225
SO FESS UP!
WHO ARE YOU AFTER?

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.860
HAS EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE ALL BEEN

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.894
ABOUT
GETTING REVENGE?

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:55.895
TELL ME!

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.230
HEH HEH HEH!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.498
FINE, DON'T TALK.

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:00.366
LET'S SEE IF EYE
OF THE TYPHOON,

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.968
CAN GET SOME ANSWERS!

00:15:01.968 --> 00:15:05.338
GO! PERFECT STORM!

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:07.106
THANKS FOR
THE PLEASANT BREEZE!

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:11.444
BUT MY NEXT MOVE
WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:14.280
I'LL START BY REVEALING
MY TWO FACEDOWN CARDS

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.550
WHICH HAPPEN TO BOTH
BE BREAK THE SEAL
SPELL CARDS.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.953
NOW BY SENDING 'EM
BOTH TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:24.123
I CAN ADD A CARD TO MY HAND
AS LONG AS IT HAS

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.159
THE FORBIDDEN ONE
IN ITS NAME.

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.627
BLOWN AWAY YET?

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:30.096
FORBIDDEN ONE?!
NO WAY!

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.764
YOU'RE GONNA
SUMMON EXODIA?

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.372
WHAT?
WHAT IS THAT?!

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.810
WHAT'S HAPPENING!?

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.147
THE SACRED BEASTS
HAVE ESCAPED!

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.149
WHAT?
WE GOT TROUBLE!

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.484
[GROWLING]

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:07.266
THE SACRED BEASTS
ARE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:10.036
ESPECIALLY AROUND
THEIR NEW MASTER.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:14.273
BUT DON'T WORRY,
THE SEAL HASN'T BEEN
BROKEN YET,

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.642
SO THEY CAN'T
STAY AROUND TOO LONG.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:20.179
JUST LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE
YOU A WHIFF OF THEIR
AWESOME POWER.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.381
[THINKING]
WHAT I SMELL IS
A RAT,

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.350
BUT SO HARD
TO RESIST.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.552
NOW THEN, BACK
INTO YOUR CAGES

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:29.455
UNTIL I SAY SO,
MY PETS.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:39.765
I THINK YOU'RE
SAFE NOW.

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.535
WAIT. HOLD UP!

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:43.669
WE'RE NOT DONE!

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.838
LET'S FINISH THIS!

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.975
AAH!

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.512
IF YOU HAD DRAWN
ONE MORE CARD

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.046
BY USING BREAK
THE SEAL,

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.748
YOU WOULD'VE
COMPLETED EXODIA!

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:58.518
AND YOU WOULD HAVE
WON THE DUEL.

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.222
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.825
BUT THIS DUEL WASN'T
ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING.

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.994
IT WAS TO SEE WHAT
YOU WERE MADE OF.

00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.729
NOW I CAN STILL GIVE YOU
WHAT I PROMISED,

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.664
BUT YOU MUST WORK WITH ME
AND NOT AGAINST ME.

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:14.567
THREE SACRED BEASTS,
BREAK YOUR SEAL!

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:34.186
MY TURN.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.058
MAN! HUH?

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:46.966
EVERYONE, ATTACK JADEN
AT THE SAME TIME!

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.204
[CHIRPS]

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:54.040
[GROANS]

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.909
WHAT A SWEET MOVE,
WINGED KURIBOH!

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.378
NOW LET'S GET
OUTTA HERE!

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.280
WAIT UP!

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.950
SORRY, SY!
GOTTA SAVE THE WORLD!

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.652
AW, MAN.
I CAN'T SEE.

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:07.920
JADEN'S ESCAPING.

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.658
WE MADE IT TO
THE TENNIS COURTS!

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:13.993
IT'S ALL CLEAR.

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:16.262
PERFECT. LET'S GET
A MOVE ON, GUYS!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.297
THERE'S NO TIME
TO WASTE HERE!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.769
AH! THIS IS THE INTERDIMENSIONAL
DUEL SYSTEM!

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.471
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
THIS THING.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.039
WHAT'S IT
DOING HERE?

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.140
WE, UH...

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.875
SORT OF BORROWED IT
FROM KAIBACORP

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.544
FOR EXPERIMENTAL
PURPOSES.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:33.145
THE KIND I CAN'T
REALLY TALK ABOUT.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.281
NOW THE CONTROL CONSOLE
IS OVER THERE.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.083
NO WONDER EISENSTEIN
CHOSE THIS PLACE.

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:39.418
NOW LET'S SEE IF WE
CAN MAKE CONTACT.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.653
ALRIGHT, PEOPLE--

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:42.221
LET ME GET THIS
THING UP AND RUNNING.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.589
WHAT SHOULD
WE DO?

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.124
BASTION!
YOU NEED HELP?

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.826
LET'S GET THIS
INTO POSITION.

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:48.194
LEND US A HAND,
CHANCELLOR.

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:51.564
UH, YES, OF COURSE!

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:54.934
PROFESSOR EISENSTEIN!
COME IN!

00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:56.769
WE'VE MADE IT SAFELY
TO THE TENNIS COURTS.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:58.004
Eisenstein:
GOOD! VEMEMBAH,

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.773
ZHESE MACHINES

00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:03.075
AND HARNESS DUEL ENERGY
INTO A VIABLE POWER SOURCE.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.678
VE MUST SYNCHRONIZE
OUR SYSTEMS IN ORDER

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:06.979
TO CONNECT
OUR DIMENSIONS!

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.414
YOU REALLY THINK
THIS WILL WORK?

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:09.548
IT BETTER.

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:10.816
IT WILL!

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.485
GOOD LUCK!

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.887
Hassleberry:
SHE'S GOOD T' GO!

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.823

GOOD, ZEN!

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:45.184
LET'S BE QUICK.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.219
TRANS-DIMENSIONAL
PORTALS ARE QUITE FICKLE!

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.521
READY?

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:56.629
WE'RE IN POSITION.

00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:00.299
JESSE'S DUELING
ON OUR END.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.401
AND WHO IS GOING TO
BE HIS OPPONENT?

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.603
ASTER, WILL IT BE YOU?

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:06.005
WE CHOSE
SOMEONE ELSE.

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.907
WE NEEDED A DUELIST
WHO WOULD GENERATE

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:10.776
ENOUGH ENERGY TO MAKE
THIS PORTAL BIG ENOUGH.

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.845
THE DECISION HERE
WAS UNANIMOUS.

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:18.017
WE REALIZED WE HAD TO FIND
SOMEONE WITH A COMPETITIVE
FIRE UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:21.120
WE NEEDED SOMEBODY THAT
DUELS TO WIN AND ONLY WIN.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.988
SOMEONE WHO DUELS
WITH PASSION,

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.724
FEROCITY, AND FERVOR.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.559
AND ONLY ONE MAN
FIT THE BILL.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.895
HE'S READY AND WAITING
FOR YOU, JESSE!

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.330
IT'S ZANE!

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.998

ANDERSON! WE CAN'T HOLD
ANYTHING BACK!

00:20:46.846 --> 00:20:49.048
THE ONLY WAY TO GENERATE
ENOUGH ENERGY

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:51.383
IS TO DUEL LIKE
WE'RE MORTAL ENEMIES!

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.019
