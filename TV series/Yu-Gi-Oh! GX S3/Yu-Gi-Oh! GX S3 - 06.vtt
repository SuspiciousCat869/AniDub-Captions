BUT YOU MIGHT
WANNA STAND BACK.

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.119
I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET THROUGH TO HIM,

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.922
AND I CAN'T BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR
FRIEND'S ACTIONS!

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.590

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:38.825

HE SACRIFICED GILASAURUS!

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.211
AND USED IT TO BRING
OUT DARK DRICERATOPS!

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:00.380
YAAH!

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.584
WATCHING HIM DUEL LIKE

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.953
YES, SIR.
I RECKON HAVING
DINOSAUR DNA

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:08.822
WOULD BE KINDA COOL.

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.191
THIS DUEL'S AWESOME!
THIS DUEL'S AWESOME!

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.760
[THINKING]
I'VE GOT IT!
IF I WANT TO TAP

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:15.495
INTO HASSLEBERRY'S
PRIMITIVE ENERGY,

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:20.000
I'VE GOTTA USE
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST
AS PRIMITIVE AS HE IS!

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:21.968
MY GO!

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.404
JUST THE CARD I NEED!

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.240
ALRIGHT... NOW I SUMMON...

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.776
MY FLINT CRAGGER!

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:32.612
NEXT I'LL SEND HIM OFF
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.916
BUT NOT BEFORE HE DOES
FIVE HUNDRED POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.452
ERR!

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.592
WHAT IN SAM HILL
DID YOU DO THAT FOR!?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.694
HASSLEBERRY'S
BACK TO NORMAL!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.696
MAYBE...

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:51.598
DEPENDS ON YOUR
DEFINITION OF "NORMAL"!

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.266
SHOW SOME RESPECT!

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.634
DROP AND GIVE ME
TWENTY!

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:55.935
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE,

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:57.604
A GUY WHO THINKS
HE'S A DINOSAUR...

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:00.173
OR A GUY WHO THINKS
HE'S AN OBNOXIOUS
DRILL SERGEANT!

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:03.143
[THINKING]
LITTLE TO THEY KNOW
THAT THE REAL REASON

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.211
I SENT MY FLINT CRAGGER
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.781
WAS SO I COULD UNLEASH
A DEVASTATING SPELL!

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:11.785
IT'S THE PERFECT WEAPON
AGAINST A DINO DUELIST!

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.355
I PLAY FOSSIL FUSION!

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:17.357
FOSSIL WHAT NOW?

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:19.459
AND YOU CLAIM TO BE
A DINOSAUR EXPERT?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.161
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.729
ERR!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.898
FOSSIL FUSION TAKES
A MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.167
AND FUSES IT
WITH ONE FROM YOURS!

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.003
[RUMBLING]

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.639
OHH! HOLD ME!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.180
I EXCAVATE THE REMAINS
OF YOUR GILASAURUS

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.182
AND MY FLINT CRAGGER!

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:45.318
THEN I COMBINE THEM TOGETHER
TO FORM A NEW FOSSIL!

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.223
FROM THE DEPTHS
OF THE EARTH...

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.226
IT'S FOSSIL DRAGON
SKULLGAR!

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:55.829
WELL I'LL BE!

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.731
WHO KNEW YOU COULD MIX
AND MATCH YOUR FOSSILS

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:01.634
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEVER TOOK
INTRO TO ARCHEOLOGICAL DUELING!

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.204
UNEARTHING FOSSILS
IS LESSON ONE!

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:06.940
I LIKED THAT COURSE
SO MUCH I TOOK IT TWICE!

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:08.908
GOT AN "A" BOTH TIMES.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:10.610
BUT YOU COULD
PROBABLY TELL.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:13.379
ERR! LOOK, I DON'T
NEED SOME CLASS!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.849
I DUEL USING
MY PRIMAL INSTINCTS!

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.585
[ROARS]

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:24.757
[ROARS]

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:26.626
IN YOUR FACE!

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.365
NOOO!

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.700
"INSTINCTS" YOU SAY?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.135
IF I DUELED LIKE YOU...

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:36.569
I'D HIT THE BOOKS!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.605
HEY! ERR!

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.107
YOU MAY KNOW
MORE FACTS
THAN I DO...

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.610
BUT I'VE GOT
ONE THING
YOU HAVEN'T GOT!

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.279
DINO DNA! ERR!

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.281
AND DO YOU
KNOW WHAT?

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.950
THAT'S SOMETHIN'
YOU CAN'T GET
FROM SOME TEXT BOOK!

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:55.455
BUT YOUR ABOUT TO
SEE THAT FIRST HAND,
CROC-BOY!

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.696

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.532
ATTEN-TION!

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.099

[CHIRPS]

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.944
[THINKING]
THAT LITTLE PUP
ONLY HAS 500 POINTS.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:19.946
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.782
NEXT I ACTIVATE
JURASSIC WORLD!

THANKS TO THE SUDDEN
CHANGE IN OUR NATURAL
SURROUNDINGS...

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.994
MY LITTLE PAL
HERE GETS A BOOST.

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.197
[THINKING]
THAT WASN'T
TOO IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.232
[THINKING]
I BET HE WAS
REAL IMPRESSED!

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:41.201
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE...

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:42.669

CRIKEY!

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:45.772

FOR A DINOSAUR
ENTHUSIAST

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.035
HE JUST DESTROYED
HIS OWN CARDS, TOO!

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:17.770
HE DID WHAT!?

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.038
I GUESS HE'S
STILL OUT OF IT!

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.007
NO, GUYS.
IT'S PART OF HIS PLAN.

00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:23.042
Hassleberry:
HE'S RIGHT!

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:25.378

[ROARS]

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:41.894
I UNDERESTIMATED
THIS BLOKE.

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.330
HE MAY NOT HAVE
THE TRAINING THAT I DO...

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:46.833
BUT HIS INSTINCTS ARE
THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN!

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.269
IT'S TIME I TAMED
THIS WILD BEAST.

BUT THEY DON'T
GET TO ATTACK,
LIKE MINE DOES.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.001
IT'S JUST
THE OPPOSITE!

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:37.236
THEY GO RIGHT BACK
TO YOUR HAND!

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.071

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.991
ALRIGHT, BRACHYON!
ENGAGE THE ENEMY!

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.161
[ROARS]

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.169
SHIRLEY!
YOU ALRIGHT!?

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:12.772
HEY, HASSLEBERRY!
SWEET MOVE, BRO!

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:15.274
YOU SAID IT!
THAT WAS AWESOME!

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.276
HOLD ON, GUYS.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.045
DID YOU FORGET
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:20.480
THE WEIRD ENERGY WAVES?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.150
OF COURSE YOU DID.
YOU'RE EXACTLY ALIKE.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.619
Both: WE ARE?
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?!

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.689
SINCE I USED MY CARD
OF VARIATION
THIS TURN...

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.325
I HAVE TO SEND ONE CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.994
SO, SABERSAURUS,
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.931
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
AN ENDANGERED
SPECIES, JIMBO!

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.501
[THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT.
IF I DON'T GET RID

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.936
OF HIS HIGH-LEVEL MONSTERS,
HE'S GONNA BURY ME!

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:47.406
WAIT! THAT'S IT!

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.775
HERE GOES.

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:53.880
FIRST, I'LL BID SAMPLE
FOSSIL "HOOROO."

00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:55.882
THIS LETS ME PLAY...

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.316
SPECIMEN INSPECTION!

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.986
SO I GET TO PICK
A MONSTER TYPE
AND A LEVEL,

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.321
AND IF YOU HAVE
A CARD THAT MATCHES...

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.724
IT GOES FROM YOUR HAND
OR DECK TO THE GRAVE!

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:06.726
COME AGAIN?

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:08.561
BASICALLY YOU LOSE ONE
OF YOUR BEST MONSTERS!

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.497
WHAT!?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.668
PICK A CARD, MATE!

00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:17.904
[GROWLS]

00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:20.640
ULTIMATE TYRANNO...

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.441
GUESS I'LL
DISCHARGE YOU.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.110
HOOROO TO THAT...

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.444
AND G'DAY TO THIS!

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:26.679
IT'S MY FOSSIL FUSION!

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.915
SO I CAN EXHUME
MY SAMPLE FOSSIL

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.218
AND YOUR TYRANNO
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.289
THEN I FUSE THEM
IN ORDER TO MAKE...

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.157
THIS BLOKE!

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.392
THE ONE AND ONLY...

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.295
FOSSIL DRAGON SKULLGIOS!

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.431
[GROWLS]

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:47.433
FOR A BUNCH OF OLD BONES,

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:48.901
THAT THING LOOKS
PRETTY TOUGH!

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:50.670
I'M WITH YOU, SY.
IT'S OVER.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:52.672
NO WAY.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.874
IT'S NOT OVER 'TIL
THE LAST CARD IS PLAYED.

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:58.578
ALRIGHT, LET'S
SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:00.413
A WHOLE LOT, SON!

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:02.682
AND I'LL START...
WITH MY BRACHYON!

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:04.850
SINCE THERE'S
A MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.787
HE SWITCHES
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:09.789
THAT WAS A RIPPER!

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.357
GOOD ON 'YA!

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.160
[THINKING]
HE MAY TALK FUNNY,
BUT HE DUELS LIKE A PRO.

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:16.162
I HELD HIM OFF
FOR NOW...

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:19.765
BUT TO WIN THIS WAR,
I GOTTA CALL IN
MY RESERVES!

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.767
BOG IN, GIRL!

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.603
[ROARS]

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.739
[ROARS]

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.808
WAIT!

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:32.745
NOW, WHY'D HE STOP?

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.081
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT MY FOSSIL DRAGON

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.883
HAS A SPECIAL ABILITY
YOU MIGHT WANNA KNOW ABOUT!

00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.086
EVEN THOUGH IT'S
IN DEFENSE MODE...

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.421
GET THIS: YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:43.990
ARE DEDUCTED FROM MINE

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.625
AND TAKEN OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.294
THAT'S A TOTAL
OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED POINTS...

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.496
WHICH IS ALL
YOU HAVE LEFT!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.799
DON'T SPIT
THE DUMMY...

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.701
BUT I WIN!

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.705
[ROARS]
[ROARS]

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.048

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.460
Jesse:
HASSLEBERRY!

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:22.028
Jaden: JIM!

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.629
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.264
SOMETHIN' SUCKED

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:26.799
I THINK I KNOW WHAT.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.300
IT'S THIS BIOBAND.

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:30.636
I COULD SWEAR
WHEN THE DUEL ENDED,

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.439
THEY ACTIVATED AND SOMEHOW
LEFT US FEELING STUFFED.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.574
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, MATE.

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:38.310
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE
ME A SNOOZER.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:41.747
AHHH... A FIRM MATTRESS.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.916

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:50.423
SURE SOUNDS LIKE IT!

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:52.725
[JIM AND HASSLEBERRY SNORING]

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.228
AW... THEY'RE
PURRIN' LIKE KITTENS.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.937
[THINKING]
THESE STUDENTS SEEM TO

00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:08.841
AND I'M HAPPY TO
TAKE IT ALL AWAY!

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.477
