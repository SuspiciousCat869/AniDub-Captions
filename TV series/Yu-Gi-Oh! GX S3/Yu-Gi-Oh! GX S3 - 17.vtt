00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.808
SO I GUESS WE SHOULD HEAD
BACK TO DUEL ACADEMY.

00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:42.809
HUH?
HUH?

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.581
Jim: SCORPIONS!

00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:48.982
WELL, THEY'RE ABOUT
TO GET CRUSHED!

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:50.784
HERE GOES!

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.186
I PLAY CLAYMAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:56.456
Jesse: THEY'RE RETREATIN'!

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.791
Axel: NOW'S OUR CHANCE!

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.059
LET'S MAKE A RUN FOR IT!

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.536
I RECKON'
WE'RE SAFE NOW.

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:11.338
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT!

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:14.007
BEHOLD 8-CLAWS SCORPION!

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:19.613
AND NOW I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD
BOOK OF MOON!

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:22.449
WHICH TURNS YOUR
CLAYMAN INTO PUTTY!

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:25.352
GUYS, I THINK
OUR CHANCES...

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:27.921
JUST TOOK A TURN
FOR THE WORSE!

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:29.322
OHH!

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.124
8-CLAWS SCORPION
IS OUT THERE!

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:33.427
AND WITH YOUR CLAYMAN
UPSIDE DOWN,

00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:35.128
THAT MEANS SCORPION'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.063
ARE GONNA INCREASE
BY 2,100!

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:40.834
OH, NO! WITH
THAT MANY ATTACK POINTS,
CLAYMAN'S HISTORY,

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.003

LIKE WE ARE TOO!

MIGHT CHANGE ALL THAT.

00:17:52.601 --> 00:17:54.036
THEIR FATE IS SEALED!

00:17:54.036 --> 00:17:56.305
COME FORTH, SAND DOODLEBUG!

00:17:57.806 --> 00:18:00.509
LET'S SEE HOW THIS SUB
WORKS UNDER THE OCEAN OF SAND

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:02.845
THAT'S ABOUT
TO CRASH DOWN UPON YOU!

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.649
CRIKEY!
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD!

00:18:06.649 --> 00:18:08.017
WE'RE SINKING!

00:18:08.017 --> 00:18:09.018
BUT HOW?

00:18:13.188 --> 00:18:15.524
NO TIME TO WASTE!
WE GOTTA MOVE!

00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:19.161
THIS WAY!

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.599
HEY, YOU THINK THIS
SUBMARINE HAS A BACKDOOR

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:25.267
OR AN EMERGENCY EXIT?

00:18:25.267 --> 00:18:29.505
NEGATIVE! THE ONLY
WAY TO GET OUT IS
THE SAME WAY WE GOT IN!

00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:31.073
RIGHT, NOW THAT
DOESN'T LEAVE US

00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:33.409

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.914
I WONDER IF THIS SUB
HAS THOSE TORPEDO
THINGIES DOWN HERE?
