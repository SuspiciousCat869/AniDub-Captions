AND FIND
THE SUPREME KING.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.877
HOPEFULLY, IF I DUEL HIM
AND DEFEAT HIM,

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.846
THE DARKNESS CONTROLLING
JADEN WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.314
Zane: EVER SINCE
I CAME HERE,

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.217
I'VE BEEN ITCHING TO CRACK
MY KNUCKLES AGAINST
A STRONG DUELIST.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.653

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:40.160

NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A MEETING OF THE MINDS.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:56.209
AND THIS IS WHAT
WE CALL THE END!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.790
JADEN! I KNOW
THERE'S STILL GOOD
INSIDE YOU.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.592
JUST LISTEN.
I CAN HELP YOU
COME BACK.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.329

EXISTS INSIDE THIS BODY.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.331

I SAW THE GOOD IN YOU

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.468
WISHING HE COULD
MAKE THINGS RIGHT,
AND I'M GONNA HELP!

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.570
YOU CAN DO
ALL YOU WANT,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.639
BUT YOU WILL FAIL
IN THE END.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.175
MANY HAVE TRIED,
AND YET NONE HAVE
SUCCEEDED.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:30.711
THERE IS NO POWER THAT
CAN DEFEAT THE DARKNESS.

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.946
YES, THERE IS,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.681
WITH THE HELP OF
THE ORICHALCUM.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.383
THAT EYE WON'T
SHOW ME A THING.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.852
YOU'RE WRONG,
AND I AIM TO
PROVE IT TO YOU.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.854
YOUR FRIEND JIM AIMED
TO PROVE IT, TOO,

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.790
AND I DISPATCHED HIM
AS I WILL YOU.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.728
WELL, THAT WAS THEN.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.763
AND THIS IS NOW.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.231
I PLAY
VOLCANIC SLICER

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.966
IN DEFENSE MODE.

[GROWLS]

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.002
WHEN THIS MONSTER'S
IN PLAY,

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.839
IT CAN SLICE OFF
500 LIFE POINTS
ONCE PER ROUND.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.080
NEXT I PLAY
A FACEDOWN

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.181
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.916
A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.653
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT REAL POWER FEELS LIKE.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.623
GO, WILD CYCLONE!

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.432
AND NOW
I PLAY A FACEDOWN

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.000
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.668
WELL THEN, I DRAW.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.240
FIRST I'M GONNA ACTIVATE
MY BLAZE ACCELERATOR

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.175
AND THEN SEND IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.610
DOING THIS
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.380
MY TRI-BLAZE ACCELERATOR
DIRECTLY TO MY FIELD.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.382
BUT THE FUN DOESN'T
STOP THERE.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.418
BY SENDING
ONE PYRO TYPE MONSTER
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.321
I CAN INFLICT
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.724
AND DESTROY ANY MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.793
SO I DISCARD
MY VOLCANIC HAMMERER

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.595
TO DESTROY
YOUR WILD CYCLONE.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:10.277
AND NEXT I'M ACTIVATING
THE SPELL CARD KNOWN AS

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.245
FIRE RECOVERY.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.880
NOW I CAN CHECK MY HAND

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.416
AND LOOK FOR A FIRE
ATTRIBUTE MONSTER.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.519
THEN, IF I SEND IT
DIRECTLY TO
MY GRAVEYARD,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.289
I CAN BRING BACK
VOLCANIC HAMMERER.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.492
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.961
MY HAMMERER COUNTS UP
EVERY VOLCANIC MONSTER

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.664
IN MY GRAVEYARD,
AND EACH ONE BURNS UP

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.566
200 OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.107
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU CAN'T ATTACK,

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.743
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
THE HEAT'S OFF
FOR THE TIME BEING.

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.046
SO IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.681
INDEED IT IS.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.015
AND I SUMMON...

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.618
THE SPELL
DARK CALLING!

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.354
WHEN THIS IS ACTIVATED,
I CAN REMOVE DARK FUSION

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.090
IN MY GRAVEYARD
FOR PLAY AND THEN

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.360
USE ITS ABILITY TO SUMMON
A FUSION MONSTER.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.529
NEXT I'LL FUSE
ELEMENTAL HEROES

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.631

TOGETHER

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.234
IN ORDER TO CALL FORTH

EVIL HERO
INFERNAL SNIPER.

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:12.505
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.907
WHEN IT'S IN
DEFENSE MODE,

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.976
IT DEALS 1,000
POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:17.410
AND CANNOT BE
DESTROYED BY

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.779
ANY SPELLS YOU MIGHT
FIRE MY WAY.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.782
BUT THEN... MY TRI-BLAZE
ACCELERATOR'S EFFECT

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:23.984
WON'T EVEN WORK.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.418

IT WILL PIERCE

AND FREE THE GOOD THAT
LIVES BEHIND THOSE EYES.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.119
YOUR HOPE IS
A WASTED ONE.

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.688
YOUR FRIEND JADEN IS
A THING OF THE PAST.

IS NOTHING BUT

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.336
DO YOU KNOW A BOY
NAMED JESSE?

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.638
[ALL]
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
ANYWHERE?

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.173
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I HAVE!

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:01.574
ARE YOU CERTAIN?

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.743
YOU CAN BET YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE WINGS I AM!

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:05.211
IT JUST SLIPPED MY MIND.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.813
UNTIL THIS VERY MOMENT.

00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.883
THEN...
HE MUST...
BE HERE!

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.651
SORRY TO
BREAK THIS UP--
[ALL] OH!

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:13.353
BUT HAVE YOU
SEEN AXEL?

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.954
I NEED TO FIND HIM.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.122
HE'S DUELING.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.524
HE'S DUELING?

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:18.758
WHO'S HE DUELING?

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:19.959
THE KING.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.628
WHA-- HOLD ON!

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:23.463
ARE YOU SAYING HE WENT
TO THE KING'S TOWER?

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:26.066
[ALL]
YES.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.201
I HAVE TO SEE THIS
WITH MY OWN EYES.

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.437
I SUMMON KITEROID!

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.641
WAIT FOR ME!

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.945
WHEN YOU HAPPEN UPON
YOUR FRIEND AXEL...

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.113
PROMISE TO TELL HIM...

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.481
THAT JESSE'S...

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.183
[ALL]
ALIVE!

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.618
AAH! I PROMISE!

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.056
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE SO CLOSE?

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:51.424
VICTORY IS
ALMOST YOURS,

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.326
BUT ONE THING
STANDS IN YOUR WAY,

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.161
AND THAT THING IS ME.

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:58.765
NOW I SUMMON EVIL HERO
INFERNAL PRODIGY.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.700
WITH NO MONSTERS
ON MY FIELD,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.102
I CAN SUMMON HIM
FROM MY HAND

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.637
AND PLACE HIM DIRECTLY
ONTO THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.307
AND NEXT,
I'LL SACRIFICE MY PRODIGY.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.776
TO BRING OUT
EVIL HERO...

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.344
MALICIOUS EDGE!

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.514
SINCE YOU HAVE
A MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD,

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:17.750
I ONLY NEED ONE SACRIFICE
TO CALL OUT THIS HERO.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.886
AND WHEN
MALICIOUS EDGE
ATTACKS YOU,

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:22.155
SHOULD YOU HAVE
A MONSTER IN
DEFENSE MODE,

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.958
IF THE DEFENSE POINTS ARE
LESS THAN ITS ATTACK POINTS,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.960
THE DIFFERENCE IS
DEALT TO YOU AS DAMAGE.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.928
IT SURE SOUNDS
GOOD ON PAPER.

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:33.133
HOWEVER, DOOMFIRE STILL
HAS MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN YOUR EVIL EDGE!

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.934
FOR THE TIME BEING,
IT DOES.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:37.770
SINCE MY PLASMA WAS SENT
DIRECTLY TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.806
I GET TO DRAW
ONE CARD.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:43.243
ONE CARD THAT WILL
LEAD TO YOUR END.

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:45.545
I PLAY VICIOUS CLAW,

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:48.448
AND EVIL HERO GETS
A 300 POINT ADVANTAGE.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:52.152
IN ADDITION, IF YOU DESTROY
MALICIOUS EDGE IN BATTLE,

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.454
VICIOUS CLAW GOES
BACK TO MY HAND,

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.089
AND MY EDGE IS SAVED.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.763
EVIL HERO, ATTACK
VOLCANIC HAMMERER!

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:11.037
GOTCHA!

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.973
YOU SEE, MY DOOMFIRE HAS
ITS OWN HIDDEN ABILITY.

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.441
WHEN YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACKING,

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.510
IT HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO DIRECTLY

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.712
AFTER MY VOLCANIC
DOOMFIRE.

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:20.980
NO WAY!

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:26.085
AAH!

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.122
I CAN DO THIS.

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.324
NOT AFTER MY
VICIOUS CLAW ACTIVATES.

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:34.027
NOT ONLY DOES
MALICIOUS EDGE
SURVIVE,

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.895
BUT HAMMERER IS
DESTROYED,

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.731
SENDING 600 POINTS
OF DAMAGE RIGHT TO YOU.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.902
AAH!

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.941
[THINKING]
IF I DON'T STEP UP,
HE'LL NEVER STEP DOWN.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.684
SYRUS, ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:59.352
QUIET!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.222
AAH!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.890
HA HA HA!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.692
YOU'LL NEVER
BEAT ME!

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.393
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.928
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:12.799
I ALWAYS FIND A WAY
TO PULL OUT A VICTORY.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.701
NOT THIS TIME,
THOUGH.

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:16.469
WELL, I'VE GOT
FOUR CARDS IN MY HAND

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.704
THAT SAY OTHERWISE,

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:20.340
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE SEE
WHO'S RIGHT OR WRONG?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.210
NOW COME FORTH,
MY MIGHTY CYBER
END DRAGON!

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:27.914
MY MOTH CAN'T FLUTTER
THROUGH THAT!

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.350
THEN I GUESS I WAS RIGHT,
AND YOU WERE WRONG!

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:34.087
GO,
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE!

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:39.058
AAH!

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.864
Syrus: ZANE!

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:47.467
NICE GET-UP.
LET'S GO.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.202
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:57.744
SUFFER THE WRATH
OF THE KING OF ARMAGEDDON!

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:01.180
WE SACRIFICE
2,000 LIFE POINTS

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.050
IN ORDER TO DESTROY
ALL OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.952
GO, LAMENT OF DEMISE!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.789
WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.325
LAST ROUND,
I ACTIVATED
THE SPELL CARD,

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:13.726
D FORCE.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:17.563
AND ITS EFFECT NEGATES
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:21.200
SO WHAT? WITH MORE ATTACK
POINTS, WE'RE STRONGER.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.502
[ROARS]

00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:24.003
I DON'T THINK SO,

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:27.607
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE
MY PLASMA COUNTER TRAP!

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:30.176
NOW BECAUSE MY D-FORCE
SPELL CARD WAS IN PLAY,

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.912
I CAN CUT YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS IN HALF

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.648
AND ADD 1,500
MORE TO MINE!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.350
HUH?

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.554
[ROARING]

00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:45.925
SO WHAT TOOK YA?

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.933
[THINKING]
I JUST KNOW THAT,
WITH EVERY LIFE POINT

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:57.236
THE KING LOSES,
THE CLOSER I AM TO
BRINGING JADEN BACK.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.508
AXEL, YOU WILL NEVER
DEFEAT THE DARKNESS.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.146
IT'S TOO POWERFUL
A FORCE.

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.748
[THINKING]
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, AXEL!

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:11.384
YOU CAN BREAK THROUGH
THE DARKNESS,
AND YOU WILL!

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.953
JUST STAY FOCUSED,
AND THE EYE WILL
SHOW YOU THE WAY!

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:18.491
I AM NOT LIKING THIS!

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.599
JADEN!

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.134
WE HAVE TO HELP!

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.403
STAY BACK!

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:32.505
THIS BATTLE IS
BETWEEN ME AND HIM!

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:35.141
Supreme King:
AND VICIOUS CLAW'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.076
BY DESTROYING IT,
AN EVIL TOKEN IS

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:39.779
SUMMONED ONTO
YOUR FIELD.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.048
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THAT?

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.483
ABSOLUTELY!

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:46.018
BECAUSE NEXT UP,
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD,

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:49.088
EVIL BLAST, WHICH ADDS
500 POINTS TO THAT TOKEN.

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.758
BUT DURING EACH
OF YOUR STANDBY PHASES,

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:56.062
MY TRAP CARD FORCES YOU
TO LOSE 500 OF YOUR
PRECIOUS LIFE POINTS.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.196
BUT THEN...

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.298
Zane: WITH AXEL
ONLY HAVING

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.534
500 LIFE POINTS
LEFT TO HIS NAME...

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:04.837
THE NEXT STANDBY PHASE
WILL BE THE END FOR HIM,

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.939
UNLESS HE'S ABLE TO
COME UP WITH A WAY OUT.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.040
[SIGHS]

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.410
AND NOW I PLAY
A FACEDOWN.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.345
THIS IS IT.
ONLY ONE OF US

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.147
WILL SURVIVE
THIS NEXT ROUND!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.422
THIS DUEL IS
ABOUT TO END.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.190
AXEL'S GONNA LOSE!

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.992
WAIT A SEC!
THE FAIRIES!

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:27.894
I NEVER TOLD AXEL
WHAT I TOLD THEM!

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.462
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME!

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:32.098
AXEL! JESSE WAS
SEEN ALIVE!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.167
YOU'RE CERTAIN?
MM-HMM!

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.803
I SAW HIM WITH
MY VERY OWN EYES!

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.138
HAH! JADEN!

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.474
JESSE IS ALIVE!

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:42.675
OH...

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:44.644
[ECHOING]
JESSE IS ALIVE!

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.647
JADEN!
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.449
YOUR FRIEND'S OKAY!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.118
HE'S THE REASON
WE'RE HERE, REMEMBER?

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.687
HE NEEDS YOU--
HE NEEDS YOU TO COME

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.590
FIND HIM AND BRING HIM BACK
SAFELY TO DUEL ACADEMY.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.359
[ECHOING]
YOUR FRIEND JESSE
NEEDS YOU!

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:04.130
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.265
THE SUPREME KING HAS
NO FRIENDS.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:07.834
MY ONLY ALLY
IS DARKNESS.

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:10.470
[THINKING]
I THOUGHT KNOWING
THAT JESSE WAS SAFE

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.071
WOULD BRING BACK
THE GOOD IN JADEN,

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.773
BUT I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO TRULY GET HIM BACK

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:16.042
IS TO SEND THE DARKNESS
TO THE STARS.

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:17.944
[SIGHS]
JADEN...

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:24.750
IS IT REALLY YOU?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.085
ALL RIGHT, JIM...

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:29.489
LET'S SAVE
OUR FRIEND!

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:32.325
THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, MATE.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.293
THIS IS THE CARD
I NEEDED.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.331
I PLAY THE SPELL
VOLCANIC CYCLONE!

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.133
NOW FOR EVERY
PYRO TYPE MONSTER
I SEND TO MY GRAVE,

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.003
THE SAME NUMBER
OF SPELL OR TRAP CARDS
THAT YOU HAVE IN PLAY

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.705
AUTOMATICALLY
GETS DESTROYED.

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:49.175
AND NOW, I'LL SEND
MY VOLCANIC COUNTER
TO MY GRAVE.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:52.011
IN RETURN,
YOUR EVIL BLAST
GETS DESTROYED!

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.616
ALL RIGHT!
NOW ALL OF AXEL'S

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:58.317
LIFE POINTS ARE
SAFE AND SOUND.

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.886
AND NOW I ATTACK!

00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.355
GO, VOLCANIC DOOMFIRE!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.824
OJAMA, I THINK
THIS MIGHT BE IT!

00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:06.826
NOT AFTER I PLAY
THIS FACEDOWN!

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.262
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:11.631
KNOWN AS
SUPER-POLYMERIZATION!

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:14.300
BY SENDING MY VICIOUS CLAW
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.369
I CAN FUSE
TWO MONSTERS TOGETHER.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.505
LIKE MALICIOUS EDGE
AND YOUR EVIL TOKEN.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.242
TOGETHER THEY FORM...

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.711
EVIL HERO
MALICIOUS FIEND!

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:33.886
OH, NO!
THAT EVIL FIEND

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.088
IS MORE POWERFUL
THAN AXEL'S MONSTER.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.630
[ALL]
AAH!

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.000
OH, NO! AAH!

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.104
HAAA!

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.773
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:55.608
YOU HAVE
NO LIFE POINTS!

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.443
THE DARKNESS LIVES,
AND YOUR FRIEND IS LOST--

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.679
AAH!
NOT SO FAST!

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.015
THE EFFECT OF MY VOLCANIC
COUNTER GETS TRIGGERED!

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.184
BECAUSE IT WAS SENT
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:07.420
YOU TAKE
THE SAME DAMAGE
THAT I DO.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.089
GAME OVER,
SUPREME KING!

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:17.730
AAH!

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:28.674
Jim:
JADEN? IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.877
THE DARKNESS IN YOU
HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:41.988
AAH!

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.395
AAH!

00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:51.397
AXEL!

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:57.436
THE POWER OF
THE ORICHALCUM
BROUGHT JADEN BACK.

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.472
PROMISE THAT YOU'LL
LOOK AFTER HIM.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.275
NO, AXEL!
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.911
THEY EACH RAN OUT OF
LIFE POINTS IN THE END.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.582
BOTH AXEL AND THE DARKNESS IN
JADEN WERE SENT TO THE STARS.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:14.120
LET'S HOPE SO.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.499
Monster: WHY DOES
THE SKY TURN RED?

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.367
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.935
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.371
THE SUPREME KING...

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.975
HAS BEEN BEATEN.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.777
YOUR ARMY IS DEFEATED!

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.651
Monster:
THE KING! HE'S GONE!

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:48.921
NOT THE KING!
WE'RE IN TROUBLE NOW!

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.623
RUN!

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:04.737
CYBERDARK DRAGON!

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:07.206
TAKE US FROM
THIS PLACE!

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.442
STOP! WAIT!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.289
WE HAVE TO GIVE HIM
TIME TO RECOVER.

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:24.623
HE NEEDS IT,
'CAUSE WHO KNOWS

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.125
WHAT'S HAPPENED
INSIDE HIM?

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:29.762
SO IS IT REALLY
TRUE, OJAMA?

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:31.564
THAT YOU SAW
JESSE HERE?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.567
YOU BETCHA! I JUST NEVER
PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.901
I'M NO GOOD
AT MATH.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.503
BUT SEEING'S
MY STRONG SUIT.

00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:39.238
WELL, FILL US IN.
I WAS SCARED,

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.840
SO IT'S HARD
TO REMEMBER.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.375
AHH! IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME!

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:46.679
SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING US!

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:48.447
IS THAT WHO
I THINK IT IS?

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.282
NAH,
IT COULDN'T'VE
BEEN HIM.

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:52.885
UNLESS--
MAYBE IT WAS!

00:20:52.885 --> 00:20:56.255
IT WAS DARK, BUT IT ALL
MAKES SENSE TO ME NOW.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.357
EVERYTHING
EXCEPT JESSE'S EYES.

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.392
THEY JUST DIDN'T
SEEM RIGHT.
