00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.006
LET'S DUEL!

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:58.078
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND I PLAY

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:01.815
GENE-WARPED WARWOLF
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.249
YOUR TURN, BOY.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:06.853
HMPH, THAT WOLF'S GOT
A LOT OF BITE TO IT!

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:09.689
OKAY, ZURE, WATCH THIS!

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:14.027
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
FAKE HERO SO I CAN
SUMMON THIS GUY...

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:17.197
ELEMENTAL HERO NEOS!

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.899
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS
SUMMONED USING
FAKE HERO,

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.201
HE CAN'T ATTACK.

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.336
AND THEN ONCE
IT'S MY END PHASE--

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.406
HA HA! HE GOES BACK
TO YOUR HAND, RIGHT?

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:29.509
WHAT A WASTE OF A DRAW.
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.977
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.413
NOW I PLAY...MY GLOW MOSS!

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:39.052
A NEO SPACIAN?!
BUT THOSE...

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.587
CAN BE FUSED WITH THIS!

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:41.988
CONTACT FUSION!

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.792
NOW I CAN SUMMON OUT
MY ELEMENTAL HERO
GLOW NEOS!

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:53.166
[ROAR]

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.134
AND NEXT UP,

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:57.003
I PLAY THE FIELD
SPELL NEO SPACE!

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:02.142
THANKS TO ITS EFFECT,
MY GLOW NEOS GETS 500
MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.346
IT'S TOO POWERFUL.

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:07.680
UH-HUH!

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.216
YOUR LIL WARWOLF'S
GETTING SENT
TO THE POUND!

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.185
GO, LIGHTNING STRIKE!

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.223
[ROARING]

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.327
SHOCKING, ISN'T IT!

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:27.500
JADEN!

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.136
YOU THINK HE MIGHT
NEED SOME SAVIN'?

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.806
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:35.575
NO, BUT WE MIGHT!

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.683
THIS WAY!

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.018
YOU'LL BE SAFE!

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:46.319
FOR NOW, YOU WILL.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.488
IF WE AIM TO HELP JADEN,
WE SHOULD HEAD OUT.

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.590
HUH.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.058
THANKS FOR NOTHING,
FREED!

00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.265
HMM.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.600
IT'S MY TURN!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.571
AND I'M PLAYING
THE FIELD SPELL POWER ZONE!

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.412
[GROANS]

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.988
AH! WHY'D MY NEOS
GET WEAKER?

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:23.156
HA HA!

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.291
WITH POWER ZONE
IN PLAY,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.727
NEOS LOSES
HIS ATTACK POINT BONUS.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.196
THEN ANYTIME
YOUR MONSTER IS DESTROYED,

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:33.733
YOU TAKE DAMAGE
TO THAT MONSTER'S
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.235
AND NOW...

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:40.340
BY PLAYING POWER ANNIHILATOR,
YOU'LL GET TO WITNESS
THIS FIRSTHAND!

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.510
IF YOU PLEASE,
POWER ANNIHILATOR...

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.845
ATTACK HIS GLOW NEOS.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:46.846
[ROAR]

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:47.881
HOLD UP!

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.249
NEOS IS TOO STRONG!

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.984
SO HE'S PULLIN'
THE POWER!

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:54.754
IT CAN'T.

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:55.955
YES, IT CAN!

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:59.359
SEE, IF YOUR MONSTER
HAD LESS ATTACK POINTS,

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.762
THEN ANNIHILATOR WOULD LOSE
A THOUSAND OF ITS POINTS.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:07.066
HOWEVER, NEOS HAS MORE,
SO MINE GAINS A THOUSAND!

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.936
LOOKS LIKE THE POWER'S
BEEN RESTORED!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.343
[SCREAMING]

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.345
AND THANKS TO POWER ZONE,

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.515
YOUR LIFE POINTS
GET DRAINED BY 2,500!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:26.252
NOW GET READY FOR ANOTHER
POWER SURGE FROM MY HAND.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.453
UH!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.625
BECAUSE NEXT I PLAY
THE SPELL POWER SPIRIT!

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.961
IN ORDER FOR THIS
TO TAKE EFFECT,

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:38.898
ALL I NEED TO DO IS SACRIFICE
1,000 OF MY LIFE POINTS,

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.667
AND THEN YOU
CAN ONLY ATTACK

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.870
IF YOUR MONSTER
IS A THOUSAND POINTS
STRONGER THAN MINE.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.871
AH...

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.942
I LAY A FACEDOWN,
AND WITH THAT, YOU GO.

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:52.045
NOW THAT MY ULTIMATE COMBO
HAS BEEN COMPLETED...

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.480
BETWEEN POWER ZONE
AND POWER SPIRIT,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.650
YOU NEED A MONSTER
WITH AT LEAST 3,800 POINTS

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.985
TO DEFEAT
MY ANNIHILATOR!

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.420
OH...

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.856
AND TO THINK
THAT I EXPECTED

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.793
A CHALLENGE FROM YOU!

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.297
AH!

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:12.632
OH, NO!

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:14.067
HELLO.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.202
WHY DID YOU GUYS
FOLLOW ME?!

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.437
WELL, UH...

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:18.438
DUH!

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:20.406
WE FELT LIKE
GETTING CAPTURED.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.641
WE'RE, YA KNOW...

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.875
SORRY.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.410
HA HA!

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.814
YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME
TO WATCH YOUR FRIEND LOSE!

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:30.850
SORRY, ZURE,
THINK AGAIN!

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:37.457
I SUMMON WINGED KURIBOH
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:39.125
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.961
THAT'S YOUR TURN?
HA HA!

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.964
YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE UP.
IT'S QUICKER!

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:45.965
AH...

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.067
JADEN!

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.136
HE AIN'T LOOKING
TOO GOOD,

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.939
AND OUR MATES
HAVE GONE AND GOTTEN
THEMSELVES CAPTURED.

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:59.879
EXCUSE ME, SIR FREED?

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:03.516
WHAT IS IT
THAT BOTHERS YOU?

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.251
DID YOU LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND?

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.419
JADEN.

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.454
HIS PATH IS DIFFERENT.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.391
JADEN FOLLOWS
WHAT HIS HEART
IS TELLING HIM...

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:15.828
THOUGH SURELY IN THE END
HE WILL FIND NOTHING
BUT DEFEAT.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.530
BUT HE NEEDS YOU.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.765
MMM.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:25.672
I'M AFRAID
THIS IS THE END.

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.374
IT'S MY TURN,
AND I SHALL PLAY

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:30.710
RING OF FIENDISH POWER!

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.281
WITH THIS SPELL CARD,
YOU ARE FORCED TO ATTACK
POWER ANNIHILATOR!

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.384
AND THEN, SHOULD
YOUR MONSTER GET DESTROYED,

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:42.755
THE DAMAGE TO YOUR LIFE POINTS
EQUALS THAT OF YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.291
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.728
TURN THAT KURIBOH
INTO A DUST BALL!

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:52.065
ATTACK WITH
POWER PULSE SLASH!

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.200
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.968
SINCE YOUR MONSTER'S
STRONGER...

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.604
IT'LL LOSE A THOUSAND
OF ITS ATTACKS POINTS!

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.843
[ROAR]

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:04.911
AH!

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:07.480
IT'S STILL MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO TAKE IT OUT!

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.481
AH!

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.183
AND THERE'S MORE TO COME.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.518
DUE TO MY FIELD SPELL
POWER ZONE,

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.921
ONCE YOUR KURIBOH
WAS DESTROYED...

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.590
ITS ATTACK POINTS
ATTACK YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.292
HA HA!

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:21.728
AND NOW MY RING
TAKES EFFECT!

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:25.031
WITH THIS SPELL, YOU TAKE
ANOTHER DOSE OF DAMAGE!

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:28.701
YOUR MONSTER'S DEFENSE POINTS
ATTACK YOUR LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:31.804
[ROAR]

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.140
AAH!

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.075
JADEN!
HANG IN THERE!

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.511
UH! UH!

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:42.682
AND NOW I CAN PLAY THIS:
EXPLOSION FUSE!

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:46.452
THIS TRAP ACTIVATES
WHEN YOUR MONSTER IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.988
IT ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
ONE POWER BOMBARD

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:51.791
FROM MY DECK
AND EQUIP HIM WITH IT!

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.594
AND DURING MY NEXT
STANDBY PHASE...

00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:56.496
I LOSE MY BOMBARD,

00:14:56.496 --> 00:15:02.502
BUT NOT BEFORE INFLICTING
1,000 POINTS OF DAMAGE TO YOU!

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:04.203
HA HA!

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.507
THERE'S NO WAY FOR YOU
TO DEFEAT ME AND WIN
THIS BATTLE.

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:11.377
EVEN IF YOU FIND A MONSTER
THAT CAN DEFEAT MY ANNIHILATOR,

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.346
ONCE ITS ATTACK POINTS
CHANGE,

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:16.582
MY BOMBARD'S SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES,

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.185
SENDING YOU TO THE STARS!

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:25.158
IT SEEMS
YOUR LUCK'S RUN OUT!

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:27.794
HA HA!
DON'T WORRY...

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:30.897
ONCE I BLAST YOU
TO THE STARS,

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:33.933
I'LL BE SURE
YOU HAVE SOME COMPANY.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.468
HA HA!

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:38.171
I'LL START WITH
THE LITTLE GUY!

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:41.607
OR MAYBE I'LL JUST KEEP THEM
PRISONERS HERE

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.910
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES!

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.211
YOU WOULDN'T!

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.580
AH!

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.348
I THINK HE WOULD!

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.250
I'M SO SCARED!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.251
HOLD ON!

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.886
JADEN!
HUH?

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:56.722
NEVER FEAR!

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:59.025
TOGETHER WE WILL
RESCUE THEM!

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.226
SIR FREED!

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:02.395
HE'S HERE!

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.667
MY FRIEND,
YOU HAVE SHOWN ME COURAGE!

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.570
NOW YOU SHALL BE REWARDED!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.973
JADEN, ALLOW MY WARRIOR SPIRIT
TO JOIN WITH YOUR DECK.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.108
AH!

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.711
HA HA!

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:23.983
YOU GOT IT,
SIR FREED.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.853
HEY, ZURE, I'M ABOUT
TO GET MY GAME ON!

00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:29.822
GET READY. MY MOVE!

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.425
[GASP]

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.693
CAN IT BE?

00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:35.995
IT'S HIM!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:40.900
ZURE, I SUMMON FREED,
THE BRAVE WANDERER!

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:48.074
WHAT?
IT CAN'T BE!

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:49.542
OH, YES, IT CAN!

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:51.511
NOW I PLAY COMMON SOUL!

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:56.148
BY SELECTING FREED,
I CAN NOW SUMMON UP
A NEO-SPACIAN.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:59.852
SO I'M PLAYIN'
MY GOOD OL' FRIEND
FLARE SCARAB!

00:17:01.287 --> 00:17:04.090
NOW, FOR EVERY
SPELL N TRAP CARD
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:08.127
MY FLARE SCARAB GAINS
400 ADDITIONAL ATTACK POINTS

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.096
FOR EACH
AND EVERY ONE.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.697
SINCE YOU HAVE
FOUR CARDS,

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.433
HE GETS 1,600
POINTS STRONGER.

00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:19.305
THEN THERE'S
MY COMMON SOUL
SPELL CARD...

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:22.108
WHICH LETS ME TAKE
ALL OF SCARAB'S
ATTACK POINTS,

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.243
AND THEN I CAN APPLY
THEM DIRECTLY TO

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.379
MY FREED
THE BRAVE WANDERER.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.647
OH, NO!

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:31.284
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
GETTING A POWER BOOST!

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:34.353
IT'S USELESS!
YOU'VE LOST!

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.322
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:40.092
AS SOON AS YOU ATTACK,
POWER ANNIHILATOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:43.362
WILL ACTIVATE
AND POWER BOMBARD
WILL EXPLODE,

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:46.165
DEFEATING YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.335
HMM, NOT QUITE!

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.172
HUH?

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.808
BY ACTIVATING
JUSTICE BRIGHT,

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.677
THIS BATTLE ENDS NOW!

00:17:57.677 --> 00:18:01.981
THIS SPECIAL EFFECT
LETS ME REMOVE TWO LIGHT
MONSTERS FROM MY GRAVE

00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.884
AND THEN A MONSTER
WITH MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN MY FREED

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.118
GETS DESTROYED!

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.119
ARGH!

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.154
AND, ZURE,

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:09.789
TURNS OUT FREED
HAD LESS POINTS

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:12.425
THAN YOUR ANNIHILATOR
BEFORE HIS BOOST!

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.528
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:18.130
HORRID FIEND,
FEEL THE WRATH OF MY

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.000

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:43.756
AH!

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:47.293

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.661
BE GOOD!

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.935
HUH?

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.337
ZURE HAS BEEN SENT
TO THE STARS!

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:01.040
RETREAT!
HE'S TOO STRONG!

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.441
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.313
HUH!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.548
YOU SAVED MY LIFE!

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:11.684
AH!

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:12.752
SIR FREED?!

00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:14.120
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.121
AH!

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:16.288
I MUST LEAVE.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:20.226
I WILL FIND MY PLACE...
IN THE STARS ABOVE US.

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:21.227
BUT WHY?

00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:22.628
YOU RESCUED US!

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:24.964
AND YOUR VILLAGERS
NEED YOU, RIGHT?

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:27.833
THEY WILL BE SAFE
NOW THAT ZURE'S GONE.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.602
YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM
STRENGTH.

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.770
DON'T GO!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.107
JADEN...YOU MUST FIGHT
THE DARKNESS.

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.343
SIR FREED.

EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.287
LOOKS LIKE IT,

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:51.524
BUT JADEN SURE MADE THIS
CLOSE FOR ALL OF US.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.460
IT'S JUST...
HE NEEDS TO FIND JESSE.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.462
AND I PLAN TO!

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.798
JESSE'S STILL OUT THERE!

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:00.833
SO WHO'S...WITH ME?

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:04.070
I'M GONNA SEARCH EVERY CAVE
AND FIGHT EVERY MONSTER
IN THIS PLACE

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.604
UNTIL I FIND HIM

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:08.674
EVEN IF I HAVE TO RISK
EVERYTHING TO DO IT!

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.142
THIS IS HEART WRENCHING.

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.577
IF JADEN ISN'T CAREFUL,

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:14.814
ONE OF THOSE DUELS MIGHT HAVE
AN END THAT AFFECTS US ALL.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:17.616
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN DUEL
OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.

JUST AIN'T RIGHT!

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:33.265
