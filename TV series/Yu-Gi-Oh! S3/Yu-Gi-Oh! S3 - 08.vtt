00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:02.339
(announcer)
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh"...

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.481
(Téa)
Whoa, check it out!

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.318
It's some kind of
a doorway.

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:09.488
Well, what are we
waiting for?

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:12.194
Let's go!

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:13.196
It's Joey!

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:14.332
Hey, where
you been?

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:16.003
I'm dueling one of
the Big Five.

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.138
And you're just in time

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:19.277
to see me wipe the courtroom
floor with him!

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:20.712
I think you'll change
your tune

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:22.049
once you've had
the opportunity

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:25.156
to meet my deck master
so please be seated.

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:29.599
The honorable
Judge Man presiding!

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.441
Meet my deck master,
Flame Swordsman!

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:36.314
I play the card,
Sinister Justice.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:38.085
Joey's in big trouble!

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.557
As long as Sinister Justice
is on the field,

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:43.530
Johnson gets 800
extra life points every time

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.203
he attacks Joey's life points
with his Kamionwizard!

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:48.875
You planned this all along,
didn't you, Johnson?

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:49.978
Of course!

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:53.051
But I have far worse
in store for you, Joseph!

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.508
♪ Your move ♪

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.191
♪ Yu-Gi-Oh is king of games ♪

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:35.412
♪ It's time to duel ♪

00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:53.017
♪ Yu-Gi-Oh ♪

00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:59.767
So far all of the evidence
points to your defeat.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.639
I find you guilty
of poor dueling!

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.677
Oh yeah--
We'll just see.

00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:06.181
My move!

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.018
All right,
what to do?

00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:10.457
His face down card is
probably a trap,

00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:12.394
but I can't worry
about that right now.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:14.265
I have to get a monster
on the field

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:17.338
or else he'll be able to
attack my life points again!

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.777
And I got just the guy
for the job!

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:21.849
So look out, Johnson!

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.486
Now I play
this card!

00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:25.690
Panther Warrior
in attack mode!

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.167
And then...

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.171
I'll place
one card facedown.

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.145
His Kamionwizard has only
1,300 attack points,

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:37.283
so my Panther Warrior should
be able to wipe it out

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:38.719
with no problem!

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.824
But just in case
he tries anything funny,

00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:43.731
I've got my facedown card
as a backup!

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.568
That's it for me, judge!

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:47.239
You're up to
something.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.111
Oh well...
I'm not too worried.

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.350
Because I have
this card!

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.586
Ready, Joseph?

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:56.525
Reveal the magic card,
Leading Question!

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:59.532
This card adds 800
attack points to any monster

00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:02.472
that's made up of two other
monsters fused together!

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:05.078
So my Kamionwizard
is now stronger

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.414
than your
Panther Warrior!

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:10.456
Wizard, attack now!

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.463
Not so fast, mister tall,
dark and gruesome!

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:16.169
You triggered my trap!

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.943
Go Skull Dice!

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:20.211
The higher I roll,

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:23.452
the more attack points
your monster loses!

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:26.091
Yeah!

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:29.533
Perhaps he should take
a closer look.

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:30.601
What!

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:31.637
A one?

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:33.174
No way!

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.078
All right...

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:38.486
I don't know how you did that,
but I got my eye on you!

00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:42.394
In my courtroom, twisting
the facts is perfectly legal,

00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:45.134
especially when it
helps me!

00:03:45.134 --> 00:03:48.241
No, my Panther Warrior!

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:50.980
Once again you have no
monsters on the field.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.621
And as for me, you remember my
Sinister Justice card,

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:55.691
don't you?

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.096
It gives me
another 800 life points.

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:01.437
Not again!

00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:02.873
That will happen every time

00:04:02.873 --> 00:04:05.446
my Kamionwizard attacks
your life points!

00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:06.815
Stop this guy!

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:08.987
You almost had him
beat once!

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:11.826
Until he turned things
around and whooped you!

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:13.096
Gee, thanks...

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:14.566
Order in the court!

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.070
Make your move!

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.407
Johnson's got me right
where he wants me!

00:04:18.407 --> 00:04:20.379
Thanks to his
Leading Question magic card

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.686
his Kamionwizard gets a power
boost of 800 points!

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:27.260
That gives it a grand
total of 2,100 attack points!

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.466
And all I have in
my hand is...

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.236
the Swordsman of Landstar,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:34.743
who's not exactly what
I'd call the king of monsters.

00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:36.448
What's the matter?

00:04:36.448 --> 00:04:39.087
Did little Joseph use up
all of his best monsters

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:41.493
during the first
five minutes of the duel?

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:42.828
No!

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:44.232
The truth
is I did!

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.102
And now I'm paying
the price...

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:48.641
Well...
Make your move.

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.916
All right fine,
Johnson.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.087
Hey...
Graceful Dice!

00:04:54.087 --> 00:04:55.991
If my luck improves,
I may be able

00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.931
to raise my Swordsman Of
Landstar's attack points.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.036
I summon Swordsman
Of Landstar!

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:04.777
And then...

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:09.555
I'll play this,
my Graceful Dice!

00:05:09.555 --> 00:05:11.058
Yeah!

00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:14.699
Raise my Swordsman's attack
points with a high roll!

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.272
All right,
it worked!

00:05:17.272 --> 00:05:19.978
Not quite.

00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:27.228
What did I do to
deserve all this?

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:30.167
I've never seen him have such
terrible luck before.

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.303
Poor Joey.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.548
Oh, Joseph,
it's my move now.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.987
Time to clear the courtroom
of your monster!

00:05:38.987 --> 00:05:42.729
His Deck Master
Special ability!

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:47.105
Yes-- For the mere price
of 1,000 life points

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.410
I've left you defenseless.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.080
The verdict is in...

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.018
You're finished!

00:05:57.127 --> 00:05:59.767
This case is coming
to a close.

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:01.269
It's not over
yet, Johnson!

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.308
I place two cards
facedown!

00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:04.944
So you do.

00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:06.213
Now!

00:06:06.213 --> 00:06:07.985
Hang in there.

00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:12.194
I play my
Pot of Greed card.

00:06:12.194 --> 00:06:16.470
I bet you wish you'd drawn this
card, don't you, Joseph?

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.947
Now, I'm able
to draw two new cards,

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:25.056
which is something that you need
to do quite desperately!

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:28.062
Thanks to you,
I can draw five cards now.

00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:29.399
'Cause I activate: Gamble!

00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:37.015
You see, I have no cards
and you have six,

00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:39.221
which is exactly
the combination I needed

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.726
in order to activate
this trap card!

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:42.996
Gamble?

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.565
Yep.

00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:46.237
It's a risky
card, Téa,

00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:49.410
but if it works it can help Joey
turn this entire duel around,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.016
and it
starts with a coin.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:55.022
And what exactly is so
risky about it, Yugi?

00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:57.261
Well, Joey flips
a coin in the air,

00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:58.531
then he calls heads
or tails,

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.835
and if he's right he
get to draw five cards,

00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:05.212
but if he is wrong, Joey's
next turn gets skipped

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:07.049
and he can't afford
to let that happen.

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:10.323
It could cost
him the entire duel!

00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:12.795
He can take all
the risks he wants,

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:17.038
because in my virtual courtroom,
I control everything.

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:18.808
Okay...

00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:22.317
This could make or
break the game for me...

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:30.335
(Mokuba)
Maybe this door'll lead
us back home!

00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:33.976
Guess not.

00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:35.779
Oh well.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.751
At least it's a change
of scenery.

00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:39.120
Are you crazy?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.827
I don't wanna be on a virtual
beach, in a virtual forest,

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.964
or even in a
virtual amusement park!

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.403
I want outta here!

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:47.806
Sorry, Seto.

00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:49.677
I just had to get that
off my chest.

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.615
This place is
really getting to me.

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.784
Just relax.

00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:56.292
If you get upset, then
you're letting Noah win.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:58.830
Noah, show yourself!

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.336
We're on to your little game
and it won't work!

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:04.878
You think you can wear us down
by toying with our emotions...

00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:08.052
but you obviously don't know
who you're dealing with!

00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:09.522
Really?

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.428
I'd say I know exactly who
I'm dealing with, Seto...

00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:14.065
A no-good thief.

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:15.635
Now where was I?

00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:17.038
Ah, yes.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.042
<i>(Yugi)</i>
<i>Come on, Joey,</i>
<i>you can do this!</i>

00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:22.416
You have a 50-50 chance!

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:25.657
Not exactly.

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:27.629
It's heads!

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:29.098
Come on.

00:08:29.098 --> 00:08:31.871
Ah man,
it's tails!

00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:33.140
No fair.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.512
No, not again!

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:36.982
This is bad.

00:08:36.982 --> 00:08:39.989
When is this poor fool
going to learn

00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:42.328
that as long as
we're in my courtroom,

00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:46.102
I control the outcome?

00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:49.711
It's still my turn, so I'll
reveal my face down card!

00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:51.113
Scapegoat!

00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:56.894
Are those fur-balls
supposed to frighten me?

00:08:56.894 --> 00:08:59.833
I'll have them dismissed from
this trial in no time!

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.539
This ought to do
for starters.

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:06.448
I'll play my Reinforcement
of the Army magic card first!

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:09.188
Allowing me to add a warrior
to my hand!

00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:10.390
Then...

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.729
I'll use Polymerization!

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:14.265
Know why, Joseph?

00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:16.436
To fuse together
my Armaill Warrior

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:19.677
and my One-Eyed
Shield Dragon!

00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:22.951
Meet Dragoness
The Wicked Knight!

00:09:25.256 --> 00:09:27.094
Wow, Big deal Johnson.

00:09:27.094 --> 00:09:29.298
Your monster
looks weak to me!

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:30.368
But wait!

00:09:30.368 --> 00:09:31.971
Thanks to that
magic card of his,

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.611
Johnson can increase the attack
points of any monster

00:09:34.611 --> 00:09:37.785
that's made up of two
other monsters fused together!

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:42.294
Time for my Leading Question
magic card to kick in.

00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:45.134
And power up my Kamionwizard

00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:48.073
as it tears down your
first Scapegoat!

00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:52.517
Now it will increase the
strength of my Wicked Knight

00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:54.956
as it eliminates your
second Scapegoat!

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.704
Two down...

00:10:01.704 --> 00:10:03.808
And two more
Scapegoats left!

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:05.847
Not if I stop
you first!

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:07.217
Objection!

00:10:07.217 --> 00:10:08.686
Your turn is skipped!

00:10:08.686 --> 00:10:12.027
You called "heads" but you
got "tails," Joseph.

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:13.731
All right, then go!

00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:15.200
As you wish.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.203
Now...

00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:19.009
Time to destroy
one more Scapegoat!

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.022
And last but not least,
I'll enhance the strength

00:10:25.022 --> 00:10:27.461
of my Wicked Knight
once more

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:29.566
and dismiss
your last Scapegoat!

00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:32.405
No!

00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:34.744
I'm done for!

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:36.649
Case closed!

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:37.951
Do you admit
defeat?

00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:39.221
No!

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.490
This duel won't be over

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.563
until your life points
reach zero, Johnson!

00:10:43.563 --> 00:10:45.735
No way am
I'm giving up!

00:10:45.735 --> 00:10:47.105
Ow.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.813
Note to self: do not punch
virtual railing.

00:10:50.813 --> 00:10:52.817
That's right,
don't give up, Joey!

00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:55.590
This bad luck of yours
is bound to change,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.597
because it
can't get any worse.

00:10:58.597 --> 00:11:00.067
Hey, Téa, listen...

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:03.642
As far as pep talks go, this
is not your best work.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:05.879
I'm running outta
options here.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.216
Don't give up!

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:10.056
There's something fishy
about this Johnson guy.

00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:14.065
It seems like more than just bad
luck that's holding Joey down.

00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:15.134
Yes, Yugi.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:17.506
I agree--
Much more.

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:20.512
Johnson is controlling the
outcome of Joey's moves.

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:23.352
I've been sensing it since
the beginning of this duel.

00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:25.524
This judge is cheating!

00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:26.860
I knew it!

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.497
We've got to step in!

00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:31.570
Or Joey's mind will be
trapped here!

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.513
(Téa)
Hey, check out
that light!

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.452
(Yugi)
Wait a second...

00:11:38.452 --> 00:11:39.989
That's Noah!

00:11:43.864 --> 00:11:44.866
Master!

00:11:44.866 --> 00:11:46.203
What brings you here?

00:11:46.203 --> 00:11:47.940
(Noah)
Silence!
Yes, sir.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.177
Noah...

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:51.347
It is him!

00:11:51.347 --> 00:11:54.855
(Mokuba)
This is even worse than that
never-ending virtual forest!

00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:56.760
Hold on, Mokuba.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.797
It's Noah...

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.201
Time out!

00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:02.506
Stop the duel!

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:04.009
What's the deal?

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:05.145
Noah...

00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.015
You can't, sir,
please!

00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:11.259
I'm only a few moves away from
taking over this fool's body!

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:13.731
You don't deserve
that prize, Johnson!

00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:16.102
Not after what you
just pulled!

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:19.076
So, he is a cheater.

00:12:19.076 --> 00:12:21.114
Sad to say it's true.

00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:23.385
The honorable Judge Man
is nothing but a fraud

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:25.624
who's been cheating you
from the very beginning.

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:27.695
He's been using
my virtual technology

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:29.666
to tamper with your
dice rolls.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.436
How 'bout I tamper
with your face?

00:12:31.436 --> 00:12:35.212
Mr. so called man-of-justice,
ya big, fat fake!

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:38.252
But Noah, I couldn't risk
losing this!

00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:39.254
Please!

00:12:39.254 --> 00:12:40.724
You must
understand me!

00:12:40.724 --> 00:12:42.495
I can't take living in this
virtual prison

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.332
for one moment longer!

00:12:44.332 --> 00:12:45.434
It's torture!

00:12:45.434 --> 00:12:47.506
Your excuses bore me!

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:50.312
I brought you five into my
world with the understanding

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:53.319
that under my leadership you
would defeat Seto Kaiba

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.022
and his little friends.

00:12:55.022 --> 00:12:58.296
But if you cheat, I can't prove
that I'm truly more deserving

00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:00.201
than him.

00:13:00.201 --> 00:13:01.437
Than me?

00:13:01.437 --> 00:13:03.174
More deserving
of what?

00:13:03.174 --> 00:13:05.446
<i>For years I've lived in</i>
<i>Seto's shadow,</i>

00:13:05.446 --> 00:13:08.218
<i>always trying to prove</i>
<i>that I'm the better one!</i>

00:13:08.218 --> 00:13:11.058
<i>I should be the president of</i>
<i>Kaiba Corp, not him!</i>

00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:13.631
<i>And it's about time</i>
<i>I've proven to Gozaburo Kaiba</i>

00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:16.069
<i>that he should have left</i>
<i>the company to me!</i>

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:17.272
What?

00:13:17.272 --> 00:13:19.076
But my stepfather
Gozaburo

00:13:19.076 --> 00:13:22.884
has been missing without
a trace for over five years!

00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:26.760
And why would Noah want to prove
something to him, anyway?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.332
This kid is not
who he seems to be!

00:13:29.332 --> 00:13:30.802
But who is he?

00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:33.474
(Joey)
Excuse me, boys.

00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:36.080
If I may interrupt this little
quarrel for just a second,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.851
the defendant
would like to speak.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:42.261
If Johnson plays by the rules, I
may still be able to win this!

00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:45.033
Sorry, but this
doesn't concern you.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.403
Johnson!

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:48.542
It's time for me to do something
that I should have done

00:13:48.542 --> 00:13:50.145
the day I met you!

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.249
Noah, please, don't!

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.786
Yoohoo!

00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.056
What?

00:13:55.056 --> 00:13:57.194
Look, I'm willing
to forgive Judge Gruesome,

00:13:57.194 --> 00:14:00.000
as long as he agrees to
duel fair and square.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.310
Noah, if he wins, you still
get to prove your strength.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.884
And if I win I get to prove that
Joey Wheeler doesn't sit back

00:14:07.884 --> 00:14:10.657
and let freaky-looking
frauds get the best of him!

00:14:10.657 --> 00:14:11.993
Fine.

00:14:11.993 --> 00:14:13.663
Well, good luck.

00:14:13.663 --> 00:14:16.504
And I hope you understand
what you just did.

00:14:16.504 --> 00:14:20.312
The stakes of this
duel still stand.

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:22.818
Wow, sure beats
the subway.

00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:23.853
All right!

00:14:23.853 --> 00:14:25.323
Let's do this
thing!

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.561
You did hear
Noah, right?

00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:30.601
You lose and I still
get to escape...

00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:32.873
by taking
control of you!

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.210
Yeah, I get it!

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.186
Then I guess you are as
foolish as you look

00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:41.225
because you're about to
lose everything, Joseph.

00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:43.831
And with your body under
my jurisdiction,

00:14:43.831 --> 00:14:47.639
your mind will be sentenced
to wander this cyber universe

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:51.180
for all eternity
without bail!

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.452
You got me shaking
in my boots, your honor.

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:54.922
You're real tough!

00:14:54.922 --> 00:14:58.230
But it's too bad you can't
cheat anymore, Johnson!

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.566
Touché.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.403
Now let's
finish this duel!

00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:04.544
Well...

00:15:04.544 --> 00:15:06.414
looky here!

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:09.321
I think my luck is beginning
to change now!

00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.590
Yes!
All right!

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.795
Pot of Greed lets me draw
two cards.

00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:14.098
Sweet!

00:15:14.098 --> 00:15:17.272
These two bad boys right
here are just what I need.

00:15:17.272 --> 00:15:20.445
And now it's time to move
my Deck Master!

00:15:20.445 --> 00:15:21.815
Flame Swordsman!

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:24.321
Go to the center of the playing
field so I can use you

00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:26.225
to attack this creepazoid!

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.998
But first I'll boost your
power with Burning Soul Sword!

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.706
Not so fast.

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:37.216
You need to sacrifice a monster
for Burning Soul Sword to work.

00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:38.987
Hey, what makes you
think I don't know

00:15:38.987 --> 00:15:41.259
how my own magic
card works?

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:43.664
First I have to
sacrifice a monster.

00:15:43.664 --> 00:15:46.270
And then whichever creature's
holding the Soul Sword

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.341
gets more attack points!

00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:51.281
In this case,
that's my Flame Swordsman.

00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:54.087
I stand corrected however you
seem to have forgotten

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:56.459
one major fact
about your strategy

00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:59.532
that will prove to be most
unfortunate, Joseph.

00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:00.702
Look at the field!

00:16:00.702 --> 00:16:03.642
You have no monsters
left to sacrifice, you fool!

00:16:03.642 --> 00:16:06.347
So your plan won't work!

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.141
I'm not through yet!

00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:22.150
I still got
this little number left!

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.357
My Arduous Decision
magic card!

00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:26.927
Talk about risk!

00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:29.466
If this doesn't work, he could
lose the entire duel

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.303
to Johnson right now, Téa!

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:32.740
But how, Yugi?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.247
Playing that magic card allows
Joey to draw two more cards

00:16:36.247 --> 00:16:39.254
from his deck and that's
where things get tough!

00:16:39.254 --> 00:16:42.929
'Cause then Johnson has to
pick one of those two cards.

00:16:42.929 --> 00:16:45.167
If he chooses a monster,
Joey can summon it.

00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.973
But if he chooses
a magic or trap card,

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:50.747
it goes to the graveyard
and Joey's turn is over.

00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:53.319
Well...
Your choice!

00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:55.223
If you haven't figured
it out yet,

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.765
the outcome of this entire
duel depends on this one move!

00:16:58.765 --> 00:17:01.170
And with Noah watching,
you can't cheat

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.477
which means our fate
will be decided by chance.

00:17:04.477 --> 00:17:07.550
Your fate was sealed
the moment we met!

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.288
Just pick a card, Johnson!

00:17:09.288 --> 00:17:11.292
And quit your
stalling already!

00:17:11.292 --> 00:17:13.397
It's not a tough choice!

00:17:13.397 --> 00:17:14.800
There's only two cards!

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.174
Of course, if you choose
a monster I can sacrifice it

00:17:18.174 --> 00:17:20.078
to power up my
Flame Swordsman

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:23.018
and blast away the rest of
your life points!

00:17:23.018 --> 00:17:25.156
Yes, but if I choose a
magic or trap card

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:27.127
then your
Swordsman remains weak

00:17:27.127 --> 00:17:30.602
and I'll destroy it, thus
winning the duel!

00:17:30.602 --> 00:17:33.374
Come on buddy,
what're you gonna do here?

00:17:33.374 --> 00:17:34.578
Choose!

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:36.080
Right or left hand.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.887
The time is now!

00:17:38.887 --> 00:17:40.691
Yeah, Joey--
Stay tough!

00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:42.963
Johnson is
losing his cool!

00:17:42.963 --> 00:17:45.902
He'll never be able to cheat
his way out of this!

00:17:45.902 --> 00:17:48.876
That fool Wheeler is risking
the entire duel

00:17:48.876 --> 00:17:50.646
on a game of chance!

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:53.018
Come on, pick
a card already.

00:17:53.018 --> 00:17:56.158
All this suspense is
driving me crazy!

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.729
Well, if you can't
take it

00:17:57.729 --> 00:18:01.671
just imagine how
Joey feels right now!

00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:04.577
Let's do this!

00:18:04.577 --> 00:18:07.250
The more you put it off,
the harder it's gonna be!

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.187
Just pick a card,
Johnson!

00:18:09.187 --> 00:18:11.526
All right,
all right.

00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:13.898
Yeah-- I'm waiting.

00:18:13.898 --> 00:18:16.837
I pick your
left hand.

00:18:16.837 --> 00:18:18.274
Are you sure?

00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:22.483
I mean
really sure?

00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:24.488
I'm sure.

00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:26.659
That's an old trick
but a good one.

00:18:26.659 --> 00:18:30.335
However, I won't be
fooled by your childish antics!

00:18:30.335 --> 00:18:32.673
You asked me twice
if I was sure.

00:18:32.673 --> 00:18:35.847
Your hesitation proves
I've made the right choice!

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:37.249
If you say so.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.722
I've spent years and years
convincing people

00:18:39.722 --> 00:18:41.158
that lies were truth,

00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:44.699
so you have little chance of
outwitting me, Joseph!

00:18:44.699 --> 00:18:47.506
I'm positive I haven't
picked your monster card.

00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:50.345
So this case is closed!

00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:52.183
Judgment in
favor of me!

00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:55.390
Now please show me the card
in your left hand.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.595
No wait!
Yes?

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.867
Ah... I change
my mind!

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:03.241
The right
hand, then?

00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:05.813
That's gotta hurt.

00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:07.316
All right!

00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:10.390
You chose my monster card
known as Goblin Attack Force!

00:19:12.528 --> 00:19:16.938
So now, I'm able to sacrifice
my goblins

00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:21.081
and add their attack points to
my Deck Master, Flame Swordsman,

00:19:21.081 --> 00:19:23.886
thanks to the powers of my
Burning Soul Sword!

00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:33.608
All right!

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:36.648
It's time for Flame Swordsman
to attack Dragoness,

00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:38.385
the Wicked Knight!

00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:46.872
No!

00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:47.974
This can't be!

00:19:47.974 --> 00:19:49.677
I never lose in
the courtroom!

00:19:49.677 --> 00:19:51.181
I once
convinced a jury

00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.889
that a man who was terrified
of water stole a boat!

00:19:54.889 --> 00:19:57.462
How could I be
fooled by some kid?

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:59.866
Ahhhh!

00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:05.379
Oh yeah!

00:20:05.379 --> 00:20:07.684
Look out--
Who's the man?

00:20:07.684 --> 00:20:09.621
Way to go Joey!

00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:10.958
That was awesome!

00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.628
Aw, yeah!

00:20:14.165 --> 00:20:15.167
Wait!

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:17.038
We still have to go find
everyone else!

00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:18.608
Yeah, the other members
of the Big Five

00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:20.913
might be
dueling them right now.

00:20:20.913 --> 00:20:22.450
Did you say
"dueling them"?

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.555
Who's dueling?

00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:26.659
They want to duel
us all, Joey.

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:28.998
Everyone who's trapped here...

00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:30.936
We are all
in this.

00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:32.707
All of us?
Stop, Joey!

00:20:32.707 --> 00:20:33.842
That's not fair!

00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:35.546
Serenity's never
dueled before!

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:37.049
No!

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:39.855
We'll find her Joey, and
we'll make sure she's okay!

00:20:39.855 --> 00:20:41.223
I promise!

00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:43.525
Let's get moving!

00:20:43.525 --> 00:20:45.494
I'm coming,
Serenity!

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.263
Wait for us!

00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:48.430
Come back, Joey!

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.431
Please!
