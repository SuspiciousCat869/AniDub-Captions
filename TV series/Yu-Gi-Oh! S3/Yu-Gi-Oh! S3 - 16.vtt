00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.569
( announcer )
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh"

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.805
I'm Leichter,
and I'll be controlling

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.107
this body for the
remainder of the duel.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.709
Get ready, boys!

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.045
( Téa )
I can't believe The Big Five
are all in Tristan's body.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.249
Those business geeks are sharing
me like I'm a Corporate Condo!

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.917
Your life points are
wide open!

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:20.454
Dark Magician Girl,
attack him directly!

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:27.628
The time has arrived to reap
the benefits of my magic card!

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.631
Now he can summon almost
any monster he wants!

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.402
In my hands, I hold the Big
Five's most powerful creature!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.605

This doesn't look
good, guys!

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:47.507
( Leichter )
It's time for me to do what
my associates couldn't,

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.244
defeat you two so we can
all escape!

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.780
You couldn't begin to imagine
what monster lurks in my deck.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.781
Tell me!

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.250
Oh, you'll find out.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.051
I'm about to summon it.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.953
Thanks to my Altar of Mist,

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.323
I can add any ritual
magic card I want to my hand,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.425
and I choose this!

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.628
Dragon Revival Ritual!

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.129
This card allows
me to summon

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.832
my all-powerful
Five-Headed Dragon!

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.333
That's not true!

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.701
Very perceptive.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.472
I must also have five monsters,
each with a different attribute.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.040
Well, I may
be missing something,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.409
but I only see
one monster on your side!

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.410
Correct.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.746
You are missing
something, Mr. Wheeler.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:29.916
Jinzo isn't my only
Deck Master, remember?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:33.153
And what do mean
by that, Leichter?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.022
The other members
of the Big Five!

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.056
That's right!

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:38.325
Their
monsters count, too!

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.695
Cause all five 'a dose creeps
are using Tristan's body!

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:44.564
And each one of them has their
own Deck Master, right?

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.867
Yeah, but that doesn't
seem fair at all...

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.003
Look, these guys'll
do anything to win.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.705
Who said they
were fair?

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.241
My five Deck Masters,
come forth!

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.376
I call you all
to the field!

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.780
First, the unstoppable
Jinzo!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.051
Then I summon the almighty
Deepsea Warrior!

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.154
Followed by the cunning
Nightmare Penguin!

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.490
Next I'll call
Judge Man to the stand!

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.828
And finally I'll summon the
superior Robotic Knight!

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:17.497
Now listen to me,
my five Deck Masters!

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.900
I command all of you
to join together

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.835
to form a creature
of unparalleled

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:24.004
strength and
supreme power!

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:28.475
Behold the ultimate monster,
my Five Headed Dragon!

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.053
We've faced this
beast before!

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.054
I know!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.356
How could I forget?

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:44.491
It was the last time
we fought these Cyber Creeps!

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.596
That Super Dragon took out my
monster, and me with it!

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.499
Yugi, so long

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.000
Joey, no!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.001
You can't leave us!

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.871
We've lost him.

00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:59.172
Joey!

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.907
He's left us!

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.577
( Joey )
Let's just hope my luck is
better den it was last time!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.278
( Yumi )
Well, the good news
is Leichter's Dragon

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:08.548
can't attack until
his next turn.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.583
That's a relief

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:10.951
We have one turn
to stop it!

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:11.952
Hold on!

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.520
I forgot
to mention...

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.089
My dragon destroys
every one of your magic,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.658
trap and monster cards
as soon as it's summoned!

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.561
( Yumi )
Oh no!

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.434
Look, Leichter...

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.871
We got plenty of monsters in our
decks, and it's our move!

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.240
There's one more thing
you should know.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.842
It's immune to almost
all attacks!

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.412
It cannot be damaged by,
Fire, Water,

00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:41.114
Earth, Wind,
or Darkness!

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.549
Oh no!

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:46.253
That leaves only one type of
monster, creatures of light!

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.622
It seems to me that
your chances of rescuing

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.891
Tristan just got
even slimmer!

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.627
And I think you all
know what that means.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:57.164
It means four more of you
will soon join him as part

00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:00.300
of the Big Five's newest
corporate takeover!

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.003
And just to make sure no one
interferes with our plan,

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.871
I place this card facedown.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.406
Good luck, gentlemen.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.443
Now use your
last turn wisely!

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:11.077
What am I supposed
to do?

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.413
It's got 5,000 attack
points and only one

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.515
kind of monster
can beat it.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.117
Any ideas, Yugi?

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.819
We can do this Joey.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.020
Trust your Deck Master.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.021
Yeah...

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.456
My Deck Master.

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:24.357
( Joey )
My Flame Swordsman
stood by me in my

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.160
last duel and guided
me to victory.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.295
Here we go!

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.296
Come on...

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.265
I was hoping for
a monster card.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.734
All right!

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.771
You'll never get me and my
friends, got that, Leichter?

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.607
First, I'll place these three
cards face down on the field.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.412
Swordsman, it's all
you out there now.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.981
I call my Deck Master
to the field!

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:53.420
All right, Yuge.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.056
It's risky but I know
we can do this together.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.524
That's all for me!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.558
Good work, Joey.

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.827
I know what I have
to do.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.762
( Yugi )
I just hope it works!

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.964
It's my move!

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:05.565
Here goes!

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.801
( Yugi )
I may need this
in a little while.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.437
Now I call my Deck Master
to the field!

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:11.838
Dark Magician!

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.173
Whoa!

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.276
Yugi and Joey both called their
Deck Masters to the field!

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:17.511
Isn't that dangerous?

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.779
If those monsters are
destroyed they lose!

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.482
Yeah, but since they have no
other monsters on the field,

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.150
that five-headed freak
would have

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.152
smashed them
to smithereens anyway!

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.623
You've made
this too easy.

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.359
Your Deck Masters
can't touch my dragon.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:35.195
And the best part is, once
I destroy them,

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:38.398
you two lose and
your bodies are ours!

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.666
Hang in there.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.601
I'm here for ya.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.604
This duel's not over,
Leichter, and it's our move.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.274
We'll show you what real
teamwork can do!

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.811
( Leichter )
Very touching, but I'd say five
heads are much better than two!

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.584
( Leichter )
How do you plan
to defeat our dragon?

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:02.321
The same way I did the
first time we fought it!

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.322
You can't!

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:05.191
That won't work now!

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.093
Last time you summoned Master
of Dragon Soldier!

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:15.835
It's true.

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.037
You can't play Master of Dragon.

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:21.040
You don't have the cards you
need to summon it to the field!

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:26.812
Yes, but I can summon a monster
that's just as powerful...

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:29.515
by combining our two Deck
Masters together

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:32.918
in order to form
Dark Flare Knight!

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.660
Take a good look,
Big Five!

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.864
This is the monster that will
bring about your destruction

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.799
and return
Tristan to us!

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.767
You challenge our
Dragon with that?

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:52.905
Yes, Dark Flare Knight is a
combination of our Deck Masters.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:55.774
Just as your Dragon
is a combination of yours,

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:58.310
and Joey and I have
faith in our Deck Masters!

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.645
You fool!

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:03.048
That new monster of yours
is a creature of darkness

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:05.885
and our Five Headed
Dragon can only be beaten

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:06.952
by a creature of light.

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:07.953
We'll see.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.456
Yes, we will!

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:13.592
Yugi's monster is so much
weaker than their dragon.

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:15.127
If he attacks,
it's gone!

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.029
Plus, it's their
Deck Master.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.465
So if it's destroyed,
they lose the duel!

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.733
( Joey )
Oh, man...

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.935
I hope Yugi knows what
he's doing out there.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.070
This move is our
last chance!

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.374
Dark Flare Knight,
prepare to attack now!

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.442
Your target is their
Five Headed Dragon.

00:08:36.348 --> 00:08:38.083
Take him down,
my beast!

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:49.929
What's this?

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.564
How can you two
still be standing?

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:56.402
We're unharmed because of Dark
Flare Knight's special effects!

00:08:56.402 --> 00:09:00.072
First it prevents me from losing
life points when it's destroyed.

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.508
But that's not all it does,
Leichter!

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:04.176
Our Deck Masters are gone,

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:07.413
but notice that Joey and I are
still in this duel!

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.447
No!

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.848
I'm afraid so.

00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:12.318
Thanks to Dark Flare Knight's
second effect.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.553
Whenever that
card's destroyed...

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:17.423
Mirage Knight is then summoned
to take its place!

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:23.996
That's your
new Deck Master?

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:29.368
Nice try, Yugi, but this
knight's too weak also.

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.803
So why did you go through
all of this trouble

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.671
just to bring
that to the field?

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:37.376
Unless Mirage Knight has
a special effect as well!

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.945
You're beginning
to catch on, Leichter.

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:42.348
Now Mirage Knight, attack
his dragon!

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.923
He may look weak...

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.993
However, first impressions
can be deceiving!

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.963
So observe
closely now, Leichter.

00:09:57.963 --> 00:10:00.065
The special ability of our
Mirage Knight

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.067
is about
to seal our victory!

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:04.036
You see, it is able
to absorb

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:07.406
all of the attack
points of the opposing monster,

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:11.010
giving our monster 5,000
extra attack points!

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.011
What?

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.245
Oh no!

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.647
Now it's more powerful
than our dragon!

00:10:15.647 --> 00:10:18.650
And there's one more thing
you may want to know...

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.020
Mirage Knight
is a creature of Light,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.055
and you know what that
means, Leichter!

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.923
It's exactly
the kind of monster I need

00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:27.526
to destroy your dragon!

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:31.263
And once it's wiped out,
this duel will finally be over!

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.374
Your Deck Master
is now gone!

00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:46.712
And since my Mirage Knight
had 7,800 attack points,

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.480
your life points
are gone!

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.782
This duel's done!

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:52.651
That's funny,
I don't feel like a loser.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:54.820
Oh no!

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.556
His life points didn't
drop to zero!

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.691
That attack
shoulda wiped 'em out!

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:01.927
Explain yourself,
tough guy!

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:05.030
( laughing )

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.637
Did you forget about the face
down card I played earlier?

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:14.139
It's known as
A Deal With Dark Ruler!

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:15.140
What?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.141
Huh?

00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.409
( Yumi )
I should have known!

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:18.677
Oh, well.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.814
This trap card prevented
me from receiving any damage

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.383
when your knight
destroyed my dragon.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:27.786
All I had to do was give
up half of my life points,

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.722
a business decision that was
well worth it in the end,

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:31.957
wouldn't you agree?

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:33.692
But you
should still lose

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:35.094
'cause your Deck Master's
gone.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.764
That would have been
the case

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.466
had it not
been for the second effect

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.168
of my Dark Ruler trap card,
Mr. Wheeler.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.707
It summons Berserk
Dragon as my Deck Master!

00:11:56.648 --> 00:12:00.485
( Leichter )
Looks like your big plan
didn't work, boys.

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:02.921
Hey Yuge, what happened
to our Mirage Knight?

00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:04.155
It's gone now!

00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:08.026
Mirage Knight only stays
in play for one attack, Joey,

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:09.994
then it splits into
the two original

00:12:09.994 --> 00:12:11.596
monsters that were
used to summon it.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:13.131
Oh man!

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:16.034
Now there's no way they
can stop the Big Five's Dragon,

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.936
'cause that over-sized
freak show is way

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:20.438
stronger than either
of their Deck Masters!

00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:21.639
And when their
Deck Masters go,

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:22.874
so do they!

00:12:22.874 --> 00:12:24.542
No, it can't be!

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:27.145
Please don't let them
destroy your Deck Masters!

00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:29.280
Don't worry about
a thing, Serenity,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.749
'cause Yugi's turn's
not over yet!

00:12:31.749 --> 00:12:32.750
You can do this!

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:35.587
All right, Leichter!

00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:37.989
Now I activate
Magical Hats!

00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:41.259
So you'll have to find
my Deck Master to destroy it!

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:45.430
And next, I shall activate my
Deck Master's Special Ability!

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.899
I'll spend 1,000
life points,

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:49.868
which allows
my Dark Magician to duplicate

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:52.737
the effect of any magic card
on the field!

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:55.240
And I choose
Magical Hats, which hides

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.141
Joey's Deck Master
as well!

00:12:58.376 --> 00:12:59.944
Thanks, Yuge!

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:02.814
Now let's hope these geezers
aren't good at hide and seek.

00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:03.815
We'll see.

00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:05.750
The rest
is up to fate, Joey.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.552
Let's hope for
the best.

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:09.187
I'm not too worried.

00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:10.688
He's got a one
in four chance.

00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:16.160
Well I'd have
to disagree, Mr. Wheeler.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.862
Your math's a bit off.

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.899
The odds are slightly
more in my favor.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.534
And now it's time!

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.002
My move!

00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:25.370
I'll save this.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.871
Now, where were we?

00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:29.107
Ah yes, your
little hat trick.

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:30.375
A nice attempt,

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:33.177
but since my new dragon can
attack four monsters

00:13:33.177 --> 00:13:35.680
at the same time,
your hats won't work.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.681
Whoa!

00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:38.550
That means he
can't miss!

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.051
One of us is
about to lose...

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.589
So Yugi hid each
monster in four hats

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:48.026
and this dragon
can attack four hats at once?

00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:49.661
Now I get it!

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:52.764
This guy is making
sure he hits his target!

00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:54.132
So this is it?

00:13:54.132 --> 00:13:55.733
I'm afraid so...

00:13:55.733 --> 00:13:58.903
One of us is about
to lose his Deck Master.

00:13:58.903 --> 00:13:59.938
Oh, yeah?

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:01.272
I don't think so!

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:03.441
Maybe Joey's got
an idea!

00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:06.678
Or maybe he's
just lost his mind.

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:09.080
( laughing )

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.782
Prepare to lose
it all, Wheeler.

00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:13.952
Hold on...

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:15.820
I think I'll target
Yugi first.

00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:19.457
Attack Berserk Dragon!

00:14:19.457 --> 00:14:22.694
It's impolite to wear hats
in a place of business,

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:24.629
so destroy
all four of Yugi's

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.498
hats along with his
Deck Master!

00:14:30.134 --> 00:14:31.869
( Yugi )
I tried my best, Tristan.

00:14:31.869 --> 00:14:33.037
( Joey )
Don't give up, Yugi.

00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:35.206
It's my turn to
save you!

00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:38.176
Flame Swordsman, protect
Yugi with your life!

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:40.478
No!

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:42.080
What are
you doing, Joey?

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.949
If his Deck Master's
destroyed, he loses!

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:45.950
Stop, Joey!

00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:52.991
( Leichter )
Now both of your
Deck Masters are gone!

00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:54.892
No!

00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:56.461
I win the duel!

00:14:59.897 --> 00:15:00.965
You there, Joey?

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:07.905
( all )
It's Joey!

00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:08.906
He's okay!

00:15:08.906 --> 00:15:10.675
But how?

00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:12.210
The Dark Magician
survived!

00:15:14.912 --> 00:15:17.315
And so did
the Flame Swordsman!

00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:18.449
Cheaters!

00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:21.419
How can your Deck Masters
be standing?

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:22.754
Take a look, Leichter!

00:15:22.754 --> 00:15:25.690
I used my trusty
Silver Dollar Trap Card!

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.191
Explain yourself.

00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:28.192
All right.

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:30.294
First I saved Yugi's
Dark Magician

00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:31.896
by forcing
my Flame Swordsman

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.831
to take the brunt of
your attack!

00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.101
Then my trap card kicked
in and saved my Swordsman.

00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.771
That card only saves
weak monsters!

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:40.972
Of course!

00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:43.441
Joey weakened his Swordsman
when he used its special

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:45.276
ability to power
up his Rocket Warrior!

00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:49.180
So when Leichter's Dragon
attacked,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.282
Joey's Silver
Dollar trap card saved

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:52.917
his already weak
Swordsman!

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:57.321
That was an
excellent move, Joey.

00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:59.457
You managed to save
us both.

00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:00.591
Well

00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:02.293
You would have
done the same thing.

00:16:02.293 --> 00:16:04.562
So, what do you think
about that?

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:05.830
Look kid!

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.766
I'm not through with you
by a long shot,

00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:11.235
and neither is my dragon,

00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:13.871
so prepare to lose
your bodies!

00:16:20.577 --> 00:16:23.680
My Dragon gets weaker
with every turn!

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.415
Joey, did you
see that?

00:16:25.415 --> 00:16:26.416
You bet!

00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:28.685
His dragon just
lost attack points!

00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:30.520
Just in time
for my turn!

00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:34.691
Check out this move,
Leichter!

00:16:34.691 --> 00:16:36.993
Reveal my facedown
card!

00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:38.395
Knight's title!

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:41.564
Now I'll add this magic card
to Yugi's Deck Master!

00:16:47.203 --> 00:16:50.573
It transforms Dark Magician
into Dark Magician Knight!

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:55.945
Now thanks to my
Deck Master's special power,

00:16:55.945 --> 00:16:58.481
I can transfer most of its
attack points to Yugi's!

00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:02.318
Since this power
only works on warriors,

00:17:02.318 --> 00:17:05.588
I had to transform
Dark Magician first!

00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:08.058
3,200 attack points?

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:11.428
That makes it stronger
than my Berserk Dragon!

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.862
That should do
the trick.

00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:15.465
Now, why don't you
do the honors Yugi?

00:17:15.465 --> 00:17:17.467
With pleasure, Joey.

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:18.868
I end my turn.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:20.904
We make a great
team, Joey.

00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:24.107
Together you and I are about
to topple the Big Five.

00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:26.309
( Leichter )
I demand an explanation,
Johnson.

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:28.912
You said Wheeler
would hold Yugi back!

00:17:28.912 --> 00:17:32.916
Instead, he's the reason
why they're ahead of us!

00:17:32.916 --> 00:17:35.251
( Johnson )
Well, don't look at me!

00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:36.820
You five are done!

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.987
My move!

00:17:37.987 --> 00:17:39.089
And now...

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:41.191
Dark Magician Knight,
attack their

00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:44.761
Berserk Dragon with Sword
of Dark Magic Attack!

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.998
Carrying with him
the combined strength

00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.600
of both of our
Deck Masters,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.502
our Knight cannot
be stopped!

00:18:03.113 --> 00:18:05.148
There goes your
Deck Master!

00:18:05.148 --> 00:18:09.219
That means all five of you
automatically lose this duel.

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:14.224
Now return Tristan's body as you
promised and run back to Noah.

00:18:14.224 --> 00:18:15.592
We've all had
enough of you!

00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:20.163
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, gentlemen.

00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:22.332
Yugi and Joey crushed
those five creeps!

00:18:22.332 --> 00:18:23.399
I knew they would!

00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:24.400
Way to go, guys!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.568
Hey, Tristan...

00:18:25.568 --> 00:18:27.871
I guess your days of looking
like a chimp are over.

00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.139
Yeah.

00:18:29.139 --> 00:18:31.508
Too bad I can't say the
same for you, Duke.

00:18:34.744 --> 00:18:36.112
Well?

00:18:36.112 --> 00:18:40.016
Now it's time for you five
to give Tristan his body back.

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:41.784
I'm afraid you've
mistaken me

00:18:41.784 --> 00:18:44.087
for someone who
believes in playing fair.

00:18:44.087 --> 00:18:45.088
Say what?

00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:46.890
All right,
it's go time!

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.891
( Leichter )
As you wish!

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:52.362
( Téa )
Oh no!

00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:54.364
( Leichter )
Now to take five
more bodies!

00:18:59.669 --> 00:19:01.638
Hey, what's going on?

00:19:01.638 --> 00:19:03.773
( Nosh )
Breaking my rules
again, are we?

00:19:03.773 --> 00:19:05.208
Noah!

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:08.578
You five fools have failed
me for the last time!

00:19:08.578 --> 00:19:09.679
What's going on?
What's happening?

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:14.117
They disappeared.

00:19:14.117 --> 00:19:15.218
Oh no!

00:19:15.218 --> 00:19:17.887
They took Tristan's
body away with them!

00:19:17.887 --> 00:19:19.489
I don't believe it.

00:19:19.489 --> 00:19:22.358
I'll be stuck in this monkey
suit for the rest of my life!

00:19:24.627 --> 00:19:26.529
And I'm feeling more
like a monkey

00:19:26.529 --> 00:19:28.398
and less like
me every second.

00:19:28.398 --> 00:19:29.599
This stinks!

00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:35.104
I'm here for you,
Tristan.

00:19:35.104 --> 00:19:37.407
On second thought,
I can learn to live with this.

00:19:41.411 --> 00:19:42.912
Master Noah!

00:19:42.912 --> 00:19:45.682
The five of you
are pathetic!

00:19:45.682 --> 00:19:47.817
Right, Mokuba?

00:19:47.817 --> 00:19:50.653
I hired you to defeat
Seto and his friends!

00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:52.355
( Gansley )
Give us another
chance!

00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:54.290
We'll put them
out of business!

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.593
( Noah )
Too late for that,
Gansley!

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:57.594
Please, Noah!

00:19:57.594 --> 00:19:58.828
Help us!

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:01.264
We need these bodies
to escape!

00:20:01.264 --> 00:20:02.665
We've been stuck
in this virtual

00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:05.101
abyss for what
seems like forever!

00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:06.536
You can save us.

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.404
Give us those bodies
and we'll help

00:20:08.404 --> 00:20:10.106
you take over
Kaiba Corp!

00:20:10.106 --> 00:20:11.941
( laughs )

00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:13.509
You, help me?

00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:17.046
I'd be better off with five
baboons than you fools.

00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:19.449
It's time for you
to leave, for good!

00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:20.450
Is that clear?

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.884
Leave for good?

00:20:21.884 --> 00:20:23.620
Please reconsider, sir!

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.555
As my father would say...

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:27.290
Your work is
unacceptable and

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.959
therefore you must
be eliminated now.

00:20:29.959 --> 00:20:32.629
( laughing )

00:20:32.629 --> 00:20:34.264
I think I'll imprison
each of you

00:20:34.264 --> 00:20:36.399
in a different
corner of my world...

00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:37.400
Forever!

00:20:40.403 --> 00:20:43.106
Now it's time
I challenged Seto personally.

00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:45.241
( laughing )

00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:46.976
I'll prove once
and for all that

00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:49.679
I'm the true heir to
the Kaiba empire!
