( announcer )
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh"...

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:04.375
Greetings humans.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.646
As the tech expert
of the Big Five,

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.086
I designed some of Kaiba
Corp's most advanced machinery !

00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:12.156
And as soon as I out-duel
one of you,

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:15.531
I'll be able to continue
my work in the real world !

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.404
Machine King, prepare to attack
her Forgiving Maiden now !

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:20.841
She'll lose
the duel !

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:21.842
Go !

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.178
Super Roboyarou !

00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:25.816
No-- If your Deck Master's
destroyed, you lose !

00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:29.991
So it's time
for you to go !

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.262
Oh no, Tristan !

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:33.866
No !

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.306
His mind has been digitized and
his body is in a holding area

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:38.975
waiting to be taken over.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.380
And you'll
both join him !

( Serenity )
No !

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:49.344
That sounded like
Serenity !

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:50.548
Joey ?
What !

00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:52.484
We'll make sure
she's okay.

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:53.987
Serenity !

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:55.690
Joey, wait !

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.494
We gotta stick
together !

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.071
( Nesbitt )
I'm sorry to say that
your friend

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.175
will never be the
same again.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.779
No, Tristan !

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.317
( Serenity )
He's gone.

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:12.256
This is all my fault,
I'm so sorry !

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:14.460
( Duke )
Hey, Serenity,
don't say that.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.031
It's not true-- You
gotta stay strong !

00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.437
He lost trying to
protect me.

00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:21.508
Where do you think
you're going ?

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.244
This duel isn't over

00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:25.916
and the Big Five
needs all of your bodies.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:29.990
Now, it's the female's turn,
so make your move already !

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.094
Serenity, you can
do it !

00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:33.497
What's wrong, my dear ?

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:35.802
Can't you duel without
your friend Tristan

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:38.540
standing beside you ?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.710
Don't listen to
this guy, Serenity !

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.947
Too late for that.

00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:44.285
I think she's already
blown a fuse.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.756
She's in no
condition to duel.

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:48.860
( Duke )
He's right--
She's in bad shape.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.730
But I need her help
to crush this guy

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.734
or we're gonna
be stuck here forever !

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.270
( Serenity )
I ruined everything !

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.312
Thanks to me Tristan is...
who knows where !

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:01.351
Serenity, we may be able to
bring Tristan back,

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:02.987
but we gotta play our best !

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:06.327
Now it's time for you to get up,
brush yourself off, and duel !

00:03:06.327 --> 00:03:08.932
Serenity !

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:11.237
( Duke )
It's no use.

00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:13.107
All right,
we'll skip her turn !

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:14.176
Very well.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:17.515
It makes no
difference to me.

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:18.584
( Duke )
Awesome !

00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:19.720
This is gonna be tricky,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.224
but if it works it could
pay off big time !

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:24.328
I just need
a little luck !

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:27.268
I activate Dimensionhole !

00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:29.805
This magic card removes a
monster from the field

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:33.280
for one turn and I'm
using it on my out monster,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.615
Dark Assailant !

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:37.354
So, Your Machine King
loses 100 attack points

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.859
since my Dark Assailant is
no longer on the field

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.395
to give him extra power.

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:42.698
And it gets better...

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:44.634
Check out this
magic card !

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.171
Play whatever you'd like.

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.909
There's absolutely nothing
that can save you now.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.379
Is that so ?

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.383
Not even this ?

00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:54.186
A Dice Dungeon magic card ?

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:55.589
You don't know me

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.494
but let's just say I know a
thing or two about dice.

00:03:58.494 --> 00:04:01.834
And now it's time for me to
roll you right outta this duel,

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:05.375
'cause I'm changing this card
game into a dice game !

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:09.783
Now-- I activate Dimension Dice
and Dice Dungeon.

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.256
This transforms the playing
field into a dice board.

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:16.897
What exactly do you plan to do
with this dice game of yours ?

00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:19.268
You'll find out
soon enough, Nesbitt,

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:22.742
when my high rolling sends
you back to the junkyard !

00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:24.946
I'm afraid you'll need
a lot more than a few dice

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:28.085
to dismantle a super human
machine like myself,

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:29.554
so make your move !

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.763
For starters I'll sacrifice
Yaranzo and The 13th Grave !

00:04:33.763 --> 00:04:37.404
This allows me to summon a super
human creature of my own.

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:39.641
Meet Orgoth
the Relentless !

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.857
Now you no longer have those
two monsters to give power

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:49.693
to your Machine King !

00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:53.802
Which means old tinfoil pants
loses 200 more attack points.

00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:57.810
And now that that's
out of the way,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.814
it's time for us
to start our dice game,

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:01.516
and this is how it's
gonna work.

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:04.789
We'll each pick a monster
to step onto the dice board

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.860
and we'll take turns
rolling the die.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.131
As you wish, foolish boy.

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:12.304
I'll choose my
still-powerful Machine King.

00:05:12.304 --> 00:05:14.709
And I'll place Orgoth
on the board.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:17.180
All right, I roll first !

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.019
The die will determine
my monster's strength.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.695
Oh yeah--
Six, baby !

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:26.799
That roll doubles
its attack points.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:28.503
Not bad at all !

00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:29.638
Let's see...

00:05:29.638 --> 00:05:32.376
That gives Orgoth
a total of 5,000 points.

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:37.620
Time to see what Machine
King's power will be !

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.457
Then commence dice roll !

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.532
Ha !

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:45.234
You rolled
a measly one !

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:49.109
That means Machine King loses
1,000 attack points !

00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:51.981
Are you making these
regulations up as you go ?

00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:53.284
Check the rulebook !

00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:54.853
Now the fun starts !

00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:56.890
Orgoth, prepare
for assault !

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:05.140
Now attack his Machine King
with Diamond Blade Strike !

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.742
This one's for Tristan !

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:15.427
Goodbye Machine King,
hello scrap pile !

00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:16.996
That was pure luck !

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:19.868
But your good fortune's
about to run out !

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:21.071
Excellent.

00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:23.442
Since I'm acting
as my own Deck Master,

00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:25.579
I shall call myself
to the field !

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.617
Robotic Knight
is now in play !

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.429
Then I'll play a magic card
known as Recycling Plant !

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:39.306
This allows me to revive one
of my former monsters

00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:41.910
and fuse it
together with myself.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.150
So Machine King,
merge with me

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.123
to form a new unstoppable
creature !

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:56.506
I am now more
powerful than ever !

00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:03.553
Hey--
What have you done ?

00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:07.627
I've merged with Machine King to
form Perfect Machine King !

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.564
Don't worry about
it, Serenity !

00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:11.768
He's just a
bigger scrap heap !

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:14.374
You have no idea of
the power I possess.

00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:16.678
I gain an additional
500 attack points

00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:19.383
for every
machine on the field !

00:07:19.383 --> 00:07:20.920
But it doesn't
stop there.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.024
Thanks to my
Clockwork Night magic card,

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:26.831
I get an additional
500-point boost !

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:27.866
No way !

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:29.169
He's unstoppable !

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:30.372
Precisely !

00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:33.311
Now prepare to join Tristan as
the next two victims

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:35.047
of the Big Five !

00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:36.817
For when I wipe both
of you out,

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:39.622
all of your bodies
will belong to us,

00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:42.762
and we can finally escape
to the real world !

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:45.601
Our dice game is
still on, so roll !

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:46.970
Very well.

00:07:51.044 --> 00:07:53.549
Yes, a five--
That must be good !

00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:55.620
Sorry to disappoint you,
but rolling a five

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.590
cuts your attack
points in half.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.692
What ?

00:07:58.692 --> 00:08:01.165
There's no logic to this
dice game at all !

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:02.567
No matter.

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:06.007
Even with half the strength,
I'm far more powerful than you.

00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:09.447
Your Orgoth has only
2,500 attack points

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:12.753
and I have 3,850 !

00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:14.256
So go ahead and roll !

00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:16.494
I'm afraid nothing
can save you now.

00:08:16.494 --> 00:08:18.765
My die has been
good to me so far,

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:21.838
so let's see if my
luck continues !

00:08:21.838 --> 00:08:23.240
I guess not !

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.542
One ?

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:27.381
That means my monster loses
1,000 attack points !

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.652
And now your Orgoth
is even weaker.

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:32.325
I can blast it
away with ease.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.206
And my remaining missiles
will blow a chunk

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:42.010
out of your
life points !

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:46.652
( Serenity )
I can't let Duke
lose, too !

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:49.791
We need to beat this robot
menace and save Tristan !

00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.127
But if I try to help,

00:08:51.127 --> 00:08:55.502
I'll probably just mess
everything up again !

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.941
So much for your dice
rolling talents.

00:08:57.941 --> 00:08:59.176
With Orgoth gone,

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:01.982
so goes your
dice field.

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:03.184
That's not good...

00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:05.322
Even my best monster
couldn't beat him !

00:09:05.322 --> 00:09:08.193
Tristan's gone,
Serenity's frozen,

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:10.064
and I'm fresh
outta ideas !

00:09:10.064 --> 00:09:14.239
I knew you mere mortals
couldn't stand up to the power

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:16.610
of a high tech machine
like me.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.047
You're a fool, Nesbitt.

00:09:18.047 --> 00:09:20.551
You know you're not
a real robot.

00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.388
Actually
it's quite sad...

00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:26.295
Deep down you're nothing but
a scared little man.

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:29.301
Soon the rest of
the Big Five and I

00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:31.672
will return to the life
we once knew,

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:36.115
except this time, we won't
have to work under Seto Kaiba !

00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:39.888
( Kaiba )
Destroying Nesbitt's
research laboratory

00:09:39.888 --> 00:09:42.794
was the smartest
decision I've ever made.

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:50.743
You've made a terrible mistake
today, Mr. Kaiba.

00:09:50.743 --> 00:09:52.913
<i>That's your opinion,</i>
<i>Nesbitt.</i>

00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:54.817
<i>I've changed the</i>
<i>direction of this company</i>

00:09:54.817 --> 00:09:57.455
<i>and there was no place</i>
<i>for your lab.</i>

00:09:57.455 --> 00:09:59.026
But sir, I've designed

00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:01.664
all of our high tech battle
vehicles in that lab.

00:10:01.664 --> 00:10:04.670
<i>We make games now, not</i>
<i>vehicles for battle</i>

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.041
<i>and unless you provide</i>
<i>me with an explanation</i>

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.078
<i>of what you can offer</i>
<i>the new Kaiba Corp,</i>

00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:12.384
<i>you'll find yourself</i>
<i>without a job, Nesbitt.</i>

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:19.331
I spent months developing
cutting edge gaming software

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:22.171
for Seto Kaiba and I hated
every second of it.

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.677
I joined Kaiba Corp to build
tanks, submarines and missiles.

00:10:25.677 --> 00:10:28.917
Come on Serenity, you've got
to get back in the game

00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:30.954
and help me defeat
this mechanical menace

00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:33.158
for Tristan's sake !

00:10:33.158 --> 00:10:36.631
This guy can only keep Tristan's
body if he wins the duel,

00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:38.736
so we have to beat
him to save Tristan !

00:10:38.736 --> 00:10:39.804
Good luck !

00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:42.075
I've got you two just
where I want you.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.912
You're down to
your last life points,

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:45.683
and she's already
given up.

00:10:45.683 --> 00:10:47.152
Victory will be mine !

00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:58.908
Serenity, I am begging you to
get up and fight this guy.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.513
If you don't go
right now you'll lose !

00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:02.616
That is correct.

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.787
The female must
make a move.

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:06.790
Keep your
bolts together !

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.193
She's gonna go !

00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:10.330
She has two minutes
to comply,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.468
otherwise I'll
consider it a forfeit

00:11:12.468 --> 00:11:15.339
and she'll join her
friend Tristan.

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:16.609
( Duke )
It's hopeless.

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.379
Wait a sec !

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.016
I know what may help !

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.687
Serenity-- Tristan
and I need you !

00:11:22.687 --> 00:11:25.359
Just like Joey
needs you when he duels !

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:27.297
No one needs me.

00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:28.966
Oh wait !

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:31.471
And now, my beast
can't be stopped !

00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:35.278
So feel his ancient
fury !

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:39.620
My brother !

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.357
I can't watch !

00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:42.826
It's just too
much !

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:44.663
Serenity--
Come back !

00:11:44.663 --> 00:11:46.667
Don't leave me now !

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:48.103
I need you.

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:50.174
I can't get through this
duel without you here !

00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:53.180
You're my biggest
inspiration, Serenity !

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.586
( Serenity )
My brother and I never give
up on each other.

00:11:56.586 --> 00:11:59.392
So why should I give up
when my friends need me ?

00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:01.161
I can't let them
down !

00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:03.466
It's my move,
metal mouth !

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.036
You tell him !

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.276
( Joey )
I'm coming,
Serenity !

00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:10.246
Does Joey even have
the slightest idea

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:12.217
where he's
going, Yugi ?

00:12:12.217 --> 00:12:15.890
I doubt it, but at this point
his guess is as good as mine !

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.761
Hey check it out !

00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:19.263
That could be
the way !

00:12:23.538 --> 00:12:24.841
Where are we ?

00:12:24.841 --> 00:12:27.780
Serenity !

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.617
Up here !

00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:33.391
It's really you ?

00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:34.927
Of course !

00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:36.396
Who'd you expect ?

00:12:36.396 --> 00:12:37.598
Yugi !

00:12:37.598 --> 00:12:38.701
Téa !

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:39.769
Hey, Duke !

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:41.506
It's good to
see ya !

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:44.546
Sorry to interrupt this
touching reunion...

00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.550
But I have
a duel to win

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.587
and a virtual world
to escape.

00:12:48.587 --> 00:12:50.056
Just what
we thought !

00:12:50.056 --> 00:12:51.058
Right, Yuge...

00:12:51.058 --> 00:12:53.062
He must be one of
the Big Five !

00:12:53.062 --> 00:12:54.565
Hey...
Where's Tristan ?

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.935
Yeah, wasn't he
with you ?

00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:56.937
No.

00:12:56.937 --> 00:12:59.041
Tristan...
is gone.

00:12:59.041 --> 00:13:00.210
He lost.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.278
Oh no !

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:02.681
He lost ?

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:03.716
Hold on !

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:04.718
That means...

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.454
Oh no !

00:13:06.454 --> 00:13:08.291
Tristan !

00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:09.660
That tin-plated
creep

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.099
is gonna be strutting
around in Tristan's body ?

00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:13.101
No way !

00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:14.170
Come on !

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.441
He tried his
best...

00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:18.678
He was only
trying to protect me

00:13:18.678 --> 00:13:21.417
and now we may never
get him back !

00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.520
Aw, man.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.089
They need
help !

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:26.795
You should see if you
can enter the duel, Joey,

00:13:26.795 --> 00:13:29.166
to take Tristan's place
and help him !

00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:30.701
Good idea !

00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.039
All right, make
room for me !

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:34.041
Negative.

00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.179
Intruders are forbidden
to duel.

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:37.482
Figures...

00:13:37.482 --> 00:13:39.485
Okay, listen up !

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.924
Whatever you do, don't
give up Serenity !

00:13:41.924 --> 00:13:45.931
I'm here for you and
I know you can do this !

00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:48.001
I'm gonna be your
guardian angel,

00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:50.307
way up here
in the rafters !

00:13:50.307 --> 00:13:52.478
Got that ?

00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:54.582
Now show him what
you got, sis !

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:55.917
Thanks, Joey.

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.720
Go get him !

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.857
He's all yours.

00:13:58.857 --> 00:14:02.563
Never mess with
the Wheelers, tin man !

00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:05.569
I'm afraid it's too late
for all of you.

00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:08.307
This one's
for Tristan !

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:09.343
Now...

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:13.451
Yes ?

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.188
( Serenity )
As Joey and Yugi
would say,

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.359
"I have to
trust my cards."

00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:19.897
Serenity, you already
know everything

00:14:19.897 --> 00:14:22.168
you need to in
order to beat this guy.

00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:23.771
Right !

00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:26.176
( Serenity )
I just have to remember
everything Tristan taught me

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:27.444
that day...

00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:31.252
Hey, Tristan...

00:14:31.252 --> 00:14:33.657
Do you think that you can teach
me how to play Duel Monsters

00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:35.427
'til we get
to Battle City ?

00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:37.364
Well...
I guess so.

00:14:37.364 --> 00:14:38.767
Now let's see...

00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:40.403
I think you know this,

00:14:40.403 --> 00:14:42.407
but when two monsters
are battling each other,

00:14:42.407 --> 00:14:44.812
the one with the highest
attack points wins.

00:14:44.812 --> 00:14:47.217
Another rule is that some
monsters are so strong,

00:14:47.217 --> 00:14:49.120
you can't play
'em right away.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.627
You have to sacrifice one or
more weaker monsters first.

00:14:52.627 --> 00:14:55.833
And you can tell how
powerful a monster is

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:58.271
by counting how many
stars it has.

00:14:58.271 --> 00:15:01.077
The more stars that you
see on the bottom of the card,

00:15:01.077 --> 00:15:02.947
the stronger the
monster is.

00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:05.518
There are stars all
over the monster cards ?

00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:07.956
They must look so pretty,
huh, Tristan !

00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:10.595
Well... yeah,
I guess they do.

00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:12.098
And one more thing

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:14.602
You can fuse your
monsters together,

00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:17.341
but to do that you
need a special magic card.

00:15:17.341 --> 00:15:20.214
It's called Polymerization,
and it rocks !

00:15:20.214 --> 00:15:22.752
So sacrificing
and Polymerization.

00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:24.021
That's right.

00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:25.023
Cool !

00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:28.162
Thanks, Tristan.

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:30.801
( Serenity )
So I have to sacrifice
my weak monster

00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:32.704
to summon
a stronger one !

00:15:32.704 --> 00:15:34.207
Well...

00:15:34.207 --> 00:15:37.047
That means if I want to summon
the strong monster in my hand,

00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:40.353
I have to get rid of my
weaker Lady Panther first !

00:15:40.353 --> 00:15:43.024
Maybe this game isn't so
tough after all !

00:15:43.024 --> 00:15:45.028
So here goes...

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:47.132
I sacrifice Lady Panther

00:15:47.132 --> 00:15:50.072
so I can summon
Marie The Fallen One !

00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:54.146
Good !

00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.149
( Duke )
I hope Serenity getting
the hang of this,

00:15:56.149 --> 00:15:58.020
'cause if she messes
this up now,

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.360
Nesbitt will win
the duel in his next turn !

00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:06.603
( Serenity )
I've got the monsters
I want...

00:16:06.603 --> 00:16:08.907
Now I need
that Polymerization card

00:16:08.907 --> 00:16:10.611
so I can fuse them
together !

00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:11.947
( Goddess )
Serenity.

00:16:11.947 --> 00:16:13.149
Was that you ?

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:14.919
Fear not,
Serenity.

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:18.694
As your Deck Master I carry
with me a very special ability.

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:20.630
The power of
fusion.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.834
I have the ability
to combine two or more

00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.371
of your monsters
together

00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:27.209
without the need for
a Polymerization card.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.351
But you must discard
one magic card

00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:34.123
in order to
activate my ability.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:40.402
Okay, now feast your eyes on
this little number, Nesbitt !

00:16:40.402 --> 00:16:42.973
First I'll dispose
of this, so then

00:16:42.973 --> 00:16:47.983
I can activate the special
ability of my Deck Master !

00:16:47.983 --> 00:16:50.021
Fusion Vision...
go !

00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:51.457
Goddess With
The Third Eye,

00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:53.294
fuse together Marie
The Fallen One

00:16:53.294 --> 00:16:56.600
and The Forgiving
Maiden to form Saint Joan !

00:16:59.873 --> 00:17:01.242
Impressive...

00:17:01.242 --> 00:17:03.681
But I'm afraid your monster
isn't powerful enough

00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:05.183
to take me on.

00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:07.754
What's going on ?

00:17:07.754 --> 00:17:08.756
This can't be !

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:14.802
Awesome !

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:17.173
Command Angel's
special power kicked in !

00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:20.546
It raised the strength of every
fairy monster on the field,

00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:22.083
including Saint Joan !

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.356
Thanks to Tristan's monster
card we can still do this !

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:28.695
Now her Saint Joan has
3,200 attack points.

00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:30.466
Yeah but his
Perfect Machine King's

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.168
still has more points...

00:17:32.168 --> 00:17:34.574
Saint Joan needs
another power boost !

00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:36.310
But how can she
get that ?

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.447
Tristan's card !

00:17:38.447 --> 00:17:40.084
Hey, guys--
Listen !

00:17:40.084 --> 00:17:42.322
I think I know
how you can do this,

00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:44.693
but you're going to need
Tristan's help !

00:17:44.693 --> 00:17:46.162
Trust me on this !

00:17:46.162 --> 00:17:48.266
How can Tristan
help us ?

00:17:48.266 --> 00:17:50.872
He's not...
Well, you guys know.

00:17:50.872 --> 00:17:52.241
No more
discussion.

00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:54.412
Make your move
now !

00:17:54.412 --> 00:17:56.382
( Duke )
What's Yugi talking about ?

00:17:56.382 --> 00:17:58.453
That's it !

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:01.326
Tristan still has a card
face down on the field !

00:18:01.326 --> 00:18:02.861
It's our last hope !

00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:06.001
I'm putting all my faith
in that card !

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.641
Now I activate my Deck Master's
Special Ability !

00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:11.078
What ?

00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:13.182
Strike Ninja
do your stuff !

00:18:13.182 --> 00:18:16.455
Activate the card Tristan left
face down on the field !

00:18:16.455 --> 00:18:17.457
No !

00:18:17.457 --> 00:18:19.861
I just gotta ditch
two cards first

00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.301
and hope that Tristan left
us something worth using...

00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:25.538
I guess it's time to
find out now.

00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:26.674
This better work.

00:18:26.674 --> 00:18:28.211
Go Strike Ninja !

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:30.115
Raise his face
down card !

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:42.939
He left us
Rare Metal Soul !

00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:43.941
Awesome !

00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:45.744
Looks like Tristan
came through !

00:18:45.744 --> 00:18:47.481
Too bad for Nesbitt !

00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:52.057
Rare Metal Soul raises Saint
Joan's attack points by 1,000 !

00:18:56.098 --> 00:18:57.534
That's impossible !

00:18:57.534 --> 00:18:59.237
Now their attack points
are tied !

00:18:59.237 --> 00:19:00.239
What happens ?

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:01.341
Just watch.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.479
Okay... Do the honors,
Serenity,

00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:06.985
and get rid of this rusty old
pile a junk once and for all !

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:08.221
All right !

00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:12.062
Go, St. Joan, and attack the
Perfect Machine King now !

00:19:33.837 --> 00:19:35.808
( Yugi )
Since Perfect Machine
King was the Deck Master,

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:38.179
he automatically
loses the duel !

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:40.751
Yeah--
Way to go, sis !

00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:41.987
You fools !

00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:45.493
I may be going offline, but
I won Tristan's body !

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:47.397
You can't do this !

00:19:47.397 --> 00:19:49.268
Hey, let him go
you creep !

00:19:49.268 --> 00:19:50.503
Negative.

00:19:50.503 --> 00:19:53.008
He's my ticket out
of this virtual prison...

00:19:53.008 --> 00:19:54.945
I'm finally free !

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.467
That mechanical snake
in the grass !

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:10.776
I don't believe it...

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:14.416
They have his body...
and it's my fault ?

00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:16.720
Serenity--
Are you all right ?

00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:21.630
It's okay, sis.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.409
Really.

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:25.444
Joey !

00:20:25.444 --> 00:20:26.578
We won the match !

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:28.647
Why didn't that bring
Tristan back ?

00:20:28.647 --> 00:20:29.715
I don't know.

00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:31.216
We'll find him.

00:20:31.216 --> 00:20:32.718
( Yugi )
They took Tristan's body,

00:20:32.718 --> 00:20:35.587
but his mind must be
here somewhere !

00:20:35.587 --> 00:20:38.190
( Téa )
I'm glad we're all
back together, you guys.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.859
Now we just
need Tristan.

00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:47.232
( Tristan )
Huh ?

00:20:47.232 --> 00:20:48.467
Wha...
Where am I ?
