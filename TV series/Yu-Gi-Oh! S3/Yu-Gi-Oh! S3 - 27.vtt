PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.504
BEFORE THE WINNER OF
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.607
CAN BE CROWNED,
WE MUST FIRST NARROW
DOWN THE FINALISTS!

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:12.045
THIS SPECIAL DUEL WILL
DETERMINE WHO FACES WHO
IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:16.116
THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS
TO REACH THE TOP WILL FACE
EACH OTHER IN ROUND 1.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.351
I GOTTA GET ME
A PIECE A' MARIK!

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.053
WHEN DIS THING STARTED,

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.656
I PROMISED YUGI DAT I'D
HELP HIM TAKE MARIK DOWN!

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.724
AND IF I FACE DAT EVIL FREAK
IN DA SEMIFINALS,

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.627
I CAN KNOCK 'IM
OUTTA DA TOURNAMENT!

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.563
I CAN'T LET JOEY LOSE!

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.465
IF HE DOES, HE MAY HAVE TO FACE
MARIK IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.501
BEAST OF GILFER...

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.736
ATTACK KAIBA'S
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.371
YOU TRIGGERED MY TRAP!

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.974
I'LL REDIRECT
YOUR ATTACK!

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.309
MY TARGET IS GOING
TO BE...

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.144
MARIK'S ONLY MONSTER!

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:48.014
OH NO!

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:51.218
I'LL MAKE SURE MARIK
AND WHEELER LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.154
SO I FACE YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.922
THEN I'LL PROVE
ONCE AND FOR ALL

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.659
THAT I AM A FAR BETTER DUELIST
THAN HE'LL EVER BE!

IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.929
THIS FOUR-WAY DUEL
IS CONFUSING!

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.196
WHAT'S THE SCORE?

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.632
WELL, SO FAR,
JOEY'S IN THE LEAD!

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.035
FOLLOWED BY YUGI
IN SECOND PLACE...

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.470
THEN YA GOT KAIBA
IN THIRD...

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.005
AND MARIK BRINGING
UP THE REAR!

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.140
IT'S MY MOVE...

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.576
AND I SUMMON DARK JEROID!

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.911
BIG DEAL!

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.947
IT'S DA WEAKEST MONSTA
ON DA FIELD, MARIK!

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.950
LITTLE DOES THAT FOOL
REALIZE THAT MY DARK JEROID

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.918
HAS A VERY
POWERFUL ABILITY!

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.920
AS SOON AS IT'S SUMMONED,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.988
IT CAN LOWER
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.291
OF ANY MONSTER
I CHOOSE BY 800!

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.027
THE QUESTION IS
"WHO SHOULD I ANNIHILATE!?"

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.896
IF MARIK ATTACKS ME,

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.065
MY RING
OF DESTRUCTION
TRAP CARD

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.499
WILL BE READY FOR
HIM!

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.501
READY TO BLAST HIS
MONSTER

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.104
INTO THE NEXT
MILLENNIUM THAT IS.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.007
I'M SURE THAT SETO KAIBA
HAS SET A TRAP FOR ME.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:58.311
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN ATTACKING HIM ANYWAY.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.382
CRUSHING THE PHARAOH
IS A MUCH MORE
APPEALING CHOICE,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.617
HOWEVER EVEN WITH
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:08.722
MY DARK JEROID ISN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEAT
HIS BEAST OF GILFER.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.424
THAT LEAVES
JUST ONE TARGET!

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.561
I'LL ATTACK GEARFRIED
THE IRON KNIGHT!

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.862
I SAW DAT COMIN'!

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.798
AND THANKS TO JEROID'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.734
YOUR BEAST GETS WEAKER!

DAT MEANS YOUR
MONSTA'S ATTACK POINTS
GET CUT IN HALF!

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.434
YES!

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.770

SO, THANKS TO ME,
WHEELER'S MONSTER

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.963
JUST LOST HALF
ITS STRENGTH!

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.733
NOW HIS CREATURE IS
AS PUNY AS HIS MIND!

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.868
DARK JEROID!

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:34.841

STAY FOCUSED, JOEY.

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:45.185
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT KAIBA JUST
HELPED MARIK OUT!

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.755
I MEAN THAT'S
ABOUT AS LOW
AS YOU CAN GET!

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.857
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
PLANNED.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.626
THAT WAS GREAT!

LAST MOVE WAS JUST PERFECT!

NOW...WHICH DUELIST
SHOULD I ATTACK?

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:05.131
KAIBA HAS BLADE KNIGHT ON
THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.201
PLUS TWO FACE DOWN CARDS
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.937
MARIK HAS
DARK JEROID IN PLAY.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.906
AND SO FAR HE'S
IN LAST PLACE.

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:16.910
BUT IF I ATTACK HIM,
KAIBA MAY PROTECT HIM AGAIN.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.880

ON THE FIELD TO SHIELD HIMSELF!

AS LONG AS KAIBA AND MARIK
FINISH LAST, HE'S SAFE.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.899
SO I COULD ATTACK
KAIBA'S BLADE KNIGHT,

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.435

ONE OF HIS FACEDOWN CARDS!

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.905

ONE CHOICE...

TIGHT SPOT.

'CAUSE HIS BEST BET
IS TO DUEL KAIBA
IN THE SEMIFINALS

AND WIN HIS EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD!

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.683

WOULD HAVE TO FACE MARIK!

A COMPLETE DISASTER!

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.350

00:10:36.578 --> 00:10:37.713

RETURN OF THE DOOMED!

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:09.544
IT BRINGS BACK
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.213
AND HIDES IT
UNDERWATER!

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.516
I BETTA THINK
A SOMETHIN' QUICK
OR I'M SUNK!

00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:17.119
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:18.687
HURRY UP
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE

00:11:18.687 --> 00:11:21.823
SO MY CREATURE OF THE DEEP
CAN STRIKE AND END THIS DUEL!

00:11:21.823 --> 00:11:24.459
IF I DRY UP MAKO'S
OCEAN,

00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:27.462
IT'LL UNCOVER
AND WEAKEN HIS
HIDDEN MONSTA!

00:11:27.462 --> 00:11:30.465
GIANT TRUNADE!

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.508

00:11:39.508 --> 00:11:42.978
YOU'VE EXPOSED
MY FISHERMAN.

00:11:42.978 --> 00:11:46.848
IT'S ALL OVER NOW,
JUST FINISH HIM OFF.

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:49.117
YOUR CHANCES OF VICTORY
HAVE VANISHED.

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.719
NOT SO FAST.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:58.527
NOW REVEAL JINZO!

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:01.029

LANDSTAR...

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.908
SO I CAN SUMMON
THIS...!

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:18.880
MY INSECT QUEEN!

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.816
EVERY ONE OF MY BATTLE
CITY VICTORIES

00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:22.250
IS PAYING OFF RIGHT NOW.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.688
THOSE DUELS GOT ME THREE
INCREDIBLE MONSTERS.

00:12:26.688 --> 00:12:30.525
I'VE COME A REALLY LONG
WAY SINCE THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT BEGAN,

00:12:30.525 --> 00:12:32.360
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF!

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.296
IF YOU REALLY WANNA
HELP ME YUGI,

00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:37.165
THEN TREAT ME
JUST LIKE YOU WOULD
ANY OTHER OPPONENT!

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:40.435
THIS IS A FOUR-WAY DUEL
AND IT'S EVERYONE
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:42.604
I DON'T WANT ANY
SPECIAL TREATMENT!

00:12:42.604 --> 00:12:43.839
LET'S GO!

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:46.041
IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ONWARD!

00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:48.210
I BELIEVE IT'S
YOUR MOVE PHARAOH!

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.811
HE'S RIGHT YUGE.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.079
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN ATTACK,

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.581
SO PICK YOUR TARGET.

00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:54.683
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU
REALLY BELIEVE IN ME,

00:12:54.683 --> 00:12:56.451
THEN YOU'LL STOP
BABYSITTIN' ME

00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:58.120
AND START TREATIN' ME
LIKE YOUR EQUAL!

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.855
BUT, JOEY, I...

00:12:59.855 --> 00:13:01.757
COME ON NOW YUGE,
NO "BUTS!"

00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:03.859
I HAVE NO MONSTAS
TO DEFEND MYSELF

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:06.194
SO YOUR SMARTEST MOVE
IS TO ATTACK ME!

00:13:06.194 --> 00:13:07.763
JOEY, NO!

00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:09.097
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

00:13:09.097 --> 00:13:11.433
JOEY DOES
HAVE THE MOST
LIFE POINTS SO FAR.

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:14.302
YEAH, BUT SINCE JOEY IS
COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS,

00:13:14.302 --> 00:13:17.472
YUGI'S BEAST OF GILFER

UP THE TOWER!

00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:18.507

IF YOU HOLD BACK
I'LL KNOW YOU DON'T

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.715
I'M ASKIN' YOU AS MY
BEST FRIEND TO ATTACK ME!

00:13:26.715 --> 00:13:28.183
WHAT IF YOU LOSE?

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.018
DAT MAY NOT BE
SO BAD.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.320
REMEMBER, THIS DUEL
ONLY DETERMINES

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.756

00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:37.459

00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:36.384

JOEY LOST MOST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS
TO YUGI'S ATTACK!

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.737
OK FOLKS.

00:15:01.737 --> 00:15:03.138

00:15:14.082 --> 00:15:15.450

SO YOU CAN ENTER
THE NEXT ROUND!

00:15:22.257 --> 00:15:26.194
JUST DO ME ONE LITTLE
FAVOR OUT THERE, HUN.

00:15:26.194 --> 00:15:30.032

FOR YOUR SISTER!

00:15:30.032 --> 00:15:32.234

TOP AGAIN...

00:15:32.234 --> 00:15:34.937
ONLY DIS TIME,
I'M DUELIN' FOR YOU MAI!

00:15:34.937 --> 00:15:37.139
I SUMMON AXE RAIDER!

00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:43.145
THIS IS HIS CHANCE TO LAUNCH
AN ATTACK ON MARIK.

00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:46.148
TIME FOR ME TO ATTACK
A CERTAIN UNLUCKY
SOMEONE...

00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:54.923
I'M CONFUSED...

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:56.592
I THOUGHT HE WAS
AFTER MARIK!

00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:57.993
YEAH ME TOO!

00:15:57.993 --> 00:16:00.128
SO WHY DID HE DIRECT
HIS ATTACK AT KAIBA?

00:16:00.128 --> 00:16:03.732
IT COULD BE THAT JOEY
FINALLY CHICKENED OUT!

00:16:03.732 --> 00:16:06.034
UNLESS THIS IS ALL PART
OF HIS STRATEGY

00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:08.437
TO MAKE SURE HE DUELS
MARIK IN THE NEXT ROUND.

00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:11.740
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
JOEY'S ATTACK'S
GONNA WORK, DUKE!

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.742
SETO WILL
JUST STRIKE BACK
BY ACTIVATING

00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:15.210
ONE OF HIS FACE
DOWN CARDS!

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.578
AXE RAIDER!

00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:18.947

BLADE KNIGHT NOW!

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:20.949

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.684
I BET KAIBA SET A TRAP!

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:26.989

00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:28.757
YOU TRIGGERED
MY TRAP!

00:16:28.757 --> 00:16:29.925

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:33.228
MEET MY RING
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:16:33.228 --> 00:16:36.264
IT ANNIHILATES WHATEVER
MONSTER WEARS IT!

00:16:36.264 --> 00:16:38.667
SO YOUR AXE RAIDER
IS HISTORY!

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:42.471
AND BOTH PLAYERS
WILL LOSE 1700
LIFE POINTS!

00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.106
NOT EXACTLY!

00:16:44.106 --> 00:16:45.774
MINE ARE SAFE!

00:16:45.774 --> 00:16:50.445
THANKS TO MY RING
OF DEFENSE MAGIC CARD!

00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:55.484
IT SHIELDS ME FROM
THE BLAST OF MY TRAP CARD!

00:16:55.484 --> 00:16:58.520
HA HA HA! OH WELL!

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.926

00:17:04.926 --> 00:17:06.695
JOEY! NO!

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:09.097
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT ALL OF JOEY'S
LIFE POINTS ARE GONE?

00:17:09.097 --> 00:17:10.565

00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:12.434

WITH MY BROTHER!

00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:13.602
HOLD ON!

00:17:13.602 --> 00:17:18.173
SOMETHING ELSE IS
GOIN' ON UP THERE!

00:17:18.173 --> 00:17:21.343
WHY HAVE MY LIFE POINTS
GONE TO ZERO!

00:17:21.343 --> 00:17:22.878
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:25.080
PLAYED DIS.
AAH!

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.817
A LITTLE CARD
CALLED GRAVEROBBER!

00:17:28.817 --> 00:17:31.920
DURING ALL THE COMMOTION
DIS LITTLE GUY

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.690
SNUCK INTO MARIK'S
GRAVEYARD AND STOLE
A CARD FOR ME!

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.125
DAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:40.328
HE GRABBED A CARD
DAT YOU USED AGAINST ME
A LITTLE WHILE AGO!

00:17:40.328 --> 00:17:43.065
DOES SPELL OF PAIN
RING A BELL?

00:17:43.065 --> 00:17:45.000
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.936
DIS CARD LETS ME
TRANSFER MY DAMAGE
TO SOMEONE ELSE!

00:17:47.936 --> 00:17:50.138
SO I THOUGHT I'D LET YOU
TAKE DA FALL MARIK!

00:17:50.138 --> 00:17:52.274
AWESOME MOVE JOEY!

00:17:52.274 --> 00:17:54.142
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
WERE ONE STEP AHEAD

00:17:54.142 --> 00:17:56.011
OF EVERYONE ELSE FOR
A CHANGE BUDDY!

00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:58.346
WAY TO GO, JOEY!
KEEP IT UP!

00:17:58.346 --> 00:17:59.448
DANKS GUYS!

00:17:59.448 --> 00:18:01.817
THAT WAS
AN AWESOME MOVE!

00:18:01.817 --> 00:18:05.287
IF JOEY WOULD HAVE ATTACKED
MARIK'S DARK JEROID WITH
HIS AXE RAIDER,

00:18:05.287 --> 00:18:07.956
MARIK WOULD ONLY
HAVE LOST 500 LIFE POINTS.

00:18:07.956 --> 00:18:10.525
SO INSTEAD,
JOEY ATTACKED KAIBA,

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:12.961
FIGURING THAT KAIBA
HAD A HIDDEN TRAP.

00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.563
AND WHEN KAIBA STRUCK BACK,

00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:17.365
JOEY WAS ABLE TO REDIRECT
THE DAMAGE AT MARIK,

00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:20.502
CAUSING MARIK
TO LOSE EVERYTHING!

00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:22.871
EXCELLENT
STRATEGY, JOEY!

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:25.907
DANKS A LOT YUGE!

00:18:25.907 --> 00:18:29.411
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ON
THE EXPRESS ELEVATOR
TA LOSERVILLE!

00:18:29.411 --> 00:18:30.912
BUH-BYE, NOW!

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:35.016
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU
SHORTLY!

00:18:35.016 --> 00:18:36.651
MARIK'S OUT!

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:39.521
AND DA NEXT DUELIST
TA LOSE, FACES HIM
IN DA SEMIFINALS!

00:18:39.521 --> 00:18:41.389
I JUST GOTA MAKE SURE
DAT'S ME!

00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:42.924
HOLD ON YOU GUYS.

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:45.260
NOW JOEY HAS
NO MONSTERS TO
PROTECT HIMSELF!

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.095
PLUS HE HAS NO
FACEDOWN CARDS.

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:48.797
AND IT'S MY
BROTHER'S TURN

00:18:48.797 --> 00:18:50.866
SO I'D SAY HE'S
IN BIG TROUBLE NOW!

00:18:50.866 --> 00:18:51.933
WE'LL SEE!

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:53.135

00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:55.470

ENOUGH FOR RIGHT NOW.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.674
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:01.643
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO!

00:19:01.643 --> 00:19:03.545
