WEBVTT

00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:02.663
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:07.501
NOW MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGONS
WILL DESTROY ALL THREE
OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:10.204
ANNIHILATE HIS
DARK MAGICIAN FIRST!

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:11.705
NOT SO FAST, KAIBA!

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.173
ACTIVATE TRAP!

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:16.210
FINE! BUT YOU'LL NEVER ESCAPE
MY OTHER TWO ATTACKS!

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.247
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR IS GONE
AND YOUR RED-EYES IS NEXT!!

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:22.349
TIME FOR RED-EYES
TO FIGHT BACK!

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.585
DESTROY HIS BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.387
WITH INFERNO FIRE BLAST!

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:29.423
YOU MAY HAVE
SAVED YOURSELF FOR NOW

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:31.358
BUT THIS DUEL'S FAR
FROM DONE!

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:32.926
I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO!

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.494
BUT AS LONG
AS I HAVE FAITH

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.363
IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS
AND IN MY FRIENDS,

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:38.365
I KNOW I CAN WIN THIS!

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.033
WAKE UP, MAN!

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.037
YUGI'S IN TROUBLE
AND HE NEEDS
YOUR HELP NOW, JOEY!

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:53.380
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.384
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:51.171
Serenity: COME ON,
BIG BROTHER.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:53.173
PLEASE,
SAY SOMETHING.

00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:56.176
IT'S US, MAN!

00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:58.879
SERENITY?

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.181
IS DIS A HOSPITAL?

00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:02.783
DID SOMEONE GET HURT?

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:05.519
YEAH, JOEY, SOMEONE WAS
KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS!

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:08.855
WAIT A SEC!
DID I PASS OUT?

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:11.291
IS DAT WHY EVERYONE'S
SO HAPPY TO SEE ME?

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.193
OH, JOEY!

00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:15.529
HEY. AWWW, SERENITY.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.499
JOEY! I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE AWAKE!

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.567
ME TOO.

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:23.537
ME THREE!
YOU SCARED US!

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:26.640
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!
YOU CAN'T BE AWAKE!

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.776
SOMEONE IN YOUR
CONDITION COULD NEVER
RECOVER THIS FAST!

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:33.146
DON'T EVER PULL THIS AGAIN,
YOU HEAR ME!?

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.583
I MEAN, YOU HAD THE GIRLS
REALLY WORRIED.

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.720
OF COURSE I KNEW
YOU'D MAKE IT ALL ALONG.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.489
TRISTAN? OH, WAIT!

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.258
I THINK I REMEMBA!
I WAS DUELIN'!

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:47.127
IT WAS ME
AGAINST MARIK!

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:52.265
AND I WAS FIGHTIN'
TA SAVE MAI!

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:54.201
BUT WHY IS SHE
STILL SLEEPIN'?

00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.738
MAI! WAKE UP!

00:02:57.738 --> 00:02:59.406
COME ON!

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:02.409
YOUR MIND'S SUPPOSED
TA BE BACK FROM
DA SHADOW REALM!

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.746
I WAS SURE
DAT DEFEATING MARIK
WOULD SAVE YA!

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:11.418
I DID DEFEAT MARIK,
DIDN'T I? DIDN'T I?

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:14.554
Joey: PLEASE, JUST GIVE IT
TA ME STRAIGHT, GUYS!

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:18.058
I REMEMBA.
I HAD DAT WEIRDO BEAT!

00:03:18.058 --> 00:03:21.128
Serenity: UM, ACTUALLY,

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:25.232
JOEY, I'M AFRAID
YOU LOST. MARIK WON.

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:28.535
THERE'S NO WAY!
I KNOW I WON!

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.238
I SUMMONED GEARFRIED
THE IRON NIGHT
AND CRUSHED HIM!

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:33.740
PLEASE, JOEY!
JUST LISTEN!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.209
YOU GUYS WERE PLAYING
A SHADOW GAME.

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.245
AND YOU ALMOST WON,

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:40.781
BUT MARIK WAS
WEARING YOU DOWN

00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:42.682
BY DRAINING YOUR ENERGY.

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:44.885
BUT THEN, WITH YOUR
LAST BIT OF STRENGTH

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:47.087
YOU WERE ABLE
TO SUMMON A MONSTER

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.656
STRONG ENOUGH
TO BEAT MARIK.

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:52.392
BUT BEFORE YOU HAD
A CHANCE TO CALL OUT
YOUR ATTACK,

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:59.433
YOU PASSED OUT.

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:04.938
I DON T BELIEVE DIS.
DAT PSYCHO ACTUALLY
BEAT ME?

00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:06.873
I GAVE IT
MY ALL, MAI.

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.309
I'M SORRY. I TRIED.

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:14.114
BUT DIS THING IS FAR
FROM OVER!

00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:16.550
Man, on radio:
THIS IS RESCUE COPTER ONE.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.251
WE ARE DESCENDING
UPON KAIBA CORP ISLAND

00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:21.254
TO TRANSPORT
THE CRITICAL PATIENT.

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.462
Kaiba: SORRY, YUGI!

00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:31.331
BUT YOU'RE STILL
AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE
IN THIS DUEL!

00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:32.999
Yugi: REALLY?

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.635
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE WE
BOTH HAVE TWO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:38.004
PERHAPS,
BUT MY TWO BLUE-EYES

00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:41.107
ARE MORE POWERFUL
THAN EITHER OF
YOUR CREATURES!

00:04:41.107 --> 00:04:45.078
NOW I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN!

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:46.580
YOUR MOVE, YUGI.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.115
WITH THESE CARDS IN PLACE,

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.117
YUGI WILL NEVER ESCAPE!

00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:54.688
KAIBA'S DEFINITELY UP
TO SOMETHING. BUT WHAT!?

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:57.791
WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY
TO GO, KAIBA!

00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.760
THIS MAGIC CARD COULD
COME IN HANDY LATER,
BUT FOR NOW

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.663
I HAVE HIS TWO BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGONS
TO WORRY ABOUT!

00:05:03.663 --> 00:05:05.665
THEY COULD DO
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE

00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:08.735
SO I HAVE TO PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.137
I'LL PLACE THIS
FACEDOWN.

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:16.009
AND THEN I LL SWITCH
MY RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.544
NOT QUITE!

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:20.747
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD!

00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:23.383
NO! NOT THAT TRAP!

00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:26.486
IT RETURNS
MY RED-EYES BACK
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:28.154
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT!

00:05:28.154 --> 00:05:31.658
AS LONG AS MY FINAL ATTACK
ORDERS TRAP CARD IS IN PLAY,

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:34.528
EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD
STAYS IN ATTACK MODE!

00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:37.531
AND NEXT, WE EACH CHOOSE
ANY THREE CARDS WE WANT

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:39.466
IN ORDER TO FORM A NEW DECK

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:42.469
AND THE REST OF OUR DECK GOES
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.138
OUR WHOLE DECK!?

00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:49.609
THAT MEANS THIS DUEL
COMES TO AN END
IN THREE MORE TURNS!

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:53.647
THESE THREE CARDS
ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO ENSURE MY VICTORY!

00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:56.316
IN A FEW SHORT MOMENTS
I'LL CRUSH YUGI

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.785
AND RECLAIM
MY NUMBER ONE STATUS!

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:00.253
NOW THEN

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:04.090
YOU MAY AS WELL GIVE UP
AND ACCEPT DEFEAT NOW, YUGI,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.394
BECAUSE MY STRATEGY
IS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:09.963
I CAN ONLY CHOOSE
THREE OF THESE CARDS
TO HOLD ON TO

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:12.265
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
GOES AWAY!

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:15.268
MY FATE DEPENDS
ON THIS CHOICE!

00:06:19.501 --> 00:06:21.636
WHERE IS YUGI?
DID HIS DUEL START YET!?

00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:23.939
YES HE'S DUELING
AGAINST KAIBA RIGHT NOW!

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.509
WHAT?! WELL DEN I GOTTA GET
UP THERE AND HELP HIM OUT!

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.111
DON'T, JOEY!

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.447
TEA, IT'S NO USE TRYN'
TA TALK ME OUT OF IT.
HE NEEDS ME!

00:06:32.447 --> 00:06:33.882
JOEY, WAIT!

00:06:33.882 --> 00:06:36.118
HEY! GET BACK IN BED,
RIGHT NOW!

00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:40.155
KAIBA CORP EMERGENCY SQUAD!

00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:42.758
WE'RE HERE TO TRANSPORT
THE PATIENT! WHERE IS HE!?

00:06:42.758 --> 00:06:44.192
RIGHT HERE.

00:06:44.192 --> 00:06:45.560
HUH? HIM?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.430
WELL HE WAS IN
CRITICAL CONDITION
A MINUTE AGO!

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.834
DON'T BE LYIN', DOC!
FIVE MINUTES AGO!
I'M DOIN' FINE NOW!

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:54.870
I'M IN DA BEST SHAPE
A MY CAREER, DOC!

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.471
JUST LOOK AT THESE PYTHONS!

00:06:56.471 --> 00:06:58.073
YOU LISTEN TO ME!

00:06:58.073 --> 00:07:00.342
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR YOU TO LEAVE NOW!

00:07:00.342 --> 00:07:02.244
YOU STILL NEED
AN EXAMINATION!

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:04.012
MAYBE LATER.

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:05.514
COME ON, YOU GUYS!

00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:06.515
HEY!

00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:08.116
DON'T GO!

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:10.185
HUH?

00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:12.587
JOEY, YOU SHOULD
STAY BACK HERE.

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:15.123
PLEASE JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT THE DOCTOR
SAYS.

00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:18.593
STOP WORRYIN' WILL YA?
CAN'T YA SEE I'M ALL RIGHT NOW?

00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:20.195
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:22.497
YOU WERE JUST
IN REALLY BAD
SHAPE, JOEY!

00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:24.933
AND ALL OF US
WERE WORRIED SICK
ABOUT YOU!

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:28.370
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
STAND THERE AND PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE?

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.139
IT'S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN HURT

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.308
BECAUSE OF
THIS TOURNAMENT,
THAT'S ALL.

00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:36.845
TRUST ME. I KNOW.

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:39.214
BUT I HAVE TO GO
AND BE THERE FOR YUGI!

00:07:39.214 --> 00:07:40.849
SORRY, GUYS!

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.651
BUT, JOEY!

00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:44.586
LOOK, I KNOW I HAD YA
ALL SCARED

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:47.689
BUT I CAME BACK
FOR A REASON! GET IT?

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:51.326
I MADE A PROMISE TO YUGI
WHEN DIS WHOLE DING STARTED!

00:07:51.326 --> 00:07:54.629
I SAID I'D HELP HIM DEFEAT MARIK
AND SAVE THE WORLD!

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:58.533
HE DOES NEED YOU.
HE TOLD ME. OH!

00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:01.903
I JOINED THIS TOURNAMENT
TO SAVE MANKIND.

00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:05.907
AND JOEY VOWED TO HELP ME.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:08.743
DIS IS ABOUT MORE
THAN JUST MY PRIDE, TEA.

00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:11.146
IT'S ABOUT BEIN' TRUE
TO MY PROMISE, SEE?

00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:13.715
NOT ONLY WOULD I BE
LETTIN' YUGI DOWN,

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.651
I D BE LETTIN' DOWN
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
ON EARTH, TEA!

00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:19.488
IF MARIK WINS THIS TOURNAMENT,
HE'LL HAVE ENOUGH POWER

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:21.356
TO CAUSE SOME MAJOR DAMAGE

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.626
AND THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN LET DAT HAPPEN!
GOT IT!?

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.362
SO I'M AFRAID MY MIND'S
MADE UP, GUYS!

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:29.097
I'M GOIN' OUT THERE NOW!

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:30.465
I UNDERSTAND.

00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:32.634
DANKS.

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:34.769
WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE, GO!!

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.872
RIGHT! TAKE CARE OF MAI,
SERENITY!!

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:39.274
OK AND BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE!

00:08:39.274 --> 00:08:43.411
HEY! COME BACK
HERE NOW!

00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:44.946
SORRY FOR ALL THIS!

00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:46.414
WAIT UP, JOEY!

00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:47.716
WELL, HERE WE GO!

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:52.554
I NEED
A NEW CAREER.

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:56.525
NOW, I CAN ONLY KEEP
THREE CARDS.

00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:59.628
I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHICH THREE CARDS
KAIBA CHOSE.

00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:01.730
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HIS STRATEGY

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.832
IN ORDER TO COME UP
WITH A WAY TO STOP HIM!

00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:05.066
LET'S SEE.

00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:06.768
IF I WERE KAIBA,
WHAT WOULD I DO?

00:09:06.768 --> 00:09:09.504
HE'S GOT TWO
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGONS
ON THE FIELD!

00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:11.506
SO I BET HE'LL WANT
TO BRING HIS THIRD ONE

00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:13.141
BACK FROM
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:15.577
FOR THAT HE'LL NEED
MONSTER REBORN!

00:09:15.577 --> 00:09:17.946
THEN HE'LL PROBABLY
WANT TO FUSE THEM
ALL TOGETHER

00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:20.148
TO FORM BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:22.951
AND FOR THAT HE'LL NEED
A POLYMERIZATION CARD!

00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:25.287
BUT WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S
REALLY HIS PLAN.

00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:27.455
OH WELL,
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:29.491
SO I'LL PICK
THESE THREE CARDS.

00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.393
AND I'LL HOPE
FOR THE BEST!

00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:34.329
IT'S ALL UP
TO DESTINY, NOW!

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:35.897
IT'S YOUR MOVE, KAIBA!

00:09:35.897 --> 00:09:37.866
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH!

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.668
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:41.403
WHAT CARDS YOU'RE HOLDING?

00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:48.009
THIS DUEL BELONGS TO ME!
NOW STAND BACK! READY?!

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:51.580
'CAUSE IT'S TIME FOR
THE FUN PART. ENJOY!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.649
I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD,
MONSTER REBORN!

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.484
I KNEW IT!

00:09:56.484 --> 00:09:58.486
I TAKE IT YOU'RE AWARE
OF WHICH MONSTER

00:09:58.486 --> 00:10:03.592
I'M PLANNING TO BRING BACK
FROM MY CARD GRAVEYARD.

00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:07.429
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:09.898
NOW I HAVE THREE!

00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:13.835
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE THIS!

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:16.438
IF HE ALREADY HAD
POLYMERIZATION
ON THE FIELD,

00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:18.240
THEN WHAT'S IN HIS DECK?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.914
NOW I SHALL FUSE
MY THREE DRAGONS TOGETHER!

00:10:25.914 --> 00:10:27.983
HA HA HA HA!

00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:31.486
SAY HELLO TO MY BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:38.026
NOTHING YOU DO CAN STOP
MY THREE-HEADED BEAST!

00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:40.996
HE'S RIGHT!
THAT'S KAIBA'S
STRONGEST MONSTER

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:43.431
AND I HAVE NOTHING
ON THE FIELD
THAT CAN BEAT IT!!

00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:45.467
I BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING FAST!

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:48.303
LOOK CLOSELY!
FOR THIS IS THE CREATURE

00:10:48.303 --> 00:10:52.107
THAT WILL STRIP YOU
OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:10:56.738 --> 00:10:59.240
Kaiba: I HAVE YOU EXACTLY
WHERE I WANT YOU--

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.478
TREMBLING IN FEAR
BEFORE MY BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:07.282
YUGI, I'VE PLAYED OUT
THIS EXACT MOMENT IN MY MIND

00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:09.384
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN!

00:11:09.384 --> 00:11:10.985
AND NOW HERE WE ARE

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:13.821
AT THE TOP OF
MY DUEL TOWER FACE TO FACE!

00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:16.157
AND ALL YOU HAVE
TO HANG ON TO IS SOME ROCK

00:11:16.157 --> 00:11:18.259
FROM 5,000 YEARS AGO.

00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:20.862
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS DUEL IS ABOUT THE PAST.

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:22.397
THAT'S TRUE.

00:11:22.397 --> 00:11:25.700
I KNOW!

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.102
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT
SOME ANCIENT BATTLE

00:11:28.102 --> 00:11:30.171
YOU THINK WE FOUGHT
IN ANOTHER LIFE,

00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:32.707
BECAUSE YOU SAW
A PICTURE ON A STONE!

00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:35.476
WHEN I SAY THIS DUEL IS
ABOUT THE PAST

00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:39.347
I MEAN IT'S ABOUT BURYING
THE PAST FOR GOOD!

00:11:39.347 --> 00:11:41.582
YUGI, ONCE I DEFEAT YOU

00:11:41.582 --> 00:11:45.386
AND GO ON TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT
I'LL BE NUMBER ONE, NOT YOU!

00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:46.554
I'VE HEARD.

00:11:46.554 --> 00:11:48.356
YES BUT THERE'S MORE.

00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:50.625
I'LL ALSO BE CLOSING
THE BOOK ON MY PAST

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:54.629
SO I CAN CONCENTRATE
ON MY FUTURE!

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:58.032
YOU SEE, EVER SINCE I WAS
DROPPED OFF AT THE ORPHANAGE

00:11:58.032 --> 00:12:01.202
AS A CHILD, I'VE HAD
TO FEND FOR MYSELF!

00:12:01.202 --> 00:12:04.205
I HAD TO TOUGHEN UP
TO PROTECT MOKUBA.

00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:08.776
THEN WE WERE ADOPTED
BY A TYRANT KNOWN
AS GOZABURO KAIBA!

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:12.146
HE TAUGHT ME TO CRUSH
MY ENEMIES AND TRUST NO ONE,

00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:14.716
BUT NOTHING I EVER DID
SATISFIED HIM!

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:18.252
SO USING THE RUTHLESS BUSINESS
TECHNIQUES HE TAUGHT ME,

00:12:18.252 --> 00:12:21.456
I OUTSMARTED HIM
AND TOOK OVER HIS COMPANY!

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:24.959
NOW KAIBA CORP BELONGS TO ME!

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:27.362
AND HE'S LONG GONE.

00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:29.564
BUT THAT'S STILL
NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:32.567
THERE'S ONE CONQUEST
I NEED TO FULFILL!

00:12:32.567 --> 00:12:34.769
AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN, YUGI!

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:38.239
SO LISTEN! I'M THE BEST
AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO!

00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:42.443
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BEING
THE BEST AT DUEL MONSTERS
YOU ARE IN MY WAY!

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:46.748
SO ONCE I BEAT YOU
I CAN FORGET THE PAST FOR GOOD!

00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:51.085
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE!

00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:55.490
I NEVER KNEW SETO FELT
SO STRONGLY ABOUT OUR PAST.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.326
I KNOW THINGS WEREN'T EASY
BACK THEN,

00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:00.395
BUT WE DID HAVE EACH OTHER.

00:13:00.395 --> 00:13:02.730
I GUESS THAT WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.766
HE WANTS TO FORGET
EVERYTHING,

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:06.968
INCLUDING THE PERSON
HE USED TO BE.

00:13:06.968 --> 00:13:11.372
BUT I LIKED SETO BACK THEN.
HE ACTUALLY USED TO SMILE.

00:13:11.372 --> 00:13:14.409
NOW HE WANTS TO GET RID
OF THAT SMILE FOREVER!

00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:17.345
SETO NEEDS TO REALIZE
THAT REACHING THE TOP

00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:19.414
DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN
BEING MISERABLE!

00:13:19.414 --> 00:13:22.917
FACE IT, YUGI,
YOUR REIGN IS OVER!

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:25.053
YOU NEVER CEASE
TO AMAZE ME.

00:13:25.053 --> 00:13:26.421
[CHUCKLING]

00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:27.889
WHY?

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:31.159
ARE YOU ASTOUNDED BY
MY SUPERIOR DUELING
SKILLS, YUGI?

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.427
NOT QUITE!

00:13:32.427 --> 00:13:33.861
IT'S YOUR COMPLETE
STUBBORNNESS

00:13:33.861 --> 00:13:37.198
AND YOUR LUST
FOR POWER THAT I FIND
SO PUZZLING, KAIBA!

00:13:37.198 --> 00:13:38.733
WHY'S THAT?

00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:41.302
IT HOLDS YOU BACK!
THAT'S WHY!

00:13:41.302 --> 00:13:42.637
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME

00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:44.939
WITH A HEART FULL
OF HATRED AND MISTRUST!

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:47.508
HA! YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO DISTRACT ME

00:13:47.508 --> 00:13:49.477
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
OF LOSING!

00:13:49.477 --> 00:13:52.146
WHY DON'T I LET
MY ACTIONS SPEAK FOR ME?

00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:54.348
REVEAL FACEDOWN CARD!

00:13:54.348 --> 00:13:56.517
MY DOUBLE SPELL
MAGIC CARD!

00:13:56.517 --> 00:13:59.020
OH NO! NOT DOUBLE SPELL!

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.088
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:01.756
THIS CARD DUPLICATES
THE EFFECTS

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:05.226
OF EVERY MAGIC CARD
YOU USED ON YOUR
LAST TURN, KAIBA!

00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:08.663
THAT INCLUDES
MONSTER REBORN
AND POLYMERIZATION!

00:14:08.663 --> 00:14:13.167
SO FIRST I'LL BRING
BUSTER BLADER BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.536
NOW I'LL USE
POLYMERIZATION!

00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:22.143
FUSING MY DARK MAGICIAN
WITH MY BUSTER BLADER!!!

00:14:22.143 --> 00:14:26.314
FUSE WHATEVER YOU WANT,
MY ULTIMATE DRAGON IS
STILL STRONGER!

00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:29.450
YOUR MAGIC CARD
DIDN'T HELP YOU AT ALL!

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.952
YOU'RE WRONG, KAIBA!

00:14:30.952 --> 00:14:32.887
FOR MY NEW
FUSION MONSTER
CARRIES WITH IT

00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:35.656
EVERY ONE
OF BUSTER BLADER'S
SPECIAL ABILITIES!

00:14:35.656 --> 00:14:37.925
THAT MEANS
ITS ATTACK STRENGTH
INCREASES

00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:41.095
BY 500 POINTS
FOR EVERY DRAGON
ON THE FIELD!

00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:44.265
THAT INCLUDES
YOUR BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON

00:14:44.265 --> 00:14:46.534
AS WELL AS MY
RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:49.470
NOW BEHOLD THE POWER
OF DARK PALADIN

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.473
THE ULTIMATE
MAGICAL SWORDSMAN!

00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:03.951
HA. GOOD MOVE, YUGI,
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:05.820
SORRY. LOOK CLOSER!

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.555
WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
KAIBA?

00:15:07.555 --> 00:15:09.824
YOUR MONSTER
MAY BE POWERFUL

00:15:09.824 --> 00:15:12.994
BUT IT'S STILL
600 ATTACK POINTS
WEAKER THAN MINE!

00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:16.130
WE SHALL SEE! MY MOVE!

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.700
ALL RIGHT, I'M
DEPENDING ON THIS CARD
TO WIN THE DUEL!

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.236
I HOPE IT WORKS.
'CAUSE AT THIS POINT,

00:15:22.236 --> 00:15:24.972
IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE
FOR VICTORY!

00:15:24.972 --> 00:15:28.910
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN!

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.146
THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL ENDS, YUGI!

00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:34.482
HA HA HA HA!

00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:37.685
NOW THEN, IT'S TIME TO PUT
AN END TO MY PAST FOR GOOD!

00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:41.122
AS SOON AS I WIN THIS
I CAN FINALLY MOVE ON!

00:15:41.122 --> 00:15:42.590
HOW FOOLISH!

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.126
IT'S OUR PAST
THAT MAKES US
WHO WE ARE TODAY!

00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:46.494
WHATEVER.

00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:48.729
YOU MUST REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:51.199
SO YOU CAN LEARN
FROM YOUR PAST.

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.401
YOU CAN'T IGNORE
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:55.670
DON'T YOU KNOW
IT'S OUR HISTORY

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.972
THAT SHAPES
OUR FUTURE, KAIBA!

00:15:57.972 --> 00:16:00.041
SAVE IT, YUGI!

00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.777
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON,
NOT LOOK BACK!

00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:04.579
THE PAST IS OVER!

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:07.949
AND NOTHING YOU SAY
WILL CHANGE MY MIND, YUGI!

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:10.251
I NEED TO TAKE YOU
DOWN, NOW!

00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:13.254
ONLY THEN WILL I ATTAIN
TRUE GREATNESS!

00:16:19.018 --> 00:16:20.520
Yugi: YOUR DUEL TOWER
STANDS HERE

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.323
SURROUNDED BY RUBBLE
AND DESTRUCTION.

00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:25.525
AND TO ME IT REPRESENTS
YOUR HEART.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:28.728
A STRONG OBJECT
SURROUNDED BY ANGER
AND HATRED.

00:16:28.728 --> 00:16:30.930
AND AS LONG
AS YOU'RE FUELED BY HATE

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.199
YOU CAN NEVER
DEFEAT ME, KAIBA!

00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:37.403
DON'T YOU REALIZE MY INNER RAGE
PUSHES ME FORWARD!?

00:16:37.403 --> 00:16:39.439
AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL USE
TO CRUSH YOU!

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:41.407
IF THAT'S THE CASE
THEN GO AHEAD

00:16:41.407 --> 00:16:43.643
AND DIRECT ALL
OF YOUR HATRED
TOWARDS ME.

00:16:43.643 --> 00:16:46.079
AND STRIKE ME DOWN
WITH YOUR RAGE!

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:47.714
VERY WELL.

00:16:47.714 --> 00:16:51.885
BUT I ASSURE YOU
YOU WILL LIVE TO REGRET
THOSE WORDS, YUGI!

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:55.255
BLUE-EYES ULTIMATE DRAGON
PREPARE FOR ATTACK!

00:16:55.255 --> 00:16:56.756
THIS IS IT.

00:16:56.756 --> 00:16:59.959
IF I DON'T STOP
HIS DRAGON'S ATTACK,
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:03.096
I HAFTA BELIEVE
IN MY FRIENDS
AND TRUST IN MYSELF.

00:17:03.096 --> 00:17:08.601
IF I TRULY AM DESTINED
TO FACE MARIK...

00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.870
THEN THERE'S NO WAY
KAIBA WILL WIN THIS!

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.538

MY DESTINY!

00:18:35.722 --> 00:18:37.557
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE WRONG.

00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:39.926

THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

00:19:10.523 --> 00:19:12.158

00:19:15.428 --> 00:19:17.663

ALL THREE
OF YOUR BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGONS AT ONCE!

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:55.568

ENOUGH POWER

00:19:55.568 --> 00:19:58.504
TO WIPE OUT MY DRAGONS
AND MY LIFE POINTS!

00:19:58.504 --> 00:20:06.279
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:10.650

IS STILL AHEAD

00:20:47.086 --> 00:20:49.655
WHEN I FACE MARIK
IN THE FINAL DUEL!
