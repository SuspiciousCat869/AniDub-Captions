00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:01.102
Narrator: PREVIOUSLY
ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:03.640
Yugi: WE GOTTA GET
GOING GUYS.

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.377
THE BIG FIVE MAY
HAVE TRISTAN'S BODY,

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.416
BUT HIS MIND'S GOT TO BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE!

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:10.187
Tristan:
WHOA, WHERE AM I?

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:12.023
OH NO!

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.227
THEY MADE A MONKEY
OUT OF ME!!!!

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:16.733
I AM GOZABURO'S
ONE TRUE SON.

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:19.672
NOT QUITE WHAT YOU WERE
EXPECTING IS IT SETO?

00:00:21.108 --> 00:00:22.110
YOU AND I BEING
STEP-BROTHERS?

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.049
NOAH'S STORY
IS NOTHING
BUT ONE BIG LIE

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.654
DESIGNED TO MESS
WITH MY HEAD YUGI!

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.393
THE SUPPOSED
CONVERSATION HE HAD
WITH GOZABURO

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.332
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
OVER SIX YEARS AGO,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.670
WHICH IS WHEN THIS
WAS TAKEN

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.205
BASED ON THE
IMPRINTED DATE.

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:38.676
BUT LOOK CLOSELY.

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:41.213
NOAH LOOKS THE SAME
AS HE DOES NOW!

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:43.651
HE HASN'T AGED
IN SIX YEARS!?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.034
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE.

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.374
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:05.995
♪ YU-GI-OH IS KING OF GAME ♪

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.837
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:51.416
YOU FOUR ARE
ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:54.322
YOU LOST YOUR DUELS,

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.395
SO YOU DECIDED TO JUST TAKE
WHAT YOU WANTED BY FORCE.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.699
WHICH IS SOMETHING
I WON'T TOLERATE!

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:02.205
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.542
I HIRED YOU FOOLS
TO DUEL FOR ME...

00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:08.182
SO BY LOSING AND THEN CHEATING
YOU MAKE ME LOOK WEAK!

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:10.453
LET US EXPLAIN...

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:11.656
PLEASE...SIR!

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.359
WE UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU HAVE LAWS

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.530
BUT WE MUST ESCAPE
FROM THIS PLACE!

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:17.667
AND TO DO THAT
WE NEED BODIES!

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:19.605
YOU ALREADY HAVE
ONE.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.275
THAT TRISTAN KID!

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:22.844
ONE WON'T DO!

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:25.182
SIR...WE NEED FIVE
BODIES SO WE CAN
ALL ESCAPE!

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.788
GREETINGS.

00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:29.858
I JUST CAME
TO SAY FAREWELL
BEFORE I GO.

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:32.730
NOW THAT I HAVE
A BODY OF MY OWN

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:34.500
I'M READY TO ESCAPE
TO THE REAL WORLD!

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.169
NESBITT!

00:02:35.502 --> 00:02:36.504
TECHNICALLY,
MY ROBOTS AND I

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:39.243
ARE THE ONLY ONES
THAT WON A DUEL!

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:40.679
SO TRISTAN'S BODY
BELONGS TO ME NOW!

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:43.451
A DEAL'S A DEAL,
RIGHT GENTLEMEN!?

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:45.421
YOU LOST THAT DUEL!

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:47.793
CRUMP IS RIGHT, THOSE
KIDS DEFEATED YOU
NESBITT!

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:50.631
THEREFORE THAT BODY
ISN'T YOUR PROPERTY!

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:53.871
YOU'RE GUILTY OF SEIZING
CONTROL OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S
PERSONAL POSSESSION!

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:56.844
NOT QUITE!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.681
I'M THE ONE CALLING
ALL THE SHOTS HERE

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:00.918
SO I'LL DECIDE
WHAT'S WRONG
AND RIGHT!

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:03.156
SO CAN I GO!?

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:04.926
NOT YET...

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:06.697
I HAVE A MUCH
BETTER IDEA...

00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:08.399
SO LISTEN UP!

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:09.435
Men: HUH?

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:12.474
ALL FIVE OF YOU WILL SHARE
TRISTAN'S BODY IN A DUEL

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:14.545
AGAINST SETO'S STRONGEST
RIVAL, YUGI MUTO!

00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:18.319
DEFEAT HIM AND I'LL
PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL

00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:20.624
THAT I DESERVE CONTROL
OF SETO'S EMPIRE!

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.661
AND YOU'LL GET FIVE BODIES!

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.732
WE WON'T FAIL YOU...
MASTER!

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:26.936
WE CAN'T.

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:29.340
THE ODDS OF US DISAPPOINTING
YOU ARE ZERO PERCENT.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.513
THANK YOU SIR.
GOOD DAY.

00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:36.521
[THINKING]
IT BETTER BE!

00:03:38.324 --> 00:03:39.494
Yugi: SO, NOAH'S
YOUR STEP-BROTHER,
KAIBA?

00:03:41.063 --> 00:03:42.265
THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS!

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.670
BUT IT DOES EXPLAIN
WHY NOAH BROUGHT US
ALL HERE!

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:48.678
YEAH HE WANTS TA PROVE
TA KAIBA'S STEP-DAD DAT
HE'S DA BETTA SON!

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:51.250
MM-HMM.

00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:52.786
SO TO SHOW
HIS POWER,
NOAH TEAMED UP

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:54.489
WITH THE BIG FIVE
TO DEFEAT US!

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.760
AND HE'S HOLDING
MOKUBA CAPTIVE
TO WEAKEN KAIBA!

00:03:58.798 --> 00:03:59.666
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.269
STOP RIGHT THERE!

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:02.604
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.408
GOING SOMEWHERE!?

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.479
IF SO THEN THAT'S
THE PROBLEM!

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:07.881
YOU GOT THAT KAIBA!?

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:09.685
JUST STEP ASIDE.

00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:11.823
I ALREADY TOLD YOU GEEKS,

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.628
THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS
AND IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU!

00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.000
SO MOVE IT!

00:04:18.102 --> 00:04:19.304
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, KAIBA!

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:20.339
JUST LET HIM GO, TEA!

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:22.243
HE'S NOT WORTH IT!

00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.813
YOU MAY BE TOO
CONCERNED

00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:25.249
WITH YOURSELF
TO REALIZE THIS,

00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.286
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR
"FAMILY BUSINESS"

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.589
WE'RE ALL TRAPPED
HERE!

00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:31.728
DON'T YOU REALIZE
WE CAN HELP YOU
SAVE MOKUBA!

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.569
LOOK AT ME WHEN
I'M TALKING TO YOU!

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.907
MOKUBA IS OUR FRIEND
AND WE WANNA HELP
HIM!

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:41.180
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT HIM INSTEAD!

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.751
Yugi: LOOK GUYS!
UP THERE!

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.359
TRISTAN!

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.730
DAT'S NOT TRISTAN,
REMEMBER!?

00:04:52.034 --> 00:04:53.871
IT'S THE TECHNO GEEK
OF THE BIG FIVE, NESBITT!

00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.911
EVEN THOUGH WE KICKED HIS
NERDY BUTT IN THAT DUEL,

00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:58.413
HE STILL TOOK
TRISTAN'S BODY!

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:00.617
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:03.356
I'M NOT ALONE IN HERE!

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:05.527
TODAY'S SPECIAL IS...
FIVE FOR ONE!

00:05:06.963 --> 00:05:07.965
AND THE VERDICT...
IS IN!

00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:10.504
OUR COMBINED FORCE
WILL DESTROY YOU!

00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:13.743
THEY'RE ALL USING
TRISTAN'S BODY!

00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:15.981
GIVE HIM BACK!

00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:17.050
Crump: LISTEN, YUGI!

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:19.688
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
WE'LL RETURN YOUR FRIEND.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.063
BUT BELIEVE ME JUNIOR,
THE ODDS ARE IN OUR FAVOR!

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.502
HEY THAT'S CRUMP!
SICKO!

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:29.474
ALL RIGHT, TELL US
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:31.545
TO GET TRISTAN BACK
FROM YOUR CONTROL!

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:33.381
Leichter:
WHY, DUEL US!

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:35.920
WIN AND HE'S YOURS.

00:05:37.055 --> 00:05:37.924
HOLD ON!

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:39.894
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
RETURNING THE BODY!?

00:05:41.097 --> 00:05:41.964
WE NEVER DISCUSSED THAT!

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:45.438
I'M THE ONE WHO WON
THIS BODY AND I WON'T
GIVE IT UP!

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:46.541
NESBITT!

00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:48.010
IT BELONGS TO ALL
OF US NOW

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.379
AND THIS WAS A GROUP
DECISION!

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:51.416
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TWO
ARE ACTUALLY ARGUING

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:57.094
AS IF WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP OUR WORD!

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:00.901
Crump: NOW...
LET'S DUEL YUGI!

00:06:03.941 --> 00:06:04.809
YOU FIVE ARE ON!

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:06.713
YU-GI-OH!

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:10.553
LET'S DO THIS!

00:06:11.222 --> 00:06:12.090
FOR TRISTAN!

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:13.392
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:16.031
YOUR MATH'S A LITTLE
OFF IF YOU GET MY
DRIFT!

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:18.035
FIVE ON ONE'S
UNEVEN!

00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:20.340
SO COUNT ME IN!

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.007
ARE YOU SURE?

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:22.444
YEAH! NO QUESTION!

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:24.982
DA TWO OF US
ARE A TEAM, YUGI!

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:26.885
NOW, LET'S WASTE
THESE FIVE SUITS!

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.691
YES. AND TOGETHER
WE'LL SAVE TRISTAN!

00:06:31.327 --> 00:06:32.396
Johnson: FINE, YUGI.

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:33.398
FIVE ON TWO!

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.936
THE PLAN WAS TO
DUEL YUGI ALONE!

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:39.477
DON'T YOU ALL
REALIZE THAT THAT
INFERIOR DUELIST

00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:43.518
JOSEPH WHEELER WILL
ONLY HOLD YUGI BACK

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:46.390
MAKING THIS
AN OPEN AND SHUT
CASE FOR US!?

00:06:47.358 --> 00:06:48.995
AS I RECALL THAT
"INFERIOR DUELIST"
DEFEATED YOU JOHNSON!

00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:53.437
Johnson: JUST SIT
BACK AND OBSERVE
LEICHTER

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:55.508
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO HIT THEM

00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:56.376
WITH A LEGAL
TECHNICALITY!

00:06:57.412 --> 00:06:59.416
Johnson: NOW, SINCE THIS
DUEL IS TWO BODIES
AGAINST ONE...

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.889
THE ONLY WAY FOR
JUSTICE TO BE SERVED

00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:06.028
IS FOR US TO START WITH
EIGHT THOUSAND LIFE POINTS

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:08.399
WHILE YOU TWO BEGIN
WITH FOUR THOUSAND.

00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.871
WIN AND YOU'LL BE
REUNITED WITH YOUR FRIEND.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.146
LOSE AND YOU ALL
BELONG TO US!

00:07:17.684 --> 00:07:19.087
Crump: ARE YOU TWO
READY TO LOSE!?

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:21.759
NO! 'CAUSE
YOU'RE FIGHTIN'
DA DREAM TEAM!

00:07:22.894 --> 00:07:24.998
YOU FIVE ARE
GOIN' DOWN!

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:28.105
Gansley: LET'S GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.509
CHOOSE YOUR
VIRTUAL DECKS!

00:07:32.613 --> 00:07:34.082
YOU'LL NEED ALL
THE HELP YOU CAN GET!

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:36.755
[THINKING]
HEY! MAI LOVES
THAT CARD!

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.562
ALRIGHT MY DEAR,
ENJOY YOUR TRIP
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.503
AAH!

00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:49.179
AS SOON AS WE
GET OUTTA DIS
VIRTUAL DUMP,

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:50.114
I'M GONNA RESCUE
MAI.

00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:52.652
BUT FOR NOW,
I'LL PICK HER
CYBER HARPIE

00:07:53.052 --> 00:07:53.921
FOR GOOD LUCK!

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:55.992
NOW! IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE
YOUR DECK MASTER!

00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:02.171
I CHOOSE THIS MONSTER--
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:07.948
AND I'LL TAKE
FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:11.923
SINCE THERE'S FIVE OF US,
WE'RE GOING TO ROTATE

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.127
OUR DECK MASTER MONSTER!

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:16.499
SO WE'LL START WITH THIS...

00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:18.570
MY DEEPSEA WARRIOR!

00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:20.473
A STRONG INVESTMENT!

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.477
NOW STAND BACK!

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:23.645
I'LL BEGIN!

00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:25.082
HA!

00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.119

I'LL PLAAAAAAAAY
THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:32.128
"A LEGENDARY OCEAN!"

00:08:34.032 --> 00:08:35.603
OH NO!

00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:37.940
TIME TO FLOOD THE MARKET!

00:08:39.243 --> 00:08:41.213
RUN GUYS!

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:45.154
AND NOW, I'LL SUMMON
THIS MONSTER...

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:47.492

DATS DA CARD MAKO TSUNAMI
ALMOST BEAT ME WIT!

HEY! HOLD ON!

00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:57.011
YOU HAVE TO
SACRIFICE

00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:58.647
SOMETHIN' FIRST TO
PLAY DAT CARD!

00:08:59.282 --> 00:09:01.019
IT'S TOO POWERFUL
TO SUMMON TO
THE FIELD

00:09:01.686 --> 00:09:02.555
IN YOUR FIRST MOVE!

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:04.559
WITH HIS MAGIC CARD
HE CAN!

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.928
RIGHT.
IT'S ALL TRUE.

00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:09.234
A LEGENDARY OCEAN CHANGES MY
FIVE-STAR MONSTERS TO FOUR!

00:09:12.173 --> 00:09:14.177
I'M AFRAID THIS SIMPLE FACT
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON THEM

00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:16.916
DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:09:18.987 --> 00:09:19.854
BE CAREFUL JOEY!

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.293
AS LONG AS THAT
CARD'S IN PLAY

00:09:23.027 --> 00:09:24.029
HE'S AT A DANGEROUS
ADVANTAGE!

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:25.967
DON'T WORRY YUGI.

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:28.204
WE'LL DRY UP
HIS OCEAN IN NO TIME!

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:30.241
YOU'LL SINK LONG
BEFORE THAT!

00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:32.547
YOU TAKE THE NEXT
MOVE JOEY.

00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:35.185
AND REMEMBER THESE
CORPORATE TYCOONS
CAN'T BE TRUSTED!

00:09:37.155 --> 00:09:37.823
FORGETTABOUTIT!

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:40.829
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
PUT DESE GUYS OUTTA
BUSINESS YUGI!

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:43.066
AND IT'S ALL GONNA

00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:45.070
WATCH DIS...

00:09:45.405 --> 00:09:46.272
I SUMMON

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:49.278

Tristan: I KNOW YOU

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.172
Joey, thinking:
I DON'T KNOW IF DAT METAL
CHIMP'S TRISTAN OR NOT,

00:10:03.507 --> 00:10:05.878
BUT WE'RE GONNA

00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:32.831
YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.003

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.579
Crump: READY!?

00:10:40.645 --> 00:10:41.314
HIS VOICE CHANGED!

00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:42.883
YES, THEY'VE
SWITCHED CONTROL!

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:44.720
CORRECT!

00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:46.323
I'M CRUMP, THE BIG
FIVE'S ACCOUNTANT...

00:10:47.325 --> 00:10:49.696
AND I'M AN EXPERT
IN CRUNCHING NUMBERS
AND CRUSHING MY RIVALS!

00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:52.502
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:54.372 --> 00:10:55.908
NOW MEET MY GOOD FRIEND

I ALREADY BEAT THIS
FLIPPER-FOOTED FREAK
AND SO CAN YOU!

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:09.903
Crump: THESE KIDS
DON'T REALIZE THAT
THE COUNTDOWN

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.705
TO THEIR DESTRUCTION
HAS BEGUN!

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.709
AND WITH ME DOING
THE COUNTING,

00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:15.313
THEY'LL BE OUT OF
LIFE POINTS

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.749
BEFORE THEY CAN
SAY "ANTARCTIC
ANNIHILATION!"

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:19.955
FOR MY DECK MASTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:21.324 --> 00:11:22.994
RAISES THE ATTACK
POINTS OF ALL
UNDERWATER MONSTERS!

00:11:25.532 --> 00:11:26.401
HERE GOES!

00:11:26.902 --> 00:11:28.305
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN, ATTACK
YUGI'S MYTHICAL BEAST NOW!

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:34.383
THANKS TO
THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF
MY NIGHTMARE PENGUIN,

00:11:35.752 --> 00:11:36.921
MY FISHERMAN GETS
A 200-ATTACK-POINT BONUS!

00:11:38.992 --> 00:11:40.161
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE NUMBERS BOYS!

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.300
AND YOUR NUMBER'S UP!

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:47.842
AND NEXT, I SUMMON
CATAPULT TURTLE!

00:11:51.048 --> 00:11:51.917
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:53.052 --> 00:11:54.054
HE PLAYED ANOTHER
FIVE-STAR MONSTER!

00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.060
AND DANKS TA THAT
MAGIC CARD OF HIS

00:11:57.528 --> 00:11:58.898
HE DIDN'T HAFTA MAKE
A SACRIFICE!!

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:00.367
NOT GOOD!

00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:02.906
WE GOTTA GET RID
'A HIS LEGENDARY
OCEAN CARD

00:12:03.273 --> 00:12:06.345
OR WE CAN SAY
GOOD BYE TO OUR
BODIES FOREVER YUGE!

00:12:10.754 --> 00:12:13.158
Kaibo, thinking:
YUGI AND HIS FRIENDS CAN
DEAL WITH THE BIG FIVE...

00:12:13.927 --> 00:12:14.795
I'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS!

00:12:16.532 --> 00:12:17.901
GOZABURO KAIBA ONLY
HAD ONE SON...

00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:20.306
THAT WAS ME, SETO.

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:23.045
NOAH'S STORY HAS
TO BE A LIE!

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.051
HE CLAIMS THAT THE MAN WHO
ADOPTED ME IS HIS FATHER!

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:30.292
BUT BASED ON HIS STORY,
THAT WOULD MAKE NOAH
THE SAME AGE AS ME!

00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:35.803
AND HE'S CLEARLY JUST
A SNOT-NOSED LITTLE KID!

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.311
I WONDER IF THE BIG FIVE
PUT THAT KID UP TO ALL THIS.

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:44.086
THOSE CORPORATE SLIME
BALLS WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO TAKE OVER KAIBA CORP.

00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:48.194
BUT THEY'RE TOO
DIM-WITTED TO COME UP
WITH A SCHEME LIKE THIS!

00:12:49.563 --> 00:12:52.234
THERE'S A PIECE
TO THIS VIRTUAL PUZZLE
THAT I STILL NEED TO FIND!

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:55.641
AND WHEN I DO, ALL OF THIS
NONSENSE WILL BE CLEAR!

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.615
BUT THE FIRST THING I HAVE
TO DO IS FIND MOKUBA

00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:01.052
AND RESCUE HIM
FROM NOAH'S CONTROL

00:13:02.354 --> 00:13:04.025
BEFORE THAT LITTLE
PUNK COMPLETELY
BRAINWASHES MY BROTHER!

00:13:06.094 --> 00:13:09.100
THEN I'LL SHOW NOAH THAT NO
ONE DISRESPECTS MY FAMILY
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!

00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:12.440
Joey: A'RIGHT
BIG FIVE!

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.346
YOU BODY-SNATCHERS
BETTA GIVE BACK MY
FRIEND NOOOOW!

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:18.185
'CAUSE YOU'RE AAAALL
DONE!

00:13:18.853 --> 00:13:19.521
[THINKING]
SWEET!

00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.060
IT'S MY KUNAI WITH
CHAIN TRAP CARD.

00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:24.063
DAT'S DEFINITELY
A GOOD START!

00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:26.301
I CAN USE THIS
LITTLE BABY

00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:27.470
TA REEL IN HIS
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN,

00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:29.106
HOOK, LINE
AND SINKER!

00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:31.310
NOW I PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN.

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:33.214
THAT'S YOUR
BIG MOVE!?

00:13:34.383 --> 00:13:35.251
I'M NOT DONE!

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:37.089
[THINKING]
DIS ONE'S FOR MAI!

00:13:38.024 --> 00:13:41.163
AND NOW, I SUMMON
CYBER HARPIE!

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:44.001
AND NEXT... I SWITCH
ALLIGATOR'S SWORD

00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:46.005
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:13:46.774 --> 00:13:47.776
AND DAT ENDS
MY TURN!

00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:49.245
AND STARTS MINE!

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:52.351
[THINKING]
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO PICK
UP WHERE JOEY LEFT OFF!

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.489
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

00:13:54.722 --> 00:13:56.693
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
IN MY HAND THAT CAN STOP

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:57.761
HIS LEGENDARY FISHERMAN
FROM ATTACKING!

00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:00.067
WAIT!

00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:01.302
JOEY'S FACEDOWN CARD!

00:14:02.371 --> 00:14:03.540
IT COULD BE MY ONLY HOPE!

00:14:05.076 --> 00:14:06.078
FIRST I SUMMON
MYSTICAL ELF!

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.084
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:10.486 --> 00:14:13.025
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU CAN DO, CRUMP!

00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:16.165
YOU'VE DUELED FOR
LONG ENOUGH, CRUMP!

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:18.903
JOHNSON...THE ODDS
ARE STILL IN MY FAVOR.

00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:22.242
SO STAY OUTTA THIS
UNTIL I SAY SO!

00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:24.915
AND NOOOOOOW...

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.419
SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR MYSTICAL ELF!

00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:31.594
BEHOLD!

00:14:32.696 --> 00:14:33.565
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.474
DESTROY YUGI'S MONSTER
WITH HARPOON OF DOOM!

00:14:39.743 --> 00:14:40.812
NOT SO FAST!

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.215
I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD!

00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:45.989
KUNAI WITH CHAIN!

00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:49.429
EXCELLENT MOVE, JOEY!

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:52.068
HEY WHY DA LONG
FACE?

00:14:53.337 --> 00:14:54.872
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
UPSET JUST BECAUSE

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:56.243
YOUR FISHERMAN GOT
A LITTLE TIED UP!

00:14:56.543 --> 00:14:57.545
HERE HE COMES
RIGHT NOW!

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.051
AND DANKS
TO MY CHAIN
HE CAN'T ATTACK

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.256
WHILE MY CYBER
HARPIE GETS EVEN
MORE POWERFUL!

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.530
OH WELL, AND DINGS
WERE GOIN' SO GOOD
FOR YOU, TOO!

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:12.574
MAYBE NOW YOU FIVE
FREAKS KNOW WHO
YOU'RE UP AGAINST!

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.213
HOW COULD YOU LET THEM
DO THIS, CRUMP?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.882
Johnson:
STEP ASIDE...
YOU'RE DONE!

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:20.322
I RAN THE NUMBERS
AND I STILL HAVE A HIGH
PERCENTAGE FOR VICTORY!

00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:22.961
I'LL CONCLUDE BY PLACING
ONE MONSTER FACEDOWN
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:26.367
AND THAT ENDS MY TURN!

00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:28.371
WAY TA GO, GUYS!

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.609
SOON TRISTAN'LL HAVE
HIS BODY BACK!

00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:32.880
THAT'S AWESOME!

00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:35.619
Tristan: IT'S A GOOD
START, BUT THIS DUEL'S
FAR FROM OVER.

00:15:36.688 --> 00:15:37.556
[MONKEY CHATTER]

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.496
UH, I THOUGHT WE TURNED
THAT MONKEY SWITCH OFF?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.536
SO IF THAT'S REALLY YOU
STUCK INSIDE THERE TRISTAN,

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:48.844
THEN WHY DO YOU KEEP
MAKING ALL KINDS OF
WEIRD MONKEY NOISES?

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:50.247
WHATTA YOU MEAN
"MONKEY NOISES?"

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:52.017
[MONKEY CHATTER]

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.587
OH NO! I MUST BE
GOING APE!

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:56.560
THE LONGER I STAY IN
HERE, THE MORE I
FEEL LIKE

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.229
SWINGING FROM A TREE
AND SCRATCHING MY
ARMPITS!

00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:02.137

ON YOUR SIDE OF
DA FIELD, INCLUDING
YOUR LEGENDARY OCEAN!

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:29.223

00:16:43.651 --> 00:16:45.121
CATAPULT TURTLE

DEFENSE POINTS!

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:48.627
MY ATTACK WON'T DO

00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:53.269

00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:58.413

ALLIGATOR'S SWORD, ATTACK

SORRY ABOUT DAT
YUGI!

00:17:41.196 --> 00:17:43.033
Crump: YOU FOOLS ARE MAKING
THIS WAY TOO EASY!

00:17:44.636 --> 00:17:45.505
YOU'RE DEFEATING
YOURSELVES!

00:17:46.807 --> 00:17:47.676
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:48.978
CALM DOWN CRUMP.

00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:50.615
THIS DUEL IS STILL ON!

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.917
MY MOVE! NOW--

00:17:53.253 --> 00:17:54.923
Crump, thinking:
SINCE MY LEGENDARY
OCEAN MAGIC CARD

00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:56.927
IS BACK IN MY HAND

00:17:57.094 --> 00:17:58.563
I CAN ACTIVATE IT
IN MY NEXT TURN!

00:17:58.997 --> 00:17:59.999
THEN I'LL PLAY
MONSTER REBORN

00:18:01.068 --> 00:18:02.237
AND BRING BACK MY
LEGENDARY FISHERMAN!

00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:04.475
IT ALL ADDS UP!

00:18:05.242 --> 00:18:06.713
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WHERE I WAS BEFORE!

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.752
ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM
WITH A BRAND NEW BODY
TO ESCAPE IN!

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:12.724
MY CHANCES OF SUCCESS
ARE 99 PERCENT!

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.129
ALL RIGHT CRUMP.

00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:18.335
NOW...IT'S ABOUT TIME
SOMEONE PUT YOU IN
YOUR PLACE.

00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.339
GO AHEAD!

00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:23.445
I'LL PLAY KURIBOH
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:24.814 --> 00:18:26.017
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
CARD DESTRUCTION!

00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:29.924
TOO BAD!

00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:32.663
NOW WE MUST THROW
AWAY ALL OUR CARDS

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:35.602
WHICH MEANS YOUR
LEGENDARY OCEAN CARD
IS GONE AGAIN!

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:38.408
AWESOME!

00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:40.679
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU, YUGI!

00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:44.520
NOW, IT'S TIME FOR ALL
OF US TO RE-DRAW
A BRAND NEW HAND...

00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:47.324
RIGHT CRUMP!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.197
Yugi:
I'M THROUGH FOR NOW.

00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:52.068
ALL RIGHT, YOU BRATS!

00:18:54.105 --> 00:18:54.772
YOU'VE DONE
ENOUGH CRUMP.

00:18:55.874 --> 00:18:59.181
IT'S TIME TO LAY A LITTLE
JUDGMENT ON THESE FOOLS!

00:19:00.484 --> 00:19:01.553
CRUMP HAS BEEN
DISMISSED KIDS.

00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:03.724
THEY SWITCHED AGAIN!

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:06.295
THOSE OLD DUDES ARE
PASSIN' AROUND MY BODY

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.099
LIKE IT'S GOIN'
OUTTA STYLE!

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.768
THAT'S THEIR PLAN.

00:19:10.436 --> 00:19:11.438
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE WINNING!

00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:12.807
HUH?

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:14.711
YA SEE, THIS DUEL IS
BEGINNING TO TAKE

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:16.348
ITS TOLL ON YUGI
AND JOEY!

00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:19.286
BUT THE BIG FIVE KEEP
ROTATING PLAYERS TO
KEEP THEMSELVES FRESH!

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.392
THIS ISN'T GONNA
BE EASY!

00:19:22.627 --> 00:19:23.796
TIME TO BRING YOU
TO JUSTICE!

00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:26.701
IN CASE YOU DON'T ALREADY
KNOW, THE NAME'S JOHNSON,

00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:29.240
LEGAL EXPERT
OF THE BIG FIVE.

00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:32.146
AND MY FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS IS
TO CLEAR THE FIELD

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.184
OF THIS PENGUIN
IF YOU DON'T MIND!

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:41.530
MEET JUDGE MAN!

00:19:46.306 --> 00:19:49.045
WHERE ARE YOU?!

00:19:50.614 --> 00:19:51.483
MOKUBA!!

00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:53.887
I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE!

00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:55.457
CAN YOU HEAR ME?!

00:19:56.393 --> 00:19:58.597
MOKUBA!

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:00.701
HEAR THAT?

00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:04.441
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR
SO CALLED BROTHER
IS CALLING FOR YOU.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.347
DO YOU WANT TO
ANSWER HIM, MOKUBA?

00:20:08.316 --> 00:20:09.184
NO.

00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:12.799
NOAH IS THE ONLY
BROTHER I HAVE.

00:20:16.569 --> 00:20:18.404
Kaiba, thinking:
THIS NOAH KID IS
TRYING MY PATIENCE.

00:20:19.706 --> 00:20:21.541
IF HE HAS SOME SORT OF
GRUDGE AGAINST ME,

00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:24.744
HE SHOULD HAVE THE GUTS
TO STAND UP TO ME FACE TO FACE.

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:27.647
BUT CAPTURING MY DEFENSELESS
BROTHER AND HIDING HIM IN
THIS VIRTUAL LABYRINTH

00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:34.988
ONLY SHOWS WHAT
A SPINELESS COWARD
NOAH REALLY IS.

00:20:36.522 --> 00:20:37.323
IT CAN'T BE!

00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:38.758
THAT BUILDING...

00:20:39.092 --> 00:20:39.759
IT'S...MY DESIGN!

00:20:41.227 --> 00:20:42.695
BUT I'VE NEVER SHOWN THOSE
BLUEPRINTS TO ANYONE!

00:20:44.264 --> 00:20:45.431
HOW COULD NOAH HAVE
RECREATED IT!?

00:20:46.332 --> 00:20:49.068
WHO IS THIS KID!?
