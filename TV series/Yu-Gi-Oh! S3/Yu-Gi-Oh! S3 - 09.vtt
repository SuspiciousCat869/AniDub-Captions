That breeze feels
nice... Ahh!

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.805
I guess
this virtual world

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:09.442
does have some good
points.

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:12.482
Five old creepy guys
wanna steal our bodies!

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:14.552
How can you talk about
good points?

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:16.156
Duke, chill!

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:17.825
Why should I?

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:19.462
Because!

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:23.103
I'm trying to help certain
people stay calm, Einstein.

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:24.272
Hey...
Huh?

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:26.276
You don't have to worry about
me being scared,

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:28.113
'cause you
make me feel safe!

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:29.315
I do?

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:30.485
I mean, of course!

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.423
You're always in good hands
with me!

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:35.061
Dude, she means both
of us.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.733
Look man, she means me!

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.672
You've got to do something
about that breath!

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:42.042
Is that so?

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:45.315
Guys, come on,
don't fight.

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:46.985
We've got
to work together

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:49.023
to find a way out
of here!

00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:50.660
And time's running out!

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.931
Yeah, those guys
could show up any minute.

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.068
It's only a matter of time
before we're set free

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:57.240
from this virtual prison!

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.945
Remember, when one of us
defeats you in a duel,

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:02.083
we'll claim
control of your body!

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:04.154
That's right, Duke!

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.458
And don't forget, there're
five of them.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:09.231
So they're not only
after Kaiba, Yugi and Joey.

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.803
They may also want to
duel against us.

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.239
So what?

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.477
Yeah, there's no
way we'll lose a duel!

00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:17.281
Not if we stick with
Tristan!

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.585
You're kidding,
right?

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.723
Don't you know that Tristan
taught my brother Joey

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:23.627
everything about dueling?

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:24.796
What?

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.232
What else did you tell
this poor girl

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:27.635
about yourself?

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.005
Ah, yes!

00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:30.307
I've been
a champion duelist

00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:32.144
ever since I could hold
up a card.

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:35.284
Defeating the Big Five will
be like a walk in the park!

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.756
Heh, heh, heh, heh...

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.263
Well guys, the good news
is that each of us

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:43.868
defeated one
member of the Freaky Five!

00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:45.438
Three down, two to go!

00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:46.674
The bad news is we
don't know

00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:48.644
where they're gonna
strike next!

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:51.083
Or who they're gonna
strike next!

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:52.954
Serenity, I'm coming!

00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:55.626
Joey!
Joey!

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:58.097
Please tell me we're not going
through that door!

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.868
Right, guys?

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:01.103
Well...

00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:03.709
What if it leads back home to
the real world?

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.114
And what if it
doesn't?

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:07.583
Let's just turn back.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:09.687
I hate to say it
but Duke may be right!

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.093
Come on, we'll never know unless
we try guys.

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:13.930
No, Serenity wait!

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.099
Hold on!

00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:20.142
Oh, it's too bright
to see!

00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:24.318
(groaning)

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:26.054
Looks like we're back
where we started

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:28.726
before the Big Five
sent us to virtual land!

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:31.832
But there's no sign of
the blimp in here at all.

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:34.371
This must be another part
of Noah's fortress.

00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:35.908
So are we
in the real world?

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:39.683
I don't think so...
look!

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:43.724
It's some kind of a giant
robot or something!

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.193
Greetings, humans.

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:47.097
Allow me to introduce
myself.

00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:49.736
In the outside world I was
known as Nesbitt,

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:53.477
former Vice President of New
Technology at Kaiba Corp.

00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:57.118
But here in the virtual realm
I am known as Robotic Knight,

00:03:57.118 --> 00:04:01.426
a creature that represents
the power of machine over
man.

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:03.765
As the tech expert of
the Big Five,

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:07.606
I designed some of Kaiba
Corp's most advanced
machinery.

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:09.710
And as soon as I
out-duel one of you,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.318
I'll be able to continue my
work in the real world!

00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:15.255
Now... ladies first!

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.424
Me?

00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:17.626
But I don't--

00:04:17.626 --> 00:04:19.230
I've never dueled
before!

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.269
Nesbitt, leave Serenity
out of this!

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.308
If you wanna duel someone,
duel me, you scrapheap!

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.112
(Duke)
No, fight me!

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:29.718
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into, Tristan.

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.824
This is not the time to be
showing off, man.

00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:35.596
Like you're some
kind of dueling expert?

00:04:35.596 --> 00:04:37.600
(Duke)
I've dueled more times
than you!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.206
I have challenged
the female to a duel.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.912
We shall begin our battle
immediately!

00:04:42.912 --> 00:04:44.181
Not quite.

00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:46.251
I said you're dueling
me!

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:48.557
I can't let either of these
two duel alone.

00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:50.894
I'm the most experienced
duelist here

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:52.198
and I'm the only one
with a chance

00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:54.335
of beating
this walking tin can.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.775
Besides, if he wins, he gets to
escape to the real world

00:04:57.775 --> 00:04:59.145
in one of our bodies.

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:01.416
As much as I'd like to see
Tristan squirm,

00:05:01.416 --> 00:05:03.955
the stakes
are too high!

00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:06.961
Hey, I got a great idea.

00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.733
Me and Tristan here will
both take you on.

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:12.739
Beat us and you'll get two
bodies for the price of one.

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:13.908
Negative.

00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:15.812
But you have given me
an idea.

00:05:15.812 --> 00:05:19.486
The duel shall
be three, against one!

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.557
You're kidding!
No.

00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:23.294
For when I defeat you we'll
gain control

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:25.064
of all of your bodies,

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:28.437
leaving your three minds
trapped here forever!

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:34.951
When this duel is over,

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:36.388
I'll have proven once
and for all

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:39.761
that machines are more
powerful than people!

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:40.896
In his dreams.

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:42.868
Let's do this!

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.941
I intend to pull the plug
on all three of you.

00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:48.312
So let us begin this duel!

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:49.480
Look, man!

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.017
It's gonna be two
on one!

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.654
No, Tristan.

00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:54.123
It's gonna be three
on one

00:05:54.123 --> 00:05:56.194
'cause we're
all in this together!

00:05:56.194 --> 00:05:57.698
But Serenity!

00:05:57.698 --> 00:05:59.301
Don't worry about
me!

00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:01.038
I'll
follow your lead.

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.641
That's what I'm scared of.

00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:05.146
Look, you don't have to
do this, Serenity!

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:06.315
Correction...

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:07.885
I'd say she does!

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:08.988
Observe!

00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:14.733
Everyone wearing a duel disk
must participate!

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:16.068
Cool!

00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:19.008
Serenity, just think this
over for a bit... please!

00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:22.982
I told you, I'll just do
exactly what you do!

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.286
Yeah, about that...

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:26.723
It's kinda been a while since
I've dueled.

00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:29.362
It's time to build you
decks for the duel.

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:32.936
Simply touch
the cards you desire.

00:06:32.936 --> 00:06:34.540
What should I choose,
huh?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.211
First of all, trust your
instincts Serenity.

00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:39.884
And make sure you
pick a nice variety of cards.

00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:42.055
You'll need magic, trap
and monster cards

00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:43.291
for your deck!

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:44.360
Uhh...

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.796
This...

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:47.199
and this...

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.468
And...

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:51.140
Oh, that one!

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.178
Well, here goes.

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:54.580
Gotcha...!

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.556
Now its time to choose a monster
to act as your Deck Master!

00:06:58.556 --> 00:07:00.927
All right, my deckmaster
is gonna be

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:03.164
Strike Ninja!

00:07:03.164 --> 00:07:04.401
I pick...

00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.442
uh, Goddess
With The Third Eye!

00:07:08.442 --> 00:07:11.215
I choose Super Roboyarou!

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:17.728
And I'll be acting as my own
Deck Master,

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.364
Robotic Knight!

00:07:19.364 --> 00:07:21.903
And just to make this duel
more interesting,

00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:25.477
we'll be battling above
a sea of radioactive waste.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:28.250
Play by the rules and you
won't fall in.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.320
There's one regulation
in particular

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.324
I'll be strictly enforcing.

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:35.230
Under no circumstances are
any of you to discuss

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.067
your strategy
with one another.

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.807
Break this rule and you'll
plummet into

00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.977
the toxic abyss below!

00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:44.483
Tristan, wait!

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:46.720
How can I duel without
your advice?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.789
You can do this!

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:49.960
Just believe in yourself!

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.175
The female shall begin
this battle.

00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:58.277
Engage!

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.981
Whatever you say.

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.083
Here goes!

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:02.252
Let's see.

00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:03.755
Which card should I play?

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:06.260
Ahh, that's the one!

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.966
Now I'm going to summon
Shadow Tamer,

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.569
in attack mode!

00:08:14.477 --> 00:08:15.713
Wait!

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:17.216
In attack mode?

00:08:17.216 --> 00:08:20.055
Oh, I didn't mess up
already, did I?

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:23.028
That monster is too weak
to play in attack mode!

00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:24.532
I'm terrible!

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:25.834
Sorry.

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:27.838
Nah, you did just fine.

00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:28.873
Really!

00:08:28.873 --> 00:08:30.677
You're a natural!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.750
Yeah, a natural disaster.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.289
I'll end my turn now.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.459
All right, Nesbitt!

00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:39.829
My move!

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:41.833
I've gotta lead this metal
meathead away

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.171
from Serenity's monster!

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:47.311
So now I'll
play Cyber Commander!

00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:54.058
Come and get me punk!

00:08:54.058 --> 00:08:56.396
Tristan played a weaker
monster than Serenity

00:08:56.396 --> 00:08:59.069
so Nesbitt will
attack him instead!

00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:00.939
I guess it's up to
me now!

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:02.175
Let's see.

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:03.277
Come on, Duke.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.947
Use your head for once!

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:08.420
Just play a lame monster so
Robo-Geek will attack you

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.759
instead of blasting poor
Serenity!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.531
I summon
The 13th Grave now!

00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.369
In defense mode!

00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:20.646
Way to look out for your
teammates, Duke!

00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:22.483
I'll stop here.

00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:27.092
It's time for me to
accelerate into high gear,
with this!

00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:29.798
Giga-Tech Wolf!

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:32.302
Attack the female's
Shadow Tamer!

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:33.472
Oh, no!

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.943
He went after Serenity's
monster!

00:09:41.155 --> 00:09:42.490
Serenity!
Serenity!

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.363
It appears
the machines are ahead.

00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:47.067
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:49.972
And the humans are down.

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:51.375
(screaming)

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:52.678
You hear that?

00:09:52.678 --> 00:09:55.884
That was Serenity screaming
just now, I know it!

00:09:55.884 --> 00:09:57.822
We're gonna find
her, Joey!

00:09:57.822 --> 00:09:59.592
I hope so!

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:00.828
Hello?

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:03.166
Serenity!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.145
We're living in an age where
machines rule!

00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:12.886
And now your little girl
friend is paying the price!

00:10:12.886 --> 00:10:14.422
I'm fine.

00:10:14.422 --> 00:10:15.892
Serenity, are you sure?

00:10:15.892 --> 00:10:17.061
Yeah.

00:10:17.061 --> 00:10:18.364
This is just bad.

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:19.433
We're no
match for this guy

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:21.604
and the stakes are
too high!

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:22.939
Poor Serenity.

00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:25.812
I can't let metal head over here
get the best of her.

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:28.017
It's time for you to feel my
iron fist again!

00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:29.553
Oh, no!

00:10:29.553 --> 00:10:32.359
Even the three of you
combined can't take me down.

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:35.465
Now observe my Deck Master
Special Ability:

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.970
Final Artillery!

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.175
Each machine monster I
discard will inflict

00:10:40.175 --> 00:10:43.215
500 life points
of damage to you!

00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:44.384
(screaming)

00:10:44.384 --> 00:10:45.486
Uh!

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:46.788
Uhhh!!!

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.831
Serenity!
Serenity!

00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:52.700
That's enough
torment for now.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.907
So I'll place this card face
down and end my turn.

00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:58.445
Serenity's not looking
too good.

00:10:58.445 --> 00:11:01.552
No, I'm okay guys,
I promise!

00:11:01.552 --> 00:11:03.121
Okay.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:06.229
I think I should put this
in defense mode.

00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:07.731
Right?

00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:08.867
Yeah!

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:10.905
Now you're getting the
hang of it!

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:12.174
Good!

00:11:12.174 --> 00:11:16.182
I summon The Forgiving Maiden
in defense mode!

00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:19.288
Aw, man, she put it in
attack mode!

00:11:19.288 --> 00:11:20.524
Serenity!

00:11:20.524 --> 00:11:23.229
You put your card on the duel
disk the wrong way!

00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:25.000
If you want your
monster in defense mode,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.505
you have to place it sideways
on the duel disk!

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:28.674
Oh.

00:11:28.674 --> 00:11:29.943
Silence humans!

00:11:29.943 --> 00:11:31.914
No discussing moves!

00:11:31.914 --> 00:11:33.985
Let her take that turn
over, dude!

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.187
Negative, young man.

00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:38.460
No second chances.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.931
I'm so sorry.

00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:41.333
I know she's trying
her best,

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.805
but we can't
afford any more mess ups!

00:11:43.805 --> 00:11:45.609
I need a plan to
fix this!

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:48.648
It's my move!

00:11:48.648 --> 00:11:50.452
A Block Attack magic card!

00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:52.456
Sweet!

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:54.827
Now I can switch the mode of
Serenity's monster!

00:11:54.827 --> 00:11:57.666
Now I activate Block Attack!

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.136
Nice effort...

00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:02.209
But it's time to reveal my
facedown card:

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:03.746
Riryoku Field.

00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:06.785
It destroys any magic card
that's used on a monster!

00:12:09.558 --> 00:12:11.962
Yeah, I can see that.

00:12:11.962 --> 00:12:13.332
Okay, now what?

00:12:17.574 --> 00:12:19.979
Ah, this desert
never ends!

00:12:21.548 --> 00:12:24.689
Look, isn't that Nesbitt's
old research lab?

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:27.027
I always
hated that place.

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:30.066
Look Nesbitt.

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:31.569
Now that
I'm in charge,

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.342
this company's
heading in a new direction.

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:36.981
And that's why I'm shutting
down your lab.

00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:38.483
No, Mr. Kaiba!

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:40.387
Please reconsider!

00:12:40.387 --> 00:12:43.260
What about all the military
technology I've created?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.395
No, no!

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:46.433
I won't let you destroy
my lab!

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.036
Watch what you say,
Nesbitt.

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:49.640
It's my lab.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.644
(exploding)

00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:57.923
I had no choice but to tear
down that sweat shop!

00:12:57.923 --> 00:12:59.593
His battle machines
were useless

00:12:59.593 --> 00:13:01.831
in the new Kaiba Corp.

00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:06.040
And sometimes starting over
means erasing the past!

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.542
You can't lead
me around your world

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.981
like a puppet forever,
Noah!

00:13:09.981 --> 00:13:12.954
In my world I can do whatever
I want

00:13:12.954 --> 00:13:15.392
and besides I'm having too much
fun toying with your head

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:17.163
to stop now!

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.632
Seto...

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.302
if you think this is bad,

00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:23.408
just wait until you see what I
have in store for you next!

00:13:25.246 --> 00:13:26.648
Okay...

00:13:26.648 --> 00:13:30.289
If I want to do some damage,
I gotta play smart!

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:31.492
Come on, Duke!

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:33.395
Don't leave Serenity out in
the open again!

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.865
Protect her!

00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:36.769
I play Yaranzo!

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.677
Come on, Yaranzo?

00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:43.216
That thing's never gonna help
us dude!

00:13:43.216 --> 00:13:46.622
Then I'll finish things off by
placing one card face down.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:47.926
Very well.

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:50.096
I shall sacrifice
my Giga-Tech Wolf

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:52.702
in order to
summon Machine King!

00:13:54.673 --> 00:13:56.376
And thank to its special
ability

00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:59.449
Machine King receives
another 100 attack points

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:02.255
for every machine-monster
in play!

00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:04.859
That includes your
Cyber Commander Tristan,

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:07.365
so thanks for the power boost
you fool!

00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:11.106
And now its time
to put them to use!

00:14:11.106 --> 00:14:12.308
Machine King...

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:15.616
attack the female's Forgiving
Maiden!

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:16.751
No!

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:17.786
Cyber Commander!

00:14:17.786 --> 00:14:18.955
Go!

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.459
Don't be a fool Tristan!

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.396
I gotta save her!

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:23.865
Ahh!

00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:30.412
No, Tristan!

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.817
I could have protected her
without losing points,

00:14:32.817 --> 00:14:34.453
you showoff!

00:14:34.453 --> 00:14:36.057
Hey, just back off!

00:14:36.057 --> 00:14:37.527
You're no help!

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:40.366
We have to play
smart or we'll all lose!

00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:43.372
Now I activate Card of
Sanctity!

00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:46.545
Requiring all of us to draw
from our decks.

00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:49.986
Don't stop until you
have six cards in your hand!

00:14:49.986 --> 00:14:51.956
Think of it as recharging
your batteries

00:14:51.956 --> 00:14:53.960
to refresh the game!

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.129
You done?

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:56.332
Yeah, can we go now?

00:14:56.332 --> 00:14:57.601
Not yet.

00:14:57.601 --> 00:14:59.906
Next I'll dispose
of three machine monsters

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:03.045
to activate my Deck Master
Special Ability:

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:05.317
Final Artillery!

00:15:05.317 --> 00:15:07.755
(screaming)

00:15:07.755 --> 00:15:11.262
Say goodbye to 500 more life
points each!

00:15:11.262 --> 00:15:14.903
Soon you'll
all be obsolete!

00:15:14.903 --> 00:15:19.078
Now I'll place this face
down and end my turn.

00:15:19.078 --> 00:15:21.449
Now I'm ready.

00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:22.986
Here goes...

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:24.222
I play...

00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:28.197
Lady Panther
in defense mode!

00:15:28.197 --> 00:15:30.168
Then I'll switch
the Forgiving Maiden

00:15:30.168 --> 00:15:33.307
from attack to defense
mode!

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.578
You go girl...
All right!

00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:40.990
Now I summon Command Angel to
the field in defense mode!

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.593
We're on a roll now!

00:15:42.593 --> 00:15:46.935
I summon forth my Dark Assailant
in defense mode!

00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:49.006
Looks like you've lined up
your monsters for me

00:15:49.006 --> 00:15:50.810
to knock down one by one,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.449
as I move closer to
disassembling you three.

00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:00.095
All right,
you rust bucket!

00:16:00.095 --> 00:16:03.135
You'll never get past our army
of defensive monsters,

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:07.043
and I dare you to
attack us directly again!

00:16:07.043 --> 00:16:08.646
Quit flapping your lips!

00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.650
We don't need to give him
any ideas!

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.886
Don't worry, Tristan..

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:13.122
he doesn't have enough
cards left

00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:15.560
to activate his
Deck Master ability again,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.764
so our life points
are safe.

00:16:17.764 --> 00:16:19.335
Almost correct...

00:16:19.335 --> 00:16:21.439
but you've forgotten about
my trap card!

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:22.674
No!
Uh...

00:16:22.674 --> 00:16:24.144
Ah!

00:16:24.144 --> 00:16:26.717
I activate Backup Soldier.

00:16:26.717 --> 00:16:28.821
Oh no, what's that?

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:32.127
Since I have more than five
monsters in my graveyard,

00:16:32.127 --> 00:16:34.299
this trap card allows me to
bring three of them

00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:36.270
back to my hand!

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.574
So it looks like I'll be
able to activate

00:16:38.574 --> 00:16:42.015
my Deck Master
Ability after all.

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:44.820
Now I'll take the three
monsters I've just received

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.292
and deposit them back
to the graveyard!

00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:50.398
Thus activating
my special ability:

00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:52.570
Final Artillery!

00:16:55.342 --> 00:16:58.615
Show some originality and do
something new for once!

00:16:58.615 --> 00:17:00.252
Why change a good thing?

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:03.725
Attack!

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:07.366
Reliability is the key to
a good invention!

00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:08.869
He's too strong!

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:09.972
Affirmative...

00:17:09.972 --> 00:17:11.207
but you've only seen
a small sample

00:17:11.207 --> 00:17:13.311
of my overall strength!

00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:14.715
What you're about to
experience

00:17:14.715 --> 00:17:16.752
will blow your circuits!

00:17:16.752 --> 00:17:18.923
Meet Clockwork Night!

00:17:18.923 --> 00:17:20.927
This magic card has
the power to transform

00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:24.167
all of your monsters
into machines!

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.503
Say what?

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:27.340
No way, man!

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.279
And in addition to turning
your creatures into metal,

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:33.520
they'll each
lose 500 attack points!

00:17:35.858 --> 00:17:37.160
And don't forget...

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.999
My Machine King gets
an additional 100 points

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:42.571
for every machine monster
in play...

00:17:42.571 --> 00:17:44.442
and I count six.

00:17:44.442 --> 00:17:46.713
Finally, Clockwork Night
gives my Machine King

00:17:46.713 --> 00:17:49.118
500 extra points!

00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:50.855
Nesbitt can't
be stopped now!

00:17:50.855 --> 00:17:52.124
Chill out, Tristan.

00:17:52.124 --> 00:17:53.795
Everything's under control.

00:17:53.795 --> 00:17:56.132
Our monsters are in defense
mode, remember?

00:17:56.132 --> 00:17:59.473
If we keep cool, that
pile of scrap can't hurt us.

00:17:59.473 --> 00:18:02.813
You must grow tired of being
wrong all the time.

00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:06.187
Engage Short Circuit!

00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:10.361
You see, unlike humans,
machines follow commands!

00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:11.932
Hey, what gives?

00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:14.637
I'm afraid to find out!

00:18:14.637 --> 00:18:16.474
If you haven't already
figured it out,

00:18:16.474 --> 00:18:18.712
this magic card gives
me the power

00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:21.618
to change all of
your monsters from defense

00:18:21.618 --> 00:18:22.954
to attack mode!

00:18:22.954 --> 00:18:26.428
So once again, your
life points are in danger!

00:18:26.428 --> 00:18:28.098
Man, I hate this guy!

00:18:28.098 --> 00:18:31.171
He never lost control of this
match for a second!

00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:34.043
Now witness the triumph of
machine over man...

00:18:34.043 --> 00:18:35.847
or should I say female!

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:37.851
Machine King, prepare
to attack

00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:40.891
her Forgiving Maiden now!

00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:43.095
(Tristan)
Serenity-- No!

00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:44.665
She'll lose the duel!

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.805
There's gotta be something
I can do to save her, but what?

00:18:47.805 --> 00:18:49.141
I got it!

00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:51.813
I can use my Deck Master to
intercept his attack!

00:18:51.813 --> 00:18:52.982
Go!

00:18:52.982 --> 00:18:54.485
Super Roboyarou!

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:55.922
No, Tristan!

00:18:55.922 --> 00:18:58.193
If your Deck Master's destroyed
you lose!

00:18:58.193 --> 00:19:00.063
My monster's special ability
allows me

00:19:00.063 --> 00:19:02.635
to play this card face down!

00:19:02.635 --> 00:19:04.773
Then its
attack points go up!

00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:06.844
Not by enough, you fool!

00:19:06.844 --> 00:19:11.386
Your monster has sadly become
last year's model!

00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:12.856
(exploding)

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:15.796
When the Deck Master is
destroyed so is the duelist!

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:19.436
I'm aware of that, you
oversized trash can.

00:19:19.436 --> 00:19:22.275
Okay, no more lies.

00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:24.480
I'm not
the duelist you think I am.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.718
I didn't teach Joey
how to play.

00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:30.492
I hardly know
the basics of Duel Monsters.

00:19:30.492 --> 00:19:31.561
And you...

00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:33.392
You better take care
of her!

00:19:33.392 --> 00:19:36.795
You've lost the duel,
so it's time for you to go...

00:19:36.795 --> 00:19:38.130
down there!

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.865
Oh no, Tristan!

00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:42.668
(screaming)

00:19:42.668 --> 00:19:44.903
Please come back!

00:19:44.903 --> 00:19:46.838
No!

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:48.407
Where'd he go?

00:19:48.407 --> 00:19:50.776
You said we'd only fall
if we cheated!

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:51.944
Relax.

00:19:51.944 --> 00:19:53.578
His mind has been digitized

00:19:53.578 --> 00:19:55.380
and his body is in
a holding area

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.249
waiting to be taken over!

00:19:57.249 --> 00:20:00.118
And you'll both join him
soon enough!
