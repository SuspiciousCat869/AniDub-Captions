YUGI!

00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:10.738
Joey: UP HIGH, PAL!

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:13.707
DAT WAS TRULY YOUR
BEST WORK, YUGE!

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:15.776
NICE DUEL!

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:17.044

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:18.045
FROM YOUR
OPPONENT'S DECK!

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.114
TAKE THIS,
MY RAREST CARD.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:24.251
AND REMEMBER,
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THIS CARD, PHARAOH.

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.387
Yugi: THE WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:29.723
WE HAVE ALL THREE OF
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:33.260
THIS VICTORY CELEBRATION
HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH!

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.696
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
IS OVER!

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:36.897
SO IF YOU'D LIKE
A FREE RIDE HOME

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:40.167
I'D SUGGEST YOU BOARD
MY AIRCRAFT RIGHT NOW,

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:43.170
CAUSE IN ONE HOUR,
THIS ISLAND WILL EXPLODE!

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.972
Roland: PREPARE
THE ENGINES NOW!

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:47.208
ROGER! ENGAGING
MAIN ENGINES!

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:48.909
WE TAKIN' OFF
OR WHAT?

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.644
WE CAN'T SEEM TO LOCATE
MOKUBA AND MR. KAIBA.

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.147
Fuguta: OH NO!
WE HAVE A PROBLEM!

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:54.815
Roland: THE ENGINES
ARE WEAK, RIGHT?

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:56.150
WORSE, THEY'RE
COMPLETELY DEAD!

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.318
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:58.385

Tea: THIS IS INSANE!

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:12.326
WHY WOULD KAIBA
PROGRAM HIS DUEL TOWER

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:13.961
TO EXPLODE
THEN DISAPPEAR?

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:17.998
WELL HE PROBABLY
KNEW OUR RIDE HAD
BUSTED ENGINES,

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:20.334
SO HE FOUND HIS OWN WAY
OUTTA DIS JUNKYARD!

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:21.335
WE'LL TRACK HIM
DOWN.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.004
KAIBA COULDN'T
HAVE GONE FAR,

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.272
BUT WE
MUST ACT FAST.

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:26.840
CAN DO!

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.345
I JUST HOPE
WE'RE NOT TOO LATE!

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:34.348
Computer voice: WARNING...

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:37.851
DUEL TOWER WILL SELF-DESTRUCT
IN TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES.

00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.120
EVACUATE THE ISLAND IMMEDIATELY.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.458
SOON THIS PLACE WILL BE
NOTHING BUT A BAD MEMORY.

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:47.227
THE VERY SITE
WHERE YUGI DISGRACED ME

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.329
BY STEALING
THE BATTLE CITY CROWN

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.731
WILL BE GONE FOREVER!

00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:52.866
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:56.203
AND LEAVE WITH
ALL THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:02:56.203 --> 00:03:00.040
BUT YUGI HAD TO STEP IN
AND RUIN MY PLANS ONCE AGAIN!

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.776
NOW THE ONLY WAY
I CAN MOVE FORWARD

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:04.745
IS BY DESTROYING THE PAST,

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:09.249
INCLUDING THE SIGHT
WHERE YUGI ROBBED ME
OF MY VICTORY!

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:19.693
ALL OF THAT NONSENSE
WILL SOON BE BEHIND ME.

00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:22.763
WELL BRO, IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL SYSTEMS ARE SET!

00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:27.768
HOPEFULLY THE REST
OF THE GANG ALREADY
LEFT THE ISLAND.

00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:29.837
Duke: COME ON,
YOU RUST BUCKET!

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:30.971
START UP ALREADY!

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:36.210
Fuguta: QUIET BACK THERE!

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.846
THE THRUSTERS ARE
NOT RESPONDING AT ALL!

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:40.180
KEEP TRYING!

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.350
QUIET!

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.686
WHEN THIS TOWER CRUMBLES,

00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.756
BATTLE CITY
WILL BE BEHIND ME!

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:50.357
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:52.960
THE MEMORY OF
MY STEP-FATHER, GOZABURO,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.330
WILL BE BURIED FOREVER!

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.731
Gozaburo: HAVE A SEAT.

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.200
IT'S TIME FOR
A FATHER AND SON CHAT.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.435
IN YOUR DREAMS.

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:03.871
SETO, JUST GIVE IN NOW.

00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:05.839
YOU'LL MAKE THINGS
MUCH EASIER ON YOURSELF.

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.709
YOUR LITTLE THREATS
DON'T SCARE ME AT ALL.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.710
SO WHY DON'T YOU
LET US GO

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.179
BEFORE I REALLY
GET ANGRY.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.313
I HAVE A LIFE TO LIVE,
UNLIKE YOU!

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:16.650
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.186
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW
THE PERFECT WAY

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:20.187
TO SETTLE
OUR DIFFERENCES.

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:22.189
DO YOU RECALL
THE CHESS MATCH WE HAD

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.924
THE DAY I MET YOU?

00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:25.926
WELL I PROPOSE A REMATCH.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.694
ANOTHER CHESS GAME?

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:32.733
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M TALKING ABOUT CHESS?

00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:37.237
NOW I SUMMON
MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:40.441
NOOOO!

00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:44.244
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT'S CHECK MATE.

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:48.749
NOW BLUE-EYES,
ATTACK HIS
EXODIA NECROS!

00:04:58.192 --> 00:05:02.796
YOU LOSE,
STEP-FATHER!

00:05:02.796 --> 00:05:06.934
EVEN THOUGH I FACED
MY GREATEST DEMON AND WON,

00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:10.070
I'M STILL HAUNTED
BY THE MEMORY OF MY STEP-FATHER.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.673
BUT ONCE I DESTROY THIS TOWER,

00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:16.043
WHICH SITS AT THE VERY HEART OF
THE ISLAND HE ONCE CONTROLLED,

00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:20.280
GOZABURO KAIBA WILL BE
OUT OF MY HEAD FOR GOOD!

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.219
MAYBE THEN I CAN START
TO REBUILD MY LIFE.

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.423
SETO, WE HAVE TO
GET OUT NOW!

00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:32.192
WITH THE DESTRUCTION
OF MY PAST

00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:34.695
WILL COME THE REBIRTH
OF MY FUTURE--

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:39.199
THE FUTURE I PROMISED
MOKUBA HE'D HAVE.

00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:43.003
Mokuba: AWESOME
SAND CASTLE, SETO.

00:05:43.003 --> 00:05:45.906
THIS IS MORE THAN
JUST A SAND CASTLE,
MOKIE.

00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:48.008
IT'S
AN AMUSEMENT PARK!

00:05:48.008 --> 00:05:50.010
AND SOMEDAY
IT'LL BE REAL.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.345
AWESOME!
A REAL THEME PARK!?

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:54.214
JUST FOR THE TWO OF US!?

00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:55.682
NOT QUITE.

00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:57.251
FIRST OF ALL,
EVERYONE'S INVITED!

00:05:57.251 --> 00:05:58.285
THEY ARE?

00:05:58.285 --> 00:05:59.419
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.021
YOU AND I
ARE GONNA OPEN UP

00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:02.723
A WHOLE BUNCH
OF AMUSEMENT PARKS

00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:03.724
ALL AROUND
THE WORLD!

00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:06.059
EVERY MAJOR CITY'LL
HAVE ONE!

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.928
WE'LL BE
A HOUSEHOLD NAME!

00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:10.030
THESE THINGS'LL
BE HUGE!

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.000
EVERYONE ON EARTH
WILL WANNA VACATION
AT KAIBA LAND!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.504
YOU'LL NAME A RIDE
AFTER ME RIGHT?

00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:22.342
SOON THIS NIGHTMARE
WILL BE OVER

00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:24.344
AND I CAN START
LIVING MY DREAM

00:06:24.344 --> 00:06:27.381
AND KEEPING THE PROMISE
I MADE TO MOKUBA!

00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.784
SETO, LET'S GO!

00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:32.052
Computer voice: WARNING...

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:35.789
DUEL TOWER WILL SELF-DESTRUCT
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.294
TIME TO CREATE
A NEW EMPIRE!

00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:45.732
TALK ABOUT
CUTTING IT CLOSE!

00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:48.235
Computer voice:
WARNING...EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!

00:06:55.104 --> 00:06:56.772
Joey: HOW WE DOIN' ON TIME?

00:06:56.772 --> 00:06:59.008
THIS TOWER WILL EXPLODE
IN THIRTEEN MINUTES!

00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:04.180
THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING
STANDING HERE!?

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.181
YOU'RE KAIBA'S
RIGHT-HAND GOON.

00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:07.083
YOU MUST KNOW HOW
TO STOP DAT DING!

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:10.252
SO QUIT HOLDIN' OUT
ON US, ROLAND!

00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:12.855
LOOK, ONLY
MR. KAIBA KNOWS HOW,

00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:15.424
AND UNFORTUNATELY
HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!

00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:18.828
WELL IF I FIND HIM,
HE'S TOAST!

00:07:18.828 --> 00:07:20.229
WITH KAIBA MISSING

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:22.098
AND OUR RIDE HOME
ON THE FRITZ,

00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:23.766
WE'LL NEVER ESCAPE
THAT EXPLOSION!

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:24.767
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH!

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:27.403
YOU GOTTA
CHILL OUT, MAN.

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:28.404
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO STAY CALM.

00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:30.773
STAY CALM?

00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:32.408
THIS ISLAND IS ABOUT
TO BLOW SKY-HIGH

00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:34.276
AND WE'RE STUCK HERE
WIT NO WAY OUT!

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:37.113
WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE THE SHIP'S
ENGINES ARE FIXED.

00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:38.214
Bakura: HEY!

00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:40.383
Yami-Yugi:
IT'S DUKE AND BAKURA!

00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:41.517
Joey: DIS BETTA
BE GOOD NEWS!

00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:44.553
WELL, GUYS?!

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:45.755
WHAT'S UP
WITH THE ENGINES?

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:47.356
THEY'RE STILL
NOT WORKING!

00:07:47.356 --> 00:07:48.758
WE NEED MORE TIME!

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:50.726
WE HAVE NONE!

00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:52.628
THERE'S ONLY
TWELVE MINUTES LEFT.

00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:54.130
LEMME HAVE A SHOT
AT DESE THINGS.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.500
JOEY, SINCE WHEN
CAN YOU FIX AN ENGINE!?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.304
PLEASE...HOW HARD
CAN IT BE!?

00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:03.672
DEN AGAIN,
I DON'T WANNA

00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:05.174
GET MY HANDS DIRTY
RIGHT NOW.

00:08:05.174 --> 00:08:06.809
Tristan: CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT COULDN'T WE JUST TAKE

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:07.810
THAT COPTER OVER THERE?

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.047
Joey: MY THOUGHTS
EXACTLY.

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:13.215
Serenity:
HELLO IN THERE!!

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:15.217
Mai: ALL RIGHT!
TIME TO ABANDON SHIP!

00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:16.652
COME ON! HURRY!

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:22.258
THERE'S ONLY
A FEW MINUTES LEFT!

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:25.294
JUST THINK...
IF YOU HADN'T
PASSED OUT,

00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:27.329
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE
SENT THIS HELICOPTER
TO SAVE YOU,

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:29.165
AND WE'D STILL BE
STUCK ON THIS ISLAND.

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:30.366
ANY LUCK?

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:31.500
NO. WE CAN'T WAIT.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.537
TAKE OFF NOW.

00:08:34.537 --> 00:08:37.673
LET'S HOPE MR. KAIBA
AND MOKUBA FOUND

00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:41.710
ACCELERATE TAKE OFF SPEED!

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.147
WE'RE NOT A SAFE ENOUGH
DISTANCE FROM THE TOWER YET!

00:08:45.147 --> 00:08:46.482
Yami-Yugi: KAIBA...

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:47.483
POOR MOKUBA.

00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:50.486

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:51.487

00:08:51.487 --> 00:08:55.958
HURRY!

00:08:58.294 --> 00:08:59.562
OH, NO!

00:08:59.562 --> 00:09:04.533
I HOPE THOSE GUYS

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:09.038
THAR SHE BLOWS!

00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:17.613
THIS IS AWFUL!

00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:20.516
KAIBA, HOW FOOLISH.

00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:23.385
Joey: MAYBE
HE WANTED TO GO DOWN
WIT HIS ISLAND, YUGE.

00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:27.389
HUH?

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:32.761
HEY, WHAT'S DAT?

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.131
IT'S BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:38.667
Joey: I DON'T GET IT!

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:40.136
[LAUGHING]

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:42.738

OH, WHO CARES?

00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:51.313
YOU MEAN TA TELL ME
THEY WERE SAFE ALL ALONG?

00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:53.682
OH, LET'S BE GLAD
IT'S OVER.

00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:57.286
HEY, WHY ARE THEY TRAVELING
IN THE HELICOPTER, SETO?

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:58.754
HMM. OOPS.

00:09:58.754 --> 00:10:00.556
I GUESS
THE OTHER SHIP
WASN'T FIXED YET.

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:01.690
DAT DOES IT!

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.691
PUT THAT DOWN!

00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:04.793
YOU DINK IT'S FUNNY

00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:06.629
THAT WE ALMOST BECAME
FISH FOOD DOWN THERE!?

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:09.031
WAIT 'TIL WE LAND
DIS DING!

00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:11.567
SORRY JOEY,
BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING BACK WITH YOU.

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:13.269
WE'VE GOT IMPORTANT
KAIBA CORP BUSINESS

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:14.537
TO TAKE CARE OF.

00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:16.172
OH, YEAH!?

00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:17.206
WHAT ARE YA PLANNIN',
ANOTHER TOURNAMENT?

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:20.509
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE, WHEELER.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:23.712
JUST GO.

00:10:23.712 --> 00:10:25.347
Kaiba: DON'T WORRY.

00:10:25.347 --> 00:10:27.383
YOU GEEKS HAVEN'T SEEN
THE LAST OF ME.

00:10:27.383 --> 00:10:31.487
ESPECIALLY YOU, YUGI!

00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:36.692
THE BATTLE BETWEEN US
WILL NEVER BE OVER!

00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:38.694
Mokuba: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

00:10:38.694 --> 00:10:40.663
HMM.

00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:42.565
HOLD ON, MOKUBA!

00:10:42.565 --> 00:10:47.069
YOU GOT IT! LET'S GO!!

00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:58.647
Yugi: WELL, THEY'RE OFF.

00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:00.816
I HOPE THAT KAIBA CAN
PUT HIS ANGER ASIDE

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:02.484
AND MOVE ON, RIGHT?

00:11:02.484 --> 00:11:03.819
YES.

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:06.088
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR OUR NEXT JOURNEY:

00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:07.489
TO DISCOVER
THE PHARAOH'S SECRET.

00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:09.191
ALL RIGHT!

00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:14.063
WHAT DO YA SAY
WE BLOW DIS TACO STAND!

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.665
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE FINALLY

00:11:16.665 --> 00:11:19.268
HA HA! WE'RE GONNA
BUILD KAIBA LAND!

00:11:19.268 --> 00:11:21.270
Kaiba: OPENING UP
A CHAIN OF THEME PARKS

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.305
ISN'T ALL FUN
AND GAMES, MOKUBA!

00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:26.775
IT TAKES HARD WORK
AND DETERMINATION!

00:11:26.775 --> 00:11:29.278
SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:38.682
Pilot: WE'LL BE LANDING
IN THE TOWN OF DOMINO

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:39.750
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.920
Tea: OH, I CAN'T WAIT!

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.424
Joey: HOME,
SWEET HOME, BABY!

00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:54.431
Tristan: WELL, WE MADE IT HOME
IN ONE PIECE.

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:56.567
Tea: BARELY!

00:11:56.567 --> 00:11:58.702
Ishizu: PHARAOH...
IT IS BECAUSE OF
YOUR BRAVERY

00:11:58.702 --> 00:12:02.106
THAT MY BROTHER
MARIK WAS SAVED
FROM THE EVIL

00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:03.807
THAT ONCE CONSUMED
HIS HEART.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:07.644
HOW COULD I EVER
THANK YOU?

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.780
NOW, THE TIME
HAS COME FOR YOU

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.715
TO UNCOVER
THE GREAT MYSTERIES

00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:12.716
THAT SURROUND
YOUR PAST.

00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:16.954
PHARAOH YOU SAVED ME
FROM MYSELF.

00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:20.290
YOU HELPED ME
CONQUER THE DARKNESS
WITHIN MY OWN HEART.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.559
I HOPE IN SPITE
OF ALL I'VE DONE

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:23.694
WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

00:12:23.694 --> 00:12:24.895
YES.

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.697
GOOD-BYE, MY KING.

00:12:26.697 --> 00:12:28.966
I KNOW THAT WE WILL
MEET AGAIN SOON.

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:31.135
Marik: FAREWELL
TO YOU ALL.

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.169
Serenity:
BYE, GUYS!

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.238
YEAH, TAKE IT EASY!

00:12:34.238 --> 00:12:38.509
SMELL YA LATER!

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:39.510
Joey: WHO KNEW THERE WAS
ACTUALLY A NICE GUY

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.646
INSIDE DAT PSYCHOTIC
EVIL NUTCASE?

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:45.215
Mai: YOU'VE CERTAINLY GOT
A WAY WITH WORDS, JOEY.

00:12:45.215 --> 00:12:47.651
IT'S A GIFT.

00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:51.855
OK, I GUESS THAT IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO SAY GOOD-BYE NOW.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:52.856
Tristan:
WHY'S THAT DUKE?

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.992
YOU KNOW ME.

00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:55.993
I CAN'T STAY IN ONE SPOT
FOR TOO LONG.

00:12:55.993 --> 00:12:58.195
I'VE GOT PLACES TO GO,

00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.196
HEARTS TO BREAK,
AND DICE TO ROLL.

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:02.866
BUT DON'T WORRY...
I'LL BE BACK.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.135
SEE YA ROUND,
SERENITY.

00:13:05.135 --> 00:13:06.303
BYE, DUKE.

00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:09.540
HUH?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.144
HEY! HE SLIPPED HER
HIS PHONE NUMBER!

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:15.546
REAL SMOOTH, DUKE!

00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:16.847
LIKE SHE'S EVER
GONNA CALL YOU!

00:13:16.847 --> 00:13:18.115
LATER!

00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:22.586
YEAH, MUCH LATER,
DICE BOY.

00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:26.590
EVERYONE'S GOIN'
THEIR OWN WAY.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.660
YEAH...YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES ME FEEL

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.761
LIKE I SHOULD HAVE
SOME SORTA PLAN.

00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:33.597
THERE'S STILL PLENTY
OF TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT.

00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:35.199
IT JUST
MAKES ME THINK

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:37.601
WHAT'S GONNA
COME NEXT FOR ME.

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:38.936
LIKE TEA SAID,

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:41.672
YOU'LL FIND IT
EVENTUALLY...
JUST WAIT.

00:13:41.672 --> 00:13:45.576
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I JUST HAVE TO
TRUST IN FATE.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:47.010
HUH? WHAT'S THIS?

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.012
TRIIIII-STAN!

00:13:49.012 --> 00:13:50.013
[LAUGHING]

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:52.749
OK. MY TURN.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.718
Yami-Yugi:
WHAT'S THAT?

00:13:54.718 --> 00:13:56.620
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
TOO, ARE YOU, MAI?

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.089
I'M A WANDERER,

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.525
AND I'M AFRAID
THE OPEN ROAD CALLS.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:04.294
I CAME HERE FOR
THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT.

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:06.763
BUT NOW THAT THAT'S
OVER, IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO MOVE ON.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:07.764
IT'S BEEN REAL.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.300
OH, MAI, DON'T GO.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.037
YOU WERE LIKE A--
LIKE A SISTER TO ME.

00:14:14.037 --> 00:14:16.240
I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M SURPRISED

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.009
A KNUCKLEHEAD
LIKE JOEY HAS SUCH
A SWEET SISTER.

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:21.778
THEN AGAIN, HE DOES
HAVE A SOFT SIDE.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.814
AND HE CAN BE CHARMING
WHEN HE WANTS TO.

00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:25.282
I FIRST MET HIM
ON THE WAY TO
DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:27.517
ALL JOEY
COULD TALK ABOUT

00:14:27.517 --> 00:14:28.485
WAS HOW HE WAS GONNA
WIN THE TOURNAMENT

00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:30.621
SO HE COULD USE
THE PRIZE MONEY

00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:32.856
FOR YOUR OPERATION,
SERENITY.

00:14:32.856 --> 00:14:35.626
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HIS STORY WAS TOUCHING.

00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:36.994
JOEY'S THE BEST!

00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:40.163
I'D SAY IT RUNS
IN THE FAMILY.

00:14:40.163 --> 00:14:44.735
THANK YOU, MAI.
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:46.470
I SHOULD BE THANKING
YOU, SERENITY.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.107
WHEN I WAS TRAPPED
IN THE SHADOW REALM,

00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:51.875
YOU TOOK CARE OF ME

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:53.744
AND YOU NEVER
LEFT MY SIDE.

00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:55.512
THANK YOU. YUGI!

00:14:55.512 --> 00:14:58.815
LISTEN, IN THE NEXT
TOURNAMENT,

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.651
IT'S GONNA BE ME
AGAINST YOU!

00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:01.952
Yami-Yugi: YOU'RE ON!

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:04.021
HMM.

00:15:04.021 --> 00:15:06.156
UH...MAI,
I, UH--

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.958
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.961
NEVER MIND.

00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:12.963
BYE, GUYS.

00:15:12.963 --> 00:15:13.964
SEE YA ROUND.

00:15:13.964 --> 00:15:16.633
BE GOOD.

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:18.201
GOOD-BYE, MAI.

00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:20.737
JOEY, DON'T BE
SUCH A DORK.

00:15:20.737 --> 00:15:23.674
DO SOMETHING RIGHT
FOR A CHANGE,
WILL YA?

00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:27.210
Joey: UH...
HEY, MAI! WAIT!

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.114
HUH?

00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:32.115
MAI, I, UH...

00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:34.551
FORGET IT, JOEY.

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.286
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING MUSHY.

00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:38.889
WHAT YOU DID FOR ME
BACK THERE SAID IT ALL.

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:40.657
YOU KNOW...

00:15:40.657 --> 00:15:43.794
MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT
THIS WHOLE TOURNAMENT

00:15:43.794 --> 00:15:44.795
WAS THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU.

00:15:44.795 --> 00:15:47.030
[SIGHS]

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.066
THANK YOU, MAI.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:52.135
RIGHT BACK AT 'CHA.

00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:54.104
BUT DON'T THINK
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK!

00:15:54.104 --> 00:15:55.572
I STILL PLAN ON
KICKING YOUR BUTT

00:15:55.572 --> 00:15:58.642
IN THE NEXT TOURNAMENT!

00:15:58.642 --> 00:16:01.211
TAKE CARE,
ALL RIGHT?

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:05.716
YOU BET.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.860
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
JOEY REALLY SURPRISED ME.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.030
WHEN I MET HIM, HE WAS
AN OK DUELIST WITH A BIG MOUTH.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.632
NOW HE'S A GREAT DUELIST
WITH A BIG MOUTH...

00:16:22.632 --> 00:16:26.636
AND A BIG HEART, TOO.

00:16:26.636 --> 00:16:28.238
WE MAY BE TAKING
SEPARATE ROADS RIGHT NOW,

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.741
BUT OUR PATHS WILL CROSS AGAIN.

00:16:42.348 --> 00:16:47.153
Yugi: IT'S DEFINITELY
NICE TO BE HOME.

00:16:47.153 --> 00:16:51.991
