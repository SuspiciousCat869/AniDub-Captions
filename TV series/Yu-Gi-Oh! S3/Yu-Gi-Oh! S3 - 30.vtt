EXCELLENT DUELING

00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:31.833
SINCE YOUR MAGIC CARD
ONLY WORKS

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.835
ON MONSTERS WITH 500
ATTACK POINTS OR LESS,

00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:36.337

JUST THE CARD I NEEDED.

IF I GET A TWO OR
MORE, YOU'RE TOAST!

00:08:46.614 --> 00:08:49.984
ACCORDING TO MY MATH,
6 IS HIGHER THAN TWO.

00:08:49.984 --> 00:08:52.654
THAT MEANS
YOUR PLASMA EEL'S
POINTS INCREASE NOW

00:08:52.654 --> 00:08:55.356

ITS ORIGINAL STRENGTH,

00:08:57.992 --> 00:08:59.861

PREVENTS IT FROM

AT WHAT
HE DID TO MAI.

00:16:25.163 --> 00:16:26.198
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:16:26.198 --> 00:16:28.433
HUH? OH, HI, ISHIZU.

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:32.504
SERENITY, SHOULDN'T
YOU BE OUT THERE
WITH THE OTHERS?

00:16:32.504 --> 00:16:35.574
I AM CERTAIN
YOUR FRIENDS COULD
USE YOUR SUPPORT.

00:16:35.574 --> 00:16:38.210
THEY'LL BE FINE.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.546
BESIDES, SOMEONE NEEDS
TO STAY HERE AND KEEP
AN EYE ON MAI.

00:16:41.546 --> 00:16:43.882
EVER SINCE SHE LOST
HER DUEL TO MARIK,

00:16:43.882 --> 00:16:47.752
WELL, YOU KNOW.

00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:50.055
SHE HASN'T SAID
A WORD FOR DAYS.

00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:51.723
POOR MAI.

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:54.993
MY BROTHER'S TRYING
TO SAVE HER MIND.

00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:58.630
HE PROMISED NOT
TO LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HER.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.734
SO HE'S DUELING
AGAINST MARIK RIGHT
NOW IN A SHADOW GAME.

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:04.803
HE THINKS WINNING
WILL BRING HER BACK.

00:17:04.803 --> 00:17:07.639
SO NOW BOTH OF
OUR BROTHERS ARE
FACING ONE ANOTHER

00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:09.741
IN A BATTLE WITH
THE ULTIMATE STAKES.

00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.409
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:15.113
AND ALL I CAN DO
IS STAY STRONG FOR JOEY
AND WISH FOR THE BEST.

00:17:15.113 --> 00:17:16.815
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP HOPE.

00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:20.652
I KNOW JUST
HOW YOU FEEL.

00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:22.721
I KNOW THERE'S STILL
GOOD WITHIN MARIK

00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:25.056
AND HE WILL
BE SAVED FROM
THE EVIL INSIDE HIM.

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:26.925
THEN ALL OF
THE WRONGS
HE'S COMMITTED

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:28.560
WILL BE FIXED.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.663
AND EVERYONE HE SENT
TO THE SHADOW REALM
WILL RETURN,

00:17:31.663 --> 00:17:35.200
INCLUDING
YOUR POOR FRIEND MAI.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.603
NOW, THEN WHY DON'T
YOU GO AND SUPPORT
YOUR BROTHER?

00:17:38.603 --> 00:17:41.072
BUT WHAT ABOUT MAI?

00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:43.775
I'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON HER FOR YOU.

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:45.610
WHY SHOULD
WE BOTH STAY?

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.814
WELL, I PROMISED
I WOULD, THAT'S ALL.

00:17:49.814 --> 00:17:53.685
WELL, I PROMISE
YOU SHE'LL BE
FINE, SERENITY.

00:17:53.685 --> 00:18:00.058
SO GO. BE THERE
FOR JOEY.

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:02.227
THANK YOU
SO MUCH, ISHIZU.

00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:03.562
OF COURSE.

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:05.330
STAY STRONG,
SERENITY.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.499
I WILL! THANKS!

00:18:07.499 --> 00:18:09.901
Thinking: I UNDERSTAND
THEIR BOND WELL.

00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:11.703
BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG

00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:14.439
SINCE I'VE FELT THAT BOND
WITH MY OWN BROTHER.

00:18:14.439 --> 00:18:17.242
AND WITHOUT THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM NECKLACE,

00:18:17.242 --> 00:18:22.814
I AM UNSURE WHAT
THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US.

00:18:22.814 --> 00:18:26.718
I'M COMING, JOEY!

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:29.688
I CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT DESTINY HAS CHOSEN

00:18:29.688 --> 00:18:31.690
MY BROTHER
TO BE DELIVERED

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.225
FROM THE DARKNESS
THAT NOW CONTROLS HIM.

00:18:34.225 --> 00:18:39.497
OTHERWISE, THE WHOLE
WORLD IS IN A GREAT
DEAL OF DANGER.

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:43.501
Thinking: NOW THAT
MY BEAST HAS TAKEN
ITS STRONGEST FORM,

00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:45.337
VICTORY IS MINE!

00:18:45.337 --> 00:18:47.505

WITHOUT
MAKING A SACRIFICE,

00:18:51.643 --> 00:18:54.679
SO IT HAS ZERO
ATTACK POINTS! THEN
HE TRANSFORMS IT

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:56.348
INTO A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT-LOOKING
MONSTER!

WILL HAVE TO REALIZE

YOUR DARKEST NIGHTMARE

THIS DUEL WAS STILL
ON, PSYCHO BOY.

AND HE'S GOT 2,800
ATTACK POINTS WITH
YOUR NAME ON THEM!

00:19:23.575 --> 00:19:24.909
MEANWHILE,

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:26.277
YOUR OVERSIZED

SPECIAL ABILITIES!

SAY WHAT?
NOT ANOTHER ONE!

00:19:45.697 --> 00:19:48.633
YES. IN ITS
PHOENIX MODE,

00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:51.870
RA CAN INSTANTLY
DISINTEGRATE
YOUR MONSTER,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.072
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS
ZERO ATTACK POINTS.

00:19:54.072 --> 00:19:56.508
ALL I'M REQUIRED
TO DO IS GIVE UP

00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:58.076
1,000 OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:19:58.076 --> 00:19:59.678

SOME SECRET ABILITY
TO WIPE OUT
MY GILFORD.

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:10.221
YOUR MONSTER
STILL DOESN'T HAVE
ANY ATTACK POINTS,

00:20:10.221 --> 00:20:13.158
WHICH MEANS THAT
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE
ANY LIFE POINTS!

DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:20:14.893 --> 00:20:17.696
LOSING LIFE POINTS
SHOULD BE THE LEAST
OF YOUR WORRIES NOW.

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:19.664
LOOK DOWN!

00:20:19.664 --> 00:20:21.399
