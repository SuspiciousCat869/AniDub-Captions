00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:06.133

TO REVIVE SLIFER

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:12.607
AND SAVE OBELISK!

00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:13.708
AWESOME!

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:15.643
HE USED ONE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
AS A SHIELD

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.211
TO PROTECT
THE OTHER!

00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:18.713
YEAH,
LEAVE IT TO YUGI

00:08:18.713 --> 00:08:20.047
TO COME UP WIT
A MOVE LIKE DAT!

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:22.350
HMM. QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.452
HE SAVED HIMSELF
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:26.554
HEY, SETO, LOOK!

00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:30.024
SLIFER WAS HIT
BY RA!

00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:32.460
AND OBELISK ESCAPED
WITHOUT A SCRATCH!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.367
I WONDER WHAT YUGI'S
GONNA DO NOW.

00:08:39.367 --> 00:08:40.968
Kaiba, voice-over:
IF HE'S SMART,

00:08:40.968 --> 00:08:43.371
HE'LL TAP INTO THE TRUE
POWER OF OBELISK!

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:48.676
AT THIS POINT,
IT'S HIS ONLY CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL.

00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:53.180
IT'S TIME FOR RA
TO RETURN TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:00.321
MY GREAT BEAST MAY BE GONE,

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.057

HE'LL BE BACK!

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.964
WILL RETURN TO THE FIELD
SOONER THAN YOU THINK!

00:09:11.332 --> 00:09:14.735
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE MY DRAGON
A SECOND CHANCE

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:18.139
BY TURNING BACK TIME
AND REPEATING
MY ATTACK AGAIN.

I'LL TAKE YOUR RESPONSE

NEXT, I PLAN TO SACRIFICE

THEIR POWER TO RA--

GIVING MY BEAST

TO DESTROY OBELISK

JUST WHAT YUGI NEEDED.

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:14.232
WHILE IT MAY GRANT MARIK
1,000 LIFE POINTS,

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:17.435
IT ALLOWS YUGI TO SACRIFICE
ONE OF MARIK'S MONSTERS.

00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:21.272
I JUST WONDER WHICH ONE
OF MARIK'S MONSTERS
YUGI WILL CHOOSE.

YOU DO REALIZE
THAT I CAN SACRIFICE
ANY MONSTER I WISH.

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:30.482
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE
GOING TO SACRIFICE RA?

YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE

00:17:18.652 --> 00:17:20.721
WHO COULD CONTROL
THE EVIL WITHIN ME.

00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:23.390
NOW I'M DRIFTING AWAY
INTO THE SHADOWS

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.059
WHILE HIS POWER INCREASES.

00:17:27.127 --> 00:17:29.696
GOODBYE, ODION.

Odion, voice-over:
IT IS MY SWORN DUTY
TO PROTECT MASTER MARIK.

00:17:33.367 --> 00:17:36.603
I MUST NOT ALLOW
HIS DARK SIDE TO PREVAIL

00:17:41.408 --> 00:17:44.244
YOU WERE A FOOL
TO SACRIFICE OBELISK.

00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:45.779
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:49.049
WITHOUT THE POWER OF
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD MONSTER
TO PROTECT YOU,

00:17:49.049 --> 00:17:51.652
YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT.
YOU'RE DONE.

00:17:51.652 --> 00:17:53.520
I HAVE PLENTY LEFT!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.490
LOOK AROUND, I STILL HAVE
EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.958
TO GIVE ME SUPPORT.

00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.993
AND I STILL HAVE
THE HEART OF THE CARDS

00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:01.595
TO GIVE ME STRENGTH.

00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:03.063
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:03.063 --> 00:18:06.333
MY MAGICAL DIMENSION CARD
ALSO ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:08.301
ANY SPELLCASTER
FROM MY HAND.

00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:11.972
OH, NO!
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:18:11.972 --> 00:18:15.942
NOW I PLAY
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:22.549
Seto, voice-over:
WELL, WELL,

00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:25.252
LOOKS LIKE YUGI'S
SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:18:25.252 --> 00:18:28.088
NOW I PLAY
MY FINAL CARD.

00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:31.692
BEHOLD... RAGNAROK!

00:18:31.692 --> 00:18:33.994

AS MY TWO MAGICIANS

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:35.862
UNLOCK THIS CARD'S MAGIC.

00:18:35.862 --> 00:18:38.165
ONCE THIS GREAT POWER
IS RELEASED,

00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:41.168
EVERY MONSTER ON
YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD
WILL BE CRUSHED,

00:18:41.168 --> 00:18:43.804
INCLUDING YOUR WINGED
DRAGON OF RA.

00:18:43.804 --> 00:18:46.540
AND SINCE YOU AND RA
ARE FUSED TOGETHER,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.542
YOU WILL BE DESTROYED
AS WELL!

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.911
[CHUCKLING]
THAT MAY BE,

00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:53.580
BUT THE DEVASTATION
CAUSED BY YOUR ATTACK

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.583
WILL ALSO DESTROY WHAT'S
LEFT OF MY WEAK SIDE.

[CHUCKLES]

00:18:58.018 --> 00:19:01.388
JUST LOOK--THE SHADOWS
HAVE MOST OF HIM ALREADY.

00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:04.057
ONE MORE ATTACK FROM YOU
WILL FINISH HIM OFF.

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:05.759
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:09.062
ONCE RA IS GONE,
HE'LL STILL HAVE
ONE LIFE POINT LEFT.

00:19:09.062 --> 00:19:11.465
THAT MEANS NOTHING!

00:19:11.465 --> 00:19:14.201
ONCE HE'S THAT WEAK,
THE FORCE OF THE SHADOW REALM

00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:16.570
WILL BE TOO STRONG
FOR HIM TO RESIST.

EVER SINCE
YOUR FAMILY TOOK ME IN,

I PLEDGED MY WORD THAT
I WOULD SERVE YOU.

ALL MY LIFE I LONGED
TO BE A TOMBKEEPER LIKE YOU.

IF I WERE TO LET

INTO THE SHADOWS,
