Deck Master System
of dueling, don't you ?

our Deck Master for the
duration of the duel.

Your cards aren't valid

deck from our card database.

When you see a card
you desire, simply touch it.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.331
Choose wisely, for once you make
contact with a card image,

00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:06.037
it's yours for the
entire length of the duel.

00:07:06.037 --> 00:07:07.072
Careful.

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.410
Don't let any
gems slip by.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.583
All right,
let's begin this duel.

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:14.721
How quickly we forget.

00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:16.725
You still have to choose
your Deck Master.

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:21.835
Each monster card has
its own special Deck Master

ability under our
new system.

00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:27.981
Of course, I won't tell
you what those abilities are.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:31.355
You'll have to figure
that out for yourself.

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:33.692

What card should I choose
to be my Deck Master ?

00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:36.064

00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:56.172
Sorry, the rules state
once a Deck Master

00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:58.443
is chosen,
it cannot be changed.

00:07:58.443 --> 00:07:59.746

Deepsea Warrior.

He's powerful
and ruthless, like me.

to business !

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:34.717
I think I'll go first,
if you don't mind.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.364
I summon a monster
facedown in defense mode !

00:08:41.364 --> 00:08:42.968
And that's all for now.

00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:44.270

would it be

only a matter of time before

I eliminate all of
your Life Points !

00:08:59.335 --> 00:09:01.072
Poor Yugi.

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:03.042
You haven't the business
skills necessary

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.948
to wheel-and-deal
with a mogul like me !

00:09:05.948 --> 00:09:07.451
Listen, Gansley...

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:11.359
Duel Monsters is about honor,
trust and respect.

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:13.998
Not about business
skills and making deals.

00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:15.468
So save your
corporate speeches

00:09:15.468 --> 00:09:18.907
for the boardroom and stop
wasting my time.

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:20.745
Why worry about time ?

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:24.586
Once I defeat you, you'll have
nothing but time, as you spend

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:27.225
all of eternity
trapped right here !

00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:33.303
Make your move, Yugi,
so I can seal this

00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:36.343
duel and escape
from this cyber world !

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:37.913
Very well.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.556
I summon
Obnoxious Celtic Guardian !

00:09:46.197 --> 00:09:47.199
Then I'll place

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:48.668
one card facedown !

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.877
Now my, Guardian...

00:09:52.877 --> 00:09:55.717
time to slay
his facedown beast

00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:57.721
with Celtic Blade
Slash Attack !

00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:05.970
Thank you.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.207
Why are you
thanking me for

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:09.478
destroying your
monster, Gansley ?

00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:13.185
The card you destroyed
was Ashinigray !

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:14.387
And ?

00:10:14.387 --> 00:10:16.158
When it's sent to
the Graveyard,

00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:18.262
its attacker must
throw out one card.

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:20.466
Fine.

00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:24.074
I have plenty of
other cards left.

00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:27.281
But that's not my monster's
only special ability.

00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:28.950
It also
allows me to summon

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.587
another Ashinigray
to the field.

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:36.099
Then I can
reshuffle my deck.

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:39.105
Such poor business planning
on your part, Yugi.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.176
Had you done the
appropriate research,

00:10:41.176 --> 00:10:43.514
you could have avoided
this embarrassing loss !

00:10:43.514 --> 00:10:44.917
I'm not done !

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:47.021
♪

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.991
Aww, how cute !

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.730
Maybe this place
isn't so bad after all.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.999
The scenery is awesome.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.944
The breeze is nice, too.

00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:02.619
That's cold !

00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:03.856
Weird.

00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:06.327
If this place is some kind
of virtual illusion,

00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:08.899
how can I feel anything ?

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:11.103
I don't get this
place at all.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:12.105
It feels...

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:13.442
so real.

00:11:15.646 --> 00:11:16.948
I take it back.

00:11:16.948 --> 00:11:19.520
I don't wanna be here
alone anymore.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.756
I gotta find Joey !

00:11:22.693 --> 00:11:23.695
Where are you ?

00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:29.073
Yo, where am I ?

00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:30.944
The last thing
I remember was putting

00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:33.683
a scare into those
Big Five sleaze balls.

00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:36.856
Now I'm stranded in
some weird castle.

00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:39.428
All right, you monkey
suit-wearing pencil-pushers !

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.332
Show yourselves
so I can readjust

00:11:41.332 --> 00:11:43.336
your uptown attitudes !

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:47.277
I know you weasels are watching,
so come out and duel !

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:49.281
I'm not scared
of your bald heads

00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:51.553
and outdated neckties,
you old freaks !

00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:54.158
Got that ?

00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.663
And I don't have all day
to play hide-and-seek

00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:58.467
either so let's
get this over with

00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.769
so I can get on
with my life !

00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:02.909
Gotcha !

00:12:02.909 --> 00:12:04.612
Well, uh,
maybe not...

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.989
Don't look at me like that,
you oversized tin can,

00:12:08.989 --> 00:12:11.460
or I'll turn you
into scrap metal so fast,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.528
your head'll spin !

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:13.565
You got that ?

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:17.271
( Tristan )
Hey, Serenity !

00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:19.209
( Duke )
Serenity !

00:12:19.209 --> 00:12:20.679
You in here somewhere ?

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:22.349
We're coming to get you !

00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:25.355
It's no use.

00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:27.426
This virtual hallway
could go on forever !

00:12:27.426 --> 00:12:28.628
We can't give up !

00:12:28.628 --> 00:12:30.399
Serenity's
gotta be here !

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.769
Yeah, but where ?

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:33.338
I don't know, somewhere.

00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:35.208
Look around, Tristan.

00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:36.845
This thing must go
on for miles !

00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:39.851
Look, Duke,
I don't know about you

00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.122
but I'm not stopping
'til I find her !

00:12:42.122 --> 00:12:44.026
You in or not ?
Well, uh...

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:45.028
I guess...

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.903
( Mokuba )
Hey, Seto.

00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:51.943
I know The Big Five wanna use
us to escape from this place,

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:54.214
but what's the deal
with that Noah kid ?

00:12:54.214 --> 00:12:58.723
I mean, who is he and what's
he getting out of all this ?

00:12:58.723 --> 00:12:59.992
Ah, Seto ?

00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:01.228
Did you hear me ?

00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:02.932
I was just wondering
who Noah--

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:05.504
Yes, I heard your
question, Mokuba.

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:07.274
I have no answer.

00:13:07.274 --> 00:13:10.414
If I had to guess, I'd say
he wants what's mine.

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:11.816
Just like everyone else,

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:14.789
he wants to be as powerful
as I am.

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:18.063
What puzzles me the most
is how he created this place.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.700
There's no way that
little punk built

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.004
a virtual universe
on his own.

00:13:22.004 --> 00:13:24.275
Maybe The Big Five
helped him.

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:25.678
Oh, I doubt it.

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:28.484
Those old fools
couldn't pull this off.

00:13:28.484 --> 00:13:29.953
Granted it's only
a copy of the

00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:32.826
virtual technology
that I invented,

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:36.066
but someone else is
involved and I'll find them !

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.204
It's only a matter
of time.

00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:39.206
I'll help you, Seto !

00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:40.441
Come on !

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.684
Get ready...

00:13:44.684 --> 00:13:46.153
to lose your mind !

00:13:48.324 --> 00:13:49.694
Excellent.

00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:53.769
Ipiria is just the monster
I needed to close this deal.

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:56.208
Soon I'll be free
again !

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.612
You know, Yugi,
I'm a businessman,

00:13:58.612 --> 00:14:00.049
and in the world
of business,

00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.386
there are three secrets
to success that are

00:14:02.386 --> 00:14:05.059
guaranteed to
crush the competition,

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:07.196
so listen closely.

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.570
The first is build
a powerful workforce.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.708
So, come forth, Ipiria !

00:14:16.782 --> 00:14:17.851
This lets me draw

00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:21.492
another card to
increase my dueling options.

00:14:21.492 --> 00:14:24.031
Then I'll change Ashinigray
to attack mode.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:25.667
Thus building up
my workforce.

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:29.508
( squawking )

00:14:30.778 --> 00:14:34.118
The second secret of success
is quite a simple one:

00:14:34.118 --> 00:14:36.623
know your own resources.

00:14:36.623 --> 00:14:39.796
By changing Ashinigray from
defense to attack mode,

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.833
I triggered its
special ability, forcing

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:44.906
you to discard one card
from your hand !

00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:46.576
All right.

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:50.017
I told you you couldn't
keep up with the bigwigs !

00:14:50.017 --> 00:14:52.255
Now for the last
and most important

00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:54.627
secret of success in
the business world.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:57.433
Always keep your
competition guessing !

00:14:57.433 --> 00:15:00.539
And I assure you, you
have no idea of

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:03.345
the horrors I have
in store for you !

00:15:06.417 --> 00:15:09.523
( panting )

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:13.264
I give up, Tristan.

00:15:13.264 --> 00:15:16.003
If we're going to rescue
Serenity, we need a new plan.

00:15:16.003 --> 00:15:17.272
Plan ?

00:15:17.272 --> 00:15:21.147
It's obvious this thing was
built to go on forever !

00:15:21.147 --> 00:15:22.484
It has no end !

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:23.486
So what ?

00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:25.356
So we won't find any
way out because

00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:27.327
this virtual hallway
doesn't have one !

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:28.529
C'mon.

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:31.101
Try having a little
bit a faith, will you ?

00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:33.072
You got any
bright ideas ?

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:35.176
Actually I do !

00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:37.113
If there are no
exits in this place,

00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:39.284
then all we gotta
do is make one.

00:15:40.654 --> 00:15:42.892
We'll smash through
the wall, dude !

00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:44.161
Good luck.

00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:46.064
These aren't
even real walls.

00:15:46.064 --> 00:15:48.102
Just some computerized
images that are

00:15:48.102 --> 00:15:51.008
designed to look
like real walls, you see ?

00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:52.211
Look, if you can
touch 'em,

00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:55.150
then they're real
enough to break down !

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.586
Break down
with what ?

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.525
Whoa !

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:03.433
( Duke )
If that ax is just an illusion,
how can he be holding it ?

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:04.670
Batter up !

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:09.379
♪

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:10.949
( Téa )
Hello ?

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:11.951
Anybody out there ?

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:18.631
Where am I ?

00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:21.738
It's like a virtual
Grand Canyon.

00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:24.611
This place is
creeping me out.

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:26.781
Where is everyone ?

And could it be
any hotter ?

( rocks rumbling )

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:35.366
Huh ?

What was that ?

What's that ?

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.443
It looks like
a way out !

Come on, Seto !

Slow down !

00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:22.662
It's probably an
emergency exit !

right there !

00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:30.111
We have to
be careful.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.189
I can't see.

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.260
It's too bright.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.397
Wait a sec...

00:17:39.397 --> 00:17:41.166
I know
this place !

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:43.338
It's the orphanage
we grew up in.

00:17:43.338 --> 00:17:44.907
Who knew it was
still around ?

00:17:44.907 --> 00:17:46.544
( Seto )
It's a trick, Mokuba.

00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:49.583
A cheap virtual illusion,
like everything else.

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:51.922
But how did Noah
find out we once lived here ?

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:57.199
We may as well close the
book on this duel, Yugi.

00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.604
Thanks to my wise investments,
I predict

00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:02.276
a major growth
in power for me !

00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:04.548
While you sink deeper
into debt thanks

00:18:04.548 --> 00:18:07.721
to your pathetic
Deck Master, Kuriboh !

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:08.723
Kuri !

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:10.994
Kuri, Kuri, Kuri !

00:18:10.994 --> 00:18:14.067
Well, it appears your little
fur ball has an idea.

00:18:14.067 --> 00:18:15.804
Too bad
he can't speak !

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:16.840
Kuri !

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.309
Stay calm.

00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:20.748
( Yugi )
I wish I knew what Kuriboh
was trying to tell me.

00:18:20.748 --> 00:18:22.083
He may know something
about these new

00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:24.455
Deck Master dueling
rules that I don't.

00:18:24.455 --> 00:18:27.661
And right now I could use all
the advice I can get !

00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:28.864
Give up yet ?

00:18:28.864 --> 00:18:29.866
No !

00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:33.106
Just what I needed.

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:34.108
Now...

00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:36.981
I play Polymerization !

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:40.154
Fusing together
Berfomet and Gazelle,

00:18:40.154 --> 00:18:42.091
the King of Mythical Beasts !

00:18:44.997 --> 00:18:48.404
To form Chimera,
the Flying Mythical Beast !

00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:51.510
Then I'll activate my
magic card, Quick Attack !

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.487
Allowing my Chimera to
attack your Ipiria now !

00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:01.363
An interesting move,
Yugi.

00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:04.102
But a very poor
business decision.

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:07.677
And now, it's time for you
to pay the price !

00:19:07.677 --> 00:19:09.848
Explain yourself,
Gansley !

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:12.787
Remember, I've taken the
form of Deepsea Warrior !

00:19:12.787 --> 00:19:16.026
And thanks to my
Deck Master ability,

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:19.834
I can sacrifice my two monsters
to create this !

00:19:21.204 --> 00:19:25.713
Reflector Hole, bounce his
attack right back !

00:19:25.713 --> 00:19:27.049
What ?

00:19:28.653 --> 00:19:30.557
( growling )

00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:32.126
No !

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:42.714
Looks like your Life Points
are starting to collapse.

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:44.585
And before long,
you'll be completely

00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:47.157
drained of everything
you have !

00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:50.230
You haven't put me out of
business yet, Gansley !

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.902
It's only a matter
of time, Yugi !

00:19:52.902 --> 00:19:56.309
Soon my colleagues and I will
destroy you and your friends

00:19:56.309 --> 00:20:00.050
in the greatest corporate
takeover in history !

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.620
Speaking of your friends,

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.157
I wonder how they're
holding up

00:20:03.157 --> 00:20:04.526
in their
new environment ?

00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:06.024
Think about it.

00:20:06.024 --> 00:20:09.961
Those fools must be suffering
even greater losses than you !

00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:11.830
And you can't
save them !

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:12.931
He's right !

00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:15.100
We've got to end
this and find them !

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.435
One more attack to your
small reserve of Life Points

00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:20.271
and your resources will be
completely wiped out,

00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:22.540
leaving you
trapped here forever !

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.709
( laughing )
