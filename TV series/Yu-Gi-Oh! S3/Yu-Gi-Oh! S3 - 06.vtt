00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:02.806
( announcer )
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh"...

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:03.809
Who are you ?

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:05.646
And what do you want
from me anyway ?

00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:08.385
The name's Crump, former
accountant of Kaiba Corp.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:09.989
I'm one of the
Big Five !

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.564
There's a 100% chance that
we're going to duel !

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.038
Winner gets to leave this world,
loser is trapped here forever.

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:18.875
Looks like my
iceberg dueling field

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.914
is about to
leave you cold !

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:24.722
As per the new rules, it's time
to choose your Deck Master.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.528
Dark Magician Girl's my Deck
Master, who's yours ?

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.600
I've already taken
the form of a monster

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.837
known as Nightmare Penguin,
you fool !

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:33.474
Time to duel,
shorty !

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:34.678
We won our duel,

00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:37.517
but I sense a whole
new game has just begun.

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:39.188
Téa needs our
help right now.

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:40.724
We have to find
what part of this

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:42.862
virtual world Noah
sent her to !

00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:44.934
Attack,
mighty Sea snake !

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.337
My life points !

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:48.642
As each duelist's
life points decrease,

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:50.580
his or her body
will become encased

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.117
in a block of
solid ice !

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.693
Your mind will be frozen stiff
until the end of time !

( Mokuba )
I wonder if these virtual
berries have any taste.

00:02:03.643 --> 00:02:06.884
I feel like I haven't
eaten in months.

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:09.589
Hey, do you think anyone's
serving food in that shack ?

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.592
I doubt it.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.202
Hmmm... a house in
the middle of the woods ?

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.909
This seems a little
too convenient... !

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.815
( Mokuba )
You think it's another one
of Noah's virtual traps ?

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:24.390
Just let me open it and stay
right next to me, Mokuba.

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:27.497
What ?

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:28.566
Hold on !

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.269
It's our stepfather's
old house !

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:35.147
Another blast
from our past !

00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:37.552
Look !

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:40.559
It's a virtual projection
of our first day in this house !

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.895
That's right !

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.503
It's the day Gozaburo took
us home from the orphanage !

00:02:45.503 --> 00:02:47.909
And it was
no picnic !

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.118
( professor )
Now, if a train from Boston is
traveling at 180 miles per hour

00:02:52.118 --> 00:02:54.757
and a train from New York is
traveling at the same speed...

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:56.261
( Hobson )
Wake up !

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:57.964
I sincerely
apologize for

00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:00.169
interrupting your
lesson, professor.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.040
But it seems young
Seto was more

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.545
concerned with the
backs of his eyelids.

00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:06.484
Continue.

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:07.987
I have strict orders.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.191
My boss has no
patience for slackers.

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:11.194
What ?

00:03:11.194 --> 00:03:12.765
I don't slack !

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:15.103
( stepfather )
I hear you're falling
behind in your studies...

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:18.945
... so you'll no
longer have the

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:21.050
weekends off starting
immediately.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.392
But... I've been
working so hard !

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:27.497
Not hard enough !

00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:29.669
You must have
discipline, Seto.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.110
It's the only way
to crush your enemies !

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.181
But I don't
have enemies !

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.484
Of course you do !

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.522
You're just not
aware of them yet !

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:39.725
You have to learn
that you can

00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:41.796
trust no
one at all !

00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:43.734
Including me !

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:44.869
Hobson !

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:48.177
Confiscate Seto's toys
immediately.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:49.346
Yes, sir.

00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:50.883
Maybe now you'll
concentrate on

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:54.157
your studies instead
of wasting your brain away !

00:03:54.157 --> 00:03:55.961
( Hobson )
Well, that ought to do it...

00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:58.199
It's for your own good.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.605
Your stepfather's
a very wise man and

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:02.743
I think he knows
what's best for you.

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.981
So I'd advise you
not to disappoint him.

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:10.360
The way they
treat Seto stinks !

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.330
But I know how to
make him smile !

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:17.910
( Mukuba )
Well, here goes.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.913
'Scuse me.

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:20.783
Hey, back to bed.

00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:24.959
Okay, but first I gotta give
Seto his textbook back...

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.095
You heard dad !

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:29.035
Gotta study,
study, study !

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:32.442
If I see one more textbook,
I think I'm gonna barf !

00:04:34.247 --> 00:04:35.249
( Hobson )
Sleeping ?

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.451
Already ?

00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:39.725
You still have one more
lesson left tonight.

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:41.630
And you left this
textbook behind.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.669
If I were you, I'd be more
careful next time.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.806
Whatever you
say, Hobson.

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:49.915
Your next lesson's
in one hour.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.084
( Seto )
I can't take this !

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.198
( Mokuba )
Dear Seto...

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:59.135
I guess you found
my hiding place.

00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:02.977
Remember, big bro, they can't
take away everything from us.

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:05.550
So enjoy my gift,
but don't let them find it !

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.553
Love, Mokie.

00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:07.555
Thanks, Bro.

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:11.530
My Duel Monsters cards !

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.169
Well, they're not the greatest
cards but they're mine !

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.510
A Blue-Eyes
White Dragon ?

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.650
Mokuba made me
a Blue Eyes card.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.058
One day, I know I'll have
the real thing in my deck.

00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:25.294
Just wait.

00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:33.879
A good show by
the Kaiba boys.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.618
That trip down memory
lane really

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:37.120
pulls at the heart strings,
doesn't it ?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.357
( Steo )
Noah !

00:05:38.357 --> 00:05:41.530
We've had enough of your
sick and twisted games !

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.534
Why, the game's
only just begun.

00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:45.273
So get ready
to relive every

00:05:45.273 --> 00:05:47.811
painful moment of
your entire lives !

00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:49.247
What ?

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:51.987
It's gonna be
a very bumpy ride...

00:05:51.987 --> 00:05:53.089
Look, kid.

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.860
What do you expect
to gain from this ?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.863
Everything that
should have been

00:05:55.863 --> 00:05:57.500
mine from the
beginning !

00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:06.687
( Yugi )
This game's
pretty easy.

00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:08.825
The stars above
each door represent the

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.130
strength of the
monster behind that door.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.934
Beat the monster
and get through !

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:14.971
( Yumi )
There's a clue
we're missing.

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:16.375
But what
can it be ?

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.377
I know !

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.282
Maybe the stars represent
more than just

00:06:19.282 --> 00:06:21.620
the power level of
the monsters !

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.023
But what, Yugi ?

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:26.163
Well what if, they're like,
directions for us !

00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:27.266
Yeah !

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.437
Through the one-star
door first, then the two,

00:06:29.437 --> 00:06:31.609
then the three,
then the four !

00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:33.748
Yes, and the reason you
and I have been traveling

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:36.186
around in circles
is because we've only been

00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:37.389
choosing to battle
against the

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.560
monsters that
have one star.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.164
Well, let's try
this door !

00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:47.377
So now I play
Obnoxious Celtic Guardian !

00:06:47.377 --> 00:06:48.380
Attack !

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:53.993
Well done !

00:06:53.993 --> 00:06:56.365
Now, let's go through
and find Téa !

00:06:57.901 --> 00:06:59.739
( Téa )
A bit brisk,
isn't it ?

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.311
I can't even
f-feel my toes !

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:07.422
Advantage number 204
of being a penguin !

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:10.129
We have thermo-insulated
flipper feet !

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.101
Now let's get back
to business, shall we ?

00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.173
( Dark Magician Girl )
Be strong.

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:16.476
All right, let's
do this !

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:17.612
Good.

00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:19.282
The sooner you make
your move the sooner

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:22.690
I can freeze you over
and win this duel.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.628
You're already
knee-deep in ice !

00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:27.434
And the worst is
yet to come, my dear !

00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:29.338
My all-powerful
flying penguin is ready

00:07:29.338 --> 00:07:30.975
to soar straight through your
puny defense !

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:32.345
No !

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:35.050
If his Flying Penguin attacks
I'll be wide open !

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.523
And if I place you on the
playing field to defend me,

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.294
then he'll just
destroy you !

00:07:39.294 --> 00:07:41.331
So very true.

00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.672
And if your Deck Master is
destroyed, well, then you

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:47.044
automatically lose
the duel, my dear !

00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:50.285
I'll place one monster
face down in

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:53.826
defense mode and then
I'll end my turn, Crump !

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:57.902
An extremely desperate move for
an extremely desperate girl !

00:07:57.902 --> 00:08:00.976
And my hand continues to
grow more powerful !

00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:04.149
And now, take this !

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:06.220
Flying Penguin attack !

00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:12.401
Ha !

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.505
There goes your
facedown card !

00:08:14.505 --> 00:08:15.842
Now you're back where
you started !

00:08:15.842 --> 00:08:17.312
Not quite !

00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:20.285
You revealed my Skelengel which
lets me draw one new card !

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:24.762
Magic Formula, this may
come in handy.

00:08:24.762 --> 00:08:26.934
I ran the numbers and
you've run out of luck,

00:08:26.934 --> 00:08:29.773
so play whatever pathetic
cards you'd like,

00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:32.112
'cause it's only a matter
of time before you're frozen

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:37.189
here forever, or my name isn't
Adrienne Randolph Crump III.

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:41.198
A master in the art of Number
crunching, I must say,

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:43.704
and best dressed
penguin in the world !

00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:47.746
You are a weird
little bird, Crump !

00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:50.953
And I'm in the mood
for a barbecue !

00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:52.223
What's this ?

00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:53.894
Maha Vailo ?

00:08:53.894 --> 00:08:55.999
No, he's not
powerful enough !

00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:58.538
There's no way he'll
beat Flying Penguin !

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.611
( Dark Magician Girl )
Téa, don't give
up so fast.

00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.785
He has a secret skill
that can help you !

00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:05.787
Huh ?

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:07.591
What kind of
a skill ?

00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:08.626
Hold on !

00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:10.130
I remember this !

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.068
Yugi once told me
about this card !

00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:16.644
You wanna know which card
is most like me ?

00:09:16.644 --> 00:09:18.415
Wait, I know.

00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:19.952
Well, I think I know.

00:09:19.952 --> 00:09:22.390
It's that purple guy with
the big hat, right ?

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.829
Uh, big hat ?

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:27.235
Oh, you mean my
Dark Magician card.

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:28.705
Well, even though
it's pretty great,

00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:31.678
I don't think it's the
card that's most like me.

00:09:31.678 --> 00:09:32.981
Okay.

00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:33.984
Ah !

00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:35.587
This is the one !

00:09:35.587 --> 00:09:37.658
Pretty cool, right ?

00:09:37.658 --> 00:09:39.730
Maha Vailo ?

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.402
He may not be as strong
as the Dark Magician, well,

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:44.874
not when you first look
at him anyway.

00:09:44.874 --> 00:09:46.378
But if you look
closer, you'll see

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.550
a hidden power
deep inside !

00:09:50.353 --> 00:09:51.389
Of course !

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:53.059
It's hidden strength !

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.529
I'm not done yet !

00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:58.940
Now I summon Maha Vailo
in attack mode !

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:01.912
That's weak !

00:10:01.912 --> 00:10:04.117
Wait, I'm not done !

00:10:04.117 --> 00:10:05.354
Check this out !

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:08.728
I activate
Magic Formula,

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:11.767
raising my monster's
attack points by 500 !

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:15.008
You must have failed all of your
math courses, kid, because it's

00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:18.783
still too short on attack points
to defeat my Flying Penguin !

00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:22.191
I guess you don't know about
Maha Vailo's hidden power !

00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:26.133
He gets 500 extra attack points
for each one of my magic cards !

00:10:28.472 --> 00:10:29.474
No fair !

00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:30.877
Oh, it's fair.

00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:32.982
Go, Maha Vailo !

00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.888
Attack his Flying Penguin
with Sacred Lightning !

00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:38.561
Add this up, Crump !

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:52.459
Extra Crispy Fried
Penguin, anyone ?

00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:57.537
We're safe, at
least for now.

00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:04.920
( Téa )
I'm f-f-freezing !

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.127
I don't know how much longer
I can last out here !

00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:09.230
We're getting close.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.834
Yeah, Téa's getting louder !

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.943
( Yugi )
Time is running out.

00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:17.548
Yami and I have to defeat more
of Noah's monsters so we can

00:11:17.548 --> 00:11:19.653
get through this
virtual maze and find

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:22.025
Téa before it's
too late !

00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:23.495
I see another set
of doors ahead !

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:27.838
We need the
three-star door !

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:30.277
( Yami )
There it is !

00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:34.018
Yes !

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:37.760
Swift Gaia,
the Fierce Knight, attack !

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.064
No, stop the attack !

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.536
It's too late !

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:48.919
Gaia !

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:51.491
That door has been
equipped with a trap card !

00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:52.761
Look more closely.

00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:54.063
Right under the stars !

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.104
Three facedown cards !

00:11:57.104 --> 00:11:58.440
Of course !

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.781
Then that blast had to be
a Mirror Force trap card !

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:03.685
So try again.

00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:05.355
Here goes !

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:06.892
I summon Gazelle !

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:13.473
( Yami )
It looks like Dark King of the
Abyss, a weaker monster.

00:12:13.473 --> 00:12:15.077
Awesome !

00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:16.413
Say goodbye !

00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:17.549
No, wait !

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:20.155
Another facedown card
is being activated !

00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:21.358
Now it's stronger !

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:26.703
Then I summon
Berfomet !

00:12:28.507 --> 00:12:31.046
Then I'll use this !

00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:32.349
Polymerization...

00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:33.718
fuse them together !

00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.823
To form Chimera !

00:12:35.823 --> 00:12:37.928
Now attack,
my Mythical Beast !

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:43.808
Yes !

00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:45.412
Let's go !

00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:51.091
Now where's that
four-star monster ?

00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:52.093
There it is !

00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:53.229
Patience, Yugi.

00:12:53.229 --> 00:12:55.033
You must be
very careful.

00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:58.841
This door has been
equipped with five cards !

00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:02.048
Noah could have hidden just
about anything behind that door.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:04.587
And you're low on cards,
so choose wisely !

00:13:05.724 --> 00:13:06.726
You're right !

00:13:06.726 --> 00:13:08.496
I only have
a few cards left !

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.267
Defeating a four
star monster plus

00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:12.940
four facedown cards
is no easy task.

00:13:14.744 --> 00:13:15.846
This may do it !

00:13:15.846 --> 00:13:18.552
No, you mustn't play Dark
Magician yet !

00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:19.688
Okay.

00:13:21.025 --> 00:13:23.630
Then how 'bout
the Heavy Storm magic card ?

00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:30.011
It destroys all
magic and trap cards !

00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:31.047
Nice work.

00:13:31.047 --> 00:13:33.118
Now his monster
stands alone !

00:13:33.118 --> 00:13:35.324
With no facedown
cards to protect it !

00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:39.298
Destroy it, Yugi.

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:42.840
4-Starred Ladybug
Of Doom should do the trick !

00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:46.548
It may seem weak,
but watch this !

00:13:49.856 --> 00:13:54.032
It automatically destroys
all 4-star monsters !

00:13:58.675 --> 00:13:59.778
Oh yeah !

00:13:59.778 --> 00:14:00.980
Excellent move.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.183
Thanks !

00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:03.519
It's a good thing
I had that little

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:05.156
critter stashed
in my deck!

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:06.459
This could be
the last door !

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.063
Come on !

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:11.838
Téa !

00:14:12.874 --> 00:14:14.344
This doesn't look good !

00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:15.613
Don't worry, Téa !

00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:16.749
Stay strong !

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:18.620
I'm right here for you !

00:14:19.688 --> 00:14:23.364
All right, then
I play Bolt Penguin !

00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:24.934
In defense mode !

00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:29.678
And as an extra precaution,
I'll play one card face down !

00:14:29.678 --> 00:14:32.685
Your little turkey
only has 800 defense points !

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:36.259
I can stuff it and
roast it with one blast !

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.665
So stand back, Crump !

00:14:38.665 --> 00:14:42.907
Maha Vailo, attack his
bolt penguin now !

00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:50.825
All my calculations
were right on the money !

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.229
Now I activate...

00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:54.834
Revenge sacrifice !

00:14:56.003 --> 00:14:57.808
Goodbye, Maha Vailo !

00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:00.280
No !

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.349
Not him !

00:15:01.349 --> 00:15:03.286
Revenge Sacrifice
destroys the card

00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:06.761
you used to attack
my monster !

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:09.800
And now I'll defend
myself with this monster !

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.242
The impenetrable
Defender Iceberg !

00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:21.394
Check that out.

00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:23.164
It's like
a giant ice cube !

00:15:23.164 --> 00:15:27.741
Yes, a giant ice cube
with 2450 defense points !

00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.177
You'll never
get past that !

00:15:29.177 --> 00:15:30.815
And don't think
I'm done !

00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:36.226
I'll place this face down,
and summon Penguin Torpedo !

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:39.300
This little bird is
a real blast, kid !

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.011
Especially when my Deck Master
ability gives it a boost !

00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:46.850
I almost forgot.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.459
It can attack your
life points directly !

00:15:52.296 --> 00:15:53.298
Téa !

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:58.042
And since you lost
a chunk of life points,

00:15:58.042 --> 00:16:00.314
you gain another
chunk of ice !

00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:03.020
Yes, it's quite chilling,
isn't it ?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.723
L-L-Look Crump...

00:16:04.723 --> 00:16:06.928
I'm not out yet !

00:16:06.928 --> 00:16:08.032
( Téa )
These two cards
won't help !

00:16:08.032 --> 00:16:09.467
I'm out of moves !

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:12.041
( Dark Magician Girl )
There is one thing
you can do, Téa.

00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:14.211
Move me onto
the playing field.

00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.213
Trust me.

00:16:15.213 --> 00:16:16.717
It's your last hope !

00:16:16.717 --> 00:16:19.457
I guess I have
nothing to lose.

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:22.129
I move Dark Magician Girl
to the field !

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:25.838
Don't you realize if your Deck
Master is destroyed, you lose ?

00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:29.746
You must have a pathetic
hand to make that move !

00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:31.183
Now watch and learn !

00:16:31.183 --> 00:16:33.856
I activate
Ocean Of Regeneration

00:16:33.856 --> 00:16:37.831
and bring back my old friend,
Penguin Torpedo !

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.971
This magic card allows me to
bring any water monster back

00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:43.276
from my graveyard
for one turn !

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:46.650
Penguin Torpedo, attack her
life points directly again !

00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:56.339
No !

00:16:56.339 --> 00:17:00.281
Suddenly, I'm in the mood
for a tall glass of Iced Téa !

00:17:07.497 --> 00:17:12.175
Soon I'll return to the real
world as a free bird !

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:13.177
Leave her alone !

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:14.179
Téa !

00:17:15.715 --> 00:17:18.622
If she loses this duel
she'll be trapped here !

00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:19.926
But it's not fair !

00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:22.431
She's not experienced enough !

00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:24.669
And she's losing badly.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.407
Téa can win, Yugi.

00:17:26.407 --> 00:17:28.177
By trusting herself
and believing

00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:29.479
in the heart
of the cards !

00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:35.125
( Téa )
I'm down to my
last few life points.

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:36.997
And my Dark Magician Girl
isn't strong

00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:38.934
enough to get
past his defense.

00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:40.839
Plus, since she's
my Deck Master,

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:43.845
if she's destroyed
I automatically lose !

00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:47.721
( Dark Magician Girl )
Téa, there is one card in your
deck that can save us.

00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.157
It's the first
card you picked.

00:17:50.526 --> 00:17:51.763
( Téa )
Wait...

00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:54.302
... is it the
Sage's Stone magic card ?

00:17:54.302 --> 00:17:55.472
( Dark Magician Girl )
Yes, Téa.

00:17:55.472 --> 00:17:57.844
That's the card you
need to draw !

00:17:57.844 --> 00:18:01.752
But, it could be at the bottom
of my deck for all I know !

00:18:01.752 --> 00:18:03.790
I will help you
draw this card.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.565
To do this, I must first invoke
my Deck Master special ability

00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:11.675
to call upon every monster
in your graveyard, Téa !

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:12.944
Behold !

00:18:12.944 --> 00:18:14.915
Dark Magic Energies !

00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:16.552
Please hear my call !

00:18:16.552 --> 00:18:19.626
Enter our graveyard and
revive the monsters within !

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.841
What's going on ?

00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:29.481
( Dark Magician Girl )
Téa, I have formed
a Soul Circle with the

00:18:29.481 --> 00:18:31.920
four monsters in your card
graveyard.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.225
This allows you to
draw four new cards.

00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:39.370
The rest is up to you.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.472
( Téa )
Let's see.

00:18:40.472 --> 00:18:41.942
Did I draw the
card I need ?

00:18:43.712 --> 00:18:44.715
Yes !

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:46.051
There it is !

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.521
Now to...ugh - play it !

00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:48.523
Ugh, stupid ice !

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:49.559
There !

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.561
Did it !

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.637
So what exactly
does this card do ?

00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:00.116
( Yugi )
What's up with
my duel disc ?

00:19:01.318 --> 00:19:02.387
Whoa.

00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:06.096
My Dark Magician !

00:19:06.096 --> 00:19:07.299
But how was he summoned ?

00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:16.686
Dark magician ?

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:21.397
I have no idea where he came
from, but I am not complaining !

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:24.938
What ?

00:19:24.938 --> 00:19:27.878
My calculations assured me
that I would win this duel !

00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:30.517
This just doesn't
add up at all !

00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:34.326
The power of the Sage's Stone
magic card bestows upon me the

00:19:34.326 --> 00:19:37.031
unique ability to call forth
the Dark Magician

00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:38.535
from any nearby
player's deck !

00:19:38.535 --> 00:19:39.537
What ?

00:19:39.537 --> 00:19:40.807
It can't be !

00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:43.012
Double Dark Magic Attack !

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:55.173
( yelling )

00:20:04.894 --> 00:20:06.631
( Dark Magician Girl )
Our task is complete.

00:20:09.505 --> 00:20:11.142
Whoa, I won.

00:20:17.556 --> 00:20:19.125
( Yugi )
Téa, can you
hear me ?

00:20:21.164 --> 00:20:22.166
Téa !

00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:24.271
You did it !

00:20:25.473 --> 00:20:29.582
Yugi, I was almost
a human ice pop !

00:20:31.254 --> 00:20:32.924
I'm so glad
to see you !

00:20:34.894 --> 00:20:36.498
Me too, Téa.

00:20:36.498 --> 00:20:39.454
And now that we're together,
I promise it'll stay that way.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.857
How cute.

00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:44.826
Little do they realize
I'm just getting warmed up.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:46.094
Fools !

00:20:46.094 --> 00:20:48.997
They'll never escape
my virtual universe !

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:49.998
Never !
