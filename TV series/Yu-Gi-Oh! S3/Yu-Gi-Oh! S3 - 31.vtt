00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:45.440
I'LL DEAL
WITH YOU, KAIBA.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.511
I'LL SEE YOU IN ONE HOUR.

00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:52.514
AND I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:09:58.183 --> 00:09:59.918
Tristan: WHAT'S THE DEAL, DOC?

00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:03.956
Doctor: HIS BRAIN
IS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY
AND HIS HEART RATE IS FINE.

00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:05.290
HE DOESN'T
LOOK FINE!

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.359
HE HASN'T MOVED
OR SPOKEN

00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:09.428
IN TWENTY
MINUTES!

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:13.799
JOEY! PLEASE!
YOU GOTTA OPEN YOUR EYES!

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:18.103
Joey: HEY!
DIS ISN'T KAIBA'S DUEL TOWER!

00:10:18.103 --> 00:10:20.005
HOW IN DA WORLD
DID I GET OUT HERE?

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:22.775
Grandpa: THERE YOU ARE, JOEY!

00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:25.310
Joey: MR. MUTO!?
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN HIDIN'!?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.780
WE SHOULD BE
ASKING YOU THAT!

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.215
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU!

00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:32.184
NOW MOVE
YOUR TAIL FEATHERS!

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:33.919
SO WHERE ARE WE GOIN' ANYWAY?

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:34.987
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:36.655
A HUGE
DUEL MONSTERS TOURNAMENT

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:38.757
STARTS TODAY
AND YOU'RE LATE
FOR YOUR FIRST DUEL!

00:10:38.757 --> 00:10:41.226
BUT AREN'T WE ALREADY
IN A TOURNAMENT?

00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:42.394
YEAH BUT THIS IS A DREAM

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:44.163
SO IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE SENSE.

00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:45.964
THAT'S
A GOOD POINT YUGI.

00:10:45.964 --> 00:10:48.901
BUT DREAM OR NO DREAM
IF YOU MISS THIS DUEL
YOUNG MAN

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:50.969
YOU'LL BE DISQUALIFIED
FROM THE TOURNAMENT!

00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:52.171
HOLD ON.

00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.839
MAYBE DAT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD THING.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.074
I NEED SOME REST!

00:10:55.074 --> 00:10:56.709
Yugi: COME ON JOEY!

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:01.647
THIS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT TOURNAMENT
OF YOUR LIFE!

00:11:01.647 --> 00:11:03.716
Doctor: IT'S SO STRANGE.

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:06.385
JOEY'S BRAIN ACTIVITY
IS QUITE HIGH.

00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:08.754
HOWEVER, HE'S NOT
CONSCIOUS AT ALL.

00:11:08.754 --> 00:11:13.025
TO BE HONEST I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:15.394
JOEY'S WILL
IS VERY STRONG.

00:11:15.394 --> 00:11:19.698
HIS MIND MUST BE
FIGHTING OFF
THE SHADOWS.

00:11:19.698 --> 00:11:20.733
IT'S ALRIGHT
SERENITY.

00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:23.435
I JUST WANT
MY BROTHER BACK.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:25.571
I UNDERSTAND.

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:31.243
BOTH OF OUR BROTHERS
MUST NOW BATTLE
THE DARKNESS.

00:11:31.243 --> 00:11:32.511
Tea: MOKUBA!

00:11:32.511 --> 00:11:34.780
WHEN ARE WE
MOVING JOEY TO
A REAL HOSPITAL!!

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.248
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

00:11:36.248 --> 00:11:38.951
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA MOVE
JOEY ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW GUYS.

00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:41.153
THOSE ORDERS CAME FROM SETO.

00:11:41.153 --> 00:11:42.621
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING!

00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.823
HE SAYS
OUR OWN DOCTORS
ARE GOOD ENOUGH.

00:11:44.823 --> 00:11:46.325
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:48.160
BESIDES OUR
ENGINES ARE DAMAGED

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.295
AND WE CAN'T MOVE.

00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:52.464
IT HAPPENED WHEN WE
JUST BARELY ESCAPED
THAT EXPLOSION

00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:56.468
ON THE WAY TO
KAIBA CORP ISLAND.

00:12:01.273 --> 00:12:03.909
THE SHIP MADE IT HERE
BUT NOW OUR ENGINES ARE DOWN.

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:06.044
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL ANYONE.

00:12:06.044 --> 00:12:07.646
SO WE'RE STUCK HERE!?

00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:09.281
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING!

00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.550
I'LL RADIO HEADQUARTERS
AND MAKE SURE THEY SEND OVER

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.585
A HELICOPTER
RIGHT AWAY GUYS!

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:16.054
MOKUBA THANK YOU.

00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:17.790
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T TELL SETO.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.560
OUR LIPS ARE
SEALED, DUDE.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.000
Serenity:
PLEASE HANG IN THERE JOEY.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.073
Yugi: IT'S MY FAULT
THIS HAPPENED TO JOEY!

00:12:35.073 --> 00:12:38.911
I SHOULD HAVE FACED MARIK!

00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:42.181
NO YUGI.

00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:44.416
I KNEW THAT DUEL
WAS TOO DANGEROUS

00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:45.584
AND I SHOULD HAVE
STOPPED IT!

00:12:45.584 --> 00:12:48.120
NOW IT'S TOO LATE!

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.555
MARIK IS PURE EVIL!

00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:52.090
FIRST HE GOT MAI THEN BAKURA

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.593
NOW THIS! IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:12:54.593 --> 00:12:56.562
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP FIGHTING.

00:12:56.562 --> 00:12:58.831
IT JUST SEEMS
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

00:12:58.831 --> 00:13:00.299
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE.

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:04.203
WAIT YUGI.
WE'VE COME TOO FAR.

00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:07.239
Joey: TOGETHER WE WON'T
LET ANY DUELIST BEAT US!

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:09.041
IT'S TRUE.

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:12.411
WE'LL HIT DIS MARIK CREEP
AND HIS RARE HUNTER
GOON SQUAD SO HARD,

00:13:12.411 --> 00:13:13.846
DEY WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM!

00:13:13.846 --> 00:13:16.648
THEY'LL BE SORRY
DAY EVA DECIDED
TA MESS WIT US!

00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:19.451
IT'S A DEAL.

00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:23.455
THE TWO OF US SHALL SAVE
THE WORLD TOGETHER!

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:25.591
Joey: YOU CAN COUNT
ON ME, YUGE.

00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:27.960
I'LL NEVA GIVE UP
DIS FIGHT AGAINST MARIK!

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.763
NO MATTA WHAT, PAL!

00:13:31.763 --> 00:13:34.566
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
FOR YOU YUGI.

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:37.269
MARIK IS THE TOUGHEST
FOE WE'VE EVER FACED.

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:41.139
BUT IF WE WALK AWAY NOW,
THEN HE WINS!

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:44.576
TRUE. JOEY NEVER GAVE UP
AND NEITHER CAN WE.

00:13:44.576 --> 00:13:46.078
WE HAVE TO FINISH
WHAT WE STARTED.

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:51.516
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:54.086
MARIK'S MADNESS HASTA STOP NOW!

00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:56.622
HE'S CAUSED WAY TOO
MUCH DAMAGE ALREADY!

00:13:56.622 --> 00:14:00.192
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LOSE ANOTHER FRIEND!

00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:02.694
I WON'T GIVE UP
IF YOU DON'T JOEY!

00:14:02.694 --> 00:14:09.968
KEEP FIGHTING
THE SHADOWS!!

00:14:09.968 --> 00:14:18.410
Joey: NOW FLAME SWORDSMAN!
ATTACK HIS HOLOGRAH!

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.979
Joey:
HASTA LA PASTA, PAL!

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:22.180
OH YEAH!

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.649
WHO'S DA "DUELINATOR"!?

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:26.418
YEAH!

00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:30.088
Tristan: WAY TA GO, DUDE!

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:32.925
Joey: I'M WINNIN' DUELS
LEFT AND RIGHT IN DIS DREAM!

00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:36.194
AND I'M NOT GONNA STOP
'TIL I GET TO DA TOP!

00:14:36.194 --> 00:14:42.234
MARIK'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION
IS SO UNPREDICTABLE.

00:14:42.234 --> 00:14:47.572
WHAT'S NEXT? IT'S SO UNCLEAR.

00:14:47.572 --> 00:14:53.011
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
JUST CHECK YOUR POCKET.

00:14:53.011 --> 00:14:56.481
JOEY, WAS THAT YOU?

00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:58.050
GUESS NOT.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:04.389
IT MUST
HAVE JUST BEEN
WISHFUL THINKING.

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:07.192
WHAT'S THIS?

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:09.194
YUGI!

00:15:09.194 --> 00:15:10.696
THE MILLENNIUM NECKLACE!

00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:11.697
OH YEAH!

00:15:11.697 --> 00:15:12.764
IT'S OURS NOW!

00:15:12.764 --> 00:15:16.468
ISHIZU SAID SHE DIDN'T
NEED IT ANYMORE!

00:15:16.468 --> 00:15:20.472
FATE HAS NOW CHOSEN YOU
TO POSSESS THIS.

00:15:20.472 --> 00:15:21.873
THIS NECKLACE
HAS THE POWER

00:15:21.873 --> 00:15:24.176
TO SHOW ME EVENTS
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN!

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:26.778
BUT LAST TIME ISHIZU
USED IT TO PREDICT
THE FUTURE,

00:15:26.778 --> 00:15:28.280
IT WAS WRONG!

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.283
SO CAN I TRUST
WHAT IT SHOWS ME!?

00:15:35.983 --> 00:15:37.819
IF I CONCENTRATE,

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:43.725
THE MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
SHOULD SHOW ME THE FUTURE!

00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:46.627
IT'S ME AND JOEY!

00:15:46.627 --> 00:15:50.498
HEY YUGE NOW THAT
DAT'S ALL OVER WITH
LET'S DUEL, PAL!

00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:55.837
YOU'RE ON!

00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:58.573
COULD THAT HAVE BEEN
A VISION OF THE FUTURE?

00:15:58.573 --> 00:16:00.208
MAYBE THE MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
IS TELLING ME

00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:02.076
JOEY'S GONNA BE OK!

00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:04.145
BUT WHO KNOWS IF IT'S RIGHT!?

00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:06.280
Roland: ATTENTION DUELISTS!

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.649
PLEASE REPORT
TO THE TOP FLOOR OF THE TOWER

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:11.586
FOR THE NEXT DUEL
OF THE SEMIFINALS.

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:14.889
YUGI MUTO WILL FACE OFF
AGAINST MR. KAIBA.

00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:18.126
THE WINNER WILL CONTINUE ON
TO THE FINAL ROUND.

00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:21.062
Yugi: I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
WHAT THE NECKLACE PREDICTED.

00:16:21.062 --> 00:16:23.064
SOON ALL OF THIS INSANITY
WILL BE OVER

00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:25.133
AND JOEY WILL BE ALRIGHT!

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:27.068
I JUST HAVE TO GET PAST KAIBA,

00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:31.539
SO I CAN DEFEAT MARIK
AND END THIS!

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:34.876
Mokuba: CAN YOU READ ME!?

00:16:34.876 --> 00:16:37.812
COME IN PLEASE!
I NEED A HELICOPTER RIGHT AWAY!

00:16:37.812 --> 00:16:41.315
COME IN!
IS ANYONE OUT THERE!?

00:16:41.315 --> 00:16:45.386
WE SEEM TO BE EXPERIENCING
TEMPORARY TRANSMISSION
INTERFERENCE

00:16:45.386 --> 00:16:47.588
DUE TO OUR DISTANCE
FROM THE MAINLAND SIR.

00:16:47.588 --> 00:16:48.990
AW MAN!

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.291
COME IN ANYONE!

00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:54.395
SEND A RESCUE 'COPTER
IMMEDIATELY!

00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:56.464
I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:16:56.464 --> 00:16:57.965
Yami-Yugi: HOW IS HE?

00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:00.001
Tristan:
HE'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, YUGI.

00:17:00.001 --> 00:17:07.008
BUT KNOWING JOEY, HE'S DOING
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WAKE UP!

00:17:07.008 --> 00:17:09.444
Yami-Yugi:
THEN HE'LL NEED THIS.

00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:12.113
HIS DUEL DISK?

00:17:12.113 --> 00:17:14.081
HE'D WANT IT CLOSE BY.

00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:15.283
GOOD POINT.

00:17:15.283 --> 00:17:16.417
Serenity: FOR WHAT?

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:18.453
HIS TOUGHEST FIGHT YET.

00:17:18.453 --> 00:17:21.389
LOOK AFTER HIM.

00:17:21.389 --> 00:17:24.892
I SHALL RETURN
FROM THIS DUEL AS SOON AS I CAN.

00:17:24.892 --> 00:17:26.828
YUGI!

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:28.963
YUGI, WAIT UP!

00:17:28.963 --> 00:17:30.665
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA GO AHEAD

00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:32.533
WITH THIS DUEL
UP THERE?

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:34.869
DID YOU FORGET
HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE GOTTEN HURT

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:36.471
IN THE TOURNAMENT
SO FAR!?

00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:39.106
PLEASE YUGI!
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:40.208
I CAN'T STAND
THE THOUGHT

00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:42.043
OF LOSING YOU, TOO!

00:17:42.043 --> 00:17:45.046
JUST END IT!
IT'S NOT WORTH
ALL THIS SUFFERING!

00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:48.883
THIS TOURNAMENT'S
BEEN NOTHING
BUT BAD NEWS.

00:17:48.883 --> 00:17:50.885
I KNOW.

00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:52.553
BUT IF I WALK AWAY NOW,

00:17:52.553 --> 00:17:56.457
THAT MEANS EVERYONE
SUFFERED FOR NOTHING.

00:17:56.457 --> 00:17:58.493
AND I'VE GOT TO
HAVE FAITH IN THE VISIONS

00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:00.862
OF THE MILLENNIUM NECKLACE.

00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.564
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
BACK TO NORMAL SOON!

00:18:03.564 --> 00:18:06.767
I JUST HAVE TO WIN
THIS TOURNAMENT FIRST!

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:10.104
AND I'LL START
BY DEFEATING KAIBA.

00:18:10.104 --> 00:18:12.607
TEA, REMEMBER WHAT WE LEARNED

00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:14.509
ON OUR TRIP
TO THE DOMINO MUSEUM?

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:17.111
ABOUT MY DESTINY?

00:18:17.111 --> 00:18:20.248
YES!

00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:24.151
WE FOUND OUT THAT
YOU WERE A PHARAOH
IN ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:26.053
AND THAT NOW YOU NEED
TO SAVE THE WORLD AGAIN

00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:28.122
FROM SOME EVIL THINGY,
LIKE YOU DID

00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:32.260
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO!

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.528
NOW THEN,

00:18:33.528 --> 00:18:34.929
IF WHAT ISHIZU TOLD US

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:37.365
ABOUT THESE STONE CARVINGS
IS REALLY TRUE...

00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:38.666
YEAH?

00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:41.269
THEN I NEED TO WIN
A DUEL MONSTERS TOURNAMENT

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:44.772
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD
FROM DESTRUCTION.

00:18:44.772 --> 00:18:47.275
IT'S MY DESTINY.

00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:48.876
TEA!

00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:50.344
DO YOU NOW UNDERSTAND

00:18:50.344 --> 00:18:52.547
WHY BACKING OUT
OF THE TOURNAMENT
IS NOT AN OPTION?

00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:53.548
YEAH BUT...

00:18:53.548 --> 00:18:54.815
NO "BUT'S" TEA!

00:18:54.815 --> 00:18:56.951
THE REASON I JOINED
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT

00:18:56.951 --> 00:18:58.786
WAS TO FULFILL
ISHIZU'S PROPHESY

00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:03.057
AND STOP THIS GREAT EVIL
FROM ENDANGERING MANKIND.

00:19:03.057 --> 00:19:04.859
AND WHEN JOEY FOUND OUT,

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:08.763
HE VOWED TO HELP ME
NO MATTER HOW TOUGH THE FIGHT.

00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:11.065
AND THAT'S WHY I MUST PRESS ON.

00:19:11.065 --> 00:19:14.001
OTHERWISE
NOT ONLY WOULD I BE
GIVING UP ON JOEY

00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:16.137
I'D BE GIVING UP
ON THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:19:16.137 --> 00:19:19.073
SO YOU STAY HERE
AND I'LL DEAL WITH KAIBA!

00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:20.908
YEAH! CRUSH HIM!

00:19:20.908 --> 00:19:23.544
I WILL.
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE TO LOSE.

00:19:23.544 --> 00:19:24.912
WE'RE RIGHT HERE!

00:19:24.912 --> 00:19:27.648
GOOD.

00:19:27.648 --> 00:19:30.885
Tea:
I KNOW YOU CAN WIN THIS YUGI!

00:19:30.885 --> 00:19:32.053
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT

00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:36.657
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T!

00:19:36.657 --> 00:19:38.893
Roland: THE SECOND DUEL
OF THE SEMIFINALS

00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:41.896
WILL BEGIN IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:19:47.234 --> 00:19:50.104
WELL I GUESS THIS IS IT!

00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:52.273
DUELING KAIBA
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY!

00:19:52.273 --> 00:19:56.010
I'VE NEVER HAD TO FACE HIS
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR BEFORE.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.679
AND I REALLY WISH
JOEY WAS ABLE TO WATCH.

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:02.950
BUT HE'LL DEFINITELY BE THERE
WITH ME IN SPIRIT!

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.518
ALRIGHT, KAIBA.

00:20:04.518 --> 00:20:06.821
YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE
THE WORLD'S GREATEST DUELIST,

00:20:06.821 --> 00:20:10.391
BUT THE FATE OF THE WORLD
IS RIDING ON MY VICTORY!
