YOU OVERPOWERED KAIBA USING
DECEIT AND BETRAYAL!

TO TURN HIM

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.733
MY MOVE!

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.069
[THINKING]
IT'S ONE OF
KAIBA'S MONSTERS!

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.371
AND NOW THAT NOAH
MERGED WITH HIS DECK
MASTER

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.872
AND MOVED ONTO
THE FIELD,

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.741
HE'S WIDE OPEN
FOR AN ATTACK!

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.143
IF I CAN DESTROY HIM
WITH KAIBA'S MONSTER,

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.612
I'LL WIN THIS DUEL
AND GET US OUT
OF THIS PLACE!

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:03.917
I SHALL PLACE THIS
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.618
MAKE YOUR MOVE, NOAH.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.854
NOTHING WOULD
THRILL ME MORE!

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.889
NOW I SUMMON MY ASURA,

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.925
WHO'S YET ANOTHER
SPIRIT MONSTER!

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:20.333
NOW, SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR
OBNOXIOUS GUARDIAN, YUGI!

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.636
ASURA, ATTACK WITH
DAGGERS OF DEMISE!

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:26.306
[ROARING]

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:29.542
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT
YOUR OBNOXIOUS CELTIC GUARDIAN

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.344
IS IMMUNE TO DAMAGE
FROM MONSTERS

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.847
WITH 1,900 ATTACK
POINTS OR MORE...

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.448
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:38.785
MY ASURA ONLY HAS
1,700 ATTACK POINTS!

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:40.186
SO, SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.588
[GRUNTS]

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:46.159
AND NOW WITNESS THE POWER OF
MY ASURA'S SPECIAL ABILITY--

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.727
MULTIPLE ATTACK!

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:48.895
WHAT?!

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.930
IT LOOKS LIKE
NOAH'S ASURA CARD

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.098
IS GONNA ATTACK AGAIN!

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.933
Noah: THE POWER
OF MULTIPLE ATTACK

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.568
GIVES ASURA
THE ABILITY TO ATTACK

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:59.105
EVERY MONSTER ON YOUR SIDE OF
THE FIELD ON THE SAME TURN!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.508
SO, I'M AFRAID YOUR
FACE DOWN MONSTER

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:04.444
IS ABOUT TO GO--
LEAVING YOU DEFENSELESS!

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:07.747
NOW, ASURA, WIPE OUT
YUGI'S LAST MONSTER

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:11.117
WITH YOUR DAGGERS
OF DEMISE!

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.119
TOO BAD, YUGI!

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.254
IT'S OVER!

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.823
YES, IT IS, NOAH!

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:17.857
HUH?

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.225
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE FALLEN

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.693
RIGHT INTO MY TRAP,

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:24.130
BY ATTACKING ONE OF
KAIBA'S FAVORITE CARDS.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.398
CYBER JAR!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.399
Noah: NO!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.034
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.636
AND THAT MEANS
ALL MONSTERS

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.438
ON THE FIELD
ARE DESTROYED!

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:34.474
AND SINCE YOU MOVED YOUR
DECK MASTER TO THE FIELD...

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:40.046
YOUR SHINATO IS DESTROYED AS
WELL AND YOU LOSE THE DUEL!

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.948
[GROWLS]

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.118
NO!

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.886
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.054
OH, YEAH!

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:50.390
I KNEW YUGI WOULD CRUSH
THAT LITTLE NUT CASE!

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.092
WAY TO GO, YUGI!

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.393
BANANA SPLITS
ALL AROUND!

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:54.861
Noah: NO!

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.429
I WON'T GO!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.933
[STRAINING]

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.769
I ACTIVATE MY DECK MASTER'S
SECOND ABILITY--

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:03.770
REVERSAL!

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:09.309
Duke: HOLD ON!

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:10.610
WHAT HAPPENED
TO NOAH?

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.644
Tea: HE'S GONE!

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.413
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.348
I THOUGHT YUGI
JUST WON THE DUEL.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.349
Joey: HE DID!

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:21.621
[GROANING]

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.456
I GUESS YUGI DIDN'T
WIN THE DUEL!

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.525
[GRUNTING]

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.393
BUT HOW WERE YOU
ABLE TO ESCAPE

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:29.662
THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER
OF CYBER JAR?

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.764
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE, YUGI.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.833
SHINATO HAS MORE
THAN ONE POWER!

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.970
AND BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED,
THAT POWER WAS ACTIVATED!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.938
SEE, WHENEVER
SHINATO IS TARGETED

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.440
BY AN OPPONENT'S MONSTER,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.575
ITS ABILITY OF REVERSAL
IS ACTIVATED,

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.078
ALLOWING MY DECK MASTER
TO LEAVE THE PLAYING FIELD

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:48.414
AND RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL
POSITION ON THE SIDELINES.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:52.018
IN EXCHANGE, SHINATO CANNOT
BE SUMMONED BACK TO THE FIELD

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.520
FOR THE DURATION OF THE DUEL.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.989
THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T
USE IT TO ATTACK ME

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.957
FOR THE REST
OF THE DUEL!

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.627
NOW, THANKS TO
THE SECOND EFFECT
OF MY CYBER JAR,

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.762
WE MUST EACH DRAW
5 CARDS.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.197
THEN EVERY
MONSTER WE PICK

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:05.932
MUST BE SUMMONED
TO THE FIELD!

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.967
I SUMMON TWO MONSTERS,

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.403
SANGAN AND GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR,

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.205
BOTH IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.207
AND NOW YOU MUST
SUMMON EVERY MONSTER

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:15.475
THAT YOU'VE DRAWN, NOAH!

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:17.744
I DON'T HAVE ONE!

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:19.045
GOOD!

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.748
THEN IT'S MY MOVE,
SO I'LL SACRIFICE

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:25.785
GAMMA THE MAGNET
WARRIOR AND SANGAN!

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.821
THIS ACTIVATES SANGAN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:30.523
ALLOWING ME TO
ADD ANY MONSTER

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.192
WITH 1,500 ATTACK POINTS

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.861
OR FEWER INTO MY HAND.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.864
SO, I'LL TAKE BIG
SHIELD GARDNA!

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.967
AND THEN THANKS
TO MY SACRIFICE...

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:42.035
I'LL SUMMON THIS:

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.972
DARK MAGICIAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:48.007
OH, NO, NOT HIM!

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:51.044
YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS ON
THE FIELD TO DEFEND YOU!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.713
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:57.217
DARK MAGICIAN, ATTACK
HIS LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.152
[GRUNTING]

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.288
ALL RIGHT!

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.724
HE KNOCKED OFF
2,500 LIFE POINTS,

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.859
WHICH LEAVES
5,600 LEFT!

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.861
[GROANING]

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.697
Joey: THERE'S STILL
A LONG WAY TO GO!

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:16.970
NOAH, I'VE CLEARED
OUT YOUR MONSTERS

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.272
AND TAKEN A BITE OUT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:23.342
YUGI, HOW DARE YOU
HUMILIATE ME LIKE THAT!

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.945
HUMILIATE YOU?!

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:28.581
IT'S YOU WHO HUMILIATED
KAIBA AND MOKUBA

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.316
JUST SO YOU COULD
PROVE TO YOUR FATHER

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.350
THAT YOU'RE SUPERIOR!

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.618
[GROWLS]

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:33.619
I AM!

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.921
NO ONE'S BETTER!

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.123
YUGI, I DESERVE
TO BE REWARDED

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.692
FOR MY UNSURPASSABLE POWER!

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:43.162
YOU MUST EARN RESPECT,
NOAH, NOT DEMAND IT!

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:45.598
IT'S TRUE, PERHAPS
YOUR FATHER

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.266
SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED
YOUR TALENTS!

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.570
AND MAYBE YOU HAVE
BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY!

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.573
NO ONE DESERVES TO BE
LOCKED AWAY IN ISOLATION

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:57.043
THE WAY YOU WERE
BY YOUR FATHER!

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:59.445
HOWEVER, THAT'S
STILL NO EXCUSE

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.714
FOR THE WAY YOU'VE
BEEN TREATING US, NOAH!

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.250
THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU, YUGI!

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.519
WATCH THIS!

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.555
I ACTIVATE MY NEXT
WORLD MAGIC CARD!

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.725
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT
THIS MAGIC CARPET, YUGI.

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.361
YOU MAY RECOGNIZE SOMEONE!

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.496
Yugi: MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.565
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.334
IT CHOOSES ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.768
AND ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON ONE

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.437
WITH THE SAME
NUMBER OF STARS.

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:26.539
SO, I CHOOSE THIS!

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.741

GET A LOAD OF
THAT THING, GUYS!

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:42.922
IT'S EVEN STRONGER THAN
YUGI'S DARK MAGICIAN!

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.224
THAT DRAGON WILL DEVOUR IT!

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:50.229
DRAGON, ATTACK HIM NOW...

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.431
WITH 8-HEADED
FLAME ATTACK!

AND 100 OF YOUR LIFE

NOW, SPIRIT MONSTER,
COME BACK!

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.551
YOU REMEMBER WHAT
THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU?

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.787
MY SPRING OF
REBIRTH MAGIC CARD

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.389

IF NOAH KEEPS THIS UP,

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:27.633
I'LL NEVER GET
THEM DOWN TO ZERO!

YOU ONLY HAVE 100
LIFE POINTS LEFT NOW!

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:34.473
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME...

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:36.108
BEFORE YOU LOSE!

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:37.343
COME ON!

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.211
DON'T LET THIS KID
PUSH YOU AROUND,
YUGI!

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.513
WE NEED YOU!

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.381
TEA'S RIGHT.
COME ON!

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.016
WE'RE ALL

GO GET HIM, YUGI!

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:48.788
HUH?

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:52.725
THE SAFETY OF ALL MY FRIENDS
DEPENDS ON MY VICTORY.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.593
SO, LET'S GET ON
WITH THIS DUEL!

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:56.862
IT'S MY MOVE NOW!

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:59.165
NOW I SHALL ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD...

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:01.634
SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT!

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:03.436
Noah: BIG DEAL!

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:05.571
THIS WALL OF SWORDS
WILL PREVENT YOU

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.174
FROM ATTACKING ME
FOR 3 TURNS!

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:10.776
[THINKING]
HE'S JUST DELAYING HIS DEFEAT!

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.345
Duke:
NICE MOVE, YUGI!

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.946
Monkey: YEAH,
NOW YOU'VE GOT NOAH

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.147
RIGHT WHERE
YOU WANT HIM!

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.983
Serenity: AND HE'S
GOT NOTHING ON YOU!

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:18.017
Joey: THAT'S RIGHT!

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.018
AND NOW YOU
JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.319
3 TURNS TO
FIGURE OUT

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:22.088
HOW TO KICK THIS
TWERP'S VIRTUAL BUTT

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.189
AND GET US
OUT OF HERE!

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.358
[THINKING]
I'VE HEARD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:28.094
FROM YUGI'S LITTLE
PEP SQUAD DOWN THERE!

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.228
PAY ATTENTION!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:33.833
NOW I SUMMON KURIBOH!

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.434
I'M SHAKING!

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:38.204
KURIBOH, ATTACK NOAH'S
LIFE POINTS RIGHT NOW!

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:40.840
HMM.

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.043
YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE PUFFBALL

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:45.077
BARELY MADE A DENT!

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.146
[WHINES]

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.749
YOUR DUELING TACTICS
ARE BENEATH ME!

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.351
YOU CAN SWAT AT ME WITH
THAT DUST BUNNY ALL DAY,

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.820
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S
NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.724
AND AS SOON AS YOUR SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT ARE GONE...

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.693
I'LL ERASE YOU, YUGI!

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:04.663
AND SINCE YOU SEEM TO BE A MUCH
BETTER DUELIST THAN SETO,

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:08.034
BY DEFEATING YOU, I'LL BE
PROVING MY POWER OVER HIM!

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:09.201
NOW ON WITH THE DUEL!

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:13.672
I'LL PLACE ONE MONSTER
FACE DOWN IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.708
ALL RIGHT, YUGI,
IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.843
NOW THERE'S ONLY
TWO TURNS LEFT...

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.645
AND THEN I'M ALLOWED
TO ATTACK YOU!

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.181
I STILL HAVE TIME!

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.350
[THINKING]
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.451
EVEN IF SHE
COULD HELP ME,

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.219
I'D NEED KAIBA'S DECK
MASTER TO SUMMON HER

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.687
WITHOUT A SACRIFICE!

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.022
BUT HIS KAISER SEAHORSE

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.924
CAN ONLY SUMMON
MONSTERS OF LIGHT!

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.727
AND DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
IS A MONSTER OF DARKNESS!

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:37.663
OH, WELL, I'LL HAVE
TO DO THIS INSTEAD!

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:42.168
I SUMMON BIG SHIELD GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.304
AND THEN I'LL SWITCH KURIBOH
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.540
NOW GO AHEAD AND MAKE
YOUR MOVE NOAH.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.276
I WILL!

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:54.246
FIRST I PLACE THIS MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.915
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:58.684
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.387
NOW IT'S JUST ONE MORE TURN

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:02.455
AND THEN IT'S LIGHTS OUT.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.457
AND I'LL BE READY.

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.225
[THINKING]
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.960
NONE OF THESE CARDS
CAN HELP ME.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.465
I'LL PLACE THIS CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:16.569
WELL, YUGI, I THINK IT'S CLEAR
HOW THIS WILL END.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.905
ON MY NEXT TURN, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOSE THIS DUEL.

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:23.976
THEN YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
WILL BE TURNED TO STONE.

00:17:27.221 --> 00:17:30.023
YOU CAN BEAT THIS GUY
ONE, TWO, THREE, YUGI.

00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:32.726
YOUR FRIENDS STILL
THINK YOU CAN WIN.

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.528
I GUESS THEY'RE MORE
CLUELESS THAN I THOUGHT.

00:17:34.528 --> 00:17:36.563
COME DOWN HERE AND SAY THAT!

00:17:36.563 --> 00:17:39.266
I BET YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE YUGI OVER HERE

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:40.868
ACTUALLY HAS FRIENDS,

00:17:40.868 --> 00:17:42.102
AND YOU'RE JUST A SPOILED
LITTLE BRAT

00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:43.403
WHO IS ANGRY AT THE WORLD

00:17:43.403 --> 00:17:44.905
'CAUSE SOMEONE STUCK YOU
IN A COMPUTER

00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:47.174
WITH NO ONE TO HANG OUT WITH
EXCEPT YOUR SORRY SELF.

00:17:47.174 --> 00:17:48.809
JOEY.

00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:51.678
WELL, I THINK YOUR FRIEND
MADE HIS POINT.

00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:55.883
SO NOW IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT I GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE MY POINT.

00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:58.285
I'VE LISTENED TO YOUR
LOUDMOUTH FRIENDS

00:17:58.285 --> 00:18:00.654
INSULT ME FOR
TOO LONG NOW!

00:18:00.654 --> 00:18:03.090
SO TAKE THIS!

00:18:05.192 --> 00:18:06.193
NO!

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.932
OH, NO! THAT KID MADE
A STONE OUT OF YOU, TOO!

00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:14.067
[LAUGHING]

00:18:14.067 --> 00:18:15.435
MUCH BETTER!

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:16.870
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN,

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.172
I THINK I'LL TRANSFORM
YOU ALL INTO STONE,

00:18:19.172 --> 00:18:21.575
ONE BY ONE, WITH EACH
TURN I TAKE.

00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:22.843
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:18:22.843 --> 00:18:25.412
I SAY I'LL REARRANGE YOUR
FACE, YOU LITTLE BRAT.

00:18:25.412 --> 00:18:28.081
SILENCE, OR YOU'LL BE
NEXT TO GO!

00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.851
SINCE YOU'RE ALL SO CONFIDENT
THAT YUGI'S GOING TO WIN,

00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:33.820
I'VE DECIDED TO PUT
YOUR FAITH IN HIS HANDS.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.690
SO WITH EVERY TURN THAT
YUGI FAILS TO DEFEAT ME,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.926
ANOTHER OF YOU WILL
BE TURNED TO STONE.

00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:40.827
YOU'LL BE FROZEN IN TIME

00:18:40.827 --> 00:18:43.430
WITH A LOOK OF DESPAIR
ON YOUR FACE

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.133
BECAUSE YUGI
FAILED TO SAVE YOU.

00:18:46.133 --> 00:18:47.968
AND IN THE END, YUGI,

00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:51.371
YOU'LL BE LEFT IN
THE MIDDLE OF A CIRCLE OF
MOTIONLESS STATUES

00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:53.674
THAT WERE ONCE
YOUR FRIENDS.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:55.676
[CHUCKLING]
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:58.045
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A CHILD.

00:18:58.045 --> 00:18:59.780
SIX YEARS MAY HAVE PASSED,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.783
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU HAVEN'T
MATURED AT ALL.

00:19:02.783 --> 00:19:04.217
YOU'RE A WEAK BOY.

00:19:04.217 --> 00:19:06.286
I AM STRONG.

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:08.622
WELL, NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:09.623
JUST LOOK.

00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:10.791
COME ON!

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.759
YOU CAN STILL BEAT
THIS LAME-O.

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:15.963
THAT'S RIGHT. SO DON'T YOU
EVEN THINK ABOUT GIVING UP
THIS FIGHT, YUGI.

00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:18.699
THIS CAN'T BE!
THEY STILL HAVE FAITH!

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:21.601
NOAH, YOU WOULDN'T
BE SO SURPRISED

00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:24.705
IF YOU HAD BEEN GIVEN
THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE
TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.406
YOU'RE JUST BITTER.

00:19:26.406 --> 00:19:29.242
THE ONLY THING I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

00:19:29.242 --> 00:19:30.811
IS HOW TO DESTROY IT.

00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:32.045
MY MOVE.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:36.049
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN TRAP CARD.

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:38.552
PYRO CLOCK OF DESTINY.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.954
OH, NO!
MY SOURCE OF LIGHT!

00:19:40.954 --> 00:19:43.457
THEY'RE GONE,
BUT THAT'S TOO SOON!

00:19:43.457 --> 00:19:46.927
TRUE, BUT MY PYRO CLOCK
OF DESTINY TRAP CARD

00:19:46.927 --> 00:19:48.962
CAUSES TIME TO MOVE FASTER.

00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:52.265
SO THEY EXPIRE
ONE TURN SOONER.

00:19:52.265 --> 00:19:56.837
NOW I SUMMON THE DREADED
OTOHIME TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:19:56.837 --> 00:19:59.973
AND THANKS TO MY NEW MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:19:59.973 --> 00:20:01.975
I CAN SWITCH ANY OF
YOUR MONSTERS

00:20:01.975 --> 00:20:05.812
FROM DEFENSE TO ATTACK MODE
OR VICE VERSA, YUGI.

00:20:05.812 --> 00:20:08.515
AND I CHOOSE YOUR KURIBOH.

00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:12.686
SO YOUR PUFFBALL SWITCHES
TO ATTACK MODE.

00:20:12.686 --> 00:20:14.054
OH, NO!

00:20:14.054 --> 00:20:15.922
IF HE'S ATTACKED,
I'LL LOSE THE DUEL.

00:20:15.922 --> 00:20:19.793
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE OTOHIME
AND MY FACEDOWN CARD.

00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:24.564
AND BRING BACK
AN OLD FRIEND.

00:20:24.564 --> 00:20:27.034
IT'S HIS YAMATA DRAGON.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.706
THE TIME IS FINALLY HERE.

00:20:32.706 --> 00:20:34.641
THIS DUEL HAS
COME TO AN END.

00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:36.476
MY DRAGON WILL WIPE OUT
YOUR KURIBOH

00:20:36.476 --> 00:20:37.644
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:40.781
YAMATA DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:47.187
Noah: VICTORY IS MINE!
