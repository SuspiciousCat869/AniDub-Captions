I HAD
THE WEIRDEST DREAM!

I WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL,

DETERMINATION FOR POWER

AFTER ALL.

PAINED HIM TO ADMIT IT,

00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:52.957
YOU MAY BE WONDERING
WHY I USED MY DEEPEST IMPACT
MAGIC CARD

00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:54.826
TO WIPE OUT
ALL MONSTERS ON THE FIELD

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:57.028
AND CUT BOTH OF
OUR LIFE POINTS IN HALF.

00:14:57.028 --> 00:15:00.865
WELL, IT'S ALL PART
OF EVOLUTION, SETO!

00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:02.734
IT WEEDS OUT
THE WEAK AND HELPLESS

00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:05.203
AND ALLOWS ONLY THE STRONG
TO THRIVE!

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.304
Kaiba:
THEN I'M SAFE!

00:15:06.304 --> 00:15:07.539
GUESS AGAIN!

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.707
MY MAGIC CARD
ICE AGE PANIC

00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:11.943
IS ABOUT TO LEAD
TO YOUR EXTINCTION

00:15:11.943 --> 00:15:16.281
BY ALLOWING ME TO SUMMON
THE MOST POWERFUL BEAST
OF THE ICE AGE, SETO!

00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:22.287
MEET LAST TUSK MAMMOTH!

00:15:22.287 --> 00:15:24.322
AW, MAN! DAT'S NUTS!

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.392
NOW! TIME
TO BRING BACK THIS!

00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:29.360
DIFFERENT DIMENSION
DRAGON!

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.865
RETURN TO ME NOW!
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:35.433
MY BEAST
HAS THE POWER

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.402
TO TRAVEL
BETWEEN DIMENSIONS,

00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:39.837
AND NOW HE'S BACK
IN OURS!

00:15:39.837 --> 00:15:41.573
AND,
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:43.741
MY DRAGON IS STRONGER
THAN YOUR MAMMOTH.

00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:45.877
NOW BRACE YOURSELF!

00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:47.745
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO REWRITE HISTORY

00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:49.781
BY CUTTING SHORT
THE ICE AGE!

00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:52.050
SO PREPARE
TO LOSE YOUR MAMMOTH!

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.352
HIS TIME IS UP!

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:55.587
YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYONE

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:57.956
THAT THE PAST
CAN'T BE CHANGED!

00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:01.593
MY TUSK MAMMOTH
WILL DESTROY YOUR DRAGON!

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:02.994
Tristan: IS IT ME,

00:16:02.994 --> 00:16:04.028
OR IS NOAH GOING TO
ATTACK A MONSTER

00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:05.663
THAT'S STRONGER THAN HIS?!

00:16:05.663 --> 00:16:08.066
YOU'RE IN FOR
QUITE A SURPRISE NOW.

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.867
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME!

00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:11.369
I'M IN CONTROL HERE!

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:14.906
MOKUBA UNDERSTANDS THAT NOW,
WHY CAN'T YOU!?

00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:17.842
THIS IS MY WORLD...
AND YOU'RE MY PRISONER...

00:16:17.842 --> 00:16:19.244
FOREVER!

00:16:21.882 --> 00:16:25.204
GO AHEAD AND ATTACK ME!
MY MONSTER'S STRONGER!

00:16:25.204 --> 00:16:26.672
HEY, WAIT!

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:28.874
THANKS TO
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF NOAH'S TUSK MAMMOTH,

00:16:28.874 --> 00:16:32.311
BOTH PLAYERS WILL
LOSE LIFE POINTS
WHEN IT'S DESTROYED!

00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:34.680
SO WHEN KAIBA
CLOBBERS DAT THING...

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.216
IT'S LIKE HE'S
ATTACKING HIMSELF, TOO!

00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:39.218
WE'VE GOT
TO STOP HIM!

00:16:39.218 --> 00:16:41.220
Noah: MAMMOTH ATTACK!

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.588
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:45.925
RING OF DESTRUCTION!

00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:50.029
THIS WILL STOP
YOUR MONSTER
IN ITS TRACKS!

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:51.130
HMM.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.666
I SEE THAT YOU'RE GETTING
DESPERATE, SETO.

00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:55.334
IT'S TRUE
YOUR RING OF DESTRUCTION

00:16:55.334 --> 00:16:57.503
WILL DESTROY
MY TUSK MAMMOTH,

00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:00.172
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL
LOSE LIFE POINTS, TOO!

00:17:00.172 --> 00:17:03.676
NOT WHEN I ACTIVATE
MY MAGIC CARD
RING OF DEFENSE!

00:17:03.676 --> 00:17:10.616
IT WILL SHIELD
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:17:10.616 --> 00:17:11.617
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:13.052
NICE MOVE, KAIBA!

00:17:13.052 --> 00:17:15.688
WAY TA PUT
DAT LITTLE RUNT
IN HIS PLACE!

00:17:15.688 --> 00:17:17.990
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR ICE AGE IS OVER.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.860
I GUESS YOU DON'T
CONTROL EVERYTHING HERE!

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.294
HEY, YUGE,

00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:24.196
THEY'RE BOTH DOWN
TO THEIR LAST CHUNK
'A LIFE POINTS!

00:17:24.196 --> 00:17:25.564
YEAH...LET'S JUST HOPE

00:17:25.564 --> 00:17:27.867
KAIBA CAN WIPE OUT
NOAH'S FIRST!

00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:29.268
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:32.438
NOW! IT'S TIME
TO FINISH YOU OFF!

00:17:32.438 --> 00:17:34.874
HA! I'M SHAKING
IN MY BOOTS.

00:17:34.874 --> 00:17:36.142
YOU SHOULD BE!

00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:37.643
FIRST I'LL
SWITCH MY DRAGON

00:17:37.643 --> 00:17:40.513
FROM DEFENSE
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:43.849
NEXT I'LL SEND
MY THUNDER DRAGON
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:47.153
WHERE HE'LL BE ABSORBED
BY SHINATO'S ARK!

00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:49.755
BUT NOT BEFORE
HIS SPECIAL SKILL
KICKS IN...

00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:52.058
GIVING ME
TWO MORE DRAGONS!

00:17:52.058 --> 00:17:54.060
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL,
NOAH!

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.961
NEXT I'LL USE
POLYMERIZATION

00:17:55.961 --> 00:17:59.098
TO FUSE THEM BOTH
TOGETHER!

00:17:59.098 --> 00:18:01.734
FORMING TWIN-HEADED
THUNDER DRAGON!

00:18:01.734 --> 00:18:04.637
[ROARS]

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:07.339
I'D HATE TA MEET DAT THING
IN A DARK ALLEY!

00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:09.842
Kaiba: AND THANKS
TO MY QUICK ATTACK
MAGIC CARD...

00:18:09.842 --> 00:18:11.510
I CAN ATTACK RIGHT NOW!

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.746
AND WITH NO MONSTERS
TO PROTECT YOU,

00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:16.449
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE AS GOOD AS GONE!

00:18:16.449 --> 00:18:17.883
YOU SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:20.119
ABOUT THE POWERS
OF MY ARK, SETO!

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:23.289
EVERY MONSTER THAT HAS BEEN
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:24.890
LIVES ON BOARD!

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.759
AND I HAVE ACCESS
TO ALL OF THEM!

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:29.328
OBSERVE!!!

00:18:29.328 --> 00:18:31.464
Tea: I THOUGHT KAIBA
HAD HIM THAT TIME!

00:18:31.464 --> 00:18:32.631
I GUESS NOT.

00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:34.300
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.168
HA HA HA!

00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:37.303
YOU FOOL!

00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:39.538
YOU FELL
RIGHT INTO MY TRAP!

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:42.208
NOW...I CAN WIPE OUT
WHAT'S LEFT OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.276
AND END
THIS FAMILY FEUD!

00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:47.446
I DIDN'T FORGET
YOUR DECK MASTER'S
ABILITY!

00:18:47.446 --> 00:18:50.616
I WANTED YOU TO
SUMMON THOSE MONSTERS!

00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:51.917
FOR ONE REASON...

00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:54.687
SO I COULD PLAY THIS!

00:18:54.687 --> 00:18:56.789
IT'S CALLED
DRAGON'S RAGE,

00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:58.157
AND HERE'S
HOW IT WORKS:

00:18:58.157 --> 00:19:00.426
IF MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:03.295
ARE HIGHER THAN
YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:06.298
THE DIFFERENCE COMES
DIRECTLY OUT OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:16.575
PREPARE YOURSELF AS
DIFFERENT DIMENSION DRAGON
ATTACKS YOUR GIANT REX!

00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:21.280
ONE MONSTER DOWN
AND ONE MORE TO GO!

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.682
YEAH! NICE!!

00:19:23.682 --> 00:19:26.452
NOW! BEAT DAT LAST MONSTA,
AND IT'S OVA!

00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:29.088
THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL ENDS!

00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:30.156
EH?

00:19:30.156 --> 00:19:32.191
NOW, TWIN-HEADED
THUNDER DRAGON...

00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:34.093
ATTACK
HIS GIANT SOLDIER!

00:19:34.093 --> 00:19:35.161
Mokuba: DON'T DO IT!

00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:36.729
Kaiba:
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:19:36.729 --> 00:19:38.164
MOKUBA!

00:19:38.164 --> 00:19:40.599
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO HIM, NOAH!?

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:41.867
MOKUBA.

00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:43.169
Mokuba:
WHOEVER YOU ARE...

00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:45.504
IF YOU WANT TO ATTACK
MY BROTHER NOAH,

00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:47.173
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ME.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:49.675
MOKUBA...
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:19:49.675 --> 00:19:52.111
HE'S BEEN BRAINWASHED!
BY NOAH!

00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:55.781
[LAUGHING]

00:19:55.781 --> 00:19:59.351
THAT'S RIGHT, MOKUBA,
PROTECT ME! FROM HIM!

00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:02.454
HE'S THE STRANGER
THAT'S TRYING TO BREAK
YOU AND I APART!

00:20:02.454 --> 00:20:03.455
STRANGER.

00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:05.591
NO, IT'S ME!

00:20:05.591 --> 00:20:09.628
MOKUBA HAS CHOSEN SIDES
BASED UPON HIS OWN
FREE WILL, SETO.

00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:10.930
LOOKING BACK,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.199
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
TREATED HIM WITH MORE RESPECT.

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:15.701
I GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT
YOU NEVER COULD.

00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:16.702
HMM.

00:20:16.702 --> 00:20:18.237
[GROWLS]

00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:21.073
Noah: IT DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE THIS WAY, SETO,

00:20:21.073 --> 00:20:23.542
BUT YOU LEFT ME
WITH NO CHOICE!

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:25.578
NOW YOU HAVE
A DECISION TO MAKE.

00:20:25.578 --> 00:20:30.015
FORFEIT THIS DUEL
AND STEP DOWN AS
PRESIDENT OF KAIBA CORP...

00:20:30.015 --> 00:20:31.817
OR CONTINUE WITH
YOUR FINAL ATTACK

00:20:31.817 --> 00:20:34.253
AND RISK LOSING MOKUBA
FOR GOOD.

00:20:34.253 --> 00:20:36.422
YOUR BROTHER'S FATE
IS IN YOUR HANDS.

00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:38.324
IF KAIBA ATTACKS NOAH NOW,

00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:40.659
HE'LL BE ATTACKING
MOKUBA, ALSO!

00:20:40.659 --> 00:20:42.728
SO...WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:20:42.728 --> 00:20:45.497
MOKUBA?
OR CONTROL OF KAIBA CORP?

00:20:45.497 --> 00:20:46.732
DECIDE.

00:20:46.732 --> 00:20:49.635
YOUR CHOICE WILL IMPACT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
