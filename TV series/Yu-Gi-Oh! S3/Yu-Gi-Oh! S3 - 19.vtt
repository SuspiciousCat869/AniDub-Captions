WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.103
Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.472
WE'RE DUELING IN MY WORLD!

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.944
AND I CONTROL
EVERYTHING AROUND US!

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:12.015
MEET MY DECK MASTER!

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.550
SHINATO'S ARK!

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.085
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:18.221
THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL ENDS.

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:20.256
NOW TWIN-HEADED
THUNDER DRAGON...

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.025
ATTACK
HIS GIANT SOLDIER!

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.693
DON'T DO IT...

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:24.761
MOKUBA!

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.329
WHAT'VE YOU
DONE TO HIM, NOAH!?

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.764
HE'S BEEN BRAINWASHED.

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:30.100
IF YOU WANT TO ATTACK
MY BROTHER NOAH

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.735
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ME.

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:36.773
MOKUBA HAS CHOSEN SIDES
BASED UPON HIS OWN
FREEWILL SETO.

00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:38.975
NOW YOU HAVE
A DECISION TO MAKE.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.879
FORFEIT THIS DUEL
AND STEP DOWN AS PRESIDENT
OF KAIBA CORP...

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.317
OR CONTINUE WITH
YOUR FINAL ATTACK AND RISK
LOSING MOKUBA FOR GOOD.

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:55.625
YOUR BROTHER'S FATE
IS IN YOUR HANDS.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.294
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE...

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:05.702
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:23.520
♪ YU-GI-OH IS KING OF GAME ♪

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:48.311
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:54.584
Seto: NOAH...

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:56.186
I'M ONLY GONNA
SAY THIS ONCE!

00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:58.421
RELEASE MOKUBA NOW!

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:02.192
THIS IS OUR FIGHT!
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.260
HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.764
THERE YOU GO
DISRESPECTING MOKUBA AGAIN...

00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:10.466
ACTING LIKE HIS OPINION
MEANS NOTHING!

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.701
TELL HIM, MOKIE!

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:14.137
GIVE KAIBA CORP
TO NOAH, NOW!

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:16.439
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.176
IT LOOKS LIKE MOKUBA
HAS MADE HIS POSITION
QUITE CLEAR!

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:21.244
NOW...

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.046
ARE YOU GOING
TO ATTACK ME OR NOT?

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:27.350
IF YOU DO,
JUST REMEMBER YOU'LL BE
STRIKING MOKUBA!

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.551
YOU PUNK!

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:30.553
HEY! DAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:32.255
WELL SETO?

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.190
ATTACK AND YOU'LL WIN
THE DUEL!

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.658
BUT AT WHAT COST?

00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:37.260
THIS IS A NO BRAINER!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.929
KAIBA HAS TO ATTACK HIM
AND WIN THIS DUEL!

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.732
IF HE LETS NOAH WIN
THEN WE ALL LOSE!

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.267
Noah: WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.736
YOU'RE VICTORY?
OR MOKUBA!?

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:49.639
ALRIGHT KID...
I'LL END MY TURN.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.344
I THOUGHT SO.

00:02:54.344 --> 00:02:55.812
SETO!

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:58.915
I KNEW YOU WERE
TOO WEAK TO GO THROUGH
WITH YOUR ATTACK!

00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:00.683
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
RUN A COMPANY

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:02.418
LIKE KAIBA CORP EFFECTIVELY

00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:05.321
IF YOU'RE SO QUICK TO GIVE IN
TO YOUR COMPETITION.

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.257
EXCELLENT WORK MOKUBA!

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.259
I COULDN'T ASK
FOR A BETTER BROTHER!

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.526
THANKS! ANY TIME!

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:11.995
WHAT A TEAM!

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:14.697
NOW LET'S FINISH
THIS STRANGER OFF,
SHALL WE!?

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:16.766
YEAH! LET'S GO!

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.102
THIS CREEP DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE!

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:21.070
Noah: YOU HEARD
THE BOY, SETO.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.072
FOR IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE

00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:25.942
ANOTHER OF MY DECK MASTER'S
SPECIAL SKILLS!

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:27.844
AND WHAT'S THAT, KID!?

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:29.078
OBSERVE!

00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:32.348
AS I UNLEASH SHINATO'S ARK'S
GREATEST POWER!

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:34.284
RESTORATION OF LIFE!!

00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:39.255
REMEMBER, EVERY MONSTER
IN THE CARD GRAVEYARD
IS NOW ABOARD MY SHIP!

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:42.025
GIVING IT A GRAND TOTAL
OF 12 PASSENGERS!

00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:43.259
OH NO!

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.965
AND NOW I CHOOSE TO REMOVE
EVERY ONE OF THEM!

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:52.268
AS YOU CAN SEE,
EVERY MONSTER THAT
I OBLITERATE

00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:54.337
TRANSFERS ITS POWER
TO MY LIFE POINTS

00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:56.105
MAKING ME UNSTOPPABLE!

00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:00.476
AND SINCE I GET
A 500 POINT BOOST
FROM EACH MONSTER,

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:03.413
I RECEIVE SIX THOUSAND
MORE LIFE POINTS!

00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:08.918
NOW I'M EVEN STRONGER
THAN I WAS WHEN WE BEGAN!

00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:11.487
Mokuba: HE'LL NEVER
BEAT US NOW, NOAH!

00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:13.923
NOT WITH A MERE
700 LIFE POINTS!

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:16.859
ONE MORE ATTACK
AND KAIBA'S A GONER!

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.428
YOU'RE RIGHT JOEY!

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:19.929
AND IF NOAH
WINS THIS DUEL

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:21.497
HE'LL TAKE OVER
KAIBA'S BODY

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:23.833
AND ESCAPE
TO THE REAL WORLD
TO RUN KAIBA CORP

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.702
LEAVING
THE REST OF US
TRAPPED HERE!

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.270
DAT VIRTUAL JERK!

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.005
GET A LOAD OF THIS CARD!

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.973
I PLAY DARK HOLE!

00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:38.281
THIS MAGIC CARD
DESTROYS ALL MONSTERS
IN PLAY!

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:41.050
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
AFTER THAT!

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.554
THEY BECOME PASSENGERS
ABOARD SHINATO'S ARK!

00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:47.824
NOAH JUST
FILLED HIS SHIP UP
WITH MONSTERS AGAIN!

00:04:47.824 --> 00:04:51.427
THAT MEANS
HE HAS EVEN MORE CREATURES
HE CAN CALL ON NOW!

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:55.098
Yugi: PLUS HE CAN BOOST
HIS LIFE POINTS EVEN HIGHER!

00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:57.467
I THINK THAT'S
ENOUGH FOR ONE TURN!

00:04:57.467 --> 00:04:59.836
YOUR MOVE SETO!!

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:00.903
Seto, voice-over:
HOW COULD MOKUBA

00:05:00.903 --> 00:05:02.905
BE FORCED TO TURN
AGAINST ME!?

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:05.208
MAYBE I HAVE BEEN
TOO HARD ON HIM.

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:06.676
Seto: HOW DARE YOU
BETRAY ME!?

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:07.844
SETO!

00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:09.212
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!

00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:11.447
I DIDN'T TELL GOZABURO!

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:14.083
MOKUBA!
WE'RE A TEAM,
REMEMBER!?

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.185
YOU WERE ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME!

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.888
I'D NEVER TURN
MY BACK ON YOU SETO!

00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:21.991
THAT'S WHY
I'M GIVING MY TWO PERCENT
OF KAIBA CORP TO YOU!

00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:27.096
Seto, voice-over:
WE DEFEATED OUR
STEP-FATHER TOGETHER!

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:30.700
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.602
Noah: VERY TOUCHING SETO!

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:36.739
BUT MOKUBA'S
ON MY TEAM NOW!

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:41.811
AND TOGETHER
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE!

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:46.010
Noah: MOKUBA'S MY BROTHER!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.404
HE DOESN'T
EVEN REMEMBER YOU!

00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:50.673
Yugi: KAIBA!
LISTEN TO ME!

00:05:50.673 --> 00:05:52.742
NO THANKS!

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:54.577
BUT I CAN
HELP YOU KAIBA,

00:05:54.577 --> 00:05:56.579
BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THIS BEFORE!

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.881
REMEMBER WHEN JOEY
WAS BRAINWASHED
BY MARIK

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.250
AND HE TURNED
AGAINST ME!?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.252
MAYBE YOU CAN GET
THROUGH TO MOKUBA

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:05.755
THE SAME WAY I GOT
THROUGH TO JOEY!

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:07.990
THE ANSWER MAY BE
IN YOUR DECK!

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.991
LET'S GO!

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.526
YOU HAVE A DUEL TO LOSE!

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:12.061
GUESS AGAIN KID.

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:15.231
NOT ONLY AM I PLANNING
TO WIN THIS DUEL...

00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.234
I'LL ALSO WIN BACK
MY BROTHER!

00:06:18.234 --> 00:06:20.836
SO WATCH THIS!

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:21.937
DISAPPOINTED?

00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:23.906
I STILL HAVE
THIS CARD...

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:27.943
DIFFERENT DIMENSION
DRAGON!

00:06:27.943 --> 00:06:31.313
SO I'LL SWITCH IT
INTO DEFENSE MODE
AND END MY TURN.

00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:34.784
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
GET PAST THIS, NOAH!

00:06:34.784 --> 00:06:39.455
OF COURSE I CAN,
BUT FIRST IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE.

00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:41.223
I THINK I'LL WARM
THINGS UP A BIT

00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:43.225
AND PUT AN END
TO THE ICE AGE.

00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.895
AFTER ALL THIS
IS MY VIRTUAL WORLD

00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:48.230
AND I CONTROL
EVERYTHING HERE!

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.566
AS YOU KNOW
THE FALL OF THE ICE AGE

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:53.235
OPENED THE WAY
FOR THE RISE OF MANKIND.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:59.375
EVENTUALLY CITIES GREW
AND LARGE CORPORATIONS
CONTROLLED THE WORLD!

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.676
HEY WHAT'S THAT?

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:02.411
IT'S KAIBA CORP!

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.647
EXPLAIN YOURSELF NOW!

00:07:04.647 --> 00:07:07.183
WELL...SINCE THAT'S
YOUR COMPANY...

00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:09.084
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:11.754
...YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT
ONE FINAL TIME!

00:07:11.754 --> 00:07:15.724
YOU SEE...ONCE YOU LOSE
AND I TAKE OVER KAIBA CORP

00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:18.494
I'LL CHANGE IT BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS!

00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:20.062
AND IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,

00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:22.665
THIS SHOULD REFRESH
YOUR MEMORY!

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:26.235
JUST LIKE SO MANY OF
THE HIGH TECH BATTLE VEHICLES

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:28.804
THAT WERE PRODUCED BY
THE ORIGINAL KAIBA CORP,

00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:37.646
MY GRADIUS FLYER
CAN CAUSE AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE!

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:43.519
THEN I'LL ADD THIS
TO BOOST ITS POWER!

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:47.489
THE MAGIC CARD CYCLON LASER!

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:49.992
AND TO MAKE
MY JET EVEN STRONGER

00:07:49.992 --> 00:07:51.861
I'LL ADD ONE MORE CARD!

00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:54.897
THE MATTER LEVELER MAGIC CARD!

00:07:54.897 --> 00:07:59.001
IT INCREASES
THE OVERALL ATTACK STRENGTH
OF MY GRADIUS FLYER

00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.738
BY 100 POINTS EVERY TIME
IT BLASTS YOU SETO!

00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:04.807
AND THANKS
TO MY LASER'S POWER,

00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:08.444
YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MONSTER'S
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:11.480
GRADIUS, ATTACK HIS DRAGON!

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:23.058
WITH CYCLON BLAST ATTACK!

00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:25.327
AND SINCE YOUR DRAGON
RETURNS TO THE FIELD

00:08:25.327 --> 00:08:26.662
EVERY TIME IT'S DESTROYED

00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:28.797
I CAN KEEP ATTACKING IT!

00:08:28.797 --> 00:08:34.470
WHAT WAS ONCE
YOUR MONSTER'S ADVANTAGE
IS NOW YOUR DOWNFALL!

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.338
HE DOES HAVE
A POINT THERE YUGE!

00:08:36.338 --> 00:08:37.907
YEAH, I KNOW...

00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:40.242
... BUT IF KAIBA DRAWS
A POWERFUL MONSTER,

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:43.379
HE CAN STILL
TURN THIS DUEL AROUND!

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.748
I'LL LEAVE MY DIFFERENT
DIMENSION DRAGON

00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:48.317
IN DEFENSE MODE
AND END MY TURN NOW!

00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:51.253
THAT'S THE MOVE OF A MAN
WHO'S GIVEN UP!

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:54.123
I KNEW YOU WERE NO MATCH
FOR MY SUPERIOR MIND!

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:55.824
AND ONCE I DEFEAT YOU

00:08:55.824 --> 00:08:58.227
EVERYONE ELSE
WILL KNOW AS WELL!

00:08:58.227 --> 00:09:03.132
THEN I'LL FINALLY
BE ABLE TO RUN KAIBA CORP
AS I WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO!

00:09:03.132 --> 00:09:06.702
YOU MAY CONTROL
THIS LITTLE VIRTUAL
FANTASY LAND...

00:09:06.702 --> 00:09:10.272
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'LL MAKE IT IN
THE REAL WORLD NOAH!

00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:11.907
WE'LL SEE!

00:09:11.907 --> 00:09:14.777
I'M AWARE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN THE REAL WORLD!

00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:17.813
AND AFTER RULING
THIS DIGITAL UNIVERSE

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:21.517
I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT RUNNING KAIBA CORP
WILL BE A SIMPLE TASK!

00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:25.254
AND ONE THAT
I WAS RAISED TO DO
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE!

00:09:25.254 --> 00:09:27.423
THAT IS UNTIL
YOU CAME INTO MY HOME

00:09:27.423 --> 00:09:29.858
AND TOOK EVERYTHING
AWAY FROM ME!

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:32.828
WELL NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO TAKE EVERYTHING FROM YOU!

00:09:32.828 --> 00:09:34.229
FIRST I TOOK YOUR BROTHER

00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:37.733
AND NEXT I'LL TAKE
YOUR IDENTITY!

00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:41.303
NOW LET'S GET BACK
TO THIS DUEL.

00:09:41.303 --> 00:09:45.641
I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD...
GRADIUS'S OPTION!

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:48.744
SINCE I ALREADY HAVE ONE
GRADIUS FIGHTER JET
ON THE FIELD

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:50.813
THIS CARD CREATES
A SECOND ONE!

00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:51.914
BEHOLD!

00:09:51.914 --> 00:09:57.519
THE POWER OF TWO
UNSTOPPABLE AIRCRAFTS!

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:06.495
NOW CYCLON LASER! FIRE!!

00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:09.131
Seto, voice-over:
I CAN'T KEEP THIS UP
MUCH LONGER.

00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:11.900
OUR ENEMY
WILL SOON BE GONE.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.770
I HOPE YOU'RE
ENJOYING THE SHOW.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.438
MOKUBA...

00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:18.173
SETO, IT'S NO USE!

00:10:18.173 --> 00:10:19.742
HE'S WITH ME!!

00:10:19.742 --> 00:10:25.080
HOW'S IT FEEL
TO LOSE YOUR ONLY FRIEND!?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.250
NOW LET'S GET BACK
TO YOUR DESTRUCTION SHALL WE?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:42.064
GO CYCLON LASER!
ATTACK HIS DRAGON NOW!

00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:45.067
THIS ISN'T OVER YET!

00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:47.970
Noah: LOOK AT THE MIGHTY
SETO KAIBA NOW!

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.905
Seto: SNAP OUT OF IT
MOKUBA!

00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:53.242
I NEED YOU IN ORDER
TO BEAT HIM!!

00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:57.679
Noah:
WHAT'S THE MATTER SETO?

00:10:57.679 --> 00:10:59.515
FEELING DOWN?

00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:03.099
YOU'RE ONE ATTACK AWAY
FROM TOTAL ANNIHILATION!

00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:05.101
I'M...NOT DONE!

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.636
COME ON KAIBA!
SQUASH DIS KID!

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:10.673
Seto: IT WILL TAKE
MORE THAN A FEW ATTACKS
TO KEEP ME DOWN!

00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:12.641
AND IT'S MY MOVE NOW!

00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:14.810
WHAT A SHAME...

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.247
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT SOMETIMES
IT'S BEST TO STAY DOWN.

00:11:18.247 --> 00:11:20.583
THE SOONER YOU GIVE IN
TO MY POWER

00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:23.352
THE LESS SUFFERING
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO, SETO.

00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:26.288
MOKUBA REALIZED THAT FACT.

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:27.356
MOKUBA!

00:11:27.356 --> 00:11:28.758
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:31.026
NOAH IS HYPNOTIZING YOU
WITH LIES!

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:34.029
SETO IS YOUR BROTHER-
NOT NOAH--

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:36.632
AND HE'S NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:39.668
LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEART
AND YOU'LL REMEMBER HIM!

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:41.170
SETO?

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.573
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO BREAK US APART MOKUBA.

00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:46.575
Seto: MOKUBA!
LISTEN TO ME!

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:50.412
DON'T LET NOAH
POISON YOUR MIND!

00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:53.349
WE'RE FAMILY
AND NO ONE CAN EVER
CHANGE THAT!

00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:55.184
YOU AND I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN THERE

00:11:55.184 --> 00:11:57.586
TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER
AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE!

00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:01.157
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU,
MOKUBA.

00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:03.058
YOU ONCE SAVED ME!

00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:05.261
WHEN WE WERE KIDS!

00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.364
WHEN GOZABURO KAIBA
ADOPTED US...

00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.832
HE WAS MERCILESS.

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.802
FORCING ME
TO WORK FOR HOURS
WITH NO REST.

00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:14.770
I WAS EXHAUSTED
AND READY TO GIVE UP!

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.572
UNTIL YOU INSPIRED ME,
MOKUBA!

00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:18.073
Young Seto: MY DECK!

00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:22.044
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
THE GREATEST CARDS
BUT THEY'RE MINE!

00:12:22.044 --> 00:12:25.080
MOKUBA MADE ME
A BLUE-EYES CARD.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.116
BY MAKING
THAT CARD FOR ME

00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:29.585
YOU ENCOURAGED ME
NOT TO GIVE UP!

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:32.421
YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING
TO STRIVE FOR!

00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:34.924
I SWORE THAT DAY
TO BECOME A PERSON

00:12:34.924 --> 00:12:37.960
WORTHY OF POSSESSING
A REAL BLUE-EYES!

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.429
Mokuba, voice-over:
I REMEMBER MAKING THAT CARD!

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:43.065
I KNEW HOW MUCH
SETO WANTED THAT CARD

00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:45.534
AND I THOUGHT
IF I DREW ONE FOR HIM,

00:12:45.534 --> 00:12:49.238
HE'D ALWAYS REMEMBER HIS DREAM
OF OWNING A REAL ONE SOMEDAY!

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:54.243
AND I SECRETLY DREAMED
THAT SETO AND HIS BLUE EYES

00:12:54.243 --> 00:12:58.714
WOULD FLY ME AS FAR
FROM MY STEP-FATHER'S HOUSE
AS WE COULD GO!

00:12:58.714 --> 00:13:01.951
I REMEMBER...

00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:03.419
THAT'S RIGHT MOKUBA.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:05.855
I KNOW YOU CAN'T
FORGET ABOUT ME.

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:07.323
YOU'RE STRONG!

00:13:07.323 --> 00:13:09.892
AND I KNOW YOU CAN
BREAK THROUGH
HIS MIND GAMES!

00:13:09.892 --> 00:13:11.927
NEVER GIVE UP!

00:13:11.927 --> 00:13:14.296
AND NEVER LET
ANYONE CONTROL YOU!

00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:16.532
CAN'T...GIVE...UP.

00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:17.833
FIGHT HIM OFF!

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:18.868
WE CAN DO THIS!

00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:23.305
YOU AND I TOGETHER!

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:26.508
Seto, voice-over:
PLEASE LET THIS BE
THE CARD I NEED!

00:13:26.508 --> 00:13:27.576
EXCELLENT!

00:13:27.576 --> 00:13:30.346
THIS DUEL IS OVER NOAH!

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:35.284
FIRST I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF MY DECK MASTER!

00:13:35.284 --> 00:13:38.654
NOW I ONLY
NEED TO SACRIFICE
ONE MONSTER...

00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:43.125
SO THAT I...
CAN PLAY THIS!

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:45.694
BEHOLD
THE INCREDIBLE POWER

00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:56.772
OF MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:56.772 --> 00:14:00.009
THERE IT IS!

00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:03.078
IT'S THE MONSTER
I DREW FOR SETO!

00:14:03.078 --> 00:14:05.247
THE ONE THAT
HE ALWAYS WANTED!

00:14:05.247 --> 00:14:07.449
I TRIED MY BEST
TO HELP HIM GET IT...

00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:10.085
AND NOW...
THANKS TO MY HELP...

00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:13.022
HE HAS ONE IN HIS DECK!

00:14:13.022 --> 00:14:15.257
I REMEMBER...

00:14:15.257 --> 00:14:17.693
MOKUBA!
SETO!

00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:20.362
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

00:14:20.362 --> 00:14:22.765
HE'S OUR ENEMY MOKUBA!

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.267
TOO LATE!
MOKUBA'S BACK WIT US!

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:27.870
AND ONCE HE STEPS AWAY,
KAIBA CAN BLAST NOAH!

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.572
LATER YOU PHONY!

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:32.174
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE,
KAIBA!

00:14:32.174 --> 00:14:33.575
HERE GOES!

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:46.588
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,
ATTACK HIS GRADIUS!

00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:47.690
ALL RIGHT!

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.591
NOAH'S OUT
OF MONSTERS NOW!

00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:51.694
KAIBA KNEW
THAT DESTROYING ONE
OF NOAH'S JETS

00:14:51.694 --> 00:14:54.029
WOULD AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROY THE OTHER ONE TOO!

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:56.365
DON'T CELEBRATE JUST YET!

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:58.467
THERE'S STILL
MY DECK MASTER!

00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:00.502
SHINATO'S ARK!

00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:02.838
AND THERE ARE FIVE MONSTERS
ON BOARD

00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:04.473
TO INCREASE MY LIFE POINTS!

00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:05.975
Yugi: OH NO!

00:15:05.975 --> 00:15:09.278
THAT GIVES HIM
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED
MORE LIFE POINTS!

00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:10.746
AW MAN!

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:12.281
HE'LL NEVER
GO DOWN TO ZERO!

00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:14.850
NOW IT'S TIME
TO FINISH YOU OFF.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.685
MY MOVE!

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:18.887
Seto: HOLD ON, NOAH!

00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:21.423
WHAT NOW!?

00:15:21.423 --> 00:15:23.759
I HAVE YOU RIGHT
WHERE I WANT YOU!

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.927
IT'S TIME
TO FIND OUT

00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:27.196
WHICH ONE OF US
IS SUPERIOR!

00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:30.032
WHAT?!
THERE'S
ONE TURN LEFT!

00:15:30.032 --> 00:15:31.934
SO BRACE YOURSELF!

00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:34.003
REVEAL THE TRAP
CAAAAARD...!

00:15:34.003 --> 00:15:36.872
...LAST TURN!

00:15:36.872 --> 00:15:38.574
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS!

00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:40.576
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:43.045
Seto: WATCH THIS,
MOKUBA!

00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:44.980
HERE'S HOW
IT'S GONNA WORK!

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.750
EACH OF US WILL
PICK A MONSTER
TO KEEP ON THE FIELD

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.586
AND ALL OTHERS
WILL GO DIRECTLY
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:53.355
THEN THE TWO
CHOSEN MONSTERS
WILL FACE EACH OTHER

00:15:53.355 --> 00:15:56.258
IN A ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE
TO THE FINISH!

00:15:56.258 --> 00:15:58.193
WHEN THE FIGHT IS OVER

00:15:58.193 --> 00:16:01.864
ONLY ONE OF OUR MONSTERS
WILL REMAIN STANDING!

00:16:01.864 --> 00:16:03.432
THE WINNER
OF THIS ONE BATTLE

00:16:03.432 --> 00:16:05.768
WILL DETERMINE
WHO WINS THE ENTIRE DUEL

00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:08.170
NO MATTER HOW MANY
LIFE POINTS HE HAS LEFT!

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.339
MAY THE STRONGEST
DUELIST WIN!

00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:13.509
I CHOOSE MY BLUE-EYES!

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:14.676
ALRIGHT!

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:16.412
I CHOOSE MY DECK MASTER,

00:16:16.412 --> 00:16:21.016
THE ALL-POWERFUL
SHINATO'S ARK!

00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:23.852
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO SINK YOUR SHIP NOW!

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.687
AND FINISH YOU OFF!

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:27.589
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:37.166
ATTACK HIS DECK MASTER
WITH WHITE LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:38.834
YEAH!
A'RIGHT!

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:42.771
BETTER ABANDON SHIP!

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:44.006
Yugi:
KAIBA WON!

00:16:44.006 --> 00:16:45.207
Noah: WRONG!

00:16:45.207 --> 00:16:48.143
LOOK AGAIN!

00:16:48.143 --> 00:16:52.014
YOU'VE JUST UNLEASHED A POWER
LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN!

00:16:52.014 --> 00:16:53.315
WHAT IS THAT!?

00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:55.751
IT'S MY REAL DECK MASTER!

00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:57.286
NO WAY!

00:16:57.286 --> 00:17:00.456
YOU'VE JUST SEALED
YOUR OWN DOOM SETO!

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:03.092
FOR WHEN YOU DESTROYED
SHINATO'S ARK,

00:17:03.092 --> 00:17:07.129
YOU RELEASED SHINATO,
KING OF A HIGHER PLANE!

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:15.058
Noah: NOW PREPARE

Tea: OH NO!

00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:31.470
SETO...
I'VE FINALLY DONE IT!

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.740
I'VE PROVEN THAT
I AM SUPERIOR TO YOU!

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.242
DID YOU SEE THAT, FATHER!?

00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:37.977
I DEFEATED SETO!

00:17:37.977 --> 00:17:39.912
NOW I CAN FINALLY
TAKE OVER KAIBA CORP

00:17:39.912 --> 00:17:41.814
LIKE I WAS ALWAYS
MEANT TO!

00:17:41.814 --> 00:17:44.517
FOR I AM THE MOST
POWERFUL BEING
IN THE WORLD!

00:17:44.517 --> 00:17:48.454
NOW TO PERFORM
ONE FINAL TASK BEFORE
I EXIT THIS PLACE!

00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:50.856
WHAT'S DAT FREAK DOIN!?

00:17:50.856 --> 00:17:51.991
READY...

00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:54.393
I'LL NOW MERGE TOGETHER
WITH MY DECK MASTER

00:17:54.393 --> 00:17:57.096
TO DELIVER THE LAST BLOW
OF THIS DUEL!

00:17:57.096 --> 00:18:02.301
YOU SEE I'VE DECIDED
NOT TO ESCAPE TO THE REAL WORLD
IN YOUR BODY SETO,

00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:05.738
SINCE I HAVE SO MANY OTHERS
TO CHOOSE FROM.

00:18:05.738 --> 00:18:08.074
BESIDES...THAT'S NO FUN!

00:18:08.074 --> 00:18:10.209
I'VE GOT BIGGER PLANS!

00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:13.579
SHINATO AND I WANT
TO TURN YOU INTO
A PERMANENT FIXTURE

00:18:13.579 --> 00:18:14.880
IN THIS VIRTUAL WORLD!

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.584
HEY! SETO!

00:18:18.584 --> 00:18:19.752
MOKUBA!

00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:21.954
THIS REUNION IS TOUCHING

00:18:21.954 --> 00:18:27.193
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT!

00:18:27.193 --> 00:18:29.228
NOOO!

00:18:29.228 --> 00:18:30.930
MY JOB IS NOW COMPLETE!

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.866
Yugi:
KAIBA! MOKUBA!

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:35.134
Tea: WHAT DID
HE DO TO THEM!?

00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:37.470
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THEY WERE HARDHEADED.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.339
SO I'VE TURNED THEM
INTO A LIVING SCULPTURE!

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:41.540
THEY'RE SO CLOSE

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.410
YET THEY'LL NEVER
REACH ONE ANOTHER.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.845
HOW TRAGIC!

00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:47.847
Joey: OH MAN.

00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:52.885
THEY'RE STATUES.
IT CAN'T BE.

00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:54.253
NOAH!

00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:56.388
YOU THINK THIS PROVES
YOU'RE THE BEST?

00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:59.358
I THINK IT SHOWS YOUR FATHER
THAT YOU'RE A COWARD!

00:18:59.358 --> 00:19:01.794
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT YUGI!?

00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:04.563
I DEFEATED SETO IN THIS DUEL
FAIR AND SQUARE!

00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:06.132
GUESS AGAIN NOAH!

00:19:06.132 --> 00:19:08.134
YOU THINK
KIDNAPPING MOKUBA

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:10.302
AND USING HIM
AS A SHIELD IS FAIR?

00:19:10.302 --> 00:19:11.971
YOU THINK I CHEATED?!

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:14.140
I THINK YOU'RE GUILTY
OF THE SAME FOUL PLAY

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.375
YOU ONCE SCOLDED
THE BIG FIVE FOR!

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:19.612
SOMETHING
YOU SAID YOUR FATHER
WOULD NEVER ALLOW!

00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:22.381
KAIBA COULD HAVE EASILY
DEFEATED YOU NOAH!

00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:26.118
BUT HE CHOSE THE SAFETY
OF HIS LITTLE BROTHER
OVER HIS VICTORY!

00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:30.689
AND THAT...MAKES KAIBA
A STRONGER PERSON
THAN YOU WILL EVER BE!

00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:32.124
ALL YOU'VE PROVEN
HERE TODAY

00:19:32.124 --> 00:19:33.793
IS THAT YOU'RE
A WEAK LITTLE BOY

00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:35.795
WHO NEEDS TO CHEAT
TO GET HIS WAY!

00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:37.630
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.132
YOU DIDN'T WIN
THIS DUEL!

00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:41.801
BUT I HAVE
A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:45.704
KAIBA HAS FOUR HUNDRED
LIFE POINTS LEFT!

00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.206
LET ME TAKE HIS PLACE

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.842
SO WE CAN
FINISH THIS DUEL
FAIR AND SQUARE!

00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:52.978
THAT COULD BE
THE MOST FOOLISH CHALLENGE
I'VE EVER HEARD!

00:19:52.978 --> 00:19:54.480
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU ACCEPT

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.981
OR ARE YOU AFRAID
I'LL DEFEAT YOU

00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:57.583
AND PROVE
ONCE AND FOR ALL...

00:19:57.583 --> 00:19:59.285
...THAT YOU ARE WEAK!

00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:01.520
I'D BE CRAZY NOT TO ACCEPT!

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.956
Joey: YUGI!
DON'T BE A DOOFUS!

00:20:03.956 --> 00:20:05.958
HE'S GOT OVER
SEVEN THOUSAND LIFE POINTS

00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.459
TO YOUR MEASLY
FOUR HUNDRED!

00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:09.595
Tristan: CAREFUL,
JOEY'S RIGHT FOR A CHANGE!

00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:11.964
ONCE I DEFEAT YOU, YUGI,

00:20:11.964 --> 00:20:14.500
I'LL TURN EVERY ONE OF YOU
INTO STONE!

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.102
JUST TRY IT!

00:20:17.102 --> 00:20:19.905
I THINK WE NEED
A LITTLE PRIVACY,
DON'T YOU!?

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:21.640
Tea: HEY
WHAT'S HE DOING!?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.711
AS I WAS SAYING,
I'LL TURN ALL BUT ONE
OF YOU INTO STONE!

00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:31.317
AFTER ALL
I NEED A BODY
TO ESCAPE IN!

00:20:31.317 --> 00:20:34.386
AND IF YOU LOSE
YOU'LL SET US ALL FREE!

00:20:34.386 --> 00:20:38.023
SO IN THE NAME
OF KAIBA AND MOKUBA
LET'S DUEL NOW!

00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:39.892
WITH PLEASURE YUGI!

00:20:39.892 --> 00:20:41.694
AND MAY THE BEST
DUELIST WIN!

00:20:41.694 --> 00:20:43.162
YOU'RE ON!

00:20:43.162 --> 00:20:44.964
AND WHEN I DO,

00:20:44.964 --> 00:20:49.034
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE PRISONERS
OF MY WORLD FOREVER!
