MY CRUSH CARD TRAP!

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.616
FIRST IT DESTROYS
YOUR MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.784
THEN THE VIRUS SPREADS
TO YOUR HAND!

IS BACK!

THE TIME HAS COME
FOR ME TO STEP IN

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.472
AND RECLAIM MY BODY,
SISTER!

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.374
NO. IT'S
FAR TOO DANGEROUS!

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.375

YEAH, YOU TELL HIM, JOEY!

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.258
HE JUST MIGHT BEAT
THAT RICH SNOB
AFTER ALL!

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:09.429
Yugi: JOEY'S DOING
AWESOME AGAINST KAIBA!

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.701
HE'S BECOME ONE OF
THE GREATEST DUELISTS AROUND!

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.036
HE COULD HAVE WON
THIS WHOLE TOURNAMENT

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:19.906
IF IT WASN'T FOR
MARIK'S SHADOW GAME.

WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

IF HE SUCCEEDS IN
ATTACKING MY LIFE POINTS,

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:43.563
I'LL LOSE THE DUEL
AND MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.232
A'RIGHT...

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.533

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.942
CAN WIPE MARIK OUT!

THIS CAN'T BE
POSSIBLE!

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.720
Yami-Yugi:
HURRY UP AND CALL
YOUR ATTACK, JOEY!

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.125
I...

Tristan: GET UP, MAN!
GET UP!

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:19.187
ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS YELL "ATTACK!"

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.289
AND JOEY WOULD HAVE
WON THE DUEL.

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.423
MMM.

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:23.758
BUT IN HIS HEART,

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:25.326
JOEY KNOWS THAT
HE'S A GREAT
DUELIST,

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.929
WORTHY OF
THE BATTLE CITY CROWN.

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.299
JOEY'S DUELING PRETTY WELL
AGAINST SETO!

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.202
BUT HE'LL HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT
TO BEAT HIM!

00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:38.039
HMM. WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS ON
MAKING ONE GOOD MOVE!

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.108
THERE IS A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING!

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:41.609
WATCH IT, PAL!

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.745
I'M NOT YOUR "PAL,"
WHEELER!

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.747
IF I WERE, I'D BE
STANDING OVER THERE

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:46.948
WITH THE OTHER GEEKS,

00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:48.283
CHEERING MY PATHETIC
HEART OUT

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:50.518
FOR THE OBVIOUS
LOSER OF THE DUEL!

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:52.420
DID YOU FORGET
THAT I DESTROYED

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.555
EVERY POWERFUL MONSTER
IN YOUR DECK!?

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:55.623
[THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT!

00:03:55.623 --> 00:03:57.191
DANKS TA
HIS CRUSH CARD,

00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.359
THE ONLY MONSTAS
I GOT LEFT

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.962
HAVE LESS THAN 1,500
ATTACK POINTS!

00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:02.764
BUT I GOTTA
KEEP FIGHTING!

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.499
IF I LET KAIBA
GET DA BEST 'A ME,

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.667
HE'LL NEVER LET ME
LIVE IT DOWN!

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:08.736
AND I GOTTA
PUT DAT PUNK
IN HIS PLACE!

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:10.538
Yami-Yugi:
YOU CAN DO THIS, JOEY!

00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:11.572
Joey:
DANKS, YUGE.

00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:13.007
I NEEDED DAT.

00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:15.476
HA! YOU DON'T
HAVE A CLUE, DO YOU?

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:17.078
NOW LET'S DUEL!

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.180
IT'S TIME I GAVE YOU
A FIRSTHAND LOOK

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.082
AT THE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR SKILL LEVELS,

00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:22.784
SO STAND BACK, WHEELER!

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.152
I PLAY...

00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:27.655
BLADE KNIGHT...
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.658
NOW ATTACK HIS SWORDSMAN!

00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:39.033
WHOA, THAT'S ROUGH!

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:41.202
HE JUST LOST HALF
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:43.805
ONE MORE ATTACK LIKE THAT,
AND JOEY'S DONE!

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:44.939
Yami-Yugi: HE'LL
PULL THROUGH.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:50.478
WELL,
LET'S JUST HOPE SO!

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:53.281
NOW... I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.516
YOU HAVE NO CHANCE!

00:04:55.516 --> 00:04:57.785
I'M JUST GETTING
WARMED UP!

00:04:57.785 --> 00:04:59.787
SO WATCH OUT!

00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:10.531
Yami-Marik: I MUST DISCOVER
WHAT HAPPENED UP HERE TODAY!

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.900
WHEN THE TWO
EGYPTIAN GODS CLASHED,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.169
SOMETHING WAS RELEASED!

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:24.645
THE FORCE CREATED
BY THESE TWO BEHEMOTHS

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:27.615
CAUSED MY MILLENNIUM ROD
TO ACTIVATE!

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:29.450
ACCORDING TO THE PHARAOH,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.920
HE AND KAIBA WERE SHOWN
A VISION OF THE PAST.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.922
BUT WHAT DID THEY SEE?

00:05:34.922 --> 00:05:39.327
AND WHY IS MY MILLENNIUM ITEM
SERVING ANYONE BUT ME!?

00:05:39.327 --> 00:05:42.363
ONLY I SHOULD CONTROL
THE MILLENNIUM ROD!

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:45.233
I COMMAND YOU TO OBEY ME NOW!

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:46.367
HEAR ME!?

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:48.736
SHOW ME THE ANCIENT IMAGES

00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:51.005
THAT YOU SHOWED
THE PHARAOH AND KAIBA!

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:58.279
[GROWLING]

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.317
YOU SHOULD BE
MORE CAREFUL WITH THIS.

00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:07.288
PARDON ME?

00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:08.890
Joey: MY MOVE,
RICH BOY!

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.691
HERE GOES!

00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:13.027
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TRY...THIS!

00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:14.262
CHECK IT OOOUT!

00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:15.730
I SUMMON
LITTLE WINGUARD

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.731
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.700
HA HA HA!

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.202
WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT!?

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:23.371
JOEY'S MONSTER
IS WEAKER
THAN KAIBA'S,

00:06:23.371 --> 00:06:25.540
BUT HE PLAYED IT
IN ATTACK MODE,
DUDE!

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.675
YEAH. HE JUST BROKE
THE MOST BASIC RULE

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:29.710
OF "WINNING
AT DUEL MONSTERS!"

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.479
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
WHEELER?

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.715
IS THIS SOME LAME
ATTEMPT AT A STRATEGY!?

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:35.850
MAYBE.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.919
WHY DONCHA JUDGE
FOR YOURSELF?

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.855
I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD
LEGENDARY SWORD!

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:42.223
THE MONSTER THAT
HOLDS THIS SWORD

00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:45.693
GAINS 300 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS!

00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:46.861
GREAT MOVE!

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:48.863
NOW YOU CAN STRENGTHEN
YOUR WINGUARD!

00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:51.132
AND TAKE DOWN KAIBA'S KNIGHT!

00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:52.233
NOW,

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:55.203
DRAW YOUR
LEGENDARY SWORD!

00:06:55.203 --> 00:06:57.972
WELL, I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:06:57.972 --> 00:06:59.173
ABSORB SPELL!

00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:00.475
OH, BOY.

00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:02.343
NOW THE MAGIC CARD
YOU JUST COMBINED

00:07:02.343 --> 00:07:03.544
WITH YOUR WINGUARD...

00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:05.947
IS TRANSFERRED
TO MY BLADE KNIGHT,

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:10.751
MAKING MY MONSTER
EVEN STRONGER!

00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:12.620
YOU STOLE
MY LEGENDARY SWORD!

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.988
HUH!

00:07:13.988 --> 00:07:15.423
AND MY ATTACK
POINTS!

00:07:15.423 --> 00:07:17.391
THAT WAS
A THIRD-RATE
STRATEGY, WHEELER,

00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:19.494
JUST AS I SUSPECTED!

00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:22.964
YOU COULD NEVER
DEFEAT A DUELIST
WITH REAL TALENT!

00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:25.066
WELL, NEXT TIME
I'M DUELIN' SOMEONE
WIT TALENT,

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:26.801
I'LL REMEMBA DAT!

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.871
NOW I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:31.205
YOUR MOVE, KAIBA!

00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:32.273
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:34.275
BUT KAIBA'S
A TOUGH CUSTOMER!

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:37.311
YEAH?! WELL,
JOEY IS, TOO!

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.647
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT HIS EYES, DUKE.

00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:41.516
JOEY IS DETERMINED
TO WIN THIS DUEL

00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:45.052
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:07:45.052 --> 00:07:47.355
HAND OVER THAT ITEM!

00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:48.923
YOU ARE MEDDLING
WITH FORCES

00:07:48.923 --> 00:07:51.058
BEYOND YOUR CONTROL!

00:07:51.058 --> 00:07:54.662
RETURN IT!

00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:59.100
AAH! AARGH!

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.935
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:07.008
NO ONE CAN USE
THE MILLENNIUM ROD BUT ME!

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:07.975
Yugi, thinking:
WHAT'S THE DEAL

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:08.976
WITH THE PUZZLE?!

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:10.578
IT'S GLOWING!

00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:11.979
I HAVE
A STRANGE FEELING

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:16.918
THAT WHATEVER'S
CAUSING THIS IS NOT GOOD!

00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:18.186
Yami-Yugi: TEA!

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:20.188
OHH!

00:08:20.188 --> 00:08:22.657
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH TEA!

00:08:22.657 --> 00:08:27.094
WE'VE GOT TO GO
FIND HER NOW!

00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:28.963
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
JOEY!

00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:33.434
STAY STRONG!

00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:38.439
YOU MAY THINK
I'M GOING TO ATTACK
YOUR PITIFUL WINGUARD...

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:41.542
BUT I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS
PLANNED FOR YOU, WHEELER!

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.010
AND I'M AFRAID
THEY'RE MUCH WORSE

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.313
THAN ANYTHING
YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE!

00:08:45.313 --> 00:08:46.380
YAH!

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.317
WATCH AND LEARN,
YOU AMATEUR!

00:08:49.317 --> 00:08:54.422
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC CARD
ENEMY CONTROLLER!

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:56.657
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:08:56.657 --> 00:08:58.893
I DROP
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS...

00:08:58.893 --> 00:09:03.397
TO TAKE CONTROL OF
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:04.899
LEFT...RIGHT...

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.067
"A"..."B!"

00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.069
AND NOW IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:12.340
YOUR PUNY WARRIOR
IS MINE!

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.975
YOU'RE WIDE OPEN,
WHEELER!

00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:17.211
NOW TO PLAY
ONE OF MY MAGIC CARDS!

00:09:17.211 --> 00:09:18.980
IT'S CALLED COST DOWN,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.182
AND IT LOWERS THE LEVEL
OF ONE MY MONSTERS,

00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:23.150
MAKING IT EASIER TO SUMMON!

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.086
EH! NO WAY!

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.621
NOW I SHALL
SUMMON A MONSTER

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:28.889
THAT USUALLY REQUIRES
TWO SACRIFICES

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.025
BY SACRIFICING
ONLY ONE CARD!

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:32.059
EHH...

00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:33.761
ALL RIGHT!

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:36.597
PREPARE TO MEET
MY ULTIMATE BEAST!

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:40.001
I SACRIFICE
YOUR LITTLE WINGUARD!

00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:42.670
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THIS CARD!

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:49.644
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:50.911
AAH!

00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:53.914
HOW CAN I PROTECT
MYSELF FROM THAT?

00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.987
NOW YOU'RE
DEFENSELESS!

00:09:59.987 --> 00:10:02.223
SO ONE ATTACK
BY MY BLUE-EYES...

00:10:02.223 --> 00:10:04.125
AND YOU LOSE THE DUEL!

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.228
YOU SHOULD HAVE QUIT
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!

00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:08.963
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:11.666
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:12.700
EHH...

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.668
DO
SOMETHING!

00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:16.304
AND DO IT FAST!

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:17.638
HOLD ON, TOUGH GUY!

00:10:17.638 --> 00:10:19.407
I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:10:19.407 --> 00:10:21.008
MY SCAPEGOAT CARD!

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:27.615
OH, NO!

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:28.716
SORRY!

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:30.551
BUT YOUR ATTACK
FAILED, RICH BOY!

00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:31.752
AWESOME!

00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:34.255
JOEY'S SCAPEGOAT
ABSORBED KAIBA'S
ATTACK!

00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:36.657
Duke: AND HE'S
STILL GOT 3
SCAPEGOATS LEFT!

00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:37.858
TOO BAD!

00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:39.360
MY LIFE POINTS
AREN'T GOIN' ANYWHERE

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.595
AS LONG AS DESE GUYS
ARE ON DA FIELD!

00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:42.663
HMM.

00:10:42.663 --> 00:10:44.799
WELL, THEY WON'T BE
FOR LONG!

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:45.966
BLADE KNIGHT!

00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:50.871
DESTROY
HIS SECOND SCAPEGOAT!

00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:52.740
HEY! WHY DID
YOUR BLADE KNIGHT

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.642
JUST GAIN
MORE ATTACK POINTS?!

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.410
BECAUSE BLADE KNIGHT
HAS A SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.611
THAT'S WHY!

00:10:57.611 --> 00:10:59.947
IT GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS

00:10:59.947 --> 00:11:03.617
WHEN I HAVE ONE CARD
OR LESS IN MY HAND.

00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:05.853
SO NOW IT HAS
A STRENGTH OF 2,300!

00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:09.323
AND MY BLUE-EYES
HAS 3,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:11.125
AND THANKS TO
THE DEVASTATING EFFECT

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:13.894
OF MY ALL-POWERFUL
CRUSH CARD,

00:11:13.894 --> 00:11:17.898
YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
WITH MORE THAN 1,500!

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.867
[THINKING]
KAIBA MAY BE
AN ARROGANT JERK,

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:22.069
BUT DA GUY
DOES HAVE A POINT!

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:24.372
HMM.
IT'S YOUR MOVE NOW!

00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:25.673
[THINKING]
HOW CAN I TAKE DOWN

00:11:25.673 --> 00:11:27.141
TWO OF KAIBA'S
HEAVYWEIGHTS

00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:29.410
WIT A DECK
FULL OF WIMPS!?

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.112
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN...

00:11:31.112 --> 00:11:32.713
LOOK OUT!

00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:34.148
[THINKING]
NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS HOPIN' FOR,

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:37.017
BUT I GUESS IT
CAN HELP GUARD
MY LIFE POINTS.

00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:39.487
FIRST, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:41.622
DEN I'LL PLAY
BATTLE WARRIOR

00:11:41.622 --> 00:11:43.224
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:44.992
AND DAT'S ALL
FOR NOW.

00:11:44.992 --> 00:11:47.862
THAT PATHETIC MONSTER
WON'T SLOW ME DOWN!

00:11:47.862 --> 00:11:49.697
WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT!

00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:53.067
HMM.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:55.169
SO YOU LEFT
A PIECE OF YOUR MIND

00:11:55.169 --> 00:11:56.937
INSIDE THIS GIRL?

00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:58.139
HOW SAD.

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.573
YES.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:02.743
AND IT'S
MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO STOP YOU.

00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:04.311
IS THAT SO?

00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:08.082
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU DON'T EXIST
ANYMORE, MARIK?

00:12:08.082 --> 00:12:10.885
I OCCUPY YOUR BODY
NOW!

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:13.320
I KNOW,
AND I'VE RETURNED

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.122
TO RECLAIM IT
FROM YOU!

00:12:15.122 --> 00:12:17.858
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE TOO WEAK NOW!

00:12:17.858 --> 00:12:20.628
MARIK,
I'M THE REAL YOU,

00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:23.831
AND YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A SMALL PIECE
OF MY MEMORY...

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:25.366
THANKS TO ODION!

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:27.635
BECAUSE OF HIS ACCIDENT,

00:12:27.635 --> 00:12:30.371
I WAS ABLE TO
EMERGE AGAIN!

00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:31.906
[SIGH]
ODION.

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:32.907
HA HA HA!

00:12:32.907 --> 00:12:34.442
UNH!

00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:37.411
I TOLD YOU
YOU WERE TOO WEAK!

00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:38.512
AH!

00:12:38.512 --> 00:12:40.080
Yami-Marik:
HA HA HA!

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.482
SORRY, MARIK,

00:12:41.482 --> 00:12:43.851
BUT IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO BANISH
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU

00:12:43.851 --> 00:12:45.753
INTO THE SHADOWS,
WHERE YOU BELONG.

00:12:45.753 --> 00:12:47.788
HA HA HA!

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:52.960
I'M AFRAID THERE'S
NOWHERE LEFT FOR YOU
TO RUN NOW.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.963
YOU WON'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

00:12:55.963 --> 00:12:58.332
YOU'RE IN
NO POSITION
TO MAKE THREATS.

00:12:58.332 --> 00:13:00.668
I DROVE YOU OUT
ONCE...

00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:03.103
NOW IT'S TIME
TO FINISH THE JOB.

00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:05.139
HA HA HA!

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:11.145
Marik: THAT'S
WHAT HE THINKS!

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.446
HUH?

00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:15.049
YOU'RE JUST
PROLONGING YOUR DEMISE!

00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:17.184
GOOD-BYE!

00:13:17.184 --> 00:13:19.119
WHOA!

00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:20.387
UNH!

00:13:20.387 --> 00:13:22.990
YOU'RE NOTHING
WITHOUT ODION
TO PROTECT YOU!

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.092
IT'S TIME TO END
OUR LITTLE GAME.

00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:28.462
YOU'LL NEVER MEDDLE
IN MY AFFAIRS AGAIN!

00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:30.397
HA HA HA!

00:13:30.397 --> 00:13:33.100
[GROANS]

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.702
IT'S OVER!

00:13:34.702 --> 00:13:36.136
HA HA HA!

00:13:36.136 --> 00:13:37.538
Ishizu: STOP THIS AT ONCE!

00:13:37.538 --> 00:13:38.639
HUH?

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.374
STAY OUT OF THIS,
ISHIZU!

00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:41.909
[GROWLS]

00:13:41.909 --> 00:13:45.212
THIS DOESN'T
CONCERN YOU!

00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:48.282
THEN AGAIN,
I COULD BANISH YOU BOTH.

00:13:48.282 --> 00:13:49.650
HA HA HA!

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.718
BE GONE!

00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:51.986
YOU'RE NOT
MY BROTHER!

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:53.120
SISTER...

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.188
IT'S TOO LATE!

00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:55.489
WHAT!?

00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:57.625
Tea and Marik:
I HAVE GROWN WEAK,
ISHIZU.

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:58.959
STOP HIM...

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.362
BUT FORGET ME.

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:02.363
OHH.

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:03.430
MARIK, GET UP!

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.332
I'M THE ONLY MARIK
NOW!

00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:08.369
I OCCUPY HIS BODY,
ISHIZU!

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:10.971
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GO!

00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:13.274
PREPARE TO REUNITE
WITH YOUR FATHER!

00:14:13.274 --> 00:14:14.942
IN ETERNAL DARKNESS!

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:16.844
HA HA HA!

00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:19.947
I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS
IMMENSELY!

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:22.950
Yami-Yugi: HOLD ON!
HUH?

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.118
LOOK AT THIS...

00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:28.289
I'M QUITE POPULAR
TODAY.

00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:29.456
ALL RIGHT...

00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:31.825
THIS HAS GONE
FAR ENOUGH, MARIK.

00:14:31.825 --> 00:14:33.761
AHH.
WELCOME, PHARAOH.

00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:36.397
OUR BATTLE WILL BEGIN
SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

ARE NOW COLLIDING!

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:50.377
ON SECOND THOUGHT...

00:14:50.377 --> 00:14:53.147
I DON'T WANT TO
END THIS JUST YET.

00:14:53.147 --> 00:14:56.984
THAT WOULD BE
TOO EASY, PHARAOH.

00:14:56.984 --> 00:14:59.520
AND I HAVE SOMETHING
MORE FUN IN MIND.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.654

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:03.057
SO UNTIL THEN,
GOOD DAY!

00:15:03.057 --> 00:15:06.927
WHEN WE NEXT MEET,
YOUR POWER WILL BE MINE!
