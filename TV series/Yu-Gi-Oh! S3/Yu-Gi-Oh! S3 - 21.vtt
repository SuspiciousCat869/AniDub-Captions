WHITE RABBIT!

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:01.648
NO!

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.584
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:07.120
AND NOW I CAN
BRING BACK A MONSTER

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.290
THAT YOU DESTROYED
EARLIER IN OUR DUEL!

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:16.363
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:18.898
NOW I HAVE THE POWER
OF TWO DARK MAGICIANS

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.700
ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD, NOAH!

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.270
AND IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS LEFT!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.572
EHH.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.474
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN,

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.509
AND I'LL END MY TURN
FOR NOW.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.145
HA! YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO DEFEND YOU!

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.481
SO YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN!

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.851
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME
I TURN THIS DUEL AROUND!

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.886
SO STAND BACK, NOAH!

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.588
Yugi, thinking:
JUST WHAT I NEEDED!

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:42.722
ALL RIGHT.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.858
PREPARE TO RELEASE
ME AND MY FRIENDS

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.292
FROM YOUR TWISTED GAME!

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.896
FOR I ACTIVATE
DARK MAGIC RITUAL!

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.197
THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.700
TO SUMMON A DARK
MAGICAL CREATURE,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.802
ONCE I MAKE
A SACRIFICE!

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:59.205
SOOOO, I'LL
SACRIFICE THIS CARD!

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:04.010
MY ALL-POWERFUL
VALKYRION
THE MAGNET WARRIOR.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.047
VALKYRION, BE GONE!

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.716
NOW I SHALL SUMMON
MY THIRD MAGICIAN!

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:15.155
THE MAGICIAN
OF BLACK CHAOS!

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.356
OH, NO!

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:17.657
OH, YES!

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.560
THIS MONSTER
COMPLETES MY TRIO
OF MAGICAL BEASTS

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.731
THAT WILL
COMBINE FORCES
TO TAKE YOU DOWN!

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.734
WHEN ADDED TOGETHER,
DARK MAGICIAN,

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.202
DARK MAGICIAN
GIRL,

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:30.904
AND MAGICIAN
OF BLACK CHAOS

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.773
HAVE OVER 7,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.109
ALMOST ENOUGH
TO WIPE YOU OUT!

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:37.777
HE'S GOT 3
DARK MAGICIANS?

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.079
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.114
BUT HE NEVA
HAD 'EM ALL
ON DA FIELD AT ONCE!

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.016
DIS IS DA BREAK
YUGI NEEDED!

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.885
NOAH! THIS IS
FOR MY FRIENDS!

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:49.823
COMBINE FORCES,
MY MAGICIANS!

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:51.658
AND STRIKE
HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:03.205
Yami-Yugi:
THE COMBINED STRENGTH
OF MY MAGICIANS

00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:04.739
WILL RENDER YOU WEAK!

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:06.241
SO YOU THINK!

00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:07.876
GUESS AGAIN!

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:09.911
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:10:09.911 --> 00:10:13.782
YOU JUST TRIGGERED
MY CHAOS BARRIER FIELD!

00:10:13.782 --> 00:10:14.850
Yugi, thinking:
OH, NO.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.119
HE STOPPED MY TRIPLE
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:20.422
MY POINTS ARE STILL SAFE!

00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:23.058
HOWEVER, YOURS
ARE IN A GREAT DEAL
OF DANGER,

00:10:23.058 --> 00:10:25.660
SO WATCH CLOSELY
AS MY TRAP CARD
TAKES EFFECT...

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.563
PITTING YOUR STRONGEST
AND YOUR WEAKEST MONSTER

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:32.334
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER!

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:34.135
NOW,
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:38.206
FEEL THE WRATH
OF YOUR FRIEND
MAGICIAN OF BLACK CHAOS!

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.875
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.076
IT'S TRUE!

00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:44.813
YOUR BIG PLAN TO DEFEAT ME
JUST FAILED MISERABLY!

00:10:44.813 --> 00:10:46.915
AND ALL THE LIFE POINTS
YOU JUST LOST

00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:49.751
GO DIRECTLY TO ME!

00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:52.053
NOW HE'S AHEAD
BY 9,000!

00:10:52.053 --> 00:10:54.155
Noah: BRAVO, YUGI!

00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:55.290
BRAVO!

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.958
YOU'VE PUT ON
SUCH A GREAT SHOW,

00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.194
I SEE NO NEED
TO CONTINUE!

00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:01.529
SO I'LL TRANSFORM
YOUR FRIENDS
BACK TO NORMAL,

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:03.031
AND WE CAN END THIS DUEL!

00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:04.733
DON'T TOY WITH ME.

00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:06.001
[GRUNT]

00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:07.302
SERENITY.

00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:10.505
I ASK ONLY
ONE LITTLE FAVOR
IN RETURN, YUGI--

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:11.873
THAT YOU
FORFEIT THE DUEL

00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:14.709
AND ADMIT THAT I
AM SUPERIOR TO YOU.

00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:16.578
IT SEEMS A SMALL
PRICE TO PAY

00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:19.481
FOR YOUR FRIENDS'
SAFE RETURN, DOESN'T IT?

00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:20.849
OF COURSE,
SETO AND MOKUBA

00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:23.418
WILL REMAIN AS THEY ARE
AND STAY WITH ME!

00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:24.920
YOU SLIME BALL!

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.821
WAIT! WATCH WHAT YOU SAY!

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.490
YOU'LL BE NEXT!

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.093
HE CAN'T PLAY
WIT PEOPLE'S LIVES
LIKE DIS.

00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:34.629
YUGE! YOU CAN BEAT
THIS LITTLE TWERP
FAIR AND SQUARE

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:36.364
AND END
HIS SICK GAME!

00:11:36.364 --> 00:11:38.533
WHAT IF I'M DEFEATED?

00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.235
YOU WON'T LOSE,
YUGE!

00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:44.072
I DON'T REMEMBER
ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION,
YOU FOOL!

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:46.074
SO SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:11:46.074 --> 00:11:49.511
[SCREAMING]

00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:52.447
AAH!
NO, JOEY!

00:11:52.447 --> 00:11:55.383
NOT YOU, TOO!
OHH.

00:11:55.383 --> 00:11:58.753
NOAH! YOU THINK YOU'RE
REALLY TOUGH, DON'T YOU!

00:11:58.753 --> 00:11:59.821
WHY, YES!

00:11:59.821 --> 00:12:01.823
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
JUST A SPOILED BRAT

00:12:01.823 --> 00:12:03.391
WHO'S GOT NO GUTS!

00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:05.393
IF THINGS AREN'T
GOING YOUR WAY,

00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:07.128
YOU JUST KEEP
CHANGING ALL THE RULES

00:12:07.128 --> 00:12:08.363
UNTIL THEY ARE!

00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:09.497
HA HA HA!

00:12:09.497 --> 00:12:10.966
DO YOU THINK
I REALLY CARE

00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:13.468
WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME, TEA!?

00:12:13.468 --> 00:12:15.337
I'VE ALREADY PROVEN
THAT THERE'S
NO ONE OUT THERE

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:16.838
WHO'S BETTER THAN ME!

00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:19.607
NOW IT'S UP TO YUGI
TO ADMIT THE SAME!

00:12:19.607 --> 00:12:22.344
THEN I'LL GLADLY
REVERSE THE DAMAGE
THAT'S BEEN DONE.

00:12:22.344 --> 00:12:24.746
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'VE GOT SOME
DISAPPOINTING NEWS

00:12:24.746 --> 00:12:26.114
FOR YOU, THEN.

00:12:26.114 --> 00:12:28.183
I STILL PLAN TO WIN!

00:12:28.183 --> 00:12:30.785
WHAT!? YOU DO!?

00:12:30.785 --> 00:12:32.287
THEN SUIT YOURSELF!

00:12:32.287 --> 00:12:35.223
I TRIED TO MAKE THINGS
EASY FOR YOU!

00:12:35.223 --> 00:12:37.559
BUT YOU CHOSE
THE HARD WAY!

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:40.395
SO...I PLAY A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:43.732
AND NEXT I'LL PLAY
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:45.166
NOW...

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.434
SINCE I CAN'T LOSE,

00:12:46.434 --> 00:12:47.936
THERE'S NO HARM
IN SHOWING YOU

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:50.372
THE NEXT CARD
I'M ABOUT TO PLAY, YUGI.

00:12:50.372 --> 00:12:52.540
SO GET READY!

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.309
TA-DA!

00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:55.677
WHEN YOUR TURN STARTS,

00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:57.178
I'LL USE GROUND BREAKING

00:12:57.178 --> 00:13:00.081
TO BRING BACK ONE OF
MY SPIRIT MONSTERS!

00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:03.585
A LITTLE CRITTER KNOWN AS
INABA WHITE RABBIT!

00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:06.121
HE POSSESSES
700 ATTACK POINTS,

00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:08.323
WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO WIPE YOU OUT!

00:13:08.323 --> 00:13:10.425
SO ONCE HE
ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY,

00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:13.995
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:16.331
NOW MAKE
YOUR FINAL MOVE, YUGI!

00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:20.802
YOU HAVEN'T
WON THIS YET, NOAH!

00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:22.604
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.773
GO, GROUND BREAKING!

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:26.841
THIS BRINGS
MY INABA WHITE RABBIT

00:13:26.841 --> 00:13:29.244
RIGHT BACK TO MY HAND.

00:13:29.244 --> 00:13:30.845
BUT NOT FOR LONG!

00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:34.315
I ACTIVATE
CARD DESTRUCTION!

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:36.251
NOW YOU MUST DISCARD
YOUR ENTIRE HAND,

00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:38.553
INCLUDING
YOUR WHITE RABBIT.

00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:40.655
THEN DRAW
4 MORE CARDS!

00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:42.857
IT ALL STOPS HERE!

00:13:42.857 --> 00:13:44.659
MAGICIAN
OF BLACK CHAOS...

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:48.163
DESTROY HIS FACEDOWN
MONSTER!

00:13:48.163 --> 00:13:49.764
SORRY, YUGI!

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:53.768
BUT YOU'VE JUST
ACTIVATED OTOHIME'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:53.768 --> 00:13:55.737
SO FEAST YOUR EYES
ON THIS!

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.806
OTOHIME...

00:13:57.806 --> 00:13:58.940
TARGET YUGI'S
DARK MAGICIAN

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.309
AND SWITCH HIM
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:04.746
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'LL BE ATTACKING ME
ANY MORE THIS TURN, YUGI!

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:06.948
BUT SINCE YOU DID
MANAGE TO DESTROY

00:14:06.948 --> 00:14:08.783
ONE OF MY SPIRIT MONSTERS,

00:14:08.783 --> 00:14:11.252
YOU'VE TRIGGERED
YET ANOTHER TRAP CARD!

00:14:11.252 --> 00:14:14.856
VESSEL OF ILLUSION
ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON A MONSTER!

00:14:14.856 --> 00:14:18.793
SO, OTOHIME,
RETURN NOW IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:21.396
YOUR TURN'S OVER,
YUGI!

00:14:21.396 --> 00:14:22.597
AND IT LOOKS TO ME

00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:26.034
LIKE YOU'VE ONLY GOT
ONE FRIEND LEFT DOWN THERE!

00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:27.202
TEA!

00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.503
SOON SHE'LL BE
NOTHING MORE

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:30.405
THAN A STATUE
OF HER FORMER SELF!

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:31.706
IN YOUR DREAMS!

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:33.074
YOU CREEP!

00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:35.243
YUGI'S GONNA
CRUSH YOU!

00:14:35.243 --> 00:14:36.945
THEN HE'LL
SET US ALL FREE!

00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:38.079
YOU GOT THAT!?

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:39.314
TEA!

00:14:39.314 --> 00:14:43.118
AH! I'LL SPARE YOU
FOR ONE MORE TURN, TEA,

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.053
SO YOU CAN WITNESS
YUGI'S DEFEAT

00:14:45.053 --> 00:14:48.590
AND SEE JUST
HOW WRONG YOU ARE
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND!

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.626
SPEAKING OF YOUR DEFEAT...

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:54.395
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC CARD,
CHANGE OF HEART!

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:57.499
IT ALLOWS ME TO CONTROL
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:14:57.499 --> 00:14:59.434
GUESS WHO IS NOW MINE!

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:00.468
NO!

00:15:00.468 --> 00:15:01.836
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:04.005
AND NOW
YOUR FAVORITE MONSTER

00:15:04.005 --> 00:15:06.674
STANDS BY MY SIDE,
YUGI!

00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:10.311
NEXT I SHALL
