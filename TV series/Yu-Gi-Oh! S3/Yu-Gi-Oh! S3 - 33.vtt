Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH..."

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:05.233
THE LAST SEMIFINAL DUEL
WILL NOW BEGIN!

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.768
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT

00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:10.939
WHICH ONE OF OUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
REIGNS SUPREME!

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.941
Serenity:
KEEP FIGHTING,
BIG BROTHER...

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.343
Joey, voice-over:
AND WHERE EXACTLY
AM I ANYWAY?

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.312
RIGHT!

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.414
I'M DREAMIN'
ABOUT KICKIN' BUTT
AT DUEL MONSTERS!

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:21.716
Yugi, voice-over:
EVERYTHING IS RIDING
ON THIS DUEL!

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:25.486
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,
COME FORTH--

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:26.554
HOLD ON, KAIBA!

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:29.190
GO, LIGHTFORCE
SWORD!

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.692
NOW YOUR OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:32.227
IS COMPLETELY
USELESS TO YOU

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:33.962
FOR 3 TURNS,
KAIBA!

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:35.897
LULLABY OF OBEDIENCE!

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:39.867
THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME TO TAKE
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.769
REVEAL...EXCHANGE!

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:42.870
WHAT?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.838
I BELIEVE
YOU OWE ME A CARD.

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:51.179
SLIFER'S IN MY HAND,
THANKS TO YOU.

Yami-Yugi:
THANK YOU, KAIBA.

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:55.810
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WAS BURIED
DEEP IN MY DECK

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.813
UNTIL YOUR MAGIC CARD
BROUGHT IT OUT!

00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:02.050
AND NOW
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
IS IN MY HAND

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.685
WAITING TO BE SUMMONED
TO THE FIELD

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:05.753
SO IT CAN DESTROY YOU!

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:08.122
Kaiba, voice-over:
IT MAY BE IN
HIS POSSESSION FOR NOW,

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:12.560
BUT EVENTUALLY ALL
3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
WILL BELONG TO ME!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.696
AND SPEAKING
OF EGYPTIAN GODS,

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.098
MY OBELISK THE TORMENTOR
WILL BE FREE

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:20.868
TO GRACE THIS DUEL
WITH ITS PRESENCE
IN TWO MORE TURNS...

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:24.038
JUST AS SOON AS YUGI'S
LIGHTFORCE SWORD WEARS OFF.

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:27.542
IN THE MEANTIME
I'LL USE MY XY-DRAGON CANNON

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:31.279
TO DESTROY EVERY ONE
OF YUGI'S MONSTERS...

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.649
SO HE'LL NEVER
GET THE 3 MONSTERS
HE NEEDS TO SACRIFICE

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.085
IN ORDER TO SUMMON SLIFER.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:38.653
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:42.590
WILL BE READY
TO CALL OBELISK TO THE FIELD
TO FINISH YUGI OFF!

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.826
Yugi, voice-over:
I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT!

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.994
THE GOOD NEWS IS...

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:49.263
I WAS ABLE TO GET
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON
INTO MY HAND!

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:50.865
THE BAD NEWS IS...

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:52.800
I HAD TO USE
MY EXCHANGE MAGIC CARD,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.369
WHICH HELPED KAIBA ALSO.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.206
IT ALLOWED HIM
TO PICK ANY CARD
HE WANTED FROM MY HAND.

00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:03.811
AND HE CHOSE
MY LIFE SHAVER CARD!

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:07.648
NOW KAIBA'S HOLDING
A REALLY DANGEROUS
TRAP CARD!

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:09.283
WHEN HE PLAYS IT--

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.719
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY
TURNS IT STAYS FACE DOWN
ON THE FIELD--

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.021
I COULD HAVE TO DISCARD
MOST OF MY HAND!

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:19.427
THAT WOULD GIVE KAIBA
A SERIOUS ADVANTAGE!

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:20.862
SINCE SLIFER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:22.797
DEPEND ON HOW MANY CARDS
I'M HOLDING...

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:24.499
IF HE WIPES OUT MY HAND,

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.535
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
WILL BE WORTHLESS!

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:29.704
Kaiba: YUGI, ARE YOU
GONNA STAND THERE

00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:32.473
CONTEMPLATING
YOUR NEXT MOVE ALL DAY?

00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:35.410
I'M GETTING BORED.
AND SO ARE MY FANS!

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.279
ALL RIGHT!
HERE GOES!

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:44.051
I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.489
THEN I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.324
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:52.560
Yugi, voice-over:
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.629
SHOULD HOLD OFF
HIS X-Y DRAGON--

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.164
AT LEAST FOR NOW!

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:59.834
THAT MOVE SEEMED
PRETTY DESPERATE TO ME, YUGI.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:04.338
ALL THE DEFENSIVE MONSTERS
IN THE WORLD
CAN'T SAVE YOU NOW!

00:04:04.338 --> 00:04:06.441
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
I MUST SAY,

00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:08.943
THIS DUEL SEEMS
QUITE HOPELESS
FOR THE PHARAOH.

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:13.448
SOON KAIBA
WILL BE FREE TO UNLEASH
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:17.452
AND UNLESS THE PHARAOH
CAN BRING FORTH
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON,

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:21.289
HE'LL BE CRUSHED BY
OBELISK'S MIGHTY
FIST OF FATE!

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.725
AND EVEN IF
HE IS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO OUT-DUEL KAIBA,

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.094
THE PHARAOH
WILL HAVE TO FACE ME...

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:34.769
GIVING ME THE PLEASURE
OF FEEDING HIS SOUL
TO THE SHADOWS!

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:37.638
Serenity:
I CAN'T STAND
WAITING LIKE THIS!

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:39.140
HANG IN THERE, SERENITY.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.675
BUT JOEY NEEDS HELP!

00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.544
AND I PROMISE YOU
HE'S GONNA GET IT!

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.880
TRISTAN AND MOKUBA
ARE WORKING ON IT NOW.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.815
YEAH, BUT IF THEY'VE
BEEN GONE THIS LONG,

00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:49.350
I'M SURE SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.953
Tea: DUKE!
YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:55.656
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T THINK
AN EMERGENCY CHOPPER'S
ON THE WAY, DUKE?

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:56.791
OH, NO!

00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.292
POOR JOEY!

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.228
Duke: YEAH,
HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.

00:05:00.228 --> 00:05:01.796
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:03.698
I MEAN...DON'T WORRY!

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:07.134
HE'LL BE ON HIS FEET
IN NO TIME!

00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:08.769
DUKE'S RIGHT.

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:10.671
WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF
FAITH, SERENITY!

00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:13.841
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANKS, GUYS.

00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:17.445
Tea, voice-over:
I JUST HOPE YUGI'S OK OUT THERE!

00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:25.286
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE'S SAFE!

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:30.258
Announcer:
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP CONTINUES
WITH JOEY WHEELER IN THE LEAD!

00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:31.726
YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:33.828
THIS IS JUST DA CARD
I NEEDED!

00:05:33.828 --> 00:05:37.665
TIME FOR ME TA SUMMON
AXE RAIDER IN ATTACK MODE!

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:41.469
YOUR DRAGON'S HISTORY!

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:48.276
DO YOUR THING, BUDDY!

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:49.377
[JOEY LAUGHS]

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:51.045

00:05:54.248 --> 00:05:55.550
AWESOME!

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.052
I'M KICKIN'
SOME SERIOUS CAN!

00:05:58.052 --> 00:05:59.320

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.657
THEY'RE GONE.

00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:03.658
DAT'S WEIRD.

00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:05.226
IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE GUYS

00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:07.662
TO JUST WALK OUT ON ME
DURIN' A DUEL!

00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:09.430
I MEAN...WHERE'S DA LOVE?

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.800
GUYS?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.670
ALL RIGHT, NOW
THIS DREAM IS STARTIN'
TO CREEP ME OUT!

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.806
Voice: JOEY...

00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:21.375
I GOTTA WAKE UP!

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:28.643
Mokuba:
THIS IS KAIBA CRAFT 3!

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:30.077
COME IN!
PLEASE COME IN!

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:31.546
STILL NO DICE?

00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:33.214
Mokuba: NOPE.
NOTHING.

00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:35.650
Tristan:
WOULDN'T IT BE FASTER
TO JUST FIX OUR ENGINE?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.385
THE CREW'S WORKING
ON THAT, TOO.

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.387
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THE ENGINE'S
IN BAD SHAPE!

00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:42.356
JOEY CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG!

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:52.800
ODION...

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.836
I WISH YOU WERE AWAKE
TO WITNESS THIS MOMENT WITH ME.

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.905
THE PHARAOH'S ANCIENT STRUGGLE

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.107
IS PLAYING ITSELF OUT
ONCE AGAIN,

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:04.478
5,000 YEARS AFTER
THE CONFLICT FIRST BEGAN.

00:07:04.478 --> 00:07:06.147
ODION...

00:07:06.147 --> 00:07:13.087
EVERYTHING'S HAPPENING
JUST AS THE ANCIENT
SCRIPTURES PREDICTED.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:14.555
Kaiba:
THAT'S THE PHARAOH?

00:07:14.555 --> 00:07:17.091
BUT THAT'S...YUGI!

00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.295
AND THE MONSTER
CARVED ABOVE HIM
IS THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:24.131
ON THE LEFT
IS THE SORCERER
FIGHTING AGAINST HIM.

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:25.466
THAT'S YOU, KAIBA!

00:07:25.466 --> 00:07:28.970
IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY DOUBT,
LOOK AT HIS MONSTER!

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.908
IT'S THE BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:36.444
THE HIEROGLYPHICS READ
THAT THE MIGHTY SORCERER

00:07:36.444 --> 00:07:38.379
MARCHED INTO
THE PHARAOH'S CHAMBER

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.415
AND CHALLENGED HIM
AND HIS LEGION
OF NOBLE MAGICIANS

00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:46.621
TO A LEGENDARY DUEL
WITH THE FATE OF
THE WORLD AT STAKE.

00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:48.522
NOW ARE YOU
CONVINCED, KAIBA?

00:07:48.522 --> 00:07:51.626
AS I SAID BEFORE,
HISTORY IS DESTINED
TO REPEAT ITSELF!

00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:53.094
IT'S NOT JUST
COINCIDENCE

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:55.029
THAT YUGI IS YOUR
GREATEST OPPONENT!

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.431
YOU TWO HAVE BATTLED
IN THE ANCIENT PAST!

00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:59.500
THANKS FOR THE LECTURE.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.802
BUT I MAKE
MY OWN DESTINY!

00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:04.238
AND I DO
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:06.107
WAIT, KAIBA!

00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:09.477
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.
LOOK CLOSELY AND YOU'LL SEE

00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:11.946
THE MOST POWERFUL CREATURES
IN DUEL MONSTERS.

00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:14.382
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:16.784
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:08:16.784 --> 00:08:18.719
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA.

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:21.689
CONTROL ONE
AND YOU CAN DESTROY
A MILLION ARMIES.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:25.293
WIELD ALL 3
AND THE PLANET ITSELF
WILL QUAKE IN FEAR!

00:08:25.293 --> 00:08:26.961
AND PEGASUS
TURNED THEM INTO CARDS?

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:28.529
YES!
YOU LIE!

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:32.033
IF HE HAD THEM,
WHY DIDN'T HE USE THEM
AGAINST ME?

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:35.636
BECAUSE PEGASUS
FEARED THE POWER OF THESE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:39.874
YOU CANNOT FATHOM
THE MAGICAL ENERGY
CONTAINED WITHIN.

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:43.044
PEGASUS COULD NOT CONTROL
THE POWER OF THE CARDS
HE CREATED.

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:48.683
THEY THREATENED
TO OVERWHELM
AND DESTROY HIM!

00:08:48.683 --> 00:08:50.451
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU,
KAIBA.

00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:51.886
TAKE IT.

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.587
CAN IT BE?

00:08:53.587 --> 00:08:55.923
IT'S OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR!

00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:56.924
YES.

00:08:56.924 --> 00:08:58.559
THE ONLY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:01.028
THAT WASN'T STOLEN BY
RARE HUNTERS!

00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:04.565
YOU MAY BORROW THIS CARD
FOR YOUR TOURNAMENT,
BUT I EXPECT IT BACK.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:07.635
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
A CARD THIS RARE
IS HANDED TO ME.

00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:10.171
WHAT IF I CHOSE
TO KEEP IT FOREVER?

00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.673
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I CAN BE TRUSTED?

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:16.811
I COULD WALK OUT
AND YOU'D NEVER
SEE IT AGAIN.

00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:22.216
YOU WILL RETURN
THE CARD TO ME.

00:09:22.216 --> 00:09:25.152
Ishizu, voice-over: IT IS
YUGI AND KAIBA'S CONNECTION
TO THE ANCIENT PAST

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:28.689
THAT ALLOWS THEM EACH TO WIELD
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:33.227
HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME
OF THIS ANCIENT FEUD
IS STILL UNCERTAIN,

00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:34.795
FOR NOWHERE IS IT WRITTEN

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:36.797
HOW THE CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE GREAT PHARAOH

00:09:36.797 --> 00:09:39.734
AND THE MYSTICAL SORCERER
FINALLY ENDED.

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:41.569
NO ONE LIVING TODAY

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:46.474
KNOWS WHICH ONE OF THESE
TWO ANCIENT LEADERS
WAS VICTORIOUS.

00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:49.777
SO ALL I CAN DO
AT THIS TIME IS WAIT...

00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:52.813
AND HOPE THAT LIGHT
WILL SHINE ONCE AGAIN

00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:57.284
AND MANKIND WILL BE SAVED
FROM THE IMPENDING DARKNESS.

00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:04.285
Crowd:
KAIBA! KAIBA! KAIBA!

00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:07.755
Kaiba:
LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT YOU
BACKED INTO A CORNER!

00:10:07.755 --> 00:10:10.591
Yami-Yugi:
LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING!
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.327
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?
ANXIOUS TO LOSE?

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:16.330
SUIT YOURSELF.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.032
Kaiba, voice-over:
EXCELLENT!

00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:20.735
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
TO COMPLETE MY STRATEGY

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:22.870
AND YUGI'S ANNIHILATION!

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.806
[KAIBA LAUGHS]

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:28.109
I PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN!

00:10:28.109 --> 00:10:29.977
Yugi, voice-over:
I'LL BET KAIBA JUST PLAYED

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.047
THE LIFE SHAVER TRAP CARD
HE GOT FROM ME!

00:10:33.047 --> 00:10:35.283
AND THE WORST PART
COMES NOW!

00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:37.285
THE WORST PART
FOR YOU, THAT IS!

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:43.391
I SUMMON
Z-METAL TANK
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:48.562
THAT'S THE FINAL CREATURE
I NEEDED TO COMPLETE
MY ULTIMATE MACHINE MONSTER!

00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:52.366
NOW MY BEAST
WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!

00:10:52.366 --> 00:10:54.368
JUST WATCH.

00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:10.985
BEHOLD MY XYZ-DRAGON CANNON!

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:13.354
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
MOST IMPRESSIVE, KAIBA.

00:11:13.354 --> 00:11:17.458
NOW I CAN SEE
HOW YOU WERE ABLE
TO DEFEAT MY SISTER.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:20.828
Kaiba: SAY FAREWELL
TO YOUR BIG SHIELD GARDNA!

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:23.831
NOW, XYZ-DRAGON CANNON,
ATTACK HIS MONSTER!

00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:35.977
THAT'S ONE MONSTER DOWN
AND ONE TO GO!

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:38.312
THEN I CAN SACRIFICE
MY DRAGON CANNON

00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:42.383
TO UNLEASH THE FURY
OF MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:11:42.383 --> 00:11:43.417
THANK YOU.

00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:46.020
DESTROYING ONE
OF MY DEFENSIVE MONSTERS

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.923
IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD DO, KAIBA.

00:11:48.923 --> 00:11:50.157
WHY'S THAT?

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:52.827
BECAUSE YOU ALLOWED ME
TO PLAY THIS!

00:11:52.827 --> 00:11:54.061
BEHOLD!

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:56.497
I REVEAL
MY FACE DOWN CARD!

00:11:56.497 --> 00:11:59.400
SOUL ROPE TRAP!

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.636
AT A COST OF 1000
OF MY LIFE POINTS,

00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:04.138
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON

00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:06.741
ANY 4-STAR MONSTER
DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD

00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:09.276
WHENEVER ONE OF MY
CREATURES IS DESTROYED.

00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:15.216
AND I CHOOSE
KING'S KNIGHT!

00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:17.118
OBSERVE, KAIBA,

00:12:17.118 --> 00:12:19.620
NOW I HAVE BOTH KING'S
AND QUEEN'S KNIGHT!

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.055
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:12:21.055 --> 00:12:22.256
BOTH CARDS!

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:23.457
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:25.126
WHICH MEANS
I CAN NOW SUMMON

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:26.627
JACK'S KNIGHT
TO THE FIELD!

00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:29.130
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
3 MONSTERS!

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.732
I SEE YOU'RE
PAYING ATTENTION, KAIBA!

00:12:31.732 --> 00:12:33.968
I'LL SOON HAVE
EXACTLY WHAT I NEED

00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.170
TO SUMMON
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.173
JACK'S KNIGHT,
COME FORTH!

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:47.415
Yami-Yugi: THANKS TO YOU,

00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:50.317
I NOW HAVE 3 MONSTERS
TO SACRIFICE!

00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:54.455
YOU CAN'T PLAY
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
BEFORE I PLAY MINE!

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:57.158
I'VE BEEN IN CONTROL
OF THIS DUEL
FROM THE START!

00:12:57.158 --> 00:12:58.325
NOT ANYMORE!

00:12:58.325 --> 00:12:59.727
AND NOW...

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:02.696
I SACRIFICE ALL 3
OF MY MONSTERS!

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:04.698
BE GONE NOW!

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.307
AND NEXT...

00:13:13.307 --> 00:13:16.243
I SUMMON
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:18.779
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:46.507
STARE INTO THE FACE
OF DEFEAT, KAIBA!

00:13:46.507 --> 00:13:48.008
Tea: HEY...GUYS?

00:13:48.008 --> 00:13:49.543
CHECK IT OUT!

00:13:49.543 --> 00:13:51.946
SUMMONED BY THE HAND
OF THE PHARAOH...

00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:54.849
THE FIRST EGYPTIAN GOD
HAS ARRIVED!

00:13:54.849 --> 00:13:56.684
HOW UNEXPECTED.

00:13:56.684 --> 00:13:58.886
THE PHARAOH
BROUGHT FORTH SLIFER

00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:00.821
BEFORE KAIBA
SUMMONED OBELISK!

00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:03.224
I'M NOT IMPRESSED, YUGI!

00:14:03.224 --> 00:14:04.859
AND WHY NOT?

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:08.429
I MANAGED TO SUMMON
ONE OF DUEL MONSTERS'
MOST POWERFUL CREATURES!

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:11.132
THAT MAY BE.

00:14:11.132 --> 00:14:13.701
BUT IT DOES
HAVE ITS WEAKNESSES.

00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:17.037
FOR INSTANCE,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:14:17.037 --> 00:14:19.807
ARE EQUAL
TO 1,000 TIMES
THE NUMBER OF CARDS

00:14:19.807 --> 00:14:21.809
YOU'RE HOLDING
IN YOUR HAND, YUGI,

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:24.044
AND I COUNT 3--

00:14:24.044 --> 00:14:27.915
GIVING YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD
CARD ONLY 3,000 POINTS!

00:14:27.915 --> 00:14:28.949
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:31.452
WHICH MAKES IT 200
ATTACK POINTS STRONGER

00:14:31.452 --> 00:14:33.687
THAN YOUR
XYZ-DRAGON CANNON!

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:37.124
SO I CAN ELIMINATE
YOUR CANNON RIGHT NOW,

00:14:37.124 --> 00:14:40.127
LEAVING YOU WITHOUT
A SINGLE MONSTER

00:14:40.127 --> 00:14:45.132
AND PREVENTING YOU FROM
SUMMONING YOUR GOD CARD!

00:14:45.132 --> 00:14:47.234
IF YOU'RE SO SURE,
THEN ATTACK!

00:14:47.234 --> 00:14:49.403
Yugi, voice-over: HE'S
DEFINITELY UP TO SOMETHING.

00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:53.240
KAIBA SEEMS PRETTY CONFIDENT
THAT HIS XYZ-DRAGON CANNON

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.844
CAN SURVIVE AN ATTACK BY
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:59.513
BUT HIS MONSTER ONLY HAS
2,800 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:59.513 --> 00:15:02.316
AND MY SLIFER HAS 3,000!

00:15:02.316 --> 00:15:05.119
I BET I WAS RIGHT
AND HIS FACE DOWN CARD

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:07.621
IS THE LIFE SHAVER TRAP
HE TOOK FROM ME!

00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:10.024
SINCE IT'S BEEN
ON THE FIELD FOR ONE TURN,

00:15:10.024 --> 00:15:13.127
KAIBA CAN USE IT
TO ELIMINATE ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND!

00:15:13.127 --> 00:15:14.929
AND SINCE MY SLIFER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:17.131
DEPEND ON HOW MANY CARDS
I'M HOLDING,

00:15:17.131 --> 00:15:18.966
IT'LL GO DOWN TO 2,000,

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.169
MAKING IT WEAKER
THAN KAIBA'S MONSTER!

00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:25.506
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
THE PHARAOH MAY HAVE
SUMMONED AN EGYPTIAN GOD,

00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:28.442
BUT HE SEEMS HESITANT
TO USE IT.

00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:30.978
KAIBA HAS HIM
QUESTIONING HIS STRATEGY

00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:34.381
WITH JUST ONE
FACEDOWN CARD!

00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:38.118
DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:40.287
WHETHER YOU ATTACK ME
OR NOT, YUGI?

00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:42.289
Yugi, voice-over: IF I DON'T
ATTACK KAIBA RIGHT NOW,

00:15:42.289 --> 00:15:45.726
HE'LL SACRIFICE HIS MONSTER
AND SUMMON OBELISK!

00:15:45.726 --> 00:15:48.395
BUT IF I DO,
HE COULD DESTROY MY SLIFER,

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.831
AND WITHOUT IT
I'LL NEVER WIN THIS DUEL!

00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:53.834
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.168
WHAT'S WRONG, YUGI?

00:15:58.168 --> 00:15:59.836
IS THE PRESSURE
GETTING TO YOU?

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:01.471
I TOLD YOU,

00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:03.073
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU ATTACK ME OR NOT!

00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:05.075
EITHER WAY,
I'VE GOT YOU BEAT...

00:16:05.075 --> 00:16:07.311
THANKS TO MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:09.413
SO GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOU MOVE!

00:16:09.413 --> 00:16:11.548
Yugi, voice-over:
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST PLAY IT SAFE

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:13.383
AND END MY TURN.

00:16:13.383 --> 00:16:15.519
NO! I CAN'T BACK DOWN!

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.957
SLIFER,
ATTACK HIS MONSTER NOW!

00:16:19.957 --> 00:16:27.531
Kaiba, voice-over:
IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.266
NOT SO FAST, YUGI!

00:16:29.266 --> 00:16:32.536
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:34.404
THAT'S NOT LIFE SHAVER!

00:16:34.404 --> 00:16:36.640
BUT WHAT IS IT?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.010
IT'S CALLED INTER-DIMENSIONAL
MATTER TRANSPORTER!

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.915
JUST WATCH WHAT IT CAN DO!

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:46.917
[KAIBA LAUGHS]

00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:57.160
IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING MAJOR'S
GOING ON UP THERE!

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.329
HMM? ODION!

00:16:59.329 --> 00:17:03.066
SLIFER HAS JUST ATTACKED!

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.901
WHAT WAS THAT
FLASH OF LIGHT?

00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.503
I'M NOT SO SURE...

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:09.606
BUT OUR TRANSMISSION SIGNAL
IS STRONGER NOW!

00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:12.976
Man on radio: THIS IS
KAIBA CORP HEADQUARTERS
RESPONDING, OVER.

00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:15.646
WE RECEIVED
YOUR DISTRESS SIGNAL

00:17:15.646 --> 00:17:18.949
AND AN EMERGENCY HELICOPTER
IS BEING DISPATCHED MOMENTARILY.

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:21.118
OH, YEAH!
IT WORKED!

00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:25.589
Man, on radio: COPTER ONE
CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.060
SET YOUR COURSE
FOR KAIBA CORP ISLAND.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.695
IT'S ON ITS WAY RIGHT NOW!

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:33.130
JOEY'S GONNA GET HELP!

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.731
I'LL GO TELL
SERENITY!

00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:37.134
HA HA HA!

00:17:37.134 --> 00:17:39.503
I WONDER
IF I CAN TRANSMIT VIDEO...

00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:41.438
GUESS IT'S WORTH A SHOT!

00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:44.975
LOOKS LIKE I CAN WATCH
SETO'S DUEL NOW!

00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:47.978
AND SO CAN THE ENTIRE CITY!

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.818
Man: WHOA!

00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:56.319
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I SEE?
HEY!

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.721
WHAT IS THAT?

00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.056
LOOK,
IT'S A MONSTER, MOM.

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.057
WHOA!

00:18:00.057 --> 00:18:01.625
THAT MUST BE A DUEL!

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.860
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR CANNON, KAIBA?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.995
TELL ME!

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:06.697
HA HA HA!

00:18:06.697 --> 00:18:10.434
MY TRAP CARD WAS ABLE
TO TAKE IT OUT OF PLAY
FOR ONE TURN!

00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:11.902
VERY CLEVER.

00:18:11.902 --> 00:18:13.637
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PLAN

00:18:13.637 --> 00:18:15.939
TO SAVE YOUR MONSTER
FROM MY ATTACK WORKED!

00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:17.874
WELL,
I'VE ALSO GOT A PLAN,

00:18:17.874 --> 00:18:22.312
SO I'LL PLAY THIS
FACE DOWN.

00:18:22.312 --> 00:18:24.014
NOW GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE,

00:18:24.014 --> 00:18:26.016
IF YOU DARE!

00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:28.051
WHAT'S WRONG, KAIBA?

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.153
DID I CONFUSE YOU?

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:33.790
Kaiba, voice-over:
YUGI JUST LOWERED
HIS MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.992
BY PLAYING A CARD
FROM HIS HAND!

00:18:35.992 --> 00:18:39.663
WHY WOULD HE INTENTIONALLY
WEAKEN HIS OWN MONSTER?

00:18:39.663 --> 00:18:42.232
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

00:18:42.232 --> 00:18:44.301
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR ADORING FANS

00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.937
ARE EAGERLY WAITING
FOR YOU TO MAKE
A DECISION, KAIBA!

00:18:46.937 --> 00:18:49.806
SLIFER IS WEAKER
THAN YOUR MONSTER NOW.

00:18:49.806 --> 00:18:51.508
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:18:51.508 --> 00:18:53.143
I'M WIDE OPEN.

00:18:53.143 --> 00:18:56.046
YOU CAN ATTACK ME
WITH YOUR CANNON,
RIGHT, KAIBA?

00:18:56.046 --> 00:18:58.048
UNLESS...
YOU'RE AFRAID TO ATTACK!

00:18:58.048 --> 00:19:01.051
HA! YOUR SCARE TACTICS
WON'T WORK

00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:02.919
'CAUSE I KNOW
WHAT I HAVE TO DO!

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:06.223
THE TIME HAS COME!

00:19:06.223 --> 00:19:08.125
AND YOUR TIME'S UP.

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:10.460
YOUR LIGHTFORCE SWORD
IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.799
SO MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS FREE NOW!

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:18.001
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NEXT.

00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:24.241
NOW I SACRIFICE
MY XYZ-DRAGON CANNON...

00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.977
SO I CAN SUMMON THIS!

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:29.946
COME FORTH NOW,
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!

00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:41.625
USE YOUR INFINITE POWER
TO BRING ME VICTORY!

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.727
IT'S OVER, YUGI!

00:19:43.727 --> 00:19:49.800
[KAIBA LAUGHS]

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.401
Yami-Yugi:
WHERE IS IT!?

00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:52.636
LOOK CLOSELY.

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:56.573
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:56.573 --> 00:19:59.576
Yugi, voice-over:
HERE IT COMES!

00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:11.822
MY MIGHTY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS HERE AT LAST!

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:15.959
THE BATTLE OF THE GODS
HAS BEGUN!

00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:19.663
BUT WHICH ONE
WILL PREVAIL?

00:20:19.663 --> 00:20:21.631
Yugi, voice-over:
I HOPE I CAN HOLD MY OWN

00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:24.100
AGAINST THE POWER
OF OBELISK!

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.136
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT GOING TO BE EASY!

00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:28.905
HE'S TWICE AS STRONG
AS MY SLIFER!

00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:36.880
YUGI, THE EGYPTIAN GODS
ARE ABOUT TO CLASH...

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.218
BUT ONLY ONE MONSTER
WILL REMAIN STANDING!

00:20:41.218 --> 00:20:44.221
NOW IT'S TIME
TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE!

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:45.222
