Yami-Yugi:
PREVIOUSLY ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:02.829 --> 00:00:06.466
Roland: THE FIRST DUEL
OF THE SEMIFINALS IS
ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.037
THE TIME HAS COME
TO TAKE THIS DUEL
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:11.705
I'M READY FOR
YOUR SHADOW GAME!

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.740
I DECIDED TO RAISE
THE STAKES

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.576
BY ADDING THESE ENERGY
STREAMS TO OUR GAME.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.212
NOW WHENEVER YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACKED,

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:22.082
YOUR BODY WILL BE DRAINED
OF A LITTLE MORE ENERGY.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.316
TIME TO ATTACK!

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:25.552
SLICE AND DICE
HIS HELPOEMER!

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:28.522
YOU ACTIVATED MY MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:30.424
WHAT'S ITS SPECIAL
ABILITY!?

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:32.559
IT'S IN YOUR
GRAVEYARD NOW!

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.627
OH MAN!

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.395
FOR AS LONG AS MY HELPOEMER

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:37.564
REMAINS IN
YOUR CARD GRAVEYARD...

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:39.332
YOU'LL LOSE ONE CARD
EVERY TURN!

00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:41.401
IF HE KEEPS LOSING
CARDS FROM HIS HAND,

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.203
JOEY'LL NEVER
BEAT MARIK!

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:44.838
I'M AFRAID
YOUR FATE WILL BE

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:47.708

Serenity: THAT'S
THE SAME DARK CLOUD

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.183
THAT SURROUNDED US
DURING MAI'S DUEL!

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:05.218
OH NO!

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:11.057
THAT MEANS MY BROTHER
AND MARIK ARE FIGHTING
A SHADOW DUEL!

00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:13.593
Yami-Marik: YOU COULD
USE A REST, LITTLE JOEY!

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:16.029
Joey: AND YOU COULD
USE A HAIRCUT, SO
WHAT'S YOUR POINT!?

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.431
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND...?

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.801
THANKS TO THESE
DARK ENERGY STREAMS,

00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.403
EVERY TIME
YOUR MONSTERS
ARE ATTACKED,

00:02:23.403 --> 00:02:26.139
YOUR BODY IS DRAINED
OF STRENGTH!

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.041
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT CARD

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.776
MARIK STUCK IN
JOEY'S GRAVEYARD?

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:33.780
IT REMOVES ONE CARD
FROM JOEY'S HAND...
WITH EVERY TURN!

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.882
SOME OF HIS BEST
CARDS COULD BE
DESTROYED

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:37.684
BEFORE HE GETS
TO USE THEM!

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:41.254
IT'S MY MOVE! FAREWELL!

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:44.124
AH...
MY COFFIN SELLER
TRAP CARD.

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:47.127
NOW I HAVE SEVERAL
TRAPS ON THE FIELD

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:50.964
JUST WAITING TO BE
TRIGGERED BY ONE OF
HIS PATHETIC MONSTERS.

00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:53.967
HA! ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:58.238
IS LURE THIS FOOL
INTO ATTACKING ME
AND HE'S FINISHED!

00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.841
I PLACE TWO CARDS FACEDOWN...

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.876
AND NOW I'LL END MY TURN.

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.045
WHY ISN'T FREAK-BOY
ATTACKIN' ME!?

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:06.346
HE'S GOT
HIS DRILLAGO

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:08.381
ON DA FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.983
AND NO CARDS LEFT
IN HIS HAND!

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:11.284
HMM...

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:14.487
NOT THAT MY CARDS ARE
ANYTHING TO BRAG ABOUT.

00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:17.157
COME ON! I NEED A WINNA!

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:19.392
HERE GOES!

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:22.062
AW YEAH!
IT'S MY INSECT QUEEN!

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:23.897
THERE'S JUST
ONE PROBLEM...

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:25.398
SINCE IT'S
A HIGH LEVEL CARD,

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.734
I GOTTA SACRIFICE
TWO MONSTERS TA PLAY IT!

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.503
DAT'S TOO RISKY
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:35.008
I SUMMON BABY DRAGON
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:03:35.008 --> 00:03:37.844
I BET AT LEAST ONE
'A HIS FACE DOWN CARDS
IS A TRAP!

00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:41.147
AND AS SOON AS I ATTACK,
HE'LL SPRING IT ON ME!

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.716
PROCEED!

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:46.119
THE SHADOWS ARE GROWING
IMPATIENT LITTLE JOEY!

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.555
ARE YOU TOO FRIGHTENED
TO ATTACK ME?

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:51.224
PERHAPS YOU FEAR
MY THREE FACE DOWN CARDS

00:03:51.224 --> 00:03:53.727
AND THE POSSIBLE DEVASTATION
THEY COULD CAUSE.

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.929
I CAN'T LET MARIK
BULLY ME LIKE DIS!

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.964
I'M WAITING...

00:03:57.964 --> 00:03:59.799
DON'T LET HIM
PUSH YOU AROUND!

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.835
YEAH HE WANTS YOU
TO ATTACK HIM!

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.303
YOU CAN'T!

00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:05.438
CAUSE HE'LL JUST
ACTIVATE ONE OF
HIS TRAP CARDS!

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:06.706
MY FRIENDS
HAVE A POINT...

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:08.074
BUT WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:09.643
JUST SIT AROUND
AND WAIT?

00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:10.777
FOR WHAT!?

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:14.014
I'M THROUGH WAITING.
I NEED TA TAKE ACTION!

00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:16.216
WAIT JOEY!
DON'T ATTACK!

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:18.852
NO...
HE SHOULD ATTACK!

00:04:18.852 --> 00:04:20.553
IN ORDER FOR JOEY TO WIN,

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.990
HE MUST FORCE MARIK
TO REVEAL HIS TRAPS RIGHT AWAY.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.393
ONCE JOEY KNOWS WHAT
MARIK'S CARDS ARE,

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:29.496
HE CAN DEVISE A STRATEGY
TO DESTROY THEM!

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:31.531
TAKE HIM DOWN, JOEY!

00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:38.004
ROCKET WARRIOR!
ACTIVATE INVINCIBLE MODE!

00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:39.906
HA HA HA HA!

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:43.543
THAT'S PRECISELY
THE MOVE I WANTED YOU
TO MAKE YOU FOOL!

00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:45.478
FOR YOU HAVE ALLOWED ME
TO ACTIVATE

00:04:45.478 --> 00:04:47.881
MY CARD OF LAST WILL!

00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:50.083
NOW I CAN DRAW FIVE CARDS!

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.418
HMM.

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:52.419
AW MAN!

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.721
LOOKS LIKE MY HAND IS FULL!

00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:58.325
NOW WHICH OF MY NEW CARDS
SHOULD I USE AGAINST YOU FIRST?

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:00.527
LET'S SEE...

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:01.628
HMM.

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:04.631
I'VE DRAWN
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:06.466
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.401
JOEY!
COME ON!

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:11.271

WAIT! HOLD ON
YOU GUYS!

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.287
MARIK'S UP TO
SOMETHING!

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:28.555
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:32.726
NOOOW I ACTIVATE THE TRAP CARD,
COFFIN SELLER!

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:34.694
WHAT!?

00:05:34.694 --> 00:05:36.663
NOW EACH TIME
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:05:36.663 --> 00:05:38.298
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:39.833
300 LIFE POINTS

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:41.835
ARE DEDUCTED FROM YOUR TOTAL!

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:43.737
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:44.804
NO WAY!

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:47.207
YES AND THERE'S MORE!

00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:50.677
MUCH MORE!
REMEMBER HELPOEMER!?

00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:55.248
IT'S DAT MONSTA
HE PUT IN MY
GRAVEYARD!

00:05:55.248 --> 00:05:57.450
IT JUST TOOK
MY INSECT QUEEN!

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.386
DAT WAS
THE BEST CARD
IN MY HAND!

00:05:59.386 --> 00:06:03.223
NOW I LOSE
300 LIFE POINTS!

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:05.058
IT'S OVER FOR YOU!

00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:07.394
I'VE DEVISED
A FOOLPROOF SYSTEM

00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:09.729
OF DEPLETING YOUR
LIFE POINTS EACH TURN

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.166
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO
ANYTHING AT ALL!

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:15.068
I'M AFRAID HE'S RIGHT!

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:17.404
JOEY LOSES ONE CARD
EACH TURN,

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:20.473
AND IF THAT CARD'S A MONSTER
HE LOSES LIFE POINTS!

00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:22.142
THAT'S NOT GOOD!

00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:25.211
AND DON'T FORGET
THAT MY PLASMA EEL

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:27.547
IS STILL ATTACHED TO
YOUR PANTHER WARRIOR

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.749
WHICH LOWERS ITS ATTACK
POINTS EVEN MORE!

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:32.652
AAH!

00:06:32.652 --> 00:06:34.854
MY MOVE... AT LAST!

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.890
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.796
FIRST I'LL PLACE THIS CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.331
AND THEN I'LL ACTIVATE THIS!

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:47.867
PREMATURE BURIAL!

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.403
THIS ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON ANY MONSTER

00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:52.305
THAT RESIDES
IN THE GRAVEYARD!

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.240
WHAT 'A YA
BRINGIN' BACK!?

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.976
ONCE I GIVE UP
800 LIFE POINTS...

00:06:56.976 --> 00:06:58.645
I SHALL REVIVE DRILLAGO

00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:01.147
FROM MY CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:07:01.147 --> 00:07:02.582
BUT THERE'S STILL MORE!

00:07:02.582 --> 00:07:05.552
NEXT I'LL SACRIFICE DRILLAGO!

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:11.791
SO I CAN BRING FORTH THIS CARD!

00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:14.394
WHAT IS THAT!?

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:22.198
I'VE SUMMONED
AN UNSTOPPABLE CREATURE

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:24.333
KNOWN AS LEGENDARY FIEND!

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:27.603
Joey:
WAIT! HE'S ONLY GOT
1500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:07:27.603 --> 00:07:31.307
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE!

00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:34.944
HUH? AND JUST WHATTA YA
MEAN BY DAT, MARIK!?

00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:36.679
HA HA HA HA!

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:38.581
MY BEAST GETS STRONGER!

00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:41.717
BY 700 ATTACK POINTS
EACH TURN!

00:07:41.717 --> 00:07:43.285
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:46.255
IF YOU DARE!

00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:49.258
JOEY STILL HAS
WAY MORE LIFE POINTS
THAN MARIK DOES

00:07:49.258 --> 00:07:50.626
SO I'M NOT
TOO WORRIED!

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:53.362
WHILE THAT MAY BE THE CASE
TRISTAN...

00:07:53.362 --> 00:07:55.164
... LIFE POINTS
AREN'T EVERYTHING!

00:07:55.164 --> 00:07:57.833
MARIK'S TOTALLY GOT
DA UPPA HAND
IN DIS DUEL!

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.502
IF ONLY I HAD
MY JINZO

00:07:59.502 --> 00:08:01.070
I COULD DESTROY
ALL HIS TRAPS!

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.839
BUT DAT CARD'S
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:08.110
IF I DON'T DRAW
SOMETHIN' GOOD NOW,
I'M A GONER!

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.178
COME ON...

00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:10.279
NOW...!

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.847
LITTLE WING GUARD!!??

00:08:11.847 --> 00:08:13.182
HE'S TOO WEAK!

AND THE WORLD IS SAVED!

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:28.340

JOEY HAS DESTROYED
ALL OF MARIK'S MONSTERS!

00:15:58.804 --> 00:16:01.807
IF HE CAN SUCCESSFULLY ATTACK
MARIK'S LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY

I'LL ONLY BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I SEE IT MOKUBA.

00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:18.824

DARK WALL OF WIND!

00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:43.114
NO WAY!

00:16:43.114 --> 00:16:45.851

00:16:45.851 --> 00:16:48.220

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:17.509
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD DEFEAT ME,
DIDN'T YOU!?

00:17:17.509 --> 00:17:19.911
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT'S NO EASY TASK!

00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.112
GRRRR!

00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:22.514
REMEMBER...

00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:25.984
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND MAI
MADE THE VERY SAME MISTAKE!

00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:28.653
AND YOU KNOW WELL
WHAT FATE BEFELL HER!

00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:31.523
AN ETERNITY OF DARKNESS
AND DESPAIR!

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:36.161
AND YOU'LL SOON JOIN HER!

00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:37.262
DON'T WORRY, MAI.

00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:38.663
WHEREVER YOUR MIND IS

00:17:38.663 --> 00:17:42.033
MY BROTHER'S GONNA
GET IT BACK!

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:44.536
JOEY, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

00:17:44.536 --> 00:17:50.175
AND SO IS MAI!

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:51.609
MY MOVE!

00:17:51.609 --> 00:17:53.344
JUST WHAT I NEEDED!

00:17:53.344 --> 00:17:54.779
GRRR.

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:58.550
I'M ABOUT TO CALL FORTH
AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL BEAST!

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.685
IT'S AN EIGHT-STAR MONSTER

00:18:00.685 --> 00:18:02.120
KNOWN AS LAVA GOLEM!

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.988
SLOW DOWN THERE
COWBOY!

00:18:03.988 --> 00:18:05.823
YOU CAN'T PLAY
A MONSTA DAT STRONG

00:18:05.823 --> 00:18:07.759
WITHOUT MAKIN'
A SACRIFICE FIRST!

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:09.827
HOW PERCEPTIVE OF YOU!

00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:13.164
I HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF MAKING A SACRIFICE!

00:18:13.164 --> 00:18:16.434
LAVA GOLEM ALLOWS ME TO
SACRIFICE TWO MONSTERS

00:18:16.434 --> 00:18:18.269
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:19.604
YOU'RE KIDDIN' ME!

00:18:19.604 --> 00:18:22.006
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:27.545
I SAID LAVA GOLEM STAYS ON
YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:18:27.545 --> 00:18:29.981
MARIK!! WHAT'S DA DEAL!?

00:18:29.981 --> 00:18:31.349
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:34.319
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED
TO RECEIVE A MONSTER

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:37.855
WITH 3000 ATTACK POINTS
LITTLE JOEY!

00:18:37.855 --> 00:18:40.291
YA MEAN
DIS DING IS MINE!?

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:43.027
THAT MONSTER MAY BELONG
TO JOEY NOW...

00:18:43.027 --> 00:18:44.963
BUT IT COMES WITH A PRICE!

00:18:44.963 --> 00:18:47.398
HEY, I DON'T
GET IT, BRO.

00:18:47.398 --> 00:18:49.934
LAVA GOLEM IS NOW
WHEELER'S MONSTER

00:18:49.934 --> 00:18:53.204
SO ALL OF ITS WEAKNESSES
BECOME WHEELER'S PROBLEM.

00:18:53.204 --> 00:18:55.273
JUST WATCH.

00:18:55.273 --> 00:18:56.608
TAKE A LOOK...

00:18:56.608 --> 00:18:58.209
YOUR MONSTER'S
BEGINNING TO MELT!

00:18:58.209 --> 00:18:59.611
SAY WHAT!?

00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:03.548
EACH TURN LAVA GOLEM MELTS
AND YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS!!

00:19:03.548 --> 00:19:04.682
AAH!

00:19:04.682 --> 00:19:06.417
DAT'S HOT!

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:08.653
I SHOULDA PACKED
MY SUNSCREEN.

00:19:08.653 --> 00:19:11.923
AND NOW THAT YOUR JINZO IS
BACK IN THE CARD GRAVEYARD

00:19:11.923 --> 00:19:14.559
I CAN SET AS MANY TRAPS
AS I WANT!

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:18.029
SO I'LL PLACE THIS CARD
FACE DOWN!

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:21.766
NOW THEN...
WHY DON'T YOU ATTACK ME
WITH YOUR MONSTER!?

00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:24.435
HE DOES HAVE
3000 ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:26.437
WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO WIPE ME OUT!

00:19:26.437 --> 00:19:27.872
SO WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR!?

00:19:27.872 --> 00:19:29.107
WELL...

00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:32.610
I MUST SAY, THERE'S NOT
MUCH ELSE YOU CAN DO!

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.012
COME ON!
THINK THIS
THROUGH, MAN!

00:19:34.012 --> 00:19:35.480
STAY CALM!

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.417
EVEN THOUGH LAVA GOLEM
CAUSES JOEY TO LOSE LIFE POINTS,

00:19:39.417 --> 00:19:42.086
IT STILL HAS
3000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:45.089
WHICH MAKES IT POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO HELP JOEY WIN THIS DUEL!

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:47.692
SO WHY WOULD MARIK
GIVE IT TO JOEY?!

00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:50.261
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:19:50.261 --> 00:19:52.864
HA HA HA HA!

00:19:52.864 --> 00:19:54.732
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO SWEAT?

00:19:54.732 --> 00:19:58.202
IT'S QUITE HOT INSIDE
LAVA GOLEM'S CAGE!

00:19:58.202 --> 00:19:59.671
BETTER MAKE A MOVE

00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:02.106
BEFORE YOUR MONSTER
TURNS UP THE HEAT
EVEN MORE!

00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:04.909
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:10.315
STOP!

00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:14.852
Serenity:
YOU'LL BE OK MAI.

00:20:14.852 --> 00:20:16.821
JOEY'S FIGHTING
FOR YOU!

00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:19.257
YOU CAN DO THIS
JOEY!

00:20:19.257 --> 00:20:21.025

00:20:21.025 --> 00:20:22.493

00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:36.174

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.180
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO RESCUE MAI FROM
THE SHADOW REALM!?

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.450
WELL NOW'S YOUR CHANCE!

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.318
ATTACK ME
AND SAVE YOUR FRIEND!
