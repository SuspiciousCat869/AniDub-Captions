( Noah )
So much for the Big Five.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:08.369
I should never have hired
those corporate clowns !

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.873
<i>( Yugi )</i>
<i>Excellent dueling, Téa.</i>

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:11.276
<i>Th-Thanks, Yugi.</i>

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.251
How could they be out-dueled by
these two in a virtual world

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.089
where I make all the rules ?

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:19.129
If you want something done right
you have to do it yourself,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.936
so perhaps it's
time for me to step in.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.443
I'll make sure they never
leave this place.

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:28.519
<i>On behalf of myself and</i>
<i>the Big Five,</i>

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:31.627
<i>I want to offer you our</i>
<i>most sincere apologies, Noah.</i>

00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:33.064
Johnson, please.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:35.637
<i>Let me explain...</i>
There's nothing to explain.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.943
You five failed me
for the last time.

00:01:37.943 --> 00:01:39.848
Now you're all fired.

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:41.351
<i>Just hear me out, sir.</i>

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.191
Your slick lawyer talk won't get
you out of this one, Johnson,

00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.863
so don't
even try it.

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:48.669
So far your partners Gansley
and Crump each suffered

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.140
an embarrassing defeat,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.913
so why should I believe
the rest of you won't fail ?

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.618
I have no choice,
Johnson.

00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:57.324
I must
dispose of you all.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:59.797
<i>Please, Noah,</i>
<i>don't do it !</i>

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:01.668
<i>We've analyzed our</i>
<i>attack patterns</i>

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:03.840
<i>and we've come up with</i>
<i>a solid dueling strategy</i>

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.248
<i>that is guaranteed to bring</i>
<i>us success, sir !</i>

00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:09.388
<i>Understand my position.</i>

00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:12.060
<i>The Big Five are desperate</i>
<i>to defeat these brats.</i>

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.400
<i>It's the only way we</i>
<i>can take over their bodies</i>

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.371
<i>and leave the cyber world</i>
<i>behind !</i>

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.942
<i>We can't</i>
<i>let them win !</i>

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.212
Very well.

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:21.685
I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourselves.

00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:22.955
Don't let me down.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.725
<i>You won't be sorry !</i>

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:25.761
No...

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.398
Cause if they fail
me again...

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.170
He will be
the sorry one.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.910
Their failures are a
reflection of me.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.915
And I can't allow
Yugi and his friends

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.989
to make me look like
a failure !

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.462
<i>( Mokuba )</i>
<i>We have to find</i>
<i>a way out of here !</i>

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:41.433
And as for you,
Seto...

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.207
Your power
will soon be mine !

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:46.412
Kaiba Craft Three,
do you read me ?

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:47.882
Is anyone out there ?

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:49.019
Still can't
get through ?

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.022
What's the deal ?

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:51.325
Listen...

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:54.632
This place was designed to
isolate us from outside contact,

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.838
but that won't
stop me !

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:59.344
Let's go, Mokuba.

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:02.920
All right,
you old dudes !

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.190
Show yourselves !

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.292
Hear me ?

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.164
I'll kick your
big business backsides !

00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:09.637
I'm tired of waiting for you
suit-wearing, deal-making,

00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:11.407
pencil-necked geeks !

00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:14.582
Man, where is
everybody ?

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.687
I'm sick of dis place !

00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:22.902
Cheap walls.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:26.812
Whoa--
Real cheap walls !

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:27.915
Check it out !

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:29.152
It's' some kinda
door !

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:31.959
Maybe I should
just knock... Nah !

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:34.632
Jackpot, baby !

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:36.469
I found the blimp !

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.312
So here we come,
real world !

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:42.952
I bet the gang's
already inside !

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.261
Hey--
Anyone here ?

00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:47.397
Guess not.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:49.869
It's like
a ghost town.

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.211
The door to Mai's room
is open !

00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:56.219
That Marik freak betta be
keeping his distance from her !

00:04:00.897 --> 00:04:02.868
Mai...

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:07.446
Alright my dear, enjoy your trip
to the Shadow Realm !

00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:12.626
( Joey )
Mai !

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:16.335
Tell me what you
did to her now, Marik !

00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:18.508
I'm gonna get your
mind back.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.781
I promise, you'll be
duelin' again in no time !

00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:24.756
Mai, you're back !

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:25.791
But how ?

00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:26.895
I mean...
you were...

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:29.735
I don't
believe it !

00:04:31.273 --> 00:04:33.010
What's up ?

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.917
( Johnson's voice )
Why you're even less intelligent
than you look, Joseph.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.521
Don't you know
where you are ?

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.091
Nothing's real here !

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.428
Who are you anyway ?

00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:43.736
Tell me now !

00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:47.613
I shoulda known
it was one of you !

00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:48.950
Johnson's the name.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.590
Attorney-at-law and
former chief legal advisor

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.998
for the Kaiba Corporation
at your service, sir.

00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:58.573
If you would just
take my card, it's all here.

00:04:58.573 --> 00:05:01.046
Save it, sleazeball !
Joseph...

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:03.619
Your presence is requested
at the trial of the century

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.158
so it's in your best interest
to listen to me.

00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:07.262
I...

00:05:07.262 --> 00:05:09.200
Did you say the trial
of the century ?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.703
Who's getting sued ?

00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:15.749
I'm afraid I'm taking you to
court so I can claim your body.

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.556
See, defeating you is my
only means of escape

00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:20.193
from this
virtual holding cell

00:05:20.193 --> 00:05:22.432
and I've never lost a
case in my life.

00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:25.473
Well, there's a first
time for everything,

00:05:25.473 --> 00:05:28.080
and there's no way you're
escaping to the real world

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.817
in my body, bud !

00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:31.789
Is that so ?

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.894
You'll change your mind
before too long.

00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:38.004
After all, controlling what
people think is what I do best !

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.459
Now allow me to state
the reasons why I deserve

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.731
the right to take control
of your body and--

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:49.834
No !

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.805
Look, I've have
had it with you !

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:54.679
All your talk is making
me dizzy, Johnson !

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.285
Then I'm doing
my job, Joseph.

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:58.756
Well, listen to me !

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:00.660
I say talk is cheap !

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.999
So put your money
where your mouth is !

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.406
Well then, why don't
you take the stand

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.176
so we can
begin this trial ?

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:09.549
Enough with the legal
mumbo jumbo, man !

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:12.389
When you dragged us here you
said we were gonna be dueling,

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.531
so what's all this stuff about
trials and taking the stand ?

00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.767
Good question !

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:19.407
To me the game of
Duel Monsters is like a trial.

00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:20.844
Observe...

00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:23.116
Hey-- Why's the room
spinning, Johnson ?

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:27.527
I'm taking you to our
dueling site, of course.

00:06:27.527 --> 00:06:32.038
And now my friend, justice
can be served.

00:06:32.038 --> 00:06:33.976
What's goi''
on here ?

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.683
I told you Duel Monsters
is like a trial,

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:38.754
so where better to
duel than in a courtroom ?

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:39.891
And when you lose,

00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:42.029
you'll be sentenced
to spend eternity here !

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:44.168
I won't lose, Johnson !

00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:45.772
I think you'll
change your tune

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.513
once you've had the opportunity
to meet my deck master

00:06:48.513 --> 00:06:50.350
so please be seated.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.828
The honorable
Judge Man presiding !

00:06:54.828 --> 00:06:57.468
It is an improvement...

00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:00.141
But it's not gonna
help you win this duel !

00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:01.411
Order !

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:03.483
One more outburst like that
and I'm holding you

00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:04.753
in contempt of court !

00:07:04.753 --> 00:07:07.927
Is that clear, Joseph ?

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.670
This guy's guilty of being
a real pain in the butt !

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.045
The accused will now choose his
deck from the card database

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:17.751
so we can begin this duel.

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:18.821
Cool.

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:20.525
Simply raise your
right hand...

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:22.697
I know !

00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:26.907
This case is closed.

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:28.945
I've researched your
duels extensively

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:33.056
and I know exactly what
cards you'll choose, fool.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:35.328
All right !

00:07:35.328 --> 00:07:36.598
Let's do this !

00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:37.935
Objection !

00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:40.675
Before we begin, you have to
choose a monster from your deck

00:07:40.675 --> 00:07:42.880
to serve as your Deck Master.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.350
Whatever.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.191
This shouldn't be
too hard.

00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:50.265
Folks, we have a winner !

00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:53.940
So... meet my Deck Master
Flame Swordsman !

00:07:57.417 --> 00:08:00.190
As long as this guy's
standing next to me, Judge,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.562
there's no way I can
possibly lose this !

00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:04.534
You have my word as
your Deck Master

00:08:04.534 --> 00:08:07.575
that I will serve you well
and guide you through this duel.

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:09.747
Awesome, he talks !

00:08:09.747 --> 00:08:12.420
I assure you we shall
defeat our opponent.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.464
As you know, I will be acting
as my own Deck Master...

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:20.440
So this court
is now in session !

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:27.057
Since we're in my courtroom,
I'll begin this duel.

00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:28.727
Watch and learn.

00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:33.439
Now, I call Hysteric Angel
to the stand !

00:08:33.439 --> 00:08:37.148
She'll make sure you
get the maximum sentence !

00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:40.089
That is the most annoying
monster I've ever seen !

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:42.227
She looks just
like you do, Johnson !

00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:43.364
Silence !

00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:45.536
It's time to call
your first witness.

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:47.072
Yes, your honor !

00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:48.476
Here goes !

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:50.147
Gearfried,
the Iron Knight !

00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:52.821
If you play that card, I
can increase its attack points

00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:54.224
by decreasing mine.

00:08:54.224 --> 00:08:55.326
Awesome !

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.334
Den I summon Gearfried,
the Iron Night !

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:03.513
And thanks to my Deck Master's
special ability,

00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:06.019
he gets a power boost !

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:09.796
Gearfried-- Attack
his Hysteric Angel, now,

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:11.834
with Metal Forearm Thrust !

00:09:17.749 --> 00:09:20.255
He shoots, he scores !

00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:21.591
Nothing but net !

00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:23.196
Prosecute that,
Judge !

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:26.470
He used his Deck Master's
special ability right away.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.606
Not bad.

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:30.113
But this trial
has just begun !

00:09:30.113 --> 00:09:32.586
My move...

00:09:32.586 --> 00:09:36.896
I'll place this monster facedown
in defense mode and end my turn.

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.970
Big deal, pal.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.043
My Deck Master
rocks !

00:09:42.043 --> 00:09:43.980
I can keep taking
attack points from him

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.620
and adding them to
my monsters.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.494
So what do you say
we try this again, huh ?

00:09:49.494 --> 00:09:50.965
Check this out !

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.203
I summon Little Winguard
in attack mode !

00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:56.812
One more
time, judge !

00:09:56.812 --> 00:09:58.383
I'll move 300
attack points

00:09:58.383 --> 00:10:01.056
from my Deck Master
to my Winguard,

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:04.999
and then I'll use it to
attack your facedown card !

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.052
It looks like you've
destroyed my Skelengel.

00:10:13.052 --> 00:10:14.857
This lets me
draw one card.

00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:17.630
You'll need it...
cause you're outta monsters !

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.635
Which means, I can
do this now !

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:20.872
Gearfried !

00:10:20.872 --> 00:10:23.445
Attack his honor's
life points directly !

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:27.889
So...

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.960
Having fun,
Joseph ?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.434
No, I'm having
a terrible time

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.205
kicking you around
the courtroom !

00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:35.775
Of course
I'm having fun

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:38.582
and this party is just
beginning, Johnson !

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:41.422
Too bad you won't have
anything to celebrate.

00:10:41.422 --> 00:10:43.160
Foolish boy.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.600
He doesn't realize
I've let him get ahead.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.540
For it's not the beginning
of the trial that counts,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.782
it's the final verdict !

00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:52.784
Come on !

00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:54.555
What are you waiting
for, Johnson ?

00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.229
I just like to watch
the defendant squirm.

00:10:57.229 --> 00:10:59.434
Wait until he feels the wrath
of my next move.

00:11:01.706 --> 00:11:02.909
I call...

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:06.451
Mystical Elf to the stand
in defense mode !

00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.359
And then I'll place
one more card facedown.

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:10.595
Any questions ?

00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:12.432
( whistling )

00:11:12.432 --> 00:11:14.705
Enjoy this
while you can.

00:11:14.705 --> 00:11:16.476
For when the trial
is over,

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:19.016
you'll be charged
with a lifetime sentence

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:20.787
in this virtual prison !

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:28.004
( Yugi )
I'd give anything
for a hot chocolate.

00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:29.709
M-me too...

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:31.981
Here,
take my coat.

00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:34.053
You're a total
lifesaver, Yugi !

00:11:34.053 --> 00:11:37.061
Thank you !
Sure, no sweat.

00:11:37.061 --> 00:11:38.764
Hey...

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.004
You're worried about everyone
else aren't you ?

00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:43.777
Yeah, I'm especially worried
about Tristan and Serenity.

00:11:43.777 --> 00:11:45.581
They're just beginners
and if they lose a duel

00:11:45.581 --> 00:11:48.054
to the Big Five, they're
trapped here.

00:11:48.054 --> 00:11:49.191
You're right !

00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:51.162
But if I can beat one
of those creeps in a duel,

00:11:51.162 --> 00:11:52.633
then so can they !

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:53.902
( sneeze )

00:11:53.902 --> 00:11:56.408
Gesundheit, Tristan.

00:11:56.408 --> 00:11:58.046
Thank you, Serenity !

00:11:58.046 --> 00:12:00.184
That's what you get
for swimming in the lake.

00:12:00.184 --> 00:12:01.922
Zip it, Duke !

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.128
"That's what you get
for swimming in the lake."

00:12:04.128 --> 00:12:06.066
Let's just hope they
all found each other

00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.307
and they're pulling together to
find a way out of this place !

00:12:09.307 --> 00:12:10.343
( sneeze )

00:12:10.343 --> 00:12:12.816
Great-- Now you got
Serenity sick !

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.553
Way to go, germ boy !

00:12:14.553 --> 00:12:16.291
Oh yeah, Duke,
as if.

00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:19.900
You better stay away or you
might catch my evil germs, too !

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.738
Oh, you're a riot !

00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:23.810
Yeah, those guys always
have each other's back.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.648
I'm sure they're gonna
be just fine !

00:12:25.648 --> 00:12:27.953
Of course they are !

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:30.560
( Mokuba )
After today...

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.500
I never wanna see
a virtual tree again !

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.737
It figures...

00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:36.975
That punk Noah must
be keeping us trapped here

00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:40.585
because he's too terrified to
confront me face to face !

00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:43.325
A very interesting theory,
Seto...

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.265
but of course,
you're wrong again...

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:51.645
Check it out, Seto !

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:53.182
Another door !

00:12:53.182 --> 00:12:55.855
Should we go ?
Mm-hmm.

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:58.963
Let's see where that kid's
leading us now !

00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:02.940
What's this ?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.878
We're back at home,
at Kaiba Corp !

00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:08.253
It's a virtual
simulation of my office !

00:13:08.253 --> 00:13:10.325
( man )
This is my office !

00:13:10.325 --> 00:13:13.132
What ?

00:13:13.132 --> 00:13:15.572
No one disturbs
me here !

00:13:15.572 --> 00:13:16.707
I know that.

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:18.110
But I'm sick of waiting
to talk to you

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.115
and I have
something important to say !

00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:21.152
Seto !

00:13:21.152 --> 00:13:23.057
Another virtual scene
from the past !

00:13:23.057 --> 00:13:24.527
I know this !

00:13:24.527 --> 00:13:27.234
It's the day I was finally
able to work up the courage

00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:29.205
to confront our stepfather !

00:13:29.205 --> 00:13:32.246
You're here to talk about
your invention, right ?

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:34.351
Look kid, I've
already told you.

00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:35.687
It's no good !

00:13:35.687 --> 00:13:38.027
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to design

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:40.399
that virtual
video game software ?

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:42.705
You just can't admit that
I invented something

00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:44.409
you never could !

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:45.646
Right...

00:13:45.646 --> 00:13:48.185
This little game of yours
is of no use to me.

00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:49.622
Open your eyes !

00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:52.764
My software could make this
company billions of dollars !

00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:54.936
That's enough,
you little brat !

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:57.074
We don't make children's
toys here !

00:13:57.074 --> 00:14:00.149
Kaiba Corp is my company and
we make vehicles for combat,

00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:01.184
got that ?

00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:02.521
Now listen to me.

00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.426
If you're going to take over
this company someday,

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:06.764
you'll have to
forget about your games !

00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:10.173
I adopted you so you could
learn my family business !

00:14:10.173 --> 00:14:12.144
The business
of fighting battles,

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:15.653
defeating your enemies and
rising to ultimate power !

00:14:15.653 --> 00:14:17.591
No way, you're insane !

00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:20.264
Guards-- Take my
stepson away !

00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:21.902
Hey-- Take your
hands off of me !

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:23.473
You can't treat me
like this !

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:26.614
You'll be sorry,
you old fool !

00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:28.418
I'll never forget
that day.

00:14:28.418 --> 00:14:29.889
Not only did my stepfather

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:32.461
shoot down my
virtual gaming program...

00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:35.135
but to make things worse,
he stole my invention

00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:38.343
and passed it
off as his own !

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:41.351
( Mokuba )
Seto, we're back in Noah's
virtual forest !

00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:43.923
I wouldn't call it
"Noah's forest," Mokuba.

00:14:43.923 --> 00:14:46.329
Because whoever helped Noah
create this place

00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:49.538
is using the same virtual
technology that our step-father

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:51.075
stole from me !

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:52.645
Even though
it's been enhanced,

00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:55.351
the basic program is
the same as mine !

00:14:55.351 --> 00:14:56.488
That's true.

00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:59.161
And I have a feeling
it's no coincidence.

00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:01.433
I just have to remember that
everything we see here

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.803
is an illusion.

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:05.778
Because all of these memories
are messing with my head !

00:15:05.778 --> 00:15:08.918
Noah-- I don't
know who you are, kid...

00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:10.456
But I'll find out !

00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:12.661
I know you can
hear everything I say

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:15.468
and no matter what you're after
and who's helping you,

00:15:15.468 --> 00:15:17.673
you'll never succeed !

00:15:17.673 --> 00:15:19.110
Never.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.548
So if you're
so powerful,

00:15:20.548 --> 00:15:24.758
why don't you come down here
and face me, you coward !

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.630
All in
good time, Seto.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.835
All in good time.

00:15:32.845 --> 00:15:34.615
Call your
next witness !

00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:36.019
You got it !

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.557
Now look out !

00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:39.962
Okay, so what's
my plan here ?

00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:43.404
He's got one monster on the
field... and one card face down.

00:15:43.404 --> 00:15:44.975
So first things first.

00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:47.414
I gotta blow
away his monster !

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.285
I summon Rocket Warrior !

00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:55.000
Pretty impressive arsenal
I got here, right ?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.337
Hey, Johnson !

00:15:56.337 --> 00:15:58.542
You got any
last requests ?

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:02.251
Cause I'm about to throw
the book-- and a big Iron Claw--

00:16:02.251 --> 00:16:04.256
right at your last monster !

00:16:04.256 --> 00:16:08.099
All right, Gearfried...
Time to crush his Mystical Elf !

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:09.535
Now !

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:11.942
Activate Deck
Master Ability !

00:16:11.942 --> 00:16:13.980
Aw, man--
That's not good.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.725
It looks like his Deck Master
has special powers, too !

00:16:18.725 --> 00:16:21.766
Yet another amateur move
on his part.

00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:24.272
I think it's time to show
this kid what the Judge Man

00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:26.812
can really do.

00:16:26.812 --> 00:16:28.784
Clear the courtroom !

00:16:28.784 --> 00:16:30.855
Clear the courtroom ?

00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:32.292
What do you mean
by that ?

00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.364
I'm giving up
1,000 life points

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:36.803
to activate my
special power.

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:39.276
Now you must clear the
field of all your monsters,

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:41.314
so you're back where
you started !

00:16:41.314 --> 00:16:43.586
No way--
That's not fair !

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.991
Where's my lawyer ?

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:50.136
And I'm not through !

00:16:50.136 --> 00:16:52.843
Next you'll lose 500 life points
for each monster

00:16:52.843 --> 00:16:55.216
you were forced to
remove from the court !

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:56.552
Oh, come on !

00:16:56.552 --> 00:17:00.829
I had three monsters so
that means I lose...

00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:03.168
1,500 life points !

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:04.906
That's correct, Joseph !

00:17:04.906 --> 00:17:06.243
Great !

00:17:06.243 --> 00:17:10.019
Okay, minor problem, but
I've got this under control.

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:11.756
Now let's see...

00:17:11.756 --> 00:17:13.260
What do we got here ?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.933
A Bottomless
Trap Hole card !

00:17:15.933 --> 00:17:18.941
This baby will let me remove
any monster from the field

00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:22.349
with 1,500 attack
points or more... sweet !

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.423
He's not the only one that
can clear the courtroom !

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:28.163
Your days in this courthouse
are numbered, Johnson !

00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:30.803
As soon as I send that
Mystical Elf of yours packing,

00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:33.276
I'm going straight for
your life points !

00:17:33.276 --> 00:17:37.487
And what evidence do you have
to back that up, may I ask ?

00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:39.391
I have this card !

00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:44.270
( Téa )
Whoa, check it out !

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.406
Yugi, look !

00:17:45.406 --> 00:17:47.612
It's some kind of
a doorway !

00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:48.915
Well, what are
we waiting for ?

00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:50.786
Let's go !

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:52.524
I wonder where
it leads !

00:17:55.097 --> 00:17:56.133
Who let
in the draft ?

00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.403
Can it be ?

00:17:57.403 --> 00:17:58.572
It's Joey !

00:17:58.572 --> 00:18:00.477
Hey, Yugi--
Téa !

00:18:00.477 --> 00:18:01.914
Where you been ?

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.917
( Judge Man )
Order !

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:04.353
Settle down !

00:18:04.353 --> 00:18:06.625
This court is still in session,
in case you haven't noticed !

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.062
You're on trial ?

00:18:08.062 --> 00:18:10.135
I'm dueling one of
the Big Five.

00:18:10.135 --> 00:18:12.507
And you're just in time to
see me wipe the courtroom floor

00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:13.510
with him !

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.314
I believe
it's my move.

00:18:15.314 --> 00:18:16.550
So sit down !

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.522
You're lucky I
don't have you two ejected

00:18:18.522 --> 00:18:19.792
from this courtroom !

00:18:19.792 --> 00:18:21.195
This doesn't look
too good.

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:23.969
Joey has no monsters
and it's this guy's turn.

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.807
Come on, Joey.

00:18:25.807 --> 00:18:28.547
I summon Curtain
of the Dark Ones !

00:18:31.654 --> 00:18:35.497
Then I reveal
my facedown card !

00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:39.307
Activate Polymerization to fuse
together my Mystical Elf

00:18:39.307 --> 00:18:41.812
and my Curtain
of the Dark Ones !

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.121
Whatever monster he's creating
will get sucked

00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.694
right into my
Bottomless Trap Hole !

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:50.969
Meet Kamionwizard !

00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:52.139
Aw man !

00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:54.377
It's only got 1,300
attack points !

00:18:54.377 --> 00:18:57.619
My trap won't work on any
monsters with less than 1,500 !

00:18:57.619 --> 00:18:59.423
Next I'll play the card...

00:18:59.423 --> 00:19:01.862
Sinister Justice !

00:19:01.862 --> 00:19:05.171
This allows my fusion monster
to attack in the same turn

00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:06.875
in which it was summoned !

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:11.386
Now, Kamionwizard attack
his life points directly !

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.933
( both )
Oh no, Joey !

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.084
Lucky move,
Johnson.

00:19:24.084 --> 00:19:27.280
Joey's in
big trouble !

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.183
As long as Sinister Justice
is on the field,

00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:32.685
Johnson gets
800 extra life points

00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:35.088
every time he attacks
Joey's life points

00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:36.923
with his Kamionwizard !

00:19:36.923 --> 00:19:39.159
How's that again ?

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:41.728
The spiky-headed pipsqueak
is right !

00:19:41.728 --> 00:19:44.664
His life points
are going up !

00:19:44.664 --> 00:19:46.032
And there's more !

00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:50.203
I place this card facedown
to seal your doom !

00:19:50.203 --> 00:19:52.939
If it wasn't for that trap card,
I would have won this duel.

00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:56.609
Now every time he attacks me,
he gets stronger and stronger !

00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:59.245
You planned this all along
didn't you, Johnson ?

00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:00.346
Of course !

00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:04.284
But I have far worse
in store for you Joseph !
