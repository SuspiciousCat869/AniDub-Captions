WEBVTT

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.170
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.806
BEFORE THE WINNER OF
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
CAN BE CROWNED

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.275
WE MUST FIRST NARROW DOWN
THE FINALISTS!

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:12.646
THIS SPECIAL DUEL
WILL DETERMINE WHO FACES WHO
IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.916
AND ALL FOUR DUELISTS
WILL PARTICIPATE AT ONE TIME!

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.150
AS YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.152
YOUR TERMINAL
WILL CLIMB HIGHER.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.321
THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS
TO REACH THE TOP

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.323
WILL FACE EACH OTHER
IN ROUND 1.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.392
Yugi, voice-over:
THIS ENTIRE DUEL WAS SET UP

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.795
TO MAKE US CHOOSE
THE OPPONENTS WE'LL FACE
IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.732
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
WHO I DUEL NEXT.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:36.003
EITHER WAY
I'LL DRAIN THE PHARAOH
OF HIS POWERS IN THE END!

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.039
Kaiba, voice-over:
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN!

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.209
I'LL SPARE YUGI
SO I CAN FACE HIM
IN THE SEMIFINALS...

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.712
AND I'LL FOCUS
ALL MY ATTENTION
ON ELIMINATING MARIK!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.448
AND GETTING RID
OF WHEELER WILL BE SIMPLE!

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.317
Joey, voice-over:
AS MUCH AS I WANNA CRUSH KAIBA,

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.486
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
REASONS FOR BEIN' HERE.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:56.523
I PROMISED YUGI AND MAI
DAT I WOULD TAKE MARIK DOWN!

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.692
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE,
WHEELER!

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:01.762
VORSE RAIDER, ATTACK
HIS LIFE POINTS NOW!!!

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.163
I'LL PROTECT YOU!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.431
THANKS, YUGE.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.733
JOEY...
YOU AND I ARE A TEAM!

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.603
AND I'LL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU!

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:17.377
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE...

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.879
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.317
♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.968
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.305
♪ YI-GI-OH ♪

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.644
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.303
Tristan:
THIS FOUR-WAY DUEL
IS NUTS!

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:19.706
EACH DUELIST CAN ATTACK
ANY OF THE OTHER THREE!

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.274
Duke: TRUE,
BUT EACH DUELIST

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.044
CAN ALSO DEFEND
ANY OF THE OTHER THREE!

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.180
THAT'S HOW
YUGI SAVED JOEY
FROM KAIBA'S ATTACK!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.482
HEY, WHEELER!

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.784
NEXT TIME
YOU WON'T BE SO LUCKY!

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.353
THANKS FOR DA HELP,
YUGE.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.888
Yugi, voice-over:
I CAN'T LET JOEY LOSE!

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:38.191
IF HE DOES,
HE MAY HAVE TO FACE MARIK
IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.327
AND SO FAR
ALL OF MARIK'S OPPONENTS

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.995
HAVE ENDED UP
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE!

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.196
Yami-Yugi: KAIBA!

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.499
THIS TOURNAMENT OF YOURS
IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.334
THAN YOU COULD EVER
UNDERSTAND!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.469
Kaiba, voice-over:
WHAT IS HE BABBLING ABOUT?

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.972
I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO
TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.107
AND I'VE HAD IT PLANNED
ALL ALONG!!

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:57.411
FIRST I HAVE TO USE
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.979
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.481
TO DEFEAT YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.151
AND TAKE SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON FROM HIM!

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.253
THEN MY DECK
WILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:08.221
TO CRUSH MARIK IN THE FINALS

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.258
AND OBTAIN THE MOST POWERFUL
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.694
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:18.432
I'LL FINALLY PROVE
THAT I AM THE GREATEST DUELIST
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN,

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:19.900
NOT YUGI!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.736
AND WITH ALL THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
IN MY DECK,

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.204
I'LL BE UNBEATABLE!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.474
Joey, voice-over:
IT'S PRETTY QUIET IN HERE.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:29.576
EVERYONE MUST BE
PLANNIN' THEIR STRATEGIES.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.311
WELL MINE'S A NO-BRAINER!

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.246
I GOTTA GET ME
A PIECE A' MARIK!

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.182
WHEN DIS THING STARTED,

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.484
I PROMISED YUGI
DAT I'D HELP HIM
TAKE MARIK DOWN!

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:39.820
AND IF I FACE DAT EVIL FREAK
IN DA SEMIFINALS,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.888
I CAN KNOCK 'IM
OUTTA DA TOURNAMENT!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.492
PLUS BEATIN' MARIK
MIGHT BRING MAI BACK
FROM DA SHADOW REALM!

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.661
AND DAT'S ANOTHER PROMISE
I CAN'T BREAK!

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.497
YOU AND I
HAD AN AGREEMENT, SO...!

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.236
Joey, voice-over: SORRY,
I LET YOU DOWN, MAI...

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.471
BUT I PROMISE...

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:59.573
I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT
OF THIS PLACE.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.475
MARIK'S DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE!

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.976
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR JOEY WHEELER

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.411
TA DISH IT
RIGHT BACK TO 'IM!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.446
Kaiba: WAKE UP, WHEELER!

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.148
AN AMATEUR DUELIST
LIKE YOU

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.583
CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE DAYDREAMING!

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.651
I WAS STRATEGIZING!

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.653
BUT TO DO THAT
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.255
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME,
WHEELER.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.323
OH YEAH!?

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:17.791
WELL I GOT A GAME FOR YA
RIGHT HERE!

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.559
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO REALIZE

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.262
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO COMPETE
IN MY TOURNAMENT

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.830
AND YOU NEVER WILL?

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.733
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON
THAT YOU MADE IT THIS FAR.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:31.104
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND YUGI
KEEPS BAILING YOU OUT!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.906
YOU'RE HOPELESS!

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.141
AND IF YOU ASK ME

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.643
I'D SAY THAT YUGI
KNOWS THAT AS WELL!

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.045
WHAT!?!
THINK ABOUT IT!

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.315
WHY ELSE WOULD YUGI
WASTE HIS TRAP CARD
TO PROTECT YOU, WHEELER?

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.152
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF!

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:46.653
AND HE'S RIGHT!

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.389
NOT ONLY
DON'T YOU HAVE THE SKILLS
TO GET THROUGH THIS...

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.361
YOU'RE ALSO
THE ONLY FINALIST WITHOUT
AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.563
AND YUGI KNOWS
THAT THE ONLY WAY

00:04:56.563 --> 00:05:00.634
YOU'LL EVER MAKE IT
PAST THE SEMIFINALS
IS IF HE DUELS FOR YOU!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.303
OR PERHAPS
HE WANTS TO DUEL
AGAINST YOU NEXT ROUND

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.505
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
IT'S AN EASY VICTORY.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.007
Yami-Yugi:
THAT'S A LIE!!

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:09.142
I THINK YUGI'S
JUST AFRAID TO ADMIT

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.545
THAT HE HASN'T BELIEVED IN YOU
FROM THE START!

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.914
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM!

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:15.248
KAIBA!

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.651
THIS TIME YOUR TAUNTING
HAS GONE WAY OVER THE LINE!

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.319
IS THAT SO?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.488
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO PROVE ME WRONG...

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.657
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
PROTECTING YOUR FRIEND

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.158
AND LET HIM FINISH THIS DUEL

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.561
USING HIS OWN PATHETIC SKILLS
FOR A CHANGE!

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.595
KAIBA!

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:30.530
Joey: WAIT A SECOND, YUGE!!

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.199
WHAT'S WRONG, JOEY?

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.035
THANKS FA TRYIN'
TA HELP ME OUT,
BUT KAIBA'S RIGHT!

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.637
I GOTTA PROVE
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF!

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.139
IF I'M GONNA
WIN DIS TOURNAMENT

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.640
AND HELP YA
SAVE DA WORLD...

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.075
I GOTTA DO IT
ON MY OWN!

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.144
JUST BE CAREFUL.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.312
Joey, voice-over:
I'LL SHOW KAIBA

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:49.649
DAT JOEY WHEELER
DEPENDS ON NO ONE!

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.384
Kaiba, voice-over:
WITHOUT YUGI TO SHIELD HIM,

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.155
THAT SECOND RATE DUELIST
WILL LOSE HIS LIFE POINTS
IN NO TIME!

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.991
ALLOWING ME TO DESTROY YUGI
IN THE NEXT ROUND!

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:10.637
Serenity, voice-over:
HANG IN THERE, MAI.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.740
YOU'RE ONE OF
THE STRONGEST PEOPLE I KNOW

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.808
AND YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS!

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:18.479
SHE'S BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO ME
SINCE THE DAY I MET HER.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.983
WATCH IT!

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.685
CROSS ON THE GREEN,
NOT IN BETWEEN!

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:26.487
PLEASE YOU GOTTA HELP US!

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:28.589
A GANG OF ROBED WEIRDOES
IS AFTER US!

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.057
WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING!

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.492
LET'S GO, SERENITY!

00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:32.960
SERENITY!?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.994
HOLD ON!

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:36.663
YOU'RE JOEY'S SISTER,
AREN'T YOU?

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.900
LADY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY "MEET AND GREET."

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.269
I TOLD YOU
WE'RE BEING CHASED BY
A BUNCH OF THUGS!

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.972
WELL GUYS...HOP IN!

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:50.210
SOON I'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE MY BANDAGES OFF!

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.913
THEN I'LL FINALLY
BE ABLE TO SEE
MY BROTHER JOEY DUEL!

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.848
I JUST CAN'T WAIT, MAI!

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.083
I HAVE TO SAY,

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:58.018
I'M SURPRISED
A KNUCKLEHEAD LIKE JOEY

00:06:58.018 --> 00:06:59.453
HAS SUCH A SWEET SISTER.

00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.989
THEN AGAIN HE DOES HAVE
A SOFT SIDE.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.191
AND HE CAN BE CHARMING
WHEN HE WANTS TO.

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.325
Tristan, voice-over:
SOFT SIDE!?

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.194
Duke, voice-over:
CHARMING!?

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.496
I FIRST MET HIM
ON THE WAY
TO DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:10.831
ALL JOEY
COULD TALK ABOUT

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.299
WAS HOW HE WAS GONNA
WIN THE TOURNAMENT

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.834
SO HE COULD
USE THE PRIZE MONEY

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:16.303
FOR YOUR OPERATION,
SERENITY.

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:18.906
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HIS STORY WAS TOUCHING.

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:20.407
JOEY'S THE BEST!

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.976
I'D SAY...
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.215
JOEY'S OUT THERE
IN THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:31.485
DUELING WITH ALL HIS HEART
JUST LIKE HE DID
AT DUELIST KINGDOM, MAI.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.220
ONLY THIS TIME...

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.156
HE'S DOING IT
TO BRING YOU BACK
FROM THE SHADOW REALM!

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.432
Ishizu, voice-over:
YOU'RE SAFE NOW, ODION...

00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:47.935
THANKS TO MARIK'S GOOD SIDE.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:48.802
Tea: ISHIZU!

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.040
Ishizu: TEA?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.975
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.212
SISTER...IT'S ME!

00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.413
YOUR BROTHER!

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.981
YOU ARE MARIK!?

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.585
PROTECT ODION
FROM MY DARK HALF!

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.053
FOR WITHOUT ODION,

00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:09.156
THE EVIL FORCE
WILL CONTROL MY BODY
FOREVER!

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:11.425
Ishizu, voice-over:
MY BROTHER WAS RIGHT.

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:13.060
AS HIS SWORN PROTECTOR,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.497
ODION WAS ABLE
TO CONTAIN THE DARKNESS
DEEP WITHIN MARIK.

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:20.501
BUT WHEN THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
KNOCKED ODION UNCONSCIOUS,

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.403
MARIK'S EVIL SIDE
COMPLETELY TOOK OVER!

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:27.708
JUST AS IT DID
SO MANY YEARS AGO.

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:32.746
ON THE NIGHT
MY FATHER PUNISHED ODION
FOR DISOBEYING HIS ORDERS.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.915
MARIK?

00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.583
Ishizu, voice-over:
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:39.620
I WITNESSED
MY BROTHER'S DARK SIDE.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.754
ODION?

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:44.491
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW,
MARIK.

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.727
Ishizu, voice-over:
ODION HELD THE DARKNESS BACK,

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:50.397
BUT NOT BEFORE
MARIK SENT OUR FATHER
TO THE SHADOW REALM,

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:54.902
FORCING ME TO INHERIT
THE MILLENNIUM NECKLACE
BEFORE MY TIME HAD COME.

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:07.080
AT THAT MOMENT
THE DOORS TO THE FUTURE
WERE OPENED UP TO ME.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.918
AND I SAW
MARIK'S DESTINY UNFOLD!

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:13.153
THAT WAS THE FUTURE!

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:14.821
AND ACCORDING
TO MY VISION,

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.491
THE WORST
IS YET TO COME!

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.560
Ishizu, voice-over:
AND MY VISION WAS CORRECT.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.762
MARIK REJECTED HIS DUTIES
AS A TOMB-KEEPER

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:25.866
AND ATTEMPTED TO STEAL
ALL THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.501
IT WAS ALL
PART OF HIS PLAN

00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:29.870
TO SEIZE THE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH!

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.807
FIRST MARIK TOOK
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA
FROM ITS HIDING PLACE.

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:36.343
THEN HE STOLE
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.646
ALL HE NEEDED
WAS OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.818
Marik: EXCELLENT WORK,
MY RARE HUNTERS.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.825
NOW OPEN THE VAULT!

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:57.364
IT'S TIME TO OBTAIN
THE THIRD EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:59.166
YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE,
MY BROTHER!

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.905
THE CARD YOU SEEK
IS NO LONGER IN THIS VAULT.

00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:07.374
Marik: WELL,
IF IT ISN'T MY SISTER.

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.409
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
SURPRISE.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.777
NOW TELL ME...

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.746
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH OBELISK?

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:13.847
MARIK!

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:16.149
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
DON'T BELONG TO YOU!

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.685
NOR DOES THE SACRED POWER
OF THE PHARAOH!

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.053
THE PHARAOH!?

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:23.390
I REFUSE
TO WASTE MY LIFE AWAY
WAITING FOR HIM!

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.161
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO TAKE MY DESTINY IN
MY OWN HANDS, ISHIZU!!

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.130
SO HAND THE CARD
OVER TO ME.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.131
RIGHT NOW!

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.666
THAT'S ENOUGH, MARIK!

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:34.501
YOU'RE A TOMB-KEEPER,
REMEMBER!?

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.405
OF COURSE!

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:39.906
HOW CAN I FORGET!?

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:41.642
THE DAY I WAS INITIATED

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:43.644
I WAS CHARGED
WITH CARRYING THE SECRET

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.979
OF THE PHARAOH'S POWER
ON MY BACK,

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.149
AS OUR FATHER
DID BEFORE ME.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.118
WELL THAT TRADITION
ENDS HERE!

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:53.053
MARIK!

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.122
IT'S NO USE
OPPOSING ME, SISTER.

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.591
THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM ROD

00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.993
ALWAYS GETS ME
WHAT I WANT!

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:03.230
SO I'LL ONLY
ASK YOU NICELY
ONE MORE TIME.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.767
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH THE LAST REMAINING
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:07.868
MY DEAR SISTER!?

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.070
BROTHER!
I SHALL NEVER REVEAL THAT!

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.347
I'LL FIND IT,
ISHIZU!

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.517
ODION! BUT WHY?

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:27.387
I'M AFRAID YOU MADE
A VERY FOOLISH CHOICE
TODAY, ISHIZU.

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:34.361
ODION!

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.930
HELP HIM.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.532
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:41.968
THAT MARIK HAS
AN EVEN STRONGER EVIL
DEEP WITHIN HIM.

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:48.642
AND ONLY YOU CAN KEEP IT
FROM SURFACING, ODION.

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:54.247
Ishizu, voice-over:
BUT WHEN ODION
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:56.950
MY BROTHER WAS CONSUMED
BY THAT EVIL.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:02.456
HOWEVER, NOW I UNDERSTAND
THAT THESE EVENTS
WERE DESTINED TO OCCUR,

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:06.426
JUST AS YUGI
WAS DESTINED TO COMPLETE
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:13.600
AND PEGASUS WAS DESTINED
TO CREATE THE GAME
OF DUEL MONSTERS.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.938
AND SETO KAIBA
WAS DESTINED TO RECEIVE
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:21.475
AND I WAS DESTINED
TO GIVE MY NECKLACE AWAY.

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:25.312
I CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT IT'S MY BROTHER
MARIK'S DESTINY

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:29.149
TO BE SAVED FROM THE DARKNESS
THAT NOW CONTROLS HIS BODY.

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.094
Yami-Marik:
ALRIGHT, YOU TWO!

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:40.963
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS DUEL!

00:12:40.963 --> 00:12:43.933
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
AND SINCE THE FIRST TWO
DUELISTS TO LOSE

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.369
WILL FACE EACH OTHER
IN THE SEMIFINALS,

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:49.038
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I HAVE TO DO...

00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:52.141
TO ENSURE THAT I FACE
THE PHARAOH!!

00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:54.910
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.547
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
I'LL MAKE SURE KAIBA
AND LITTLE JOEY FALL FIRST.

00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:01.250
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.420
THEN I'LL SUMMON LORD POISON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:09.091
AND NOW,
I'LL ATTACK YOU, KAIBA!

00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:12.561
SO PREPARE TO BE
THE FIRST UNFORTUNATE SOUL

00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:14.463
TO FEEL THE WRATH
OF MY DECK!

00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:16.031
ARE YOU READY?

00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:17.366
NEWDORIA!!

00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:19.869
ATTACK HIS VORSE RAIDER NOW!

00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:23.406
Kaiba, voice-over: WHAT?!

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:27.143
HE'S ATTACKING ME WITH A MONSTER
THAT IS WEAKER THAN MINE!

00:13:27.143 --> 00:13:29.245
Yugi, voice-over:
MARIK'S MONSTER MUST HAVE

00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:30.980
SOME KIND OF
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.481
NICE TRY, FOOL!

00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:33.649
VORSE RAIDER!

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:35.751
COUNTER-ATTACK!

00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:42.091
YOU FELL INTO MY TRAP...!

00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:44.593
WHEN NEWDORIA
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:13:44.593 --> 00:13:47.730
I CAN DESTROY ANY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.900
SO SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR VORSE RAIDER!

00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:57.640
Joey, voice-over: AWESOME!

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.508
NOW KAIBA'S WIDE OPEN!

00:13:59.508 --> 00:14:02.678
I CAN BLAST HIS LIFE POINTS
IN MY NEXT TURN!

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:04.380
I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.083
NOW...WHICH ONE OF MY CARDS
SHALL I UNLEASH FIRST?

00:14:09.985 --> 00:14:12.755
I ACTIVATE SPELL OF PAIN!

00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:15.424
BUT WHO SHOULD
I DIRECT IT TOWARDS?

00:14:15.424 --> 00:14:18.427
LET'S SEE...

00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:22.131
I THINK I'LL USE MY CARD
ON LITTLE JOEY!!

00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:24.767
NOW YOU LOSE THE POINTS
I WOULD HAVE LOST

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.936
WHEN MY MONSTER
WAS DESTROYED!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.475
JOEY! NO!

00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:34.310
HANG IN THERE!

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.411
I'LL TRY!

00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.247
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY A FAN
OF HIGH PLACES!

00:14:38.247 --> 00:14:39.615
COME ON, MAN!

00:14:39.615 --> 00:14:41.684
YOU'VE BEEN IN
MUCH SCARIER SPOTS
THAN THIS ONE!

00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:43.252
STAY STRONG JOEY!

00:14:43.252 --> 00:14:44.420
IT'S ONLY
A SIX HUNDRED FOOT DROP!

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.222
GEE, THANKS!

00:14:46.222 --> 00:14:47.857
Joey, voice-over:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE,

00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:50.659
LOSING THIS DUEL,
OR FALLIN' OUTTA DIS CHAIR!

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:53.128
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
I HAVE BOTH KAIBA
AND LITTLE JOEY

00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:54.864
EXACTLY WHERE I WANT THEM.

00:14:54.864 --> 00:14:57.867
SO, I'M SURE TO DUEL THE PHARAOH
IN THE NEXT ROUND!

00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:03.506
THEN I'LL SEIZE
HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
AND HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:04.673
YOUR MOVE, PHARAOH!

00:15:04.673 --> 00:15:06.976
I KNOW!

00:15:06.976 --> 00:15:09.078
Yugi, voice-over:
KAIBA HAS NO MONSTERS
DEFENDING HIM.

00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:11.647
THIS IS THE PERFECT CHANCE
TO ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:15:11.647 --> 00:15:12.848
AND NOW...

00:15:12.848 --> 00:15:15.417
BEHOLD, KAIBA!

00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:17.920
I SACRIFICE
BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.456
TO SUMMON
MY BEAST OF GILFER!

00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:21.957
AND NOW, MY BEAST...

00:15:21.957 --> 00:15:25.261
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR AN ASSAULT!!

00:15:25.261 --> 00:15:27.096
BEAST OF GILFER...

00:15:27.096 --> 00:15:29.732
ATTACK KAIBA'S
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:15:29.732 --> 00:15:30.833
SETO, NO!

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:32.201
GUESS AGAIN!

00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:33.769
YOUR TACTICS ARE OBVIOUS!

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:35.905
OBSERVE!

00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:37.873
YOU TRIGGERED MY TRAP!

00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:40.843
AND THANKS TO MY CARD,
ATTACK GUIDANCE ARMOR ...

00:15:40.843 --> 00:15:42.811
I'LL REDIRECT YOUR ATTACK!

00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:45.814
TO ANY MONSTER
ON THE PLAYING FIELD!

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:47.850
NOW OF COURSE
I COULD EASILY TARGET

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.586
YOUR BEAST OF GILFER,
YUGI...OR NOT.

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:51.487
NOW LET'S SEE.

00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:55.024
WAIT, KAIBA'S TRAP CARD

00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:57.626
CAN ONLY TARGET MONSTERS,
WHICH MEANS...I'M SAFE!!!

00:15:57.626 --> 00:16:00.996
OBVIOUSLY, MY TARGET
IS GOING TO BE...

00:16:00.996 --> 00:16:02.731
LORD POISON!

00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:05.601
MARIK'S ONLY MONSTER!

00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.102
ALRIGHT, MARIK...

00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:08.904
I AIM YUGI'S ATTACK
AT YOU!!

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:12.508
REALLY?

00:16:12.508 --> 00:16:14.343
NOT IF I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:16:14.343 --> 00:16:17.212
MIRROR FORCE!

00:16:17.212 --> 00:16:19.014
WHAT!? NO WAY!

00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:22.918
YES, SO I'M ABLE
TO REFLECT THE ATTACK
BACK AT YUGI!

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:24.553
SO YOUR MONSTER'S
DESTROYED!

00:16:24.553 --> 00:16:26.221
ARE YOU SURE?!

00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:29.258
WHAT?
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP!

00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:31.427
SEVEN TOOLS
OF THE BANDIT!

00:16:31.427 --> 00:16:34.029
MY CARD DEACTIVATES
YOUR MIRROR FORCE!

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:35.431
NICE TRY, MARIK!

00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:36.832
BUT YOUR TRAP
DIDN'T WORK!

00:16:36.832 --> 00:16:37.766
OH NO!

00:16:51.387 --> 00:16:52.422
WOW!

00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:53.623
THIS DUEL'S INTENSE!

00:16:53.623 --> 00:16:56.726
MY BROTHER REDIRECTED
YUGI'S ATTACK TO MARIK,

00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:59.662
AND THEN MARIK TRIED
TO REFLECT THAT ATTACK
BACK TO YUGI...

00:16:59.662 --> 00:17:02.999
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK,
SO MARIK TOOK THE DAMAGE ANYWAY!

00:17:02.999 --> 00:17:04.334
MARIK.

00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:06.936
YOUR LIFE POINTS
JUST WENT DOWN
BY SEVEN HUNDRED!

00:17:06.936 --> 00:17:10.373
SO, GO UP THERE
WITH THE OTHER CHUMP!

00:17:10.373 --> 00:17:12.041
Joey, voice-over:
NOW MARIK'S TIED WIT ME,

00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.678
SO I MAY FACE HIM
IN DA SEMIFINALS!

00:17:15.678 --> 00:17:18.548
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO LOSES LIFE POINTS.

00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:21.551
YOU PLAYED SEVEN TOOLS
OF THE BANDIT, PHARAOH!

00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:24.154
THAT CARD COSTS YOU
1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:25.922
SO YOUR CHAIR RISES AS WELL!

00:17:25.922 --> 00:17:28.391
I'M AWARE OF THAT!

00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:30.794
Kaiba, voice-over:
WHAT'S THIS!?

00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:32.796
YUGI HAS TO WIN
SO HE CAN DUEL ME NEXT!

00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:34.864
YUGI'S IN LAST PLACE NOW!

00:17:34.864 --> 00:17:35.899
I KNOW!

00:17:35.899 --> 00:17:37.500
BUT I THINK HE LOST
THOSE LIFE POINTS

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.402
ON PURPOSE, TEA!

00:17:39.402 --> 00:17:41.171
REMEMBER, THE FIRST
TWO DUELISTS TO LOSE

00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:43.239
FACE EACH OTHER
IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.775
Kaiba, voice-over:
YUGI'S STILL PLANNING
TO PROTECT WHEELER

00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:47.610
FROM DUELING AGAINST MARIK!

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.712
MY MOVE!

00:17:49.712 --> 00:17:50.647
Joey, voice-over:
IF I DON'T DRAW
A MONSTER NOW,

00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:52.215
THIS TURN IS GONNA BE
MY LAST!

00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:54.150
COME ON, I NEED A WINNA!

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.619
HERE GOES!

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.087
Joey, voice-over: AWESOME!

00:17:58.087 --> 00:18:01.758
I SUMMON...
GEARFRIED THE IRON KNIGHT!

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:04.494
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:04.494 --> 00:18:06.496
ABOUT TIME
HE GOT A MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:18:06.496 --> 00:18:08.598
JOEY! WAY TA GO!

00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:10.066
Joey, voice-over:
NOW THAT I GOT A MONSTA,

00:18:10.066 --> 00:18:11.835
IT'S TIME TO DO
A LITTLE DAMAGE.

00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:13.570
NOW LET'S SEE...

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.039
ALL THREE A' DEM BLEW
THEIR FACEDOWN CARDS LAST TURN.

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:18.908
AND DOSE TWO HAVE NO MONSTERS
ON DA FIELD.

00:18:18.908 --> 00:18:21.344
I COULD BLAST MARIK.

00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:22.512
NAAAAH.

00:18:22.512 --> 00:18:24.214
I GOT A BETTA IDEA!

00:18:24.214 --> 00:18:26.182
I'M GOIN' FOR RICH BOY!

00:18:26.182 --> 00:18:27.817
TAKE DIS, KAIBA!

00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:29.719
NOW! GEARFRIED, ATTACK!

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:33.857
GO STRAIGHT
FOR HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:36.025
Yugi, voice-over:
THIS'LL PUT KAIBA
IN LAST PLACE!

00:18:42.198 --> 00:18:43.366
BIG BROTHER!

00:18:43.366 --> 00:18:44.634
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

00:18:44.634 --> 00:18:46.903
WHEELER!

00:18:46.903 --> 00:18:50.373
I ASSURE YOU,
YOU WON'T BE LAUGHING
MUCH LONGER!

00:18:50.373 --> 00:18:51.441
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:53.076
LAST I CHECKED
YOU WANTED TO GO

00:18:53.076 --> 00:18:55.278
TO DA TOP
'A YOUR DUEL TOWER
KAIBA!

00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:57.814
Yugi, voice-over:
WHY DID JOEY ATTACK KAIBA!?

00:18:57.814 --> 00:19:00.149
NOW KAIBA AND I
ARE CLOSEST TO THE TOP

00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:02.986
AND JOEY AND MARIK
ARE CLOSEST TO THE BOTTOM!

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:04.153
OH NO!

00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:08.124
JOEY MUST WANT TO FACE MARIK
IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:19:08.124 --> 00:19:10.059
Joey, voice-over:
YOU'RE MINE, MARIK!

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:12.562
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID TA MAI!

00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:17.500
DON'T WORRY, MAI!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.068
AS SOON AS I CRUSH MARIK,

00:19:19.068 --> 00:19:21.170
I'LL GET YOUR MIND BACK
FROM DA SHADOW REALM...

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.805
JUST LIKE I PROMISED!

00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:24.140
Joey: FOR MY LAST MOVE,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.143
I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:28.511
ABOUT TIME.

00:19:28.511 --> 00:19:30.013
MY MOVE!

00:19:30.013 --> 00:19:32.715
Kaiba, voice-over:
IF I WANT TO FACE YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS,

00:19:32.715 --> 00:19:34.217
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS MAKE SURE

00:19:34.217 --> 00:19:37.487
THAT HE AND I BOTH LOSE
THIS FOUR-WAY DUEL!

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:42.125
BUT I CAN'T LET MYSELF
LOSE A DUEL ON PURPOSE!

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.928
I'LL PLACE
THREE CARDS FACEDOWN
ON THE FIELD!

00:19:44.928 --> 00:19:49.866
AND THEN I'LL SUMMON
THE MIGHTY BLADE KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:19:49.866 --> 00:19:51.567
Kaiba, voice-over:
I WON'T THROW THIS DUEL!

00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:54.203
TIME TO LOSE
MORE LIFE POINTS, MARIK!

00:19:54.203 --> 00:19:56.506
NOW, BLADE KNIGHT!

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:58.908
ATTACK MARIK DIRECTLY!

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:09.686
Kaiba: GOING UP!

00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:11.120
Joey, voice-over: AW MAN!

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.923
DIS HURTS MY CHANCES
'A FACIN' MARIK
IN DA NEXT ROUND!

00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:16.159
THIS FOUR-WAY DUEL'S
CONFUSING!

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.560
YEAH!

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.429
IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO
DUEL SOMEONE ELSE!

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:22.498
I HOPE YOU'RE
NOT AFRAID OF
HEIGHTS, MARIK,

00:20:22.498 --> 00:20:25.301
BECAUSE IT'S
A LONG WAY UP
TO THE TOP!

00:20:25.301 --> 00:20:28.705
Kaiba, voice-over:
I'LL MAKE SURE MARIK
AND WHEELER LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:31.107
SO I FACE YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:20:31.107 --> 00:20:33.409
THEN I'LL PROVE
ONCE AND FOR ALL

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:37.080
THAT I AM A FAR BETTER DUELIST
THAN HE'LL EVER BE!

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.116
I'LL PIT
MY OBELISK THE TORMENTOR

00:20:40.116 --> 00:20:42.685
AGAINST HIS
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:45.655
AND WHEN THESE
TWO EGYPTIAN GODS CLASH,

00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:48.658
YUGI WILL LEARN
WHAT TORMENT IS ALL ABOUT!
