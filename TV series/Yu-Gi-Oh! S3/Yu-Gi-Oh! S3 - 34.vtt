00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:11.308
SLIFER AUTOMATICALLY
STRIKES EVERY
MONSTER YOU SUMMON.

00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:16.980
NOW, SLIFER, ATTACK!

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.516
I'M AFRAID
THAT WON'T WORK.

00:09:19.516 --> 00:09:23.920
I ACTIVATE CARD GUARD.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.223
NO!

00:09:26.223 --> 00:09:29.793
YES, NOW I CAN DISCARD
TWO CARDS FROM MY HAND,

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:34.798
WHICH MEANS CARD GUARD
PROTECTS THEM BOTH.

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:40.303
I'M NOT IMPRESSED.

00:09:40.303 --> 00:09:43.240
THEY'RE STILL TOO
WEAK TO BE USEFUL.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.844
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:49.579
YUGI, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:52.382
THAT OBELISK HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY
AS WELL?

00:09:52.382 --> 00:09:55.018
AND JUST AS SOON
AS I ACTIVATE IT,
YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:09:55.018 --> 00:09:56.553
JUST TRY IT.

00:09:56.553 --> 00:09:58.221
VERY WELL.

00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:01.625
BUT YOU'LL REGRET
THOSE WORDS.

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.127
I SACRIFICE
MY TWO MONSTERS

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.731
TO TRIGGER
THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:10.166
ARE YOU AWARE OF
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.335
ALLOW ME
TO EXPLAIN, YOU FOOL.

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:16.973
THESE TWO SACRIFICES
ALLOW OBELISK
TO STORM THE FIELD,

00:10:16.973 --> 00:10:19.009
DEALING 4,000
POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:21.278
TO EVERYTHING
IN ITS PATH.

00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:22.512
[ROARING]

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:25.382
AND WHEN I SAY
EVERYTHING, YUGI,

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:27.183
THAT INCLUDES
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:29.152
SO PREPARE
TO BE WIPED OUT.

00:10:29.152 --> 00:10:30.153
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:32.188
YES, IT CAN!

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:35.959
WAY TO GO, SETO!

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.964
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,
DEPLETE HIS LIFE POINTS
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.667
OBELISK, DESTROY YUGI
AND BRING ME VICTORY.

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.135
[ROARING]

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.971
HOLD ON!

00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:01.009
MY WALL OF KURIBOHS
WILL PROTECT ME.

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:06.448
NOTHING CAN STOP
THE WRATH OF OBELISK.

00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:07.816
LOOK, GUYS.

00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:09.984
OH, MAN.
WHAT'S WITH
THE FIREWORKS?

00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:13.121
Tea: I DON'T KNOW, BUT
LET'S HOPE YUGI'S OK.

00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:14.989
THAT'S RIGHT! HE
BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN

00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:16.758
ON THE RECEIVING
END OF THAT BLAST.

00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:18.827
YUGI.

00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:22.263
FINALLY,
YUGI LOST TO ME!

00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:25.266
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:31.239
OH, REALLY?

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:32.273
[GRUNTS]

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:34.509
YUGI? BUT HOW?

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:36.311
WHAT'S WRONG, KAIBA?

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:38.780
WERE YOU EXPECTING
ME TO GO SOMEWHERE?

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.416
DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT DISCARDING
KURIBOH FROM MY HAND

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:43.017
PROTECTS
MY LIFE POINTS?

00:11:43.017 --> 00:11:44.352
KURIBOH,

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:46.221
I WOULD HAVE LOST
THIS DUEL WITHOUT YOU.

00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:48.590
[CALLS]

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.391
YOU MOCK ME?

00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:54.095
HOW DARE YOU DEFY
THE MIGHT OF OBELISK
WITH THAT PUNY KURIBOH!

00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:56.564
THIS IS NOT OVER, YUGI.

00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:59.067
IT WILL BE SOON ENOUGH.

00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:01.836
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD,

00:12:01.836 --> 00:12:03.805
AND THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:12:03.805 --> 00:12:06.274
VERY WELL!
MY MOVE!

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:08.910
SORRY, KAIBA,
BUT SINCE I'VE
DRAWN A CARD,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.845
SLIFER'S ATTACK
POINTS

00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:12.547
INCREASE TO 6,000.

00:12:12.547 --> 00:12:19.788
SLIFER,
DESTROY HIS OBELISK!

00:12:19.788 --> 00:12:21.322
OH, NO! SETO!

00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:23.892
KAIBA'S LIFE POINTS
ARE GONE.

00:12:23.892 --> 00:12:29.998
NOW END THIS!

00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:32.433
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT
YOU, YUGI.

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:33.434
HUH?

00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:34.903
YOU TRIGGERED

00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:41.409
MY TRAP CARD,
POWER BALANCE!

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:45.246
WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:48.249
KAIBA, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

00:12:48.249 --> 00:12:50.685
THANKS TO MY
POWER BALANCE TRAP,

00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:53.288
YOU HAVE TO DISCARD HALF
OF THE CARDS IN YOUR HAND.

00:12:53.288 --> 00:12:54.589
OH, NO!

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:56.124
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:12:56.124 --> 00:12:58.326
AND SINCE YOU LOSE
3 CARDS,

00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:00.695
SLIFER'S ATTACK POINTS
REDUCE BY 3,000.

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:02.130
SO LET'S GO.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.832
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.567
THROW OUT YOUR 3 CARDS!

00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:09.571
VERY WELL, KAIBA.

00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:15.543
AS A SECONDARY EFFECT,
I GET TO DRAW 3 CARDS.

00:13:15.543 --> 00:13:18.847
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
MY OBELISK IS

00:13:18.847 --> 00:13:23.418
STRONGER THAN YOUR
SLIFER ONCE AGAIN, YUGI.

00:13:23.418 --> 00:13:25.286
TIME TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

00:13:25.286 --> 00:13:26.721
NOW, THEN,

00:13:26.721 --> 00:13:29.224
GO, OBELISK. SHOW
YUGI SOME REAL POWER!

00:13:29.224 --> 00:13:31.192
HOLD ON, KAIBA!

00:13:31.192 --> 00:13:32.894
SLIFER'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE!

00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:34.662
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A MAGIC CARD

00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:36.331
THAT WILL TURN
THINGS AROUND!

00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:39.534
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY NECROMANCY CARD!

00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:46.574
OBSERVE!

00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:49.510
KAIBA, YOU MAY WANT
TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.580
ON YOUR DUEL DISK.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.983
AAH! WHAT'S THIS?

00:13:54.983 --> 00:13:57.752
[GROANING]

00:13:57.752 --> 00:14:01.055

SWORD OF SOUL?

00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:02.757
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:06.127
WHY ARE ALL
OF MY MONSTERS
RETURNING TO THE FIELD?

00:14:06.127 --> 00:14:09.297
NECROMANCY RESTORES
4 MONSTERS FROM
YOUR GRAVEYARD, KAIBA.

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:12.600
AND THEY EACH RETURN
TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.036
YUGI, WHY WOULD YOU
WASTE YOUR TIME

00:14:15.036 --> 00:14:17.572
GIVING ME MORE MONSTERS
TO ATTACK YOU WITH?

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:19.674
I'M GLAD THAT
YOU ASKED, KAIBA.

00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:22.510
MY CARD HAS
AN UNFORTUNATE
SIDE EFFECT, TOO.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.544
[GROWLS]

00:14:23.544 --> 00:14:25.179
IF ANY OF
THESE MONSTERS

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:26.814
ARE DESTROYED,

00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:28.883
MY NECROMANCY
WILL WEAKEN YOUR

BY 600 POINTS, KAIBA!

00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:34.188
AND SINCE MONSTERS
HAVE BEEN PLAYED

00:14:34.188 --> 00:14:36.090
ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.626
MY SLIFER'S
SPECIAL EFFECT
HAS BEEN TRIGGERED.

00:14:38.626 --> 00:14:45.033
ACTIVATE
LIGHTNING BLAST!

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:48.436
[KAIBA GROANING]

00:14:48.436 --> 00:14:49.971
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:52.874
SINCE SLIFER DESTROYED
YOUR 4 NEW MONSTERS,

00:14:52.874 --> 00:14:54.876
MY NECROMANCY
MAGIC CARD WEAKENS

00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:56.778
YOUR ONE REMAINING
MONSTER.

00:14:56.778 --> 00:14:59.981
SO OBELISK LOSES
2,400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:02.350
YUGI, I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D TAKE

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.988
SUCH A CHEAP SHOT
AT MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:15:06.988 --> 00:15:08.289
THE TABLES

HAVE TURNED
ONCE AGAIN.

00:15:10.058 --> 00:15:12.060
AND YOUR MONSTER'S
STRENGTH PALES

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.795
IN COMPARISON
TO MINE!

00:15:13.795 --> 00:15:17.098

DONE, KAIBA?

HMM. WHO? ME?

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.343
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT I'VE DONE.

00:15:28.343 --> 00:15:29.911
IT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE

00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.779
BY USING YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:34.048
TO DESTROY
MY SWORD OF SOUL,

00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:35.650
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO ADD

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.151
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:41.155
TO ANY MONSTER I CHOOSE.
AND I CHOOSE MY OBELISK!

00:15:47.256 --> 00:15:49.725
THANKS TO YOU,
I WAS ABLE TO INCREASE
OBELISK'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:53.395
NOW, OBELISK,
DESTROY HIS SLIFER!

YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS ANCIENT HISTORY.

00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:10.579
WHAT? YOUR SLIFER
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:12.314

HAVE BEEN

THE ABILITY TO
PROTECT MY EGYPTIAN

FOR THAT TASK

THANKS
TO A TRAP CARD
THAT YOU PLAYED.

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:29.364
WHEN YOU ACTIVATED
YOUR POWER BALANCE CARD,

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:32.768
I HAD TO PLACE
3 CARDS IN

INCLUDING THIS.

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:37.639
HMM. RECOGNIZE IT?

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:39.708
IT'S A USEFUL
MONSTER CARD KNOWN

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.944
AS ELECTROMAGNETIC
TURTLE.

00:16:41.944 --> 00:16:44.413
AND IT HAS QUITE
A UNIQUE
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:46.815
WHEN THIS MONSTER
IS SENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:49.017
IT LEAVES A SMALL
ELECTRODE ATTACHED

00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:50.686
TO ONE
OF MY MONSTERS,

00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:52.521
IN THIS CASE
SLIFER!

WELL, I SEE YOU DID
YOUR HOMEWORK, KAIBA.

00:17:00.996 --> 00:17:03.565
NOW I PLACE
THIS CARD FACE DOWN.

DID YOU SEE THAT?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.601
NICE ONE, YUGI!

00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:06.602
GO, KAIBA.

00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:08.437

NEITHER EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.140
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.546

OF A DUEL!

[CHUCKLING]

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:28.090
THIS IS THE DUEL I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.026
IT'S THE ULTIMATE BATTLE
OF INTELLECT AND POWER.

00:17:31.026 --> 00:17:34.196
EVERY TIME I DUEL
AGAINST YUGI,

00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:38.867
I'M PUSHED TO MY LIMITS
AND CHALLENGED
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.

00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:40.669
[ROARING]

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:42.904
[NEIGHING]

00:17:42.904 --> 00:17:46.041
EVEN THOUGH I DEFEATED
HIM IN DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:49.144
HE'S KNOWN AS THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DUELIST!

00:17:49.144 --> 00:17:50.345
Yami-Yugi: OH, NO!

00:17:50.345 --> 00:17:51.747
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:54.583
BUT THAT TITLE
BELONGS TO ME.

00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:57.219
AND WHEN I WIN
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT,

00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:59.621
I'LL HAVE IT BACK!

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:02.057
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

00:18:02.057 --> 00:18:04.259
BEFORE YUGI'S REPUTATION
COMES CRUMBLING DOWN

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:07.162
AT THE HANDS OF
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:18:07.162 --> 00:18:12.134
ALL RIGHT, YUGI.
MY MOVE!

00:18:12.134 --> 00:18:13.869
YOU READY?

00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:15.570
NOW, THEN,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.073
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CARD
IN YOUR HAND.

00:18:18.073 --> 00:18:20.409
THAT MEANS SLIFER'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE 1,000.

00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:23.779
SO LET'S SEE
YOU ESCAPE NOW.

00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:27.115
IT'S TIME TO SHOW
THE WORLD THAT I'M
SUPERIOR TO YOU.

00:18:27.115 --> 00:18:29.985
GO, OBELISK!

00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:33.889
ANNIHILATE HIS SLIFER
WITH YOUR FIST OF FATE.

00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:35.357
GUESS AGAIN!

00:18:35.357 --> 00:18:38.326
REVEAL
THE MAGIC CARD--

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:40.195
SPELL TEXTBOOK!

00:18:40.195 --> 00:18:43.732
NOW I MUST DISCARD
EVERY CARD IN MY HAND.

00:18:43.732 --> 00:18:46.468
AND IN EXCHANGE, I
CAN DRAW ONE NEW CARD.

00:18:46.468 --> 00:18:48.704
I CAN THEN PLAY THE CARD
IMMEDIATELY,

00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:54.509
BUT ONLY IF I DRAW
A MAGIC CARD.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.746
NOW THAT SLIFER'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE ZERO,

00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:00.215
YOU'LL LOSE THE DUEL.

00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:03.485
OBELISK, WIPE OUT
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:05.387
THIS IS IT!

00:19:05.387 --> 00:19:07.622
IF I DON'T DRAW
THE RIGHT CARD NOW,

00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:09.758
I'LL LOSE TO KAIBA
AND BE ELIMINATED
FROM THE TOURNAMENT!

00:19:09.758 --> 00:19:12.294
COME ON, JOEY,
GUIDE ME!

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:19.201
I NEED YOUR HELP
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:21.570
I ACTIVATE
THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.604
WHAT'S THAT?

00:19:22.604 --> 00:19:24.139
CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:26.308
IT REQUIRES BOTH
OF US TO DRAW

00:19:26.308 --> 00:19:30.879
UNTIL EACH
ONE OF US IS
HOLDING 6 CARDS.

00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:37.319
OH, NO!

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:40.088
THAT MEANS
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
INCREASES IN STRENGTH!

00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:41.857
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:41.857 --> 00:19:47.429
AND NOW SLIFER HAS
6,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:51.399
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE
THIS DUEL, KAIBA!

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:56.071
HOLD ON. I ACTIVATE
MY FINAL TRAP CARD--

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.639
LIFE SHAVER!

00:19:57.639 --> 00:20:02.644
IT SHAVES 2,000 ATTACK POINTS
OFF YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:17.759
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:23.198
KAIBA CORP HOLOGRAMS
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THIS!

00:20:23.198 --> 00:20:24.199
[CROWD SCREAMING]

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:28.103
LOOK OUT!

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:31.873
Tristan: I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS,
BUT THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

00:20:31.873 --> 00:20:34.242
YUGI!

00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:36.378
Tea: WHAT COULD BE
GOING ON, YOU GUYS?

00:20:36.378 --> 00:20:39.080
Tristan: I CAN'T SEE
A THING OUT THERE!

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.349
THE TRUE POWER OF ANCIENT EGYPT

00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:43.819
IS BEGINNING TO REVEAL ITSELF!

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:45.720
AND I FEAR FOR US ALL!
