YOU COULD USE A REST.

FROM ALL THOSE DIRECT ATTACKS.

BEEN FINISHED BY NOW.

YOU'VE WON?

I'M AFRAID NOTHING
COULD BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH

YOU'VE INTRODUCED HIM
TO THE PLAYING FIELD.

IS DESTROYED,

00:17:14.774 --> 00:17:17.380
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT CARD YOU JUST DREW.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.184
REALLY?

00:17:19.184 --> 00:17:22.091
IS THAT SWIFT GAIA
THE FIERCE KNIGHT?

00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:23.796
[LAUGHS]

00:17:23.796 --> 00:17:25.098
THAT'S USELESS.

00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:27.003
REMEMBER
MY SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:29.510
ATTACK ME
WITH WHATEVER MONSTER
YOU LIKE,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.180
AND IT STILL
WON'T AFFECT ME.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.054
I'LL JUST REFLECT THE ATTACK
BACK TO YOU.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.894
WITH ONLY 400 LIFE POINTS
TO SPARE,

00:17:36.894 --> 00:17:38.698
YOU'LL WIPE
YOURSELF OUT.

00:17:38.698 --> 00:17:41.037
I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE.

00:17:41.037 --> 00:17:42.641
[SQUEAK]

00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:43.777
HUH?

00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:45.916
ACTIVATE
FACEDOWN CARD.

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:49.658
BEHOLD,
THE MAGIC CARD--
RAINBOW BLESSING.

00:17:49.658 --> 00:17:51.663
WHEN THIS CARD
IS COMBINED
WITH KURIBOH,

00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:53.801
A GREAT POWER
IS RELEASED.

00:17:53.801 --> 00:17:55.739
[SQUEAK]

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:56.909
WHAT?

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.649
YOU EXPECT TO WIN
WITH RAINBOWS AND FUZZ BALLS?

00:17:59.649 --> 00:18:02.055
WHAT KIND OF STUNT
IS THIS?

00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:05.663
[SQUEAK]

00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:10.675
ALL RIGHT,
KURIBOH, FORM
THE RAINBOW ARCH!

00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:11.945
WHAT IS HE DOING?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.692
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CHECK YOUR DECK
MASTER RULEBOOK.

00:18:17.692 --> 00:18:19.531
BUT FIRST
I SHALL SUMMON

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:23.339
SWIFT GAIA
THE FIERCE KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:26.949
AND NOW, TO PUT YOU
OUT OF BUSINESS,
GANSLEY.

00:18:28.218 --> 00:18:31.092
[NEIGHING]

00:18:31.092 --> 00:18:34.166
I'M AFRAID
YOUR MONSTERS
ARE NOT MY TARGETS.

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:37.641
I'M AIMING
DIRECTLY FOR
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.622
BUT HOW?
I ANALYZED EVERY ASPECT
OF THIS DUEL.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:46.429
WELL, YOU SEEM
TO HAVE MISSED
THIS ONE.

00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:49.035
NOW,
MY FIERCE KNIGHT,
ATTACK!

00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:51.307
FOLLOW THE PATH
OF THE RAINBOW ARCH

00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:54.181
AND ATTACK
HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.551
NO! THIS CAN'T BE!

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:59.427
MY DECK MASTER ABILITY
DOESN'T WORK ON DIRECT ATTACKS!

00:18:59.427 --> 00:19:01.432
YES, I KNOW.
THANKS TO KURIBOH,

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.938
I WAS ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT
YOUR WEAKNESS.

00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:07.113
PREPARE
TO BE CRUSHED
BY THE COMPETITION.

00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:09.418
[GROWLING]

00:19:09.418 --> 00:19:11.824
AAH!

00:19:11.824 --> 00:19:13.762
YOU LITTLE BRAT,

00:19:13.762 --> 00:19:16.502
I WAS SO CLOSE
TO WINNING YOUR BODY

00:19:16.502 --> 00:19:19.576
AND LEAVING
THIS VIRTUAL NIGHTMARE
BEHIND FOR GOOD.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.080
[GRUNTS]

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.917
AAH!

00:19:26.627 --> 00:19:29.266
UGH!

00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:32.641
I'M GLAD
THAT'S OVER WITH,
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:34.713
IT'S TIME TO FIND
OUR FRIENDS.

00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:37.086
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT KIND OF DANGER

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:38.622
NOAH MAY HAVE
PUT THEM IN.

00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:39.926
HMM...

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:42.598
[SQUEAK]

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.470
THANK YOU, KURIBOH.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.174
[SQUEAK]

00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:56.198
IT LOOKS LIKE YUGI
WAS STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:57.635
IMPRESSIVE.

00:19:57.635 --> 00:20:00.442
OR PERHAPS THE BIG 5
DON'T REALLY HAVE
THE DUELING SKILLS

00:20:00.442 --> 00:20:02.914
THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE
WHEN I HIRED THEM.

00:20:02.914 --> 00:20:05.922
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE
HOW WELL THE OTHERS FARE

00:20:05.922 --> 00:20:08.762
IN THE COMING DUELS,
WON'T WE?

00:20:10.699 --> 00:20:12.538
HUH?

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:19.488
LOOKS LIKE
A PASSAGEWAY.

00:20:19.488 --> 00:20:20.633
YES.

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:23.670
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
WE MIGHT FIND
THE GANG.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.673
YOU'RE RIGHT. HOPEFULLY,
THAT'S WHERE IT LEADS.

00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:29.075
OUR FRIENDS COULD BE
IN GRAVE DANGER.

00:20:29.075 --> 00:20:31.277
LET'S JUST HOPE
WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.
