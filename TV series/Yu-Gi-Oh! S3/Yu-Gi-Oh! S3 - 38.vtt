00:08:09.243 --> 00:08:12.747
WAIT UP, SETO!

00:08:12.747 --> 00:08:14.248
HOLD ON, KAIBA!

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:16.651
WHY DONCHA DUEL ME?

00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:18.886
WE'LL SEE WHO GET'S
DA THIRD PLACE CROWN.

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:21.088
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU'RE SCARED
'A LOSIN' TA ME?

00:08:21.088 --> 00:08:22.423
HMM...

00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:24.925
HEY!

00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:26.861
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION!

00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:28.462
OUT OF MY WAY, WHEELER!

00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:29.630
YOU THINK
YOU'RE TOO GOOD

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.365
FOR THE REST OF US
DON'T YA!?

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:34.769
WELL, I USED TO BE
A STUBBORN JERK
JUST LIKE YOU ARE.

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:36.304
I PICKED
ON EVERYONE ELSE,

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:39.140
AND INSIDE
I FELT ALONE!

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.142
THEN I WAS IN
A TOUGH SITUATION

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:44.245
AND YUGI STUCK OUT
HIS NECK FOR ME.

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:45.379
AAH!

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:46.847
[GROANING]

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:49.917
Joey, voice-over: HE SHOWED ME
WHAT FRIENDSHIP IS ALL ABOUT!

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.453
NOW I REALIZE
DAT LOOKIN' OUT
FOR OTHA PEOPLE

00:08:52.453 --> 00:08:54.088
ACTUALLY MAKES US
STRONGER!

00:08:54.088 --> 00:08:55.423
YUGI CHANGED MY LIFE
DAT DAY!

00:08:55.423 --> 00:08:57.992
THANKS, JOEY.

00:08:57.992 --> 00:09:00.061
AND I'VE SEEN YUGI
STICK HIS NECK OUT
FOR YOU

00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.962
A WHOLE BUNCH
A TIMES, KAIBA!

00:09:01.962 --> 00:09:03.898
AND DID YOU EVER ONCE
SAY, "THANK YOU?"

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:05.499
NOT DAT I EVER HEARD!

00:09:05.499 --> 00:09:07.134
TRUST ME,
YOU NEED FRIENDS!

00:09:07.134 --> 00:09:09.136
TAKE AWAY ALL
YOUR KAIBACORP FLUNKIES

00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:10.905
AND WHO'S LEFT
ON YOUR TEAM?

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:12.940
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE DONE.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.975
ALL THIS NONSENSE
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:16.811
IS STARTING TO BORE ME,
WHEELER.

00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:18.713
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:18.713 --> 00:09:21.148
THE LAST THING
MY BROTHER NEEDS
IS A LECTURE FROM YOU,

00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:22.583
SO WHY DON'T
YOU JUST LAY OFF!

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:23.651
OH, REALLY?

00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:25.152
HOW CAN YOU
DEFEND DIS GUY

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:26.754
AFTER WHAT HE SAID
ABOUT YOU?

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:29.223
ME? WHAT'D HE SAY?

00:09:29.223 --> 00:09:31.459
HE SAID HE WAS HAPPY
BEING ALL ALONE.

00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:32.793
SO I GUESS
WHAT DAT MEANS

00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:36.497
IS HE DOESN'T NEED
YOU, MOKUBA!

00:09:36.497 --> 00:09:38.632
SOME BIG BROTHER!

00:09:38.632 --> 00:09:39.967
LOOK, PAL!

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:42.036
YOU'VE DONE NOTHIN'
BUT BUST MY CHOPS

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:44.872
ABOUT MY DUEL
MONSTER SKILLS EVER
SINCE I MET YA!

00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:47.141
NOW IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE AFRAID
OF LOSIN' TO ME

00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:48.776
AND LOOKIN' LIKE
A FOOL, KAIBA!

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:50.878
HMM. WATCH IT.

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:53.381
PUSH ME TOO FAR,
AND YOU'LL REGRET IT,
WHEELER.

00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:54.982
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:56.851
SO ARE YOU GONNA
DUEL ME OR WHAT?

00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.253
I'M AFRAID I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE POINT IS

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:01.255
OTHER THAN TO WASTE MY TIME!

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.957
BESIDES, I'D CRUSH YOU.

00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:04.725
DEN PROVE IT TO ME,
RICH BOY.

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:05.793
ALL RIGHT.

00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:07.361
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOUR NONSENSE.

00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:09.897
I'LL ACCEPT THIS
RIDICULOUS CHALLENGE
OF YOURS!

00:10:09.897 --> 00:10:11.365
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:12.366
GOOD.

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:13.534
WE AGREE ON SOMETHIN'!

00:10:13.534 --> 00:10:14.502
BUT, SETO...

00:10:14.502 --> 00:10:15.703
RELAX, MOKUBA!

00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:18.205
I'LL SILENCE THIS AMATEUR
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:21.976
NOW AS SOON AS YOU AND I
BEGIN THIS DUEL OF OURS,
WHEELER,

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:24.211
ALL THE FRIENDS ON EARTH
WON'T SAVE YOU!

00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.246
YEAH?

00:10:25.246 --> 00:10:28.249
DEN BRING IT ON, KAIBA!

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:36.286
Ishizu, voice-over:
THE ULTIMATE BATTLE
IS FAST APPROACHING.

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:38.956
SOON THE PHARAOH
WILL FACE MY BROTHER,

00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:42.960
AND THE FUTURE OF MANKIND
WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.567
Kaiba:
I'LL DESTROY YOU

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.370
EVEN WITHOUT
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,
WHEELER!

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.239
TAKE YER BEST SHOT,
KAIBA!

00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:57.741
TRUST ME,
IT WON'T TAKE MY BEST

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.077
TO DEFEAT AN AMATEUR
LIKE YOU.

00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:01.478
DEN TAKE
YOUR WORST SHOT

00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:05.649
FOR ALL I CARE,
TOUGH GUY!

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:08.886
A'RIGHT!
LET'S DO DIS!

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.921
I GOT A DUEL TO WIN!

00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:12.790
I DON'T THINK
I'VE NEVER SEEN JOEY

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.891
LOOK THIS CONFIDENT
BEFORE, GUYS.

00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:15.659
THAT'S TRUE.

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:19.730
JOEY HAS CERTAINLY
COME AN EXTREMELY LONG WAY
TO GET WHERE HE IS TODAY.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.866
HE KNOWS HE CAN WIN.

00:11:22.866 --> 00:11:25.068
GO, ALLIGATOR'S SWORD!

00:11:25.068 --> 00:11:28.071
TEACH THIS FRAUD A LESSON!

00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:37.414
NOW, BATTLE WARRIOR
AND SWORDSMAN OF LANDSTAR,

00:11:37.414 --> 00:11:40.350
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.418
HE'S DONE WELL.

00:11:41.418 --> 00:11:43.453
EVEN MARIK QUIVERED IN FEAR

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.455
WHEN FACED
WITH JOEY'S SKILLS.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.859
SO NOW I CAN SACRIFICE
ALL 3 'A MY MONSTAS

00:11:48.859 --> 00:11:54.198
TO BRING OUT MY ULTIMATE
FIGHTING MACHINE!

00:11:54.198 --> 00:12:01.038
MEET GILFORD THE LIGHTNING!

00:12:01.038 --> 00:12:04.074
NOW, SHOW HIM WHAT
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY
IS ALL ABOUT

00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:09.813
AND WIPE OUT HIS EEL!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.217
Yami-Yugi: WITH EVERYTHING
JOEY'S LEARNED FROM THIS
BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT,

00:12:13.217 --> 00:12:16.286
I'D SAY HE HAS
A GOOD CHANCE AT FINALLY
DEFEATING KAIBA.

00:12:16.286 --> 00:12:17.354
Tristan: YEAH!

00:12:17.354 --> 00:12:18.488
AND EARNING THE RESPECT
HE DESERVES

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:22.793
FROM THAT STUCK UP PUNK!

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:24.394
Marik, voice-over:
TEA, PLEASE!

00:12:24.394 --> 00:12:29.633
TAKE ME TO MY SISTER.

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:32.369
Joey: I'LL EVEN LET YOU
GO FIRST, KAIBA!

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:35.873
VERY WELL. STAND BACK!

00:12:35.873 --> 00:12:38.475
Kaiba, voice-over:
NOW, IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SHOW
THIS THIRD RATE WANNABE

00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:40.410
WHAT REAL DUELING
IS ALL BOUT!

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.312
THIS'LL BE OVER SOON.

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:49.286
I'LL PLAY
RYU-KISHIN POWERED!

00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:52.155
THEN I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN

00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:53.924
AND END MY TURN!

00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:55.559
Kaiba, voice-over:
HE'LL NEVER SURVIVE

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:58.362
MY SHRINK AND CRUSH
CARD COMBINATION!

00:12:58.362 --> 00:13:00.163
Joey: YOU'LL HAFTA DO
BETTA DEN DAT

00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:02.266
TA BEAT ME, RICH BOY!

00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:03.400
A'RIGHT!

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.168
MY MOVE!

00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:07.104
NOT TOO SHABBY!

00:13:07.104 --> 00:13:08.305
CHECK DIS OUT!

00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:15.445
I PLAY GEARFRIED
THE IRON KNIGHT!

00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:16.880
THAT'S RIGHT, KAIBA!

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.716
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR FACEDOWN
STRATEGIES!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.220
YOU WERE PROBABLY
ALL JAZZED UP ABOUT
YOUR TWO FACEDOWN CARDS!

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.621
WELL TOUGH NOOGIES!

00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:26.990
MAGIC CARDS DON'T WORK
ON GEARFRIED!

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.991
AWESOME!

00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:29.459
THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY,

00:13:29.459 --> 00:13:31.962
BUT I THINK JOEY'S
USING HIS HEAD OUT THERE!

00:13:31.962 --> 00:13:33.463
WELL THAT'S
SOMETHING NEW!

00:13:33.463 --> 00:13:36.166
HE BETTER NOT THINK TOO HARD
OR HE MIGHT HURT HIMSELF!

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.167
HEY WAIT!

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.237
WHERE'D TEA GO?

00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:42.706
SHE PROBABLY JUST WENT
TO THE BATHROOM
OR SOMETHING.

00:13:42.706 --> 00:13:43.807
RELAX!

00:13:43.807 --> 00:13:45.542
C'MON, MAN,
YOU OWN THIS GUY!

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:46.944
DAT'S RIGHT!

00:13:46.944 --> 00:13:53.684
SO, GEARFRIED,
ATTACK HIS RYU-KISHIN
RIGHT NOW!

00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:54.751
WAIT.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.386
DON'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

00:13:56.386 --> 00:14:00.424
REVEAL MY MAGIC CARD...
SHRINK!

00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:02.192
WATCH CLOSELY,

00:14:02.192 --> 00:14:05.462
BECAUSE MY MAGIC CARD
HAS THE POWER TO WEAKEN
ANY MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:07.965
BY CUTTING ITS ATTACK POINTS
RIGHT IN HALF!

00:14:07.965 --> 00:14:10.367
ALTHOUGH,
IT'S NOT YOUR IRON KNIGHT

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:12.135
I PLAN TO USE THIS CARD ON!

00:14:12.135 --> 00:14:13.370
SAY WHAT?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.307
I'M USING IT
TO SHRINK MY OWN MONSTER!

00:14:17.307 --> 00:14:20.711
HOLD ON!
HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE!

00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:22.879
SORRY, WHEELER,
YOU'RE THROUGH,

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:26.316
BECAUSE NOW THAT MY MONSTER
HAS LESS THAN
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:30.287
I CAN ACTIVATE THIS CARD...
MY CRUSH CARD TRAP!

00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:33.857
THIS INFECTS MY OWN MONSTER
WITH A DEVASTATING VIRUS!

00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:37.861
AND NOW THAT
YOUR GEARFRIED ATTACKED IT,
THAT VIRUS WILL SPREAD!

00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:47.404
FIRST IT DESTROYS
YOUR MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:14:47.404 --> 00:14:49.539
THEN THE VIRUS
SPREADS TO YOUR HAND,

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:53.543
THEN YOUR DECK...
CRUSHING EVERY STRONG BEAST!

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.083
OH, NO!
OH, NO!

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.651
OH, YES.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.721
UNFORTUNATELY,
EVERY MONSTER WITH 1500
ATTACK POINTS OR MORE

00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:06.623
IN JOEY'S HAND AND DECK

00:15:06.623 --> 00:15:09.559
WILL BE DESTROYED BY
KAIBA'S CRUSH CARD TRAP.

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:10.861
NOT A GOOD START.

00:15:10.861 --> 00:15:12.396
Joey:
I DON'T BELIEVE DIS!

00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:14.131
JINZO! GILFORD!

00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:16.733
EVERY ONE OF MY POWERFUL
MONSTAS IS TOAST!

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:19.069
LATER, GUYS.

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:20.737
DANKS A LOT!

00:15:20.737 --> 00:15:24.708
A WEAK DUELIST SHOULD HAVE
WEAK MONSTERS, RIGHT?

00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:27.310
I TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE
AN OPPONENT LIKE ME.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.879
ZIP IT!

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:31.815
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD,
WHEELER,

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:34.418
AND LEAVE NOW
BEFORE YOU HURT YOURSELF?

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:35.552
FORGET IT, PAL!

00:15:35.552 --> 00:15:36.820
DIS DUEL JUST STARTED

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.790
AND I GOT STRATEGIES
YA NEVER DREAMED OF!

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.825
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TIME TO QUIT?

00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.293
MY MOVE!

00:15:43.293 --> 00:15:47.164
NOW, SINCE YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS TO PROTECT YOU...

00:15:47.164 --> 00:15:48.965
WELL, YOU FIGURE IT OUT!

00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:50.734
I SUMMON LA JINN!

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:58.341
MEET THE MYSTICAL GENIE
OF THE LAMP!

00:15:58.341 --> 00:15:59.643
AW, MAN!

00:15:59.643 --> 00:16:01.745
JOEY'S LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN
TO AN ATTACK!

00:16:01.745 --> 00:16:03.480
THIS COULD GET UGLY.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.818
I'M AFRAID IT'S TIME
TO SAY GOODBYE TO 1800
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:16:07.818 --> 00:16:10.787
NOW, LA JINN,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.761
Tea: THE TIME IS NEAR,
ISHIZU!

00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:25.063
TEA!

00:16:25.063 --> 00:16:26.698
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:28.866
YOU SEEM A BIT LOST.

00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:31.836
SISTER, IT'S ME AGAIN.

00:16:31.836 --> 00:16:34.839
MARIK!

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.941
YOUR GOOD SIDE
IS BACK!

00:16:36.941 --> 00:16:38.576
[COUGHING]

00:16:38.576 --> 00:16:41.379
Kaiba: HAD ENOUGH YET,
WHEELER?

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:43.047
HANG IN THERE!

00:16:43.047 --> 00:16:44.215
Joey, voice-over: GREAT.

00:16:44.215 --> 00:16:45.950
DANKS TO KAIBA'S
TRAP CARD,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.454
ALL I'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH ARE THESE
MINOR LEAGUE MONSTERS!

00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:50.955
HMM...

00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:54.626
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO BEAT YOU, KAIBA!

00:16:54.626 --> 00:16:56.561
DIS COULD
DEFINITELY HELP.

00:16:56.561 --> 00:17:03.401
FIRST, I'LL SUMMON
SWORDSMAN OF LANDSTAR!

00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:06.070
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
DIS MAGIC CARD...

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.974
GRACEFUL DICE!

00:17:09.974 --> 00:17:11.476
GOOD THINKING, JOEY!

00:17:11.476 --> 00:17:13.378
THAT MAGIC CARD
IS AN EXCELLENT WAY

00:17:13.378 --> 00:17:16.447
TO INCREASE
THE ATTACKING POWER
OF YOUR WEAK MONSTERS!

00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:18.883
YOU CAN TURN THIS DUEL
AROUND, JOEY!

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:19.951
AWESOME!

00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:21.786
NOW JOEY'S SWORDSMAN
OF LANDSTAR

00:17:21.786 --> 00:17:22.954
CAN GAIN ENOUGH
STRENGTH

00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:24.622
TO TAKE DOWN
KAIBA'S MONSTER!

00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:26.624
HE JUST HAS TO ROLL
A HIGH ENOUGH NUMBER

00:17:26.624 --> 00:17:28.426
USING HIS GRACEFUL
DICE CARD!

00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:32.030
YEAH, BUT KAIBA'S GENIE
HAS 1800 ATTACK POINTS,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.601
WHICH MEANS JOEY'S
GOTTA ROLL AT LEAST A 4
IF HE WANTS TO BEAT IT!

00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:44.008
C'MON, JOEY NEEDS
A NEW PAIR OF SHOES!

00:17:44.008 --> 00:17:47.879
Yugi, voice-over:
YOU CAN DO THIS, JOEY!

00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:51.649
Tristan, voice-over:
COME ON, 4 OR HIGHER!

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:55.687
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:55.687 --> 00:17:58.690
Joey, voice-over:
DA MOMENT 'A TRUTH.

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:07.398
YEAH!

00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:09.067
AND DAT'S 4!

00:18:09.067 --> 00:18:10.568
IN YOUR FACE, KAIBA!

00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:12.136
NOW WATCH DIS!

00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:14.472
MY SWORDSMAN'S
ATTACK POINTS QUADRUPLE,

00:18:14.472 --> 00:18:16.708
MAKIN' IT
STRONGER DAN YOURS!

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:17.742
GREAT DUELING!

00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:19.277
NOW ATTACK!

00:18:19.277 --> 00:18:21.813
Joey, voice-over:
NOW DAT'S WHAT I CALL
A CLOSE ONE,

00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:25.616
BUT I CAN'T LET KAIBA
SEE ME SWEAT!

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:28.286
YOU CAN'T WIN A DUEL
WITH LUCK, CHUMP!

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:31.389
MAYBE, BUT IT CERTAINLY
GAVE MY SWORDSMAN ENOUGH POWER

00:18:31.389 --> 00:18:34.092
TO CUT YOUR GENIE DOWN!

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.735
TAKE DAT!

00:18:43.735 --> 00:18:45.837
NOW YOU'RE ANOTHER
200 LIFE POINTS CLOSER

00:18:45.837 --> 00:18:47.472
TO LOSING THIS DUEL, PAL!

00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:49.841
SO YOU WON THAT BATTLE,

00:18:49.841 --> 00:18:51.409
BUT YOU WON'T WIN THE WAR.

00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:53.311
Ishizu: MARIK!

00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:56.280
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE YOU LAST
APPEARED TO ME.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.983
SISTER, IT'S ME!

00:18:58.983 --> 00:19:00.184
YOUR BROTHER!

00:19:00.184 --> 00:19:01.886
YOU'RE MARIK?

00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:04.889
YOU MUST SAVE ODION
RIGHT NOW!

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:06.290
I KNEW THAT
YOUR GOOD HALF

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.626
TOOK SHELTER
WITHIN TEA'S MIND,

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:10.461
BUT I ALSO KNEW
YOU WERE WEAK

00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:12.730
AND COULDN'T HOLD ON
FOR LONG.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.798
THAT'S TRUE.

00:19:13.798 --> 00:19:16.234
AS MY DARK SIDE
GROWS STRONG,

00:19:16.234 --> 00:19:18.302
I GROW WEAK.

00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:20.605
BUT I'VE BEEN
IN TEA'S MIND LONG ENOUGH

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.174
TO HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH
ABOUT OUR PAST.

00:19:23.174 --> 00:19:27.478
THROUGH HER EARS,
I LISTENED TO YOU TELL
THE STORY OF OUR FAMILY,

00:19:27.478 --> 00:19:31.783
AND THE EMERGENCE
OF THE EVIL WITHIN ME.

00:19:31.783 --> 00:19:33.618
I ORDER YOU
TO PUT THAT DOWN!

00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:35.286
AND IF I DON'T?

00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:36.821
MARIK, DROP IT!

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:42.460
Ishizu: MARIK! NO!

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.295
I NEVER KNEW THAT
I WAS THE ONE

00:19:44.295 --> 00:19:46.297
WHO SENT FATHER
TO THE SHADOW REALM.

00:19:46.297 --> 00:19:47.298
YES, BUT--

00:19:47.298 --> 00:19:48.366
I KNOW.

00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:50.067
IT WAS THE EVIL FORCE
WITHIN ME

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:51.803
THAT COMMITTED THE ACT,

00:19:51.803 --> 00:19:54.806
SO YOU CAME HERE
TO SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.

00:19:54.806 --> 00:19:57.742
DESPITE EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
IN MY QUEST FOR POWER,

00:19:57.742 --> 00:19:59.143
YOU'VE HAD FAITH.

00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:01.813
YOU KNEW THERE WAS
STILL GOOD WITHIN ME.

00:20:01.813 --> 00:20:06.050
HOWEVER, THAT GOOD
IS ALMOST COMPLETELY
EXTINGUISHED NOW.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.552
OH, NO!

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:11.622
IF THE EVIL FORCE
DEFEATS THE PHARAOH
IN THE FINAL BATTLE,

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:13.791
YOU WILL BE GONE
FOREVER,

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:16.727
AND THE ENTIRE PLANET
WILL SUFFER GREATLY!

00:20:16.727 --> 00:20:20.965
WELL, I CAN'T ALLOW ONE DUEL
TO DECIDE THE FATE
OF THE WHOLE WORLD!

00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:23.134
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR ME TO STEP IN

00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:25.303
AND RECLAIM MY BODY,
SISTER!

00:20:25.303 --> 00:20:27.238
BUT HOW?

00:20:27.238 --> 00:20:28.472
I DON'T KNOW,

00:20:28.472 --> 00:20:31.309
BUT I MUST BANISH THAT EVIL
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:33.244
THERE'S JUST
TOO MUCH AT RISK.

00:20:33.244 --> 00:20:35.913
NO! IT'S FAR
TOO DANGEROUS!

00:20:35.913 --> 00:20:37.081
WAIT, MARIK!

00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:39.750
SISTER, TAKE CARE OF ODION!

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.751
MARIK!

00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:43.221
DON'T GO! PLEASE!

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:44.222
MARIK! COME BACK!
