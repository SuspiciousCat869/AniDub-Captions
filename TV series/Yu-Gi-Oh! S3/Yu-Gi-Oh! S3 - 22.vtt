YOU CAME IN, SETO.

TRANSFER NOAH'S
MIND TO KAIBA?

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:24.808

A SHORT TIME.

00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:31.314
WHY WOULD I GIVE YOU
NOAH'S MIND WHEN YOURS
WAS PERFECTLY FINE?

00:08:31.314 --> 00:08:33.684
SO I CONCENTRATED
ON TRAINING YOU, SETO,

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:36.386
SO YOU COULD INHERIT
MY EMPIRE.

00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:38.188
BUT THEN YOU STOLE IT.

00:08:38.188 --> 00:08:41.391
SO USING THE SAME
TECHNOLOGY I USED TO DOWNLOAD

00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:43.994

MY COMPUTER NETWORK,

00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:46.029

THAT YOU HAD THE NERVE
TO CALL ME A SNAKE.

I WAS THE MOST POWERFUL
HUMAN BEING ON
THE ENTIRE PLANET

BEFORE YOU CAME ALONG
AND STOLE THAT POWER
AWAY FROM ME, SETO.

ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THAT?

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:44.187

00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:49.426
AND CONNECT THEM BACK
TO THE UNDERWATER BASE

MY SUPERCOMPUTER.
