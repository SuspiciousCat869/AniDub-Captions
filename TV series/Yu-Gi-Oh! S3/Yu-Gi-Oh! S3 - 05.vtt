( Téa )
I've had enough man-eating
giants for today !

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.972
Well, I'm almost there...

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:15.047
I wonder if everyone's
having as much fun as I am.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.194
Does this tunnel
ever end ?

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:22.197
It might.

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:24.369
But only when Noah
wants it to.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.872
You mustn't
forget, Yugi...

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.378
he's controlling
everything around us.

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:30.516
Noah can try to stop
us if he wants to,

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:32.321
but we're gonna
find our friends...

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.323
no matter what !

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:34.358
Right.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.409
( Noah )
Keep running, Yugi...
you fool !

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.784
You're getting absolutely
nowhere very quickly !

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:47.123
But not to worry,
my good friend...

00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:49.763
I have a destination
in mind for you.

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:53.271
Unfortunately, you won't be
anywhere near your friends !

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:55.743
( Yugi )
What's going on ?

00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.553
( yelling )

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:02.560
<i>( Crump )</i>
<i>Mr. Noah ?</i>

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.230
Speak to me, Crump.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.269
<i>( Crump )</i>
<i>I'd like to volunteer</i>
<i>to duel the next</i>

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.774
<i>victim and make up</i>
<i>for Gansley's defeat.</i>

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:09.777
Fine...

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:11.949
just don't fail
me, Crump !

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.421
I've already chosen
your dueling opponent

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.092
and it shouldn't be
too difficult

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:17.996
for you to
defeat her !

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:20.403
Good luck, Téa.

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:29.524
This easily wins the prize
for the worst day ever.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.864
I need a nap.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:34.135
( Téa )
Just a small one so I can...

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:36.942
get my... energy... back.

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:43.758
Hey Yugi, I had a dream that we
were trapped in a virtual world

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:46.531
and we had to duel these
five old guys to escape !

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.835
Ah, Téa ?

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.372
This is the dream !

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:51.310
And when you wake up,
you'll need this card.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.512
I will ?

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:55.319
Yup, it's the
Dark Magician Girl.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.489
Remember ?

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.061
There was a Broadway
play about this card.

00:02:59.061 --> 00:03:00.532
We saw it a few
years ago.

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:02.303
( Téa )
We did ?

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:07.315
Well, not really, but this is
your dream, so just go with it.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:08.818
( man )
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:11.591
The Dark Magician Girl !

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.064
And now, the most
powerful being ever to

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:16.337
step foot on the
Broadway stage will choose

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:18.207
a volunteer from
the audience to

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:20.346
join her in her
first Number !

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.126
Cool !

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:32.141
( man )
Give our volunteer
a big round of applause !

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.811
Thanks, Yugi...

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:37.453
Thanks, Yugi...

00:03:41.797 --> 00:03:43.802
Who's there ?

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:44.937
Wait, I know you !

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.680
I thought I was
seeing things, but

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.986
I really was
rescued by a penguin.

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:52.790
Thanks for getting
me out of that cave.

00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:57.033
Say what ?

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:03.048
I guess I'm supposed
to follow you ?

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:05.888
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any weirder.

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:10.031
There are more
of you guys ?

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:15.411
Well, what do
I have to lose ?

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:16.513
Let's go.

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.766
( Téa )
Take it easy, guys.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.072
Yup, I'm talking
to penguins.

00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:32.117
Mr. Penguin ?

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:34.089
Could you squawk twice
if we're almost there ?

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:35.659
( squawking )

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:36.695
Hey, don't go !

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.913
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.392
Of all the possible
places I could have gone,

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:52.700
I had to end up on a raft ride
to a virtual Antarctica !

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:59.382
Or worse, Planet of
the Penguins !

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.019
Um, hi there.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.824
I come in peace ?

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.762
Uh... take me to
your leader ?

00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:09.540
If I'm gonna
climb 2,000 stairs,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.516
there better be someone up
there who speaks English.

00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:18.695
( Téa )
Hello ?

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:20.099
Is anyone in there ?

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.101
( man )
Of course.

00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.374
Open your eyes and
look around, will ya ?

00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:25.545
You're surrounded
by my penguin army.

00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:27.049
I know !

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.624
I meant is there anyone in here
without feathers and a beak ?

00:05:30.624 --> 00:05:33.498
There's no one here but us
penguins, Téa !

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:34.600
You know my name ?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.340
I know more than
that, Téa Gardner...

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.443
five-foot five...

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:39.946
size six sneaker...

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:42.185
I've got all the
Numbers in my report.

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.424
And I'd say your
Number is up !

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:47.497
Because I'm about to put
the freeze on you !

00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:54.815
Who are you ?

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:56.619
And what do you
want from me, anyway ?

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.991
( man )
Don't tell me you forgot
our last meeting.

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:03.035
I think I'd
remember you.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:04.137
Look...

00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:06.443
things are never what
they appear to be here,

00:06:06.443 --> 00:06:09.384
so when we met earlier
I looked a bit different.

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:10.386
Give up ?

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:11.889
I'm one of
the Big Five !

00:06:14.996 --> 00:06:17.937
The name's Crump, former
accountant of Kaiba Corp.

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:19.541
Disguised as
a penguin ?

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.713
Yes, and I'll explain
all that soon.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:25.588
But for starters, let's do a
quick run through your Numbers.

00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:28.562
According to my notes,
there's a 100% chance

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:30.600
that we're going
to duel !

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.070
Me versus you ?

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.544
Exactly, winner
gets to leave this world,

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:36.582
loser is trapped
here forever.

00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:39.388
Now then, let's get back
to my calculations.

00:06:39.388 --> 00:06:42.061
Says here you've dueled
five times in your life,

00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:45.536
which gives you a 1% chance of
actually winning this duel.

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:48.410
It also says you've eaten
216 slices of pizza.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.417
Hey, how do you know all of
this stuff about me, birdbrain ?

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:53.489
Collecting facts and
figures is my job.

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:55.125
And you'd be surprised
by what Numbers

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:56.596
tell you about
a person's life.

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:57.699
Look, Crump !

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.570
My life's none of
your business !

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.608
I'm going to have
to disagree with you.

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:03.881
I need to know
everything about you.

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.019
That way, when
I win this duel,

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:08.391
I'll be ready to
become you !

00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.527
No way !

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.233
My partners and I no
longer have our own bodies.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.372
So that's why...

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:17.713
Yes, that's why I've taken the
form of a giant virtual penguin

00:07:17.713 --> 00:07:20.620
and come here to live with my
penguin brothers and sisters !

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.092
( clapping )

00:07:23.092 --> 00:07:24.563
Why don't you
stay here !

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:26.668
'Cause I need the
real world, Téa !

00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:28.272
And once I completely
out-duel you

00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:30.878
here in my very
own Palace of Ice,

00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:33.885
I can finally return to the
world disguised as you !

00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:35.723
Listen to me,
Flipper Feet !

00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:38.897
I've had enough of this,
so I'm outta here !

00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:40.133
We'll see
about that !

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:48.052
( Crump )
You can try and run away, Téa,
but the odds are against you !

00:07:51.294 --> 00:07:52.429
What's going on ?

00:07:57.408 --> 00:07:58.911
This can't be good !

00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.948
( Crump )
Nice try !

00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.358
Looks like my iceberg
dueling field

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.365
is about to leave
you cold !

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:09.102
Before we start,
we'll have to choose

00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:12.812
our virtual decks from
this card database.

00:08:12.812 --> 00:08:16.253
Not that it really matters
what cards you decide to pick.

00:08:16.253 --> 00:08:19.428
The probability that you'll be
victorious is slim to none !

00:08:19.428 --> 00:08:21.198
How am I supposed
to choose when I've never

00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:24.673
even seen most of
these cards before !

00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:25.710
Wait !

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.215
That one actually
looks sort of familiar !

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:29.819
Good thing I've
spent so many hours

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:31.724
watching Yugi
and Joey duel.

00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:33.094
Okay.

00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:36.802
As per the new rules it's time
to choose your Deck Master.

00:08:36.802 --> 00:08:39.409
It can be any monster
in your deck.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.681
I know exactly who
I want to choose...

00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:42.816
So check it out !

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:47.695
Dark Magician Girl's my Deck
Master, who's yours ?

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:49.600
I've already taken
the form of a monster

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.240
known as Nightmare
Penguin, you fool !

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.012
So I'm both the duelist
and the Deck Master.

00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:56.683
Two threats in one !

00:08:56.683 --> 00:08:58.989
And once you're put
on ice, I'll be free

00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:01.461
to waddle my way
to the real world !

00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:02.731
Guess again, Crump !

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:11.285
It's time to duel,
shorty !

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.490
Which door to choose ?

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.562
If we don't pick one,
we're stuck here.

00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:17.098
Don't touch it !

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.772
We have to test all
these doors for traps first.

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:28.927
Testing doors is
definitely smart.

00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:30.397
It's true.

00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:34.941
We won our duel, but I sense a
whole new game has just begun.

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.116
Time to kick your
feathered butt !

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:40.220
Hmm... Mirror Force...

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.526
To begin I'll place
one card facedown...

00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:46.335
And then I'll summon
Ancient Elf to the field !

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:47.972
And that's all
for now, Crump.

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.147
Now the fun begins.

00:09:51.147 --> 00:09:52.484
Watch this...

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:55.858
I'll start off by summoning
my Giant Red Seasnake !

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.701
And he gets
a little power boost.

00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.738
How did your snake get more
attack points already ?

00:10:01.738 --> 00:10:03.108
Well...

00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:06.317
My Deck Master's Special Ability
increases the attack power

00:10:06.317 --> 00:10:09.758
of every Water Monster on my
side of the dueling field.

00:10:09.758 --> 00:10:12.531
So now my snake
has 2,000 attack points

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.071
and that's a Number
you can't argue with !

00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:16.942
( Téa )
That's what
you think !

00:10:16.942 --> 00:10:19.715
So, are you going
to attack me or what ?

00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:20.784
( Crump )
Patience.

00:10:20.784 --> 00:10:23.023
We accountants are
a cautious bunch.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.761
I never rush
into anything unless

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:27.266
the Numbers are
there to support it.

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:31.042
To attack now, I'd have to
ignore one important fact...

00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:32.579
your facedown card !

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:35.787
I'm more than 90%
sure it's a trap.

00:10:35.787 --> 00:10:37.090
That's not the
kind of risk a man

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.129
in my position can
afford to take.

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:41.634
Of course there's
one way around that.

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:44.641
I can activate
the magic card Cold Wave !

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.257
When Cold Wave is in effect,
it freezes all magic

00:10:51.257 --> 00:10:55.167
and trap cards on
the field for one full turn,

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:59.210
which means your Ancient Elf
is now a sitting duck !

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.347
Attack, mighty Seasnake !

00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:05.792
Oh no, my
life points !

00:11:08.164 --> 00:11:10.503
Oops, I forgot
to mention...

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.009
As each duelist's
life points decrease,

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:14.880
his or her body
will become encased

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.553
in a block of
solid ice !

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:20.928
So get ready for quite
a chilling ending !

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:24.537
Your mind will be frozen
stiff until the end of time !

00:11:31.654 --> 00:11:33.591
Man, it's cold...

00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.898
( Téa )
I can't take this
much longer !

00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:37.301
Téa !

00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:38.303
Where are you, Téa ?

00:11:38.303 --> 00:11:39.439
Tell me !

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:41.010
It's... so... cold...

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.780
Téa needs our
help right now !

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.150
We have to find
what part of this

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.255
virtual world Noah
sent her to !

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:49.196
Noah's letting us
hear her just to torture us.

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:50.532
What a cruel trick.

00:11:50.532 --> 00:11:52.771
We have to break out
of here and find her !

00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:58.084
Don't panic, Yugi.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:00.223
That's just what
Noah wants you to do.

00:12:00.223 --> 00:12:01.793
What about Téa ?

00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:03.663
Look up over
the doors.

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:05.970
A star ?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.272
Of course !

00:12:07.272 --> 00:12:09.678
In Duel Monsters, stars
represent a card's strength.

00:12:09.678 --> 00:12:11.215
Right.

00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:14.957
So I'd say behind that door,
a one-star monster awaits us.

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:17.497
And I bet if we
can defeat it you

00:12:17.497 --> 00:12:20.136
and I can get
through that doorway !

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:23.478
I summon Winged Dragon,
Guardian of the Fortress !

00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:26.285
Attack !

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:28.223
And see what's
behind door number one !

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:37.411
Wow.

00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:39.015
All right,
we'll go in...

00:12:40.017 --> 00:12:41.788
But who knows
where it leads ?

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:43.426
Hopefully to Téa !

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:46.399
( Crump )
What's the matter, Tea,
got cold feet ?

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.304
Real funny, Crump.

00:12:48.304 --> 00:12:50.375
You accountants
are hysterical.

00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:55.220
I-- I place a monster
in defense mode.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.993
Sounds like someone's
got a case of the chills.

00:12:57.993 --> 00:12:59.197
You should really
dress more

00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:01.736
appropriately for
the weather, dear.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.547
Sorry, my tux was
at the cleaners !

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:07.984
You got spunk, kid.

00:13:07.984 --> 00:13:11.893
Too bad it'll all go to waste
when your mind is frozen here !

00:13:11.893 --> 00:13:13.598
Now then...

00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:16.571
Let's see... this could
take me some time...

00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:19.812
this card's good, but,
there's always these...

00:13:19.812 --> 00:13:20.815
Hurry up, beak breath.

00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:21.817
It's freezing !

00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:23.087
So just go !

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:26.595
I need to weigh the percentages
before I make my decision.

00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:30.037
Dark Magician Girl isn't much
of a risk to me on her own,

00:13:30.037 --> 00:13:32.109
but if you added
other cards,

00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:34.414
she could become
more of a threat !

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.818
Add other cards
to her ?

00:13:35.818 --> 00:13:36.820
Of course.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.958
Every duelist knows
that fact !

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.228
What's the problem ?

00:13:40.228 --> 00:13:42.032
There is no problem.

00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:45.106
Oh I get it, you forgot
to devise a strategy

00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:47.980
when you were
picking all your cards !

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.082
I knew it !

00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:51.589
Only a pure amateur would
make that mistake !

00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:56.801
I'll keep you guessing by
playing these two cards.

00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:58.271
Then I'll wait
for your meltdown.

00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.741
( Téa )
Hmm...

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:03.416
He didn't attack, which means he
must be planning something big.

00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:06.357
Soon my brain will be inside
that empty head of yours.

00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:08.195
Then I'll finally
be free !

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:11.637
You're not flying the
coop just yet, so chill out.

00:14:11.637 --> 00:14:13.708
I play Mystical
Space Typhoon !

00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.712
This card allows me
to destroy one of

00:14:15.712 --> 00:14:17.751
your trap or
magic cards !

00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:19.121
So say goodbye
to that one !

00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:21.727
You took my bait !

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:25.670
You destroyed one trap card
only to fall victim to another !

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.778
It's called
Driving Snow !

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.016
When activated, it
creates a giant blizzard

00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:33.622
to blow away one of
your facedown cards !

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:36.562
So get ready for the storm
of the century !

00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:40.339
Cold enough for ya ?

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:42.944
Now you've got nothing
to stop my attack,

00:14:42.944 --> 00:14:45.918
so my Giant Seasnake is
free to strike !

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.154
Oh yeah ?

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.828
It'll take a lot more
than that to freeze me out !

00:14:53.904 --> 00:14:55.975
( Crump )
Isn't the weather
wonderful today ?

00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:58.915
It's a pleasant
negative 16 degrees !

00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:00.352
( Dark Magician Girl )
Téa, wait !

00:15:00.352 --> 00:15:04.029
My Deck Master ability allows
us to communicate mentally.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.832
I'm here to guide you.

00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:07.937
Okay, you have
my trust.

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:12.014
Now I activate
this card !

00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:14.253
Offerings to
the Doomed !

00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:18.663
Looks like I've got
this duel all wrapped up,

00:15:18.663 --> 00:15:21.737
'cause my magic card destroys
one of your monsters !

00:15:21.737 --> 00:15:22.873
See ya, snakey !

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:26.849
Now for my
facedown monster.

00:15:26.849 --> 00:15:29.322
I'll switch it from
defense to attack mode !

00:15:29.322 --> 00:15:32.496
Reveal Fire Sorcerer !

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:38.076
Pretty cool, right ?

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:41.485
And now, it's time
to warm things up a bit !

00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:51.442
Much better.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:54.816
Next I'll activate Fire
Sorcerer's special ability !

00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:56.921
By discarding two
of my cards...

00:15:56.921 --> 00:16:00.129
I'm able to burn through
800 of your life points !

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.003
Ouch !

00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.573
Hot, hot, hot !

00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:10.520
And don't think I'm
finished with you yet, Crump !

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.430
Fire Sorcerer, put that
bird on the hot seat !

00:16:19.642 --> 00:16:21.647
And since you lost
life points,

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.786
your own rule gets
turned against you !

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:25.723
How do you like
being frozen ?

00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:27.695
I absolutely
love it !

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.700
If you hadn't noticed,
I'm a penguin

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.805
and we like things
on the cool side.

00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:34.545
Or do you need a lesson
on Antarctic birds ?

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:37.485
Well now that you mention it,
I do have a question, Crump.

00:16:37.485 --> 00:16:39.155
Where did I get
my good looks from ?

00:16:39.155 --> 00:16:40.525
No, not quite.

00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:42.731
I wanna know why you're
so obsessed with penguins.

00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:44.401
Not that it's any
of your business,

00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:46.139
but when I was
a young man,

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:47.876
these little
flightless birds saved

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.283
me from living
a life of misery !

00:16:50.283 --> 00:16:53.891
You see, I was an only child and
my parents were never around.

00:16:53.891 --> 00:16:57.566
They worked late and were too
tired to spend any time with me.

00:16:57.566 --> 00:16:59.505
So to entertain
myself I would sit

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:01.509
for hours and
count things...

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.949
crumbs on the rug,
dots on the wallpaper,

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:05.786
whatever I could find.

00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:08.392
Then one day while counting
books on the shelf,

00:17:08.392 --> 00:17:10.931
I discovered a book
about penguins.

00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:13.103
I learned that
a mother and father penguin

00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:16.411
actually take turns
sitting on their eggs.

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.048
These birds had
a bond with their

00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:20.822
children that I never
knew could exist.

00:17:20.822 --> 00:17:24.163
From then on my life revolved
around my two loves:

00:17:24.163 --> 00:17:25.900
Numbers and penguins,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.142
and I devoted
myself to both.

00:17:29.142 --> 00:17:31.514
As I grew I dreamt
of a career that would

00:17:31.514 --> 00:17:33.719
combine my two
great passions.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.559
Then one day that
dream almost came true.

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:40.201
I climbed my way to the top of
the Kaiba Corporation as the

00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:42.875
company's chief accountant
and Number expert.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:46.283
And I had an idea that would
have tripled our profits,

00:17:46.283 --> 00:17:48.388
an All-Penguin
theme park.

00:17:48.388 --> 00:17:51.495
So I brought my proposal
to Seto Kaiba...

00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:53.867
( Seto Kaiba )
Please, don't waste
my time.

00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:56.808
We're a gaming corporation
not a petting zoo.

00:17:56.808 --> 00:17:59.247
Look Crump, stick
to your calculator.

00:17:59.247 --> 00:18:01.820
That good-for-nothing
punk shot down my dream,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.529
and once I'm free from here
I'll finally have my revenge !

00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:07.801
( Téa )
But what does that
have to do with me ?

00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:10.273
I told you I need
a human body in order

00:18:10.273 --> 00:18:12.947
to escape from
this cyber realm.

00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:15.820
You just happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.229
In the future, be more careful
about who you hang around with.

00:18:19.229 --> 00:18:20.966
Of course, the odds
of you actually

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.304
having a future
are slim to none !

00:18:23.304 --> 00:18:24.875
So let's continue
this duel so

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.980
I can get out of
this place already !

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.416
Now I summon...

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:31.223
Flying Penguin !

00:18:33.428 --> 00:18:36.235
And thanks to my
Deck Master's special ability,

00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:39.042
it gains 200 attack
points right away !

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:40.980
But that's just
the beginning !

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.386
Next I'll play
Penguin Sword, raising

00:18:43.386 --> 00:18:46.059
its attack strength
800 more points !

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:47.329
That's not good.

00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:48.599
My monster's toast !

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.601
That's right !

00:18:49.601 --> 00:18:52.073
And now my
Flying Penguin...

00:18:52.073 --> 00:18:54.379
Attack her
Fire Sorcerer !

00:18:57.453 --> 00:18:58.589
That's my
last defense !

00:19:00.126 --> 00:19:04.135
And since you lost more life
points, the freezing continues !

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:05.339
( Téa )
You're s-sick !

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:07.176
It'll all be
over soon, Téa.

00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.549
Your life points
are down almost 50%

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:12.054
and with no more defensive
monsters to hide behind,

00:19:12.054 --> 00:19:13.892
you're out
in the cold !

00:19:13.892 --> 00:19:15.095
You wish !

00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:20.140
We don't seem to
be getting anywhere !

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.878
( Téa )
It's... freezing...

00:19:21.878 --> 00:19:23.382
... my legs are... numb !

00:19:23.382 --> 00:19:25.287
We're coming, Téa !

00:19:25.287 --> 00:19:27.625
We gotta find our way
outta here, right now !

00:19:29.095 --> 00:19:30.064
Yugi.

00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:31.067
Look on the floor...

00:19:31.067 --> 00:19:32.102
Huh ?

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:36.223
That's the same
coin I threw at the door !

00:19:36.223 --> 00:19:37.325
We were here, before !

00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:38.659
So...

00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:41.662
that means we've just been
running around in circles !

00:19:42.963 --> 00:19:44.999
( Crump )
A little chilly,
are we ?

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:47.168
That's the least
of your worries !
