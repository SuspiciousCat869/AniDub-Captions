00:14:38.487 --> 00:14:40.825
THIS CARD LETS ME
MOVE ONE MAGIC CARD

00:14:40.825 --> 00:14:42.995
FROM MY DECK
TO MY HAND--

00:14:42.995 --> 00:14:45.533
ONCE I'VE DISCARDED
EVERY CARD I'M HOLDING!

00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:48.271
SO, I'LL TAKE THE ONE
CARD I NEED--

00:14:48.271 --> 00:14:50.275
MY MONSTER REBORN!

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:51.778
YOU'RE THROUGH!

00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:53.482
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:14:53.482 --> 00:14:55.752
REVEAL EXCHANGE!

00:14:55.752 --> 00:14:58.390
THIS ALLOWS EACH OF
US TO DRAW A CARD

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.228
FROM THE OTHER'S
HAND!

00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:01.295
CHOOSE A CARD!

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:02.565
[GROWLS]

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:05.170
AND HAND OVER YOUR
MONSTER REBORN, NOW!

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.339
[GROANS]

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:07.574
ALL RIGHT!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.277
NICE MOVE, YUG!

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:10.513
TAKE IT.

00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:13.218
WITH PLEASURE.

00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:14.621
[LAUGHS]

00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:16.958
HMM.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.227
TOO BAD.

00:15:18.227 --> 00:15:23.704
NOW MARIK CAN'T BRING BACK
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD.

00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:25.040
[THINKING]
LITTLE DOES HE KNOW

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.645
I HAVE ANOTHER
WAY TO SUMMON RA!

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:29.982
I'LL USE
MONSTER REBORN

00:15:29.982 --> 00:15:32.086
TO BRING BACK
QUEEN'S KNIGHT!

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:35.826
AND THEN I SHALL SUMMON
MY KING'S KNIGHT!

00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:40.101
[GROWLING]

00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:43.207
WHEN KING'S AND QUEEN'S
KNIGHT ARE IN PLAY,

00:15:43.207 --> 00:15:46.446
THEIR SPECIAL
ABILITY ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON THIS...

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:51.455
JACK'S KNIGHT!

00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:55.163
NOW I HAVE 3 MONSTERS ON
MY SIDE OF THE FIELD, MARIK!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.399
AND YOU HAVE ONLY ONE!

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:59.838
I'M NOT IMPRESSED.

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:01.608
[LAUGHING]

00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:03.345
YOU'RE PLANNING
TO SACRIFICE

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:04.914
ALL 3 OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:06.851
SO YOU CAN
SUMMON SLIFER!

00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:09.756
AND WHEN YOU DO,
I'LL BE READY!

00:16:09.756 --> 00:16:11.025
COME ON!

00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.494
HE'S BLUFFING, DUDE!

00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:14.098
ATTACK THIS FREAK!

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.435
YEAH, MARIK'S RIGHT
WHERE YOU WANT HIM!

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:18.706
IT'S TIME TO ROCK
HIS WORLD NOW!

00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:19.908
HOLD ON, GUYS!

00:16:19.908 --> 00:16:22.847
MARIK STILL HAS TWO
CARDS FACE DOWN!

00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:24.216
YUGI'S GOTTA
BE CAREFUL!

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.387
Marik: YOU JUST
SAID IT YOURSELF...

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:28.824
YOUR MONSTERS
OUTNUMBER MINE!

00:16:28.824 --> 00:16:30.328
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:32.298
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR!?

00:16:32.298 --> 00:16:34.001
ATTACK ME!

00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:35.270
[THINKING]
ONCE HE ATTACKS,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.443
I'LL UNLEASH MY
SECRET WEAPON!

00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:39.578
WELL?

00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:41.248
HAS THE MIGHTY
PHARAOH REALIZED

00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:43.786
THAT THERE'S NO WAY
HE CAN PREVAIL!?

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:45.790
[LAUGHS]

00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:51.931
[CHUCKLING]

00:16:51.931 --> 00:16:52.933
[THINKING]
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PHARAOH

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:54.469
IS AFRAID TO ATTACK.

00:16:54.469 --> 00:16:56.406
I END MY TURN.

00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:57.442
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:16:57.442 --> 00:16:58.644
THAT'S IT?

00:16:58.644 --> 00:17:00.614
YUGI COULD HAVE DONE
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE

00:17:00.614 --> 00:17:02.651
IF HE ATTACKED WITH
ONE OF HIS KNIGHTS!

00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:04.655
DON'T BE SO SURE.

00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:06.324
I THINK HE DID
THE RIGHT THING

00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:08.795
BY CHILLING OUT
AND WAITING TO ATTACK, GUYS.

00:17:08.795 --> 00:17:10.164
I AGREE!

00:17:10.164 --> 00:17:11.701
HE'S GOT GREAT INSTINCTS,

00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:13.604
AND HE KNEW
THE TIME WASN'T RIGHT.

00:17:13.604 --> 00:17:15.141
I'D DO THAT, TOO.

00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:17.412
MARIK'S DEFINITELY GOT
SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.582
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:20.818
MY MOVE!

00:17:20.818 --> 00:17:24.725
I'LL PLACE ONE MORE
CARD FACEDOWN.

00:17:24.725 --> 00:17:26.796
ALL RIGHT, NOW...

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.666
I COULD END
THIS SHORTLY!

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:29.734
ALTHOUGH...

00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:31.505
IT WOULD BE
MUCH MORE AMUSING

00:17:31.505 --> 00:17:34.710
TO EXTEND THIS GAME
AND PROLONG YOUR SUFFERING!

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.847
SINCE YOU'RE GOING
TO LOSE THIS DUEL

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.620
WHEN I PLAY MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD...

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.226
I'VE DECIDED TO OFFER YOU
SOME ASSISTANCE, PHARAOH,

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:44.796
SO, YOU CAN PLAY YOURS!

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.898
[GASPS]

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.171
THEREFORE I SHALL
PLAY THIS MAGIC CARD--

00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:51.341
CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.979
SO, WE MUST EACH
DRAW FROM OUR DECK

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:56.217
UNTIL WE'RE HOLDING
6 CARDS IN OUR HAND!

00:17:56.217 --> 00:17:59.657
JUST CONSIDER THAT A GIFT!

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:02.528
NOW, SELECT YOUR CARDS!

00:18:02.528 --> 00:18:03.931
AND BEST OF LUCK.

00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.768
WHO KNOWS WHAT
YOU'LL DRAW!?

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:06.903
HMM!

00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:11.044
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ABOUT
TO REGRET THAT MOVE.

00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:14.283
Marik: HAVE YOU DRAWN YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD?

00:18:14.283 --> 00:18:16.287
OR DO YOU NEED MORE HELP?

00:18:16.287 --> 00:18:18.825
I SUPPOSE I'LL
FIND OUT SOON.

00:18:18.825 --> 00:18:21.664
I'LL SWITCH JURAGEDO
TO DEFENSE MODE

00:18:21.664 --> 00:18:22.967
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:26.172
ALL RIGHT, MARIK,
MY MOVE!

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:28.109
GO AHEAD,
PHARAOH!

00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:30.013
SUMMON YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD...

00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:31.082
IF YOU CAN!

00:18:31.082 --> 00:18:34.020
LET'S SEE WHAT
THE GREAT SLIFER CAN DO!

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.591
Yugi: I SACRIFICE
MY JACK'S KNIGHT,

00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:37.727
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT,

00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:38.929
AND MY KING'S
KNIGHT

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:43.906
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:18:43.906 --> 00:18:47.445
REVEAL YOURSELF,
MY ALL-POWERFUL BEAST!

00:18:55.994 --> 00:18:58.465
[ROARS]

00:18:58.465 --> 00:18:59.935
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:01.070
THE WAR BEGINS!

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.574
ALL RIGHT!
YEAH!
COOL!

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:04.076
WAY TO GO, YUG!

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.113
SLIFER'S GOT
YOUR BACK NOW!

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:08.451
AND WITH 6,000
ATTACK POINTS,
YOU'RE SET!

00:19:08.451 --> 00:19:10.554
MARIK'S MOVE BACKFIRED!

00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:13.193
NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES,
THAT FREAK IS TOAST!

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.298
SO, ATTACK HIM
AND WIN THIS DUEL, PAL!

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:18.169
[THINKING]
COULD THIS BE THE END?

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:20.139
[ROARING]

00:19:20.139 --> 00:19:22.844
BEHOLD THE POWER
OF SLIFER...

00:19:22.844 --> 00:19:25.616
AND ITS
THUNDERFORCE ATTACK!

00:19:25.616 --> 00:19:27.419
[LAUGHING]

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:28.421
HUH?

00:19:28.421 --> 00:19:30.057
YOUR MONSTER'S NOTHING.

00:19:30.057 --> 00:19:31.526
I HAVE THIS!

00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:33.530
REVEAL MAGIC CARD--

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.401
DARK SPELL
REGENERATION!

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.503
NO!

00:19:36.503 --> 00:19:39.041
HEY, SETO,
WHAT'S THAT?

00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:40.710
IT'S A RARE CARD.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.215
WITH IT, MARIK CAN
MOVE ANY MAGIC CARD

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:44.952
HE WANTS FROM
THE CARD GRAVEYARD

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.189
BACK TO THE FIELD NOW!

00:19:47.189 --> 00:19:48.458
ANY ONE
HE WANTS!?

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:51.196
YES, AND WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:19:51.196 --> 00:19:52.666
AND NOW...

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:55.405
I'LL CHOOSE TO PLAY
MONSTER REBORN, PHARAOH,

00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:57.642
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO REVIVE

00:19:57.642 --> 00:20:01.249
MY MIGHTY WINGED
DRAGON OF RA!

00:20:01.249 --> 00:20:03.052
NOW, MY DRAGON,

00:20:03.052 --> 00:20:07.760
EMERGE IN YOUR
UNSTOPPABLE PHOENIX MODE!

Marik: MY EGYPTIAN GOD

00:20:19.515 --> 00:20:22.388
HAS NEUTRALIZED
THE POWER OF YOURS!

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.457
IN THIS MODE,

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:26.328
RA IS IMMORTAL
FOR ONE WHOLE TURN,

00:20:26.328 --> 00:20:29.134
SO NOTHING YOU
DO CAN STOP IT!

AND I OUGHT TO KNOW!

00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:35.545
IT KNOCKED ME OUT COLD!

THANKS TO THE FIERY
WRATH OF RA,

00:20:37.994 --> 00:20:41.064
LITTLE YUGI WILL SOON BE
