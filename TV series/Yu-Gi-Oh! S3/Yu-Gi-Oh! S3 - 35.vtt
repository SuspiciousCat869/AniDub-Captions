00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:30.725
I UNDERSTAND THAT
I NEED TO WIN, YUGI!

00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:32.994
YOU CAN'T DENY
WHAT WE BOTH SAW!

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:33.995
HUH?

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:35.196
YUGI!

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:36.631
DON'T BE A FOOL!

00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.966
THAT WAS NOTHING MORE
THAN AN ILLUSION!

00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:42.870
KAIBA! ACKNOWLEDGE
THE TRUTH!

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.439
THIS IS FATE!

00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:46.707
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
DESTINED TO DUEL
EACH OTHER

00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:48.843
FOR 5,000 YEARS!

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:51.846
WHATEVER!
LET'S JUST END THIS NOW!

00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:00.848
Yami-Yugi: I'M DUELING
FOR SO MUCH MORE

00:10:00.848 --> 00:10:03.051
THAN A MERE
TOURNAMENT VICTORY.

00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:04.352
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:07.321
I JOINED THIS
TO HELP SAVE MANKIND,

00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.590
AND NOTHING
WILL STAND IN MY WAY!

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.995
THAT INCLUDES YOU,
KAIBA!

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:16.097
BELIEVE WHATEVER
YOU WANT, YUGI.

00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:18.433
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER SOON!

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:22.303
Yami-Marik: YES,
EVERYTHING WILL SOON BE OVER.

00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:24.939
[THINKING]
I JUST NEED TO INSURE
THAT KAIBA'S LINK

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:29.277
TO MY MILLENNIUM ROD DOESN'T
INTERFERE WITH MY PLANS!

00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:33.848
I MUST WIN THIS TOURNAMENT
IN ORDER TO GAIN INFINITE POWER!

00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:36.718
LAST I CHECKED,
IT WAS STILL
YOUR MOVE, KAIBA!

00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:39.387
NOW YOU'RE STARTING
TO MAKE SOME SENSE!

00:10:39.387 --> 00:10:41.622
LET'S MOVE ON
SO I CAN END THIS

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:45.093
AND CLAIM THE VICTORY
I DESERVE!

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:46.928
I HOPE YOU'RE READY!

00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:48.229
HMM.

00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:49.464
ALL RIGHT!

00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:53.601
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD!

00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:57.271
I DON'T NEED AN EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD TO DEFEAT YOU!

00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:01.109
[THINKING]
I HAVE A MORE RELIABLE CARD
IN MY HAND NOW!

00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:03.244
MY BLUE EYES!

00:11:03.244 --> 00:11:05.713
IT'S MY MOVE NOW!

00:11:05.713 --> 00:11:08.750
Yugi, thinking:
OH, NO! NOT GAZELLE!

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.685
I CAN'T WIPE OUT
KAIBA'S LIFE POINTS
WITH THIS!

00:11:10.685 --> 00:11:12.754
IT'S TOO WEAK!

00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:14.756
Yami-Marik:
HA HA HA HA!

00:11:14.756 --> 00:11:17.158
[THINKING]
KAIBA HAS NO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:18.860
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.661
HIS LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.998
FOR THE PHARAOH TO ATTACK.

00:11:23.998 --> 00:11:25.366
ALL RIGHT!

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:26.934
I SUMMON GAZELLE,

00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:31.072
THE KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:31.072 --> 00:11:33.441
[ROAR]

00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:35.076
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:35.076 --> 00:11:38.312
IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT,
YOU'RE DONE!

00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:41.516
BEHOLD MY TRAP!

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:42.817
[ROAR]

00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:43.851
Yami-Yugi: WHAT!?

00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:45.386
BUT THAT'S...

00:11:45.386 --> 00:11:48.656
YES, MY CLONING TRAP CARD
HAS MADE AN EXACT DUPLICATE

00:11:48.656 --> 00:11:51.192
OF YOUR KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS, YUGI!

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:52.960
TOO BAD!

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.695
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE TIED AGAIN!

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:58.332
THEN I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN NOW.

00:11:58.332 --> 00:12:00.802
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:12:00.802 --> 00:12:01.936
SORRY, YUGI,

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:04.639
BUT YOU'VE JUST MADE
YOUR FINAL MOVE!

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:06.174
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:06.174 --> 00:12:08.609
FOR THE MONSTER THAT
I NOW HOLD IN MY HAND

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:11.245
IS THE KEY TO YOUR
ULTIMATE DEMISE.

00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:12.246
[GASP]

00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:13.481
ALL I NEED TO DO

00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:15.917
IS SACRIFICE THE GAZELLE
I GOT FROM YOU,

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:18.352
AND I CAN SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD!

00:12:18.352 --> 00:12:19.654
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:19.654 --> 00:12:21.255
SO PREPARE TO FEEL
THE WRATH

00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:24.091
OF MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:26.127
BLUE EYES!?
BUT HOW!?

00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:28.963
YOU NEED TO SACRIFICE
TWO MONSTERS FOR THAT!

00:12:28.963 --> 00:12:30.731
IS THAT SO?

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.434
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THINGS AREN'T
ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM!

00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:35.436
ENOUGH TALK, KAIBA.

00:12:35.436 --> 00:12:38.472
JUST MAKE YOUR MOVE
SO WE CAN END
THIS DUEL!

00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:42.276
YES, ENDING THIS DUEL
IS EXACTLY WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO DO!

00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:46.214
THANKS TO THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:49.217
YUGI! YOU WERE CORRECT.

00:12:49.217 --> 00:12:53.654
SUMMONING BLUE EYES USUALLY
REQUIRES TWO SACRIFICES.

00:12:53.654 --> 00:12:55.990
HOWEVER, THANKS
TO MY MAGIC CARD,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.093
THAT RULE NO LONGER
HOLDS TRUE NOW!

00:12:59.093 --> 00:13:01.896
THIS CARD IS THE KEY
TO UNLOCKING MY GREAT BEAST

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:03.698
AND WIPING YOU OUT!

00:13:03.698 --> 00:13:04.765
BEHOLD!

00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.567
MY COST DOWN MAGIC CARD!

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:07.802
[GASP]

00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:10.738
NOW MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON
IS INSTANTLY REDUCED

00:13:10.738 --> 00:13:14.442
FROM AN 8-STAR MONSTER
TO A 6-STAR MONSTER!

00:13:14.442 --> 00:13:16.444
Yugi, thinking: OH, NO!

00:13:16.444 --> 00:13:19.347
THAT MEANS KAIBA
ONLY NEEDS TO SACRIFICE
ONE MONSTER

00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:20.514
TO SUMMON IT!

00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:22.283
THE TIME HAS COME!

00:13:22.283 --> 00:13:24.018
AND MARK MY WORDS...

00:13:24.018 --> 00:13:27.121
THIS IS NO ILLUSION,
YOU FOOL!

00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:30.024
FIRST, I SACRIFICE
MY GAZELLE CLONE!

00:13:30.024 --> 00:13:31.359
[ROAR]

00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:32.493
AND NOW...

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:34.795
I SUMMON BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:36.430
[ROAR]

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.999
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:40.601
YEAH! TAKE IT
TO THE HOOP, SETO!

00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:43.671
NOTHING CAN STOP YOU NOW!

00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:46.941
Yami-Marik, thinking:
WELL, PERHAPS
I'LL BE FACING KAIBA

00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:50.478
IN THE NEXT ROUND
AFTER ALL.

00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:51.679
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:53.581
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO FINALLY PUT AN END

00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:56.050
TO THIS FEUD RIGHT NOW!

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:02.390
BLUE-EYES, ATTACK
HIS GAZELLE WITH
WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.326
[GRUNTING]

00:14:05.326 --> 00:14:07.261
HA HA HA!

00:14:07.261 --> 00:14:09.630
YOU MAY AS WELL THROW IN
THE TOWEL, YUGI!

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.832
YOUR ONLY MONSTER'S GONE!

00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:13.768
AND UNLESS YOU CAN
SUMMON SOMETHING

00:14:13.768 --> 00:14:16.070
WITH OVER 3,000
ATTACK POINTS...

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.072
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.574
Yugi, thinking:
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE CHANCE

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:28.143
TO DEFEAT KAIBA'S
BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON...

00:14:28.143 --> 00:14:29.845
BUT IT'S A LONG SHOT!

00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:32.247
IF THE IMAGES
OF THE PAST WE SAW
ARE TRUE,

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.683
AND HISTORY IS
REPEATING ITSELF...

00:14:34.683 --> 00:14:36.685
THEN IN ORDER TO TAKE
DOWN KAIBA'S BLUE-EYES,

00:14:36.685 --> 00:14:40.622
I HAFTA SUMMON
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:42.991
AND THIS IS
MY LAST CHANCE!

00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:45.160
IF I DON'T DRAW
THE CARD I NEED NOW,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.764
KAIBA WINS THE DUEL,
AND I'M OUT
OF THE FINALS!

00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.599
[AS YAMI-YUGI]
STAND BACK, KAIBA!

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:54.369
BEHOLD THE TRUTH!

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:57.072
I KNOW YOU SAW
THE SAME VISIONS
THAT I DID!

00:14:57.072 --> 00:14:59.741
AND I'M ABOUT
TO PROVE IT, KAIBA!

00:14:59.741 --> 00:15:01.143
THAT'S RIGHT...

00:15:01.143 --> 00:15:05.080
YOU AND I
BATTLED EACH OTHER
5,000 YEARS AGO!

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.884
AND NOW DESTINY
HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER
ONCE AGAIN!

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.619
IT'S TRUE! LOOK!

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:13.422
I USE MONSTER REBORN
TO BRING BACK A MONSTER

00:15:13.422 --> 00:15:15.190
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.860
THE SERVANT OF
THE ANCIENT PHARAOH--

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.194
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

[GASP]

00:15:20.229 --> 00:15:25.601
NOW, DARK MAGICIAN,
COME FORTH!

00:15:25.601 --> 00:15:27.736
[THINKING]
WHEN I PLAYED
MY LIFE SHAVER TRAP,

00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:30.439
I FORCED YUGI
TO DISCARD TWO CARDS.

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.474
ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN
HIS DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.776
AND NOW THAT
HE'S BROUGHT IT BACK,

00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:39.748
HE EXPECTS ME TO BELIEVE
THIS ANCIENT EGYPTIAN
FAIRY TALE!?

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:47.322
YUGI! YOUR MOVE
DOESN'T PROVE A THING!

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.758
KAIBA! HOW CAN YOU
CONTINUE TO DENY

00:15:49.758 --> 00:15:51.560
YOUR ANCIENT PAST!?

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.228
JUST LOOK
AT THE FIELD!

00:15:53.228 --> 00:15:56.532
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON
FACES THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:56.532 --> 00:16:00.269
THE TIME HAS COME
TO ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY,
KAIBA!

00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:02.938
FATE HAS LED US
TO BATTLE AGAIN!

00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:08.010
[ROAR]

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.311
Yugi, thinking:
THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT
THIS ANCIENT FEUD

00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:10.679
THAT'S STILL
A MYSTERY...

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.348
LIKE WHAT
WERE WE FIGHTING OVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:16.618
AND WHO EVENTUALLY WON?

00:16:16.618 --> 00:16:18.854
[THINKING]
IT'S TIME FOR YUGI
TO LEARN THE HARD WAY

00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:22.724
THAT REAL DUELISTS
MAKE THEIR OWN DESTINY!

00:16:22.724 --> 00:16:24.593
NOW THEN...

00:16:24.593 --> 00:16:28.063
I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:16:28.063 --> 00:16:29.631
Yugi, thinking:
I HOPE THIS WORKS!

00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:33.068
'CAUSE IF IT DOESN'T,
KAIBA'S MONSTER
WILL CRUSH MINE!

00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:35.404
HIS BLUE EYES
HAS 3,000 POINTS!

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:38.340
AND MY DARK MAGICIAN
ONLY HAS 2,500!

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.042
THAT MEANS ONE ATTACK
BY KAIBA,

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:42.077
AND MY MAGICIAN'S
A GONER!

00:16:42.077 --> 00:16:45.380
SO IT'S ALL UP
TO MY FACEDOWN CARDS
TO SAVE ME!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.816
LUCKILY, I HAVE
A MAGIC FORMULA CARD,

00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:51.320
WHICH CAN RAISE
MY DARK MAGICIAN'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 500.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.323
THEN IT'LL BE EQUAL
IN STRENGTH TO KAIBA'S
BLUE-EYES.

00:16:54.323 --> 00:16:57.192
SO MY MONSTER
WOULD ALSO BE DESTROYED!

00:16:57.192 --> 00:16:59.895
I GUESS IT'S ALL UP
TO DESTINY NOW!

00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:07.703
YOU'RE WILLING TO PUT
ALL YOUR FAITH

00:17:07.703 --> 00:17:09.538
IN SOME OLD FOLK STORY.

00:17:09.538 --> 00:17:11.206
HOW PATHETIC!

00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:13.442
WHO KNEW YOU'D TAKE IT
THIS FAR?

00:17:13.442 --> 00:17:16.778
SOMEONE SHOWS YOU
SOME CHICKEN SCRATCH
ON AN OLD ROCK,

00:17:16.778 --> 00:17:18.981
AND YOU USE IT
TO DICTATE YOUR LIFE!?

00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:22.818
I EXPECTED MORE
FROM YOU!

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:25.320
TRUST ME,
YOU'RE NO PHARAOH!

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.622
HA HA HA!

00:17:26.622 --> 00:17:28.724
SO STOP PLAYING
"MAKE-BELIEVE! "

00:17:28.724 --> 00:17:30.792
YOU'RE CAUGHT UP
IN THE PAST

00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:34.262
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE
CONCENTRATING ON WHAT'S
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.164
AND THAT WILL BE
YOUR DOWNFALL!

00:17:36.164 --> 00:17:37.599
WE SHALL SEE.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.535
YES, AS SOON
AS YOU'RE KNOCKED OUT
OF THE TOURNAMENT!

00:17:40.535 --> 00:17:42.804
THEN I'LL MOVE AHEAD
TO THE FINAL ROUND

00:17:42.804 --> 00:17:45.841
AND RECLAIM MY NUMBER-ONE
DUELING STATUS!

00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:47.509
NOW LET'S MOVE ON!

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:50.412
FIRST, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:53.515
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
MY CARD OF DEMISE!

00:17:53.515 --> 00:17:55.851
THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME TO DRAW

00:17:55.851 --> 00:17:57.919
UNTIL I'M HOLDING
5 CARDS...

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:00.155
AS LONG AS I DISCARD
MY ENTIRE HAND

00:18:00.155 --> 00:18:02.457
AFTER 5 TURNS
HAVE PASSED!

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.760
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.130
[THINKING[
I'VE OBSERVED YUGI'S
PAST DUELS VERY CAREFULLY,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.965
AND I KNOW WHAT
HE'S UP TO!

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:11.466
ONE OF HIS FACEDOWN CARDS

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.835
WILL MAKE HIS
DARK MAGICIAN STRONGER...

00:18:13.835 --> 00:18:17.706
AND HE'LL USE
THE OTHER ONE TO STOP
MY BLUE-EYE'S ATTACK!!

00:18:17.706 --> 00:18:20.575
SORRY, YUGI, BUT THIS
LITTLE STRATEGY OF YOURS

00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:22.110
IS NO SECRET TO ME,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.013
SO I'M AFRAID
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK!

00:18:25.013 --> 00:18:26.848
YOU'RE PLANNING
TO TAKE ME DOWN

00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:29.284
WITH YOUR TWO
FACEDOWN CARDS!

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:30.786
WELL, GUESS WHAT...?

00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:32.654
I'VE GOT A PLAN, TOO!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.389
BEHOLD THIS!

00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:36.625
A MONSTER
THAT WILL SEAL YOUR FATE.

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:37.993
[THINKING]
OH, NO!

00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:41.363
I SUMMON
LORD OF DRAGONS!

00:18:41.363 --> 00:18:43.365
AS LONG AS IT'S ON
THE FIELD,

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:46.435
MY BLUE EYES IS SAFE
FROM ALL MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS!

00:18:46.435 --> 00:18:48.336
THAT MAY BE SO,
KAIBA,

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.706
BUT MY DARK MAGICIAN
IS MORE POWERFUL

00:18:50.706 --> 00:18:52.674
THAN YOUR LORD
OF DRAGONS!

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.677
THEN GO AHEAD
AND ATTACK IT, YUGI!

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.180
Yugi, thinking:
KAIBA MAY HAVE A PLAN
TO STOP MY ATTACK,

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.116
BUT IN ORDER TO WIN,
I'LL HAVE TO TRY!

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:03.151
[AS YAMI-YUGI]
ALL RIGHT! MY MOVE!

00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:09.958
I SUMMON BETA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.693
[THINKING]
COME ON, YUGI...

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.197
ATTACK ME WITH
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:20.736
DARK MAGICIAN,
ATTACK HIS LORD
OF DRAGONS NOW!

00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:22.037
HA HA HA!

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.072
TOO BAD, YUGI!

00:19:24.072 --> 00:19:26.141
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD!

00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:27.142
OH!

00:19:27.142 --> 00:19:29.644
MAGICAL TRICK MIRROR!

00:19:29.644 --> 00:19:33.115
NOW I CAN TAKE
ONE MAGIC CARD
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:36.051
AND USE IT AS MY OWN
FOR ONE TURN!

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.687
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHICH ONE OF YOUR OLD CARDS

00:19:38.687 --> 00:19:40.956
I NEED TO GET
MY HANDS ON!

00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:42.891
MONSTER REBORN!

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.826
AND WHY'S THAT!?

00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:46.762
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:49.264
NOW I CAN BRING BACK
AN OLD FRIEND!

00:19:49.264 --> 00:19:50.532
BEHOLD!

00:19:50.532 --> 00:19:53.769
THE REBIRTH
OF MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:55.737
IT'S OBELISK!

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.906
VERY OBSERVANT, YUGI!

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.643
BUT EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
CAN ONLY BE REVIVED
FOR ONE TURN!

00:20:01.643 --> 00:20:02.711
TRUE!

00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:04.212
BUT ONE TURN
IS ALL I NEED

00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:06.248
TO BLOCK YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN'S ATTACK!

00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.416
HOLD ON!!

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.618
TOO LATE!

00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:14.489
IT'S TIME FOR OBELISK
TO ABSORB YOUR ATTACK!

00:20:14.489 --> 00:20:15.891
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:19.427
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO 1,500 LIFE POINTS!

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:23.932
UHH!

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:28.303
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE OUT OF OPTIONS!

00:20:28.303 --> 00:20:29.738
IT'S OVER!

00:20:29.738 --> 00:20:32.741
HA HA HA!
