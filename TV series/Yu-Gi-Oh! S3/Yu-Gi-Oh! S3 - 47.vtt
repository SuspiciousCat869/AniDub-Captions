BUT THEY'RE ONLY
DUELING FOR FUN.

00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:42.000
WHEN YUGI DUELED
IN BATTLE CITY,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.336
A LOT MORE WAS AT STAKE.

00:14:44.336 --> 00:14:46.705

GONNA GO AHEAD WITH

HAVE GOTTEN HURT IN
THE TOURNAMENT SO FAR?

PLEASE, YUGI!

00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:57.249
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

00:14:57.249 --> 00:14:59.584
I CAN'T STRAND
THE THOUGHT OF
LOSING YOU, TOO!

00:14:59.584 --> 00:15:01.086
JUST END IT!

00:15:01.086 --> 00:15:02.688
IT'S NOT WORTH
ALL THIS SUFFERING!

00:15:02.688 --> 00:15:06.658
THIS TOURNAMENT'S BEEN
NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS.

BUT IF I WALK AWAY NOW,

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:14.232
THAT MEANS EVERYONE
SUFFERED FOR NOTHING.

00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:16.735
TEA, REMEMBER
WHAT WE LEARNED

00:15:16.735 --> 00:15:18.670
ON OUR TRIP TO
THE DOMINO MUSEUM?

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.139
ABOUT MY DESTINY?

00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:22.341
OH!

00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:25.477
YES!

00:15:25.477 --> 00:15:28.213
WE FOUND OUT THAT
YOU WERE A PHARAOH
IN ANCIENT EGYPT.

00:15:28.213 --> 00:15:30.349
AND THAT NOW YOU NEED
TO SAVE THE WORLD AGAIN

00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:31.883
FROM SOME EVIL THINGY,

00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:34.353

5,000 YEARS AGO!

DO YOU NOW UNDERSTAND WHY

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:39.825
BACKING OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT
IS NOT AN OPTION?

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:40.826

NO "BUTS" TEA!

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.062
THE REASON I JOINED
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT

00:15:44.062 --> 00:15:45.998
WAS TO FULFILL
ISHIZU'S PROPHESY

00:15:45.998 --> 00:15:50.168
AND STOP THIS GREAT EVIL
FROM ENDANGERING MANKIND.

00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:53.505
AND WHEN JOEY FOUND OUT,
HE VOWED TO HELP ME...

00:15:53.505 --> 00:15:55.674
NO MATTER HOW
TOUGH THE FIGHT.

00:15:55.674 --> 00:15:58.010
AND THAT'S WHY
I MUST PRESS ON.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.079
OTHERWISE NOT ONLY WOULD
I BE GIVING UP ON JOEY,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:03.382
I'D BE GIVING UP
ON THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:16:03.382 --> 00:16:05.517
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE TO LOSE.

00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:06.518
WE'RE RIGHT HERE!

00:16:06.518 --> 00:16:09.554
GOOD.

00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:11.923
Tea: I KNOW YOU
CAN WIN THIS, YUGI!

00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:14.493
THE LAST DUEL'S
ABOUT TO BEGIN...

00:16:14.493 --> 00:16:17.062
MARIK ISHTAR
WILL FACE YUGI MUTO,

00:16:17.062 --> 00:16:19.631
AND THE WINNER WILL RECEIVE
THE BATTLE CITY CROWN!

00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:22.667
LET THE FUN BEGIN NOW!

00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:26.271
OH, NO, IT'S ANOTHER
SHADOW GAME!

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.907
YOU'VE WITNESSED SEVERAL
OF MY SHADOW GAMES BEFORE,

00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:31.076
BUT THIS ONE
WILL BE DIFFERENT.

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:34.980
I'VE THROWN IN A FEW TWISTS
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU!

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.215
HA HA HA!

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:40.185
MEET MY NEXT VICTIM!

00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:41.319
[GASP]

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:42.821
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.322
OH, NO!

00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:48.160
LOSE THE DUEL AND YUGI GOES
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.262
MARIK, THIS IS
ABOUT YOU AND ME,

00:16:50.262 --> 00:16:51.530
SO LEAVE HIM ALONE.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.331
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:55.500
YOU'RE FORGETTING
MY WEAKER HALF.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.838
HE'S INVOLVED IN
THIS CONFLICT AS WELL.

00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:02.641
SO, IF I LOSE,
THE SHADOWS WILL TAKE HIM!

00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:04.309
NO, YOU CAN'T!

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:06.244
I JUST DID!

00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:08.847
THE SHADOW REALM WILL
CLAIM AN INNOCENT SOUL

00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:10.582
NO MATTER WHO WINS!

00:17:10.582 --> 00:17:12.584
HA HA HA!

00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:21.086
SHOWING SERENITY AROUND TOWN

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:23.421
BROUGHT BACK SO MANY
MEMORIES ABOUT MY FRIENDS

00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:25.590
AND THE BATTLE
CITY TOURNAMENT.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.392
NOW EVERYONE'S GOING
THEIR SEPARATE WAYS.

00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:30.194
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO GO.

00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:32.396
YUP.

00:17:32.396 --> 00:17:37.601
I'M JUST GLAD THAT
EVERYTHING TURNED OUT
OK IN THE END.

00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:41.138
AND THE WINNER OF THE BATTLE
CITY CHAMPIONSHIP CROWN

00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:43.207
IS YUGI MUTO!

00:17:43.207 --> 00:17:44.308
YEAH!

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:45.309
WAY TO GO, YUGI!

00:17:45.309 --> 00:17:46.377
OH, YEAH!

00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:47.511
THAT'S WHAT I
CALL A DUEL!

00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:48.646
NICE DUEL!

00:17:48.646 --> 00:17:50.247
AND AS THE WINNER,

00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:53.250
YOU GET TO KEEP
THE RAREST CARD FROM
YOUR OPPONENT'S DECK.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.086
TAKE THIS, MY RAREST CARD.

00:17:56.086 --> 00:18:00.190
AND REMEMBER, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED THIS CARD, PHARAOH.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.593
THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA.

00:18:02.593 --> 00:18:06.196
WE HAVE ALL 3 OF
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:08.432
BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE
IN OUR DECK,

00:18:08.432 --> 00:18:10.434
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THEM?

00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:12.269
HOW CAN WE USE
THESE CARDS

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.139
TO UNLOCK THE HIDDEN
POWERS OF THE PHARAOH?

00:18:15.139 --> 00:18:21.779
WE NEED MORE
INFORMATION!

00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:23.847
NOW THAT YUGI
HAS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS

00:18:23.847 --> 00:18:25.249
TO FINISH HIS JOURNEY,

00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:28.452
I WONDER IF I'LL
EVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

00:18:28.452 --> 00:18:30.688
HEY, TEA...

00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:31.955
AH, TEA?

00:18:31.955 --> 00:18:33.190
[GASP]

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.458
WHAT?

00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:35.926
THANK YOU.

00:18:35.926 --> 00:18:37.261
I KNOW YOU WENT
OUT OF YOUR WAY

00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.962
TO SHOW ME AROUND
THE CITY TODAY.

00:18:38.962 --> 00:18:40.531
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO...

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:44.468
AND IT MEANT
SO MUCH TO ME.

00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.469
HOLD ON!

00:18:45.469 --> 00:18:47.137
IS IT 2:00 ALREADY?

00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:54.011
I'M TOTALLY LATE!

00:18:54.011 --> 00:18:55.379
OH, NO!

00:18:55.379 --> 00:18:57.981
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO DO, TEA?

00:18:57.981 --> 00:18:59.850
WELL, SORT OF.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.218
I'M SORRY.

00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:02.419
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T REALIZE

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:04.588
I WAS GONNA
MESS UP YOUR PLANS.

00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:06.490
I WISH YOU
HAD TOLD ME.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.492
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE DRAGGED YOU
AROUND TOWN.

00:19:08.492 --> 00:19:10.360
DON'T WORRY,
SERENITY.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.929
I'M NOT THAT LATE.

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:14.098
BUT I HAVE TO HURRY.

00:19:14.098 --> 00:19:17.034
BEFORE LONG, YUGI MIGHT
BE GONE FOREVER.

00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:18.268
I MEAN...

00:19:18.268 --> 00:19:21.438
WHO KNOWS WHERE FATE'S
GONNA TAKE HIM NEXT?

00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:22.773
OH, WELL.

00:19:22.773 --> 00:19:24.174
I HAVE A TRAIN
TO CATCH.

00:19:24.174 --> 00:19:25.909
OH. RIGHT.

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:28.779
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
GONNA BE SO FAR AWAY!

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:29.747
I WON'T!

00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:30.848
HUH?

00:19:30.848 --> 00:19:32.182
I'LL BE CLOSE, TEA.

00:19:32.182 --> 00:19:33.283
IT'S TRUE.

00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.419
IT'S LIKE JOEY
ALWAYS TELLS ME.

00:19:35.419 --> 00:19:37.254
HE'S CONNECTED
TO YOU GUYS

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:38.756
WITH A SPECIAL BOND
OF FRIENDSHIP

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:39.990
THAT CAN
NEVER BREAK!

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.693
JOEY SAID THAT TO YOU?

00:19:42.693 --> 00:19:44.061
HA HA.

00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:46.063
I KNEW HE WAS
A BIG SOFTY.

00:19:46.063 --> 00:19:49.433
NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M
ONE OF YOU GUYS, TEA!

00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:51.568
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ONE OF US, SERENITY,

00:19:51.568 --> 00:19:53.570
EVER SINCE WE
FIRST MET YOU.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.873
THAT MEANS WE'LL
NEVER BE FAR APART.

00:19:55.873 --> 00:19:57.374
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:57.374 --> 00:19:58.876
[SIGH]

00:19:58.876 --> 00:19:59.877
BYE, TEA!

00:19:59.877 --> 00:20:01.779
FOR NOW!

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:05.849
I'LL SEE YA LATER,
SERENITY.

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:07.251
SHE'S RIGHT.

00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:10.087
NO MATTER HOW FAR APART
I AM FROM MY FRIENDS,

00:20:10.087 --> 00:20:19.863
THEY'RE ALWAYS
RIGHT HERE IN MY HEART.

00:20:19.863 --> 00:20:21.031
I KNOW YUGI AND I

00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:22.933
WILL ALWAYS BE FRIENDS,

00:20:22.933 --> 00:20:26.436
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT...

00:20:26.436 --> 00:20:29.606
BUT I'M NOT READY
FOR HIM TO GO AWAY YET.

00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:34.378
I GUESS ALL I CAN DO IS ENJOY
THE TIME WE HAVE TOGETHER.

00:20:34.378 --> 00:20:35.979
YOO-HOO! YUGI!

00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:37.414
OVER HERE!

00:20:37.414 --> 00:20:38.415
YUGI!
