00:09:08.171 --> 00:09:11.841
BUT MY MIND WAS STILL
SHARP AS EVER.

00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:16.546
SO MY FATHER USED HIS
COMPANY'S CUTTING EDGE
TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE ME.

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:19.716
HE LINKED MY MIND
TO A CENTRAL COMPUTER,

00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:23.953
TRANSFORMING MY BRAIN WAVES
INTO ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES.

00:09:23.953 --> 00:09:26.322
EVERY THOUGHT PATTERN,
EVERY MEMORY,

00:09:26.322 --> 00:09:29.625
EVERY BIT OF KNOWLEDGE
I HAD WAS DIGITIZED

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.429
AND DOWNLOADED INTO MY FATHER'S
MAINFRAME COMPUTER.

00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:36.699
IT WAS THE END OF
MY FORMER LIFE AS A HUMAN

00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:38.935
AND THE BEGINNING
OF MY NEW LIFE

00:09:38.935 --> 00:09:46.809
AS A VIRTUAL BEING
WHOSE POWER IS LIMITLESS!

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.978
SOON AFTER THAT,
YOU CAME ALONG.

00:09:48.978 --> 00:09:51.647
ORIGINALLY, FATHER ADOPTED YOU

00:09:51.647 --> 00:09:54.283
TO MOTIVATE AND CHALLENGE ME,
AS PART OF MY TRAINING

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:56.352
TO TAKE OVER KAIBA CORP.

00:09:56.352 --> 00:09:58.855
BUT THAT WAS
NO LONGER POSSIBLE.

00:09:58.855 --> 00:10:02.225
ALTHOUGH I WAS EXTREMELY
POWERFUL IN CYBERSPACE...

00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:04.827
WITH NO BODY OF MY OWN,
I COULDN'T SERVE

00:10:04.827 --> 00:10:08.064
AS THE FUTURE PRESIDENT
OF MY FATHER'S COMPANY.

00:10:08.064 --> 00:10:10.562
UNTIL NOW!!!

00:10:13.466 --> 00:10:15.134
SO YOU SEE, SETO,

00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:17.203
I'M NOT HUMAN ANYMORE.

00:10:17.203 --> 00:10:19.539
I EXIST ONLY
AS A DIGITAL FILE

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.175
IN A SUPERCOMPUTER
BUILT BY MY FATHER!

00:10:22.175 --> 00:10:24.510
BUT AS SOON AS
I DEFEAT YOU IN A DUEL,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.214
PROVING ONCE AND FOR ALL
THAT I SHOULD BE RUNNING
KAIBA CORP,

00:10:28.214 --> 00:10:31.584
I'LL UPLOAD MY MIND
INTO YOUR BODY.

00:10:31.584 --> 00:10:35.088
THEN I'LL FULFILL
MY FATHER'S WISHES BY
TAKING OVER THE COMPANY!

00:10:35.088 --> 00:10:37.557
HA HA HA HA!

00:10:37.557 --> 00:10:41.127
YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT!?
NOAH, PLEASE.

00:10:41.127 --> 00:10:43.229
THE ONLY THING
MORE RIDICULOUS
THAN THAT STORY

00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:45.164
IS YOU OUT-DUELING ME!

00:10:45.164 --> 00:10:46.432
THEN LET'S GO!

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:49.569
WHAT BETTER WAY TO PROVE
MY POWER OVER YOU...

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:52.906
THAN BY DEFEATING YOU
AT YOUR OWN PATHETIC
GAME, SETO!

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:55.742
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:10:55.742 --> 00:10:58.444
I RE-BUILT KAIBA CORP
FROM THE GROUND UP!

00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:01.481
ON MY OWN TERMS!
WITH NO HELP AT ALL!

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.450
THAT COMPANY IS WHAT
IT IS BECAUSE OF ME!

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.085
NO ONE ELSE
COULD RUN IT!

00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:07.954
ESPECIALLY NOT SOME KID!

00:11:07.954 --> 00:11:12.525
REALLY!?

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:14.360
I'LL SHOW YOU
REAL POWER...

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.595
LET'S GO!

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:18.264
ALL RIGHT. THEN CHOOSE
YOUR CARDS SETO!

00:11:18.264 --> 00:11:23.369
I ALREADY HAVE!

00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:26.272
AND I'VE ALREADY CHOSEN
MY DECK MASTER!

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:33.646
SAY HELLO TO MY FRIEND--
KAISER SEAHORSE!

00:11:33.646 --> 00:11:40.019
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS, SETO.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.122
TIME TO LOSE IT ALL!

00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:44.657
Both: LET'S DUEL!!

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:47.694
I'LL GO FIRST!
AND NOOOOOOW BEHOLD!

00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:52.165
I SUMMON GIANT GERM
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:55.268
THEN I'LL POSITION
THIS CARD FACEDOWN.

00:11:55.268 --> 00:11:57.737
[THINKING]
HIS FIRST MISTAKE WAS
TAKING MOKUBA.

00:11:57.737 --> 00:12:00.306
HIS SECOND WAS
CHALLENGING ME
TO A DUEL!

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:03.810
WITH MY FACEDOWN
CRUSH CARD ON THE FIELD,
HE'S FINISHED!

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.212
WHEN HE ATTACKS
MY GIANT GERM,

00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.648
MY CRUSH CARD'S POWER
WILL ACTIVATE,

00:12:08.648 --> 00:12:11.451
DESTROYING EVERY MONSTER
IN HIS HAND AND DECK

00:12:11.451 --> 00:12:14.153
WITH 1500
ATTACK POINTS OR MORE!

00:12:14.153 --> 00:12:16.990
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE
GOT, STEP-BROTHER.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.226
WITH PLEASURE SETO.
SO STAND BACK!

00:12:20.226 --> 00:12:22.895
THIS SHOULD BE AMUSING.

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:28.401
I SUMMON CHIRON THE MAGE!

00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:30.503
Joey: DIS CAN'T BE GOOOD!

00:12:30.503 --> 00:12:32.238
AAAH!
AAAH!

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:40.246
Tea: I THINK I LEFT
MY STOMACH BACK
AT THAT LAST TURN!

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:43.716
AAAH!
AAAH!

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:45.785
Yugi: IS...EVERYONE...
ALL RIGHT?

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.554
Joey: DEFINE...
"ALL RIGHT. "

00:12:48.554 --> 00:12:49.889
HEY LOOK!!

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:51.624
Serenity:
WHERE ARE WE!?

00:12:51.624 --> 00:12:52.959
BEATS ME.

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:56.129
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE
IN KAIBA LAND ANYMORE!

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.864
HEY! LOOK OVA THERE GUYS!

00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.866
KAIBA VERSUS NOAH!?

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:01.167
Joey: NO WAY.

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:02.902
BE CAREFUL KAIBA!

00:13:02.902 --> 00:13:04.003
YUGI.

00:13:04.003 --> 00:13:06.105
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
FAN CLUB HAS ARRIVED!

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:08.007
AND THEY CAME
JUST IN TIME...

00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:10.376
TO WITNESS
YOUR LAST DUEL, SETO!

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:12.712
AND MY REBIRTH INTO
THE REAL WORLD

00:13:12.712 --> 00:13:14.680
AS THE NEW LEADER
OF KAIBA CORP!

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.183
NO! HE CAN'T LET NOAH WIN!

00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:18.785
LET'S CONTINUE!

00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:20.787
BEHOLD THE POWER OF MY MAGE

00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:23.823
AND HIS MIRROR OF TRUTH!

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:26.459
NOTHING CAN REMAIN
HIDDEN FROM ME NOW,

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:29.328
FOR THE MIRROR OF TRUTH
REVEALS YOUR FACEDOWN CARD

00:13:29.328 --> 00:13:30.997
AND DESTROYS IT AS WELL!

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:36.502
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU
TRIED TO HIDE!

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:39.972
OH NO!

00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.909
YOUR CRUSH CARD IS GONE,
NOW WATCH THIS!

00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:44.644
ATTACK, MY MAGE!

00:13:44.644 --> 00:13:52.051
DESTROY HIS GIANT GERM!

00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:56.989
GIANT GERM
RETURN TO ME NOW!

00:13:56.989 --> 00:13:59.492
IT'S BACK AND YOU LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:13:59.492 --> 00:14:01.828
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED.
YOUR CARD'S WEAK!

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:03.663
THAT MAY BE.

00:14:03.663 --> 00:14:06.866
BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I BROUGHT IT BACK
TO ATTACK YOU?!

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:08.334
WATCH AND LEARN!

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:10.903
I SACRIFICE
MY GIANT GERM!

00:14:10.903 --> 00:14:14.907
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY VAMPIRE LORD!

00:14:14.907 --> 00:14:16.943
NOW MY CREATURE
OF DARKNESS,

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:23.349
ATTACK HIS CHIRON
THE MAGE!

00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:25.885
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:27.687
THANKS TO HIS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:31.257
EVERY TIME MY VAMPIRE
SUCKS AWAY SOME OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:14:31.257 --> 00:14:33.559
HE FORCES YOU TO SEND
ONE OF YOUR CARDS

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.962
DIRECTLY
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:14:35.962 --> 00:14:39.432
SO SAY GOODBYE
TO ANOTHER
MONSTER CARD NOAH!

00:14:39.432 --> 00:14:43.870
AT THIS RATE,
YOUR DECK WILL BE
EMPTY IN NO TIME.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.340
I DOUBT THAT...I'M AFRAID
THAT FANGED FREAK OF YOURS

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.110
IS ABOUT TO TAKE HIS OWN TRIP
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD NOW!

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.612
BUT YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS!

00:14:52.612 --> 00:14:55.648
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT USING A MONSTER!

00:14:55.648 --> 00:14:57.683
I'LL DESTROY HIM WITH THIS!

00:14:57.683 --> 00:14:59.652
THE MAGIC CARD FISSURE!

00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:03.956
ADIOS BAT BOY!

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:10.129
AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE DEFENSELESS
I'LL PLAY THIS!

00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:13.566
OH NO! KAIBA'S WIDE OPEN
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:15.067
GO MY AERIS!

00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:19.845
ATTACK SETO'S LIFE POINTS!

00:15:25.004 --> 00:15:27.807
SURRENDER NOW WHILE
YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!

00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:29.375
DON'T GIVE UP,
KAIBA!!

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:32.011
SHOW DAT LITTLE
GREEN-HAIRED TWERP
WHO'S BOSS!

00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:35.147
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN.

00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:37.783
Kaiba: YOU'LL NEVER GET
AWAY WITH THIS, NOAH!

00:15:37.783 --> 00:15:40.119
I'D RATHER SEE
MY COMPANY CRUMBLE
TO THE GROUND

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:42.388
THAN FALL INTO YOUR
GRUBBY LITTLE HANDS!

00:15:42.388 --> 00:15:45.558
KAIBA CORP IS MINE,
YOU GOT THAT PUNK!?

00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:49.495
YOU STOLE IT!
I'M JUST TAKING BACK
WHAT BELONGS TO ME!

00:15:49.495 --> 00:15:52.231
KEEP DREAMING KID!
OKAY THEN...!

00:15:52.231 --> 00:15:54.834
I THINK YOU MIGHT
REMEMBER MY OLD FRIEND--

00:15:54.834 --> 00:16:01.207
VAMPIRE LORD!

00:16:01.207 --> 00:16:02.775
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:04.710
DON'T YOU KNOW
ABOUT VAMPIRES?

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.712
THEY CAN'T BE DESTROYED!

00:16:06.712 --> 00:16:10.983
MY VAMPIRE LORD POSSESSES
THE POWER OF IMMORTALITY,
YOU FOOL!

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:13.986
SO WHEN HE'S SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD
HE COMES BACK!

00:16:13.986 --> 00:16:17.289
AND THERE'S MORE!
I SUMMON THIS!

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:22.862
SLATE WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:22.862 --> 00:16:25.765
A'RIGHT!
I NEVA THOUGHT DAT I'D
BE ROOTIN' FOR KAIBA...

00:16:25.765 --> 00:16:27.233
BUT LET'S GO RICH BOY!

00:16:27.233 --> 00:16:28.801
I CAN'T BE BEAT!

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:31.370
WE'RE IN MY WORLD NOW
AND I MAKE THE RULES!

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.775
LISTEN. YOU MAY THINK
THAT YOU CREATED THIS
VIRTUAL WORLD YOU PUNK!

00:16:35.775 --> 00:16:38.778
BUT ALL YOU DID WAS
RIP OFF MY SYSTEM!

00:16:38.778 --> 00:16:41.447
NOW...!
VAMPIRE LORD ATTACK!

00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:43.015
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:45.751
YOUR VAMPIRE HAS ACTIVATED
MY TRAP CARD!

00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:49.755
SO REVEAL...
THE MIGHTY EARTHSHAKER!

00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:58.631
TIME FOR ME
TO SHAKE THINGS UP A BIT!

00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:00.499
NOW ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:02.935
HOW THIS GROUND-BREAKING
TRAP CARD OF MINE WORKS

00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:04.737
IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:17:04.737 --> 00:17:07.106
YOU HAVE TWO KINDS
OF CREATURES ON THE FIELD,

00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:09.909
A WIND MONSTER
AND A DARK MONSTER.

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:13.412
AND ONE OF THOSE TWO MONSTERS
IS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED.

00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:16.415
BUT WHICH ONE?
THAT IS UP TO YOU SETO!

00:17:16.415 --> 00:17:18.417
SO HIS TRAP CARD
FORCES ME TO CHOOSE

00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:20.920
ONE OF MY OWN MONSTERS
TO BE DESTROYED.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.956
IF I CHOOSE WIND,
I LOSE MY SLATE WARRIOR

00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:26.859
AND IF I CHOOSE DARK
MY VAMPIRE'S GONE.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.160
LET'S GO!

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.097
I CHOOSE MY CREATURE
OF DARKNESS!

00:17:31.097 --> 00:17:32.832
EARTHSHAKER!

00:17:32.832 --> 00:17:39.338
SWALLOW HIS VAMPIRE LORD!

00:17:39.338 --> 00:17:40.973
WHY'D HE PICK DAT!?

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:44.210
KAIBA'S VAMPIRE LORD
WAS MUCH STRONGER
DEN HIS OTHA MONSTA!

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.711
YEAH, BUT DON'T
FORGET...

00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.047
WHEN KAIBA'S VAMPIRE
IS DESTROYED

00:17:48.047 --> 00:17:50.616
IT COMES RIGHT BACK
TO THE FIELD
IN HIS NEXT TURN.

00:17:50.616 --> 00:17:52.985
A'RIGHT! KAIBA MAY BE
A PAIN IN DA BUTT,

BUT HE KNOWS HOW
TA PLAY DUEL MONSTAS!

00:17:54.987 --> 00:17:57.623
NOW IT'S TIME

BY ALMOST TWO THOUSAND
LIFE POINTS, JOEY.

00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.515
THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF TIME TO CELEBRATE...

00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:24.817
I WAS THINKING, SETO...

00:18:24.817 --> 00:18:27.820
MAYBE YOU AND I JUST GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.257
PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO
WASH AWAY OUR DIFFERENCES...

00:18:31.257 --> 00:18:33.259
AND THIS SHOULD HELP!

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:37.029

00:18:46.572 --> 00:18:48.974
Joey: I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS--A TIDAL WAVE!

00:18:48.974 --> 00:18:50.876
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

00:18:50.876 --> 00:18:53.045

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:14.500

EVERY MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD IS
GETTING WASHED AWAY!

00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:30.783
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SEE

BUT YOU NEVER PICKED
A DECK MASTER!

00:19:33.018 --> 00:19:37.456
