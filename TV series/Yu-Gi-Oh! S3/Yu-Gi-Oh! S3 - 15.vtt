(Yugi)
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh!"

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.538
All five of you will share
Tristan's body

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:08.254
in a duel against Seto's
strongest rival, Yugi Muto.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.177
Defeat him and you'll
get five bodies.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.146
(Yugi)
Look, guys, up there!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.248
(Téa)
Tristan!

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.349
That's not Tristan,
remember?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.217
It's Nezbitt.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.293
Even though we kicked his
butt in that duel

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.512
he still took Tristan's body.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.990
I'm not alone in here.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.358
Today's special
is...

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.026
five for one!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.528
Our combined force
will destroy you.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.064
Tell us what we have to do
to get Tristan back.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.032
Duel us.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.033
Win and he's yours.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.202
Five on one's uneven,
so count me in!

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.672
(Kaiba)
Yugi and his friends can
deal with The Big Five.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.140
I've got bigger problems!

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.277
The first thing I have to do
is find Mokuba.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.079
Then I'll show Noah that
no one disrespects my family

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:48.682
and gets away with it.

you and your friends will be
sentenced to an eternity

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.485

You're the one

I beat you once
and I'll beat you again!

Yes, but now we're up
against all five of them!

That's right,
I'm not alone in here.

(Serenity)
I can't believe The Big Five are
all in Tristan's body!

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:16.570
Those business geeks
are sharing me

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:18.639
like I'm a Corporate Condo.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.342
(Johnson)
My first maneuver should seem
familiar to you, Joseph.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.145
The move's called
"Clear the Courtroom."

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:28.115
It's Judge Man's
Deck Master ability.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.217
Oh no, not this move!

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:32.252
Oh, yes!

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.489
First I'll give up
1,000 of my Life Points.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:38.759
Proceed, Your Honor.

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:43.964
Prosecute all of their monsters
to the full extent of the law.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.602
All four of our
monsters are gone now.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.271
But that's not
all I've done.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.406
What?

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.740
Have your forgotten
already, Joseph?

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.243
Next, you'll both lose
500 Life Points

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.479
for each monster
that I've crushed.

(Kaiba)
This doesn't make any sense.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:14.061
It's a virtual copy of the Duel
Monsters Theme Park I designed!

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.198
There's no way Noah could
have known about this.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.202
The blueprints for
Kaiba Land are top-secret

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.372
and construction isn't scheduled
to begin for another four years.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.409
But it's all right here,
every detail.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.213
They even included my
backstage security system.

Don't worry, Tristan.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.300
Yugi and my brother
are gonna win this!

Now that I've cleared the field

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.407
it's time to work
on your Life Points.

I call Hysteric Angel

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:05.645
And now...

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.646
I think our spectators

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.382
are really going to
enjoy this next move.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:10.684
Huh?

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.352

Now, Hysteric Angel,

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.695
attack Joseph's
Life Points directly!

Are you sure you're
all right, Joey?

00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.566
I've been better.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.735
Tell me, Joseph, are you
beginning to understand

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.671
my dueling strategy
or do you need a hint?

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.340
I plan to destroy
the weaker link first.

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.143
Then I'll concentrate on Yugi.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.013
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to be scared?

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.682
You're just mad 'cause I wiped
the courtroom floor with you

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.150
in our last duel, Johnson!

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.418
Ha, don't flatter
yourself.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:21.988
I place one card face-down.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.492
And then I play the magic card,
Altar of Mist!

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:28.161
(Yugi)
Oh, no!

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.630
Thanks to that card's effect,
after three turns,

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.433
Johnson will be able to
play any ritual magic card

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.668
in his entire deck!

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.237
That will allow him to
automatically summon

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.139
a really powerful
monster to the field!

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.174
The prosecution rests.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:42.742
Good, about time.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:44.685

This'll help!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.815
I summon
Rocket Warrior!

(Joey)
This little guy packs
a pretty strong punch,

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.755
but I'm gonna boost
his strength even more

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:57.390
with my Deck Master's
special ability!

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.759
After all, Flame Swordsman
came in really handy

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.429
last time I laid
a hurting on Johnson.

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.764
Now, here comes a move
that you might remember!

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:07.334
Thanks to my Swordsman's
special ability,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.036
I'll take 1,000
of his Attack Points

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.538
and transfer them
to my warrior.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.240
And now, Rocket Warrior,

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.343
attack his
Catapult Turtle!

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.347
I activate
Revenge Sacrifice!

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.017
No!

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.619
This card
allows me to sacrifice

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.154
the monster you just
attacked me with.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.323
So consider your
Rocket Warrior dismissed.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.694
And I'll use it to summon
a new monster.

All right, I need
to play Des Volstgalph,

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.562
but in order to
summon it to the field,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.564
I need to sacrifice another
monster first.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.733
And I have no other monsters!

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.168

It's the Rock Spirit
monster card!

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.311
But in order to use it,

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:27.286
I first have to take a monster
out of my graveyard

00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:28.214
and remove it from the game.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.116
I was forced to send
Buster Blader

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.117
to the graveyard before,

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.186
so I guess I'll take
him out of play.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.156
First I'll remove my
Buster Blader from the game

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.226
in order to summon
The Rock Spirit!

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.196
But I'm afraid
that's not all, Johnson!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.165
I'll sacrifice my spirit
to summon this!

What?
Huh?

See, Yugi played
a weaker monster.

Really?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.614
That doesn't sound like
something Yugi would do.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:35.882
Yugi!

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:39.386
Out of the way,
Johnson.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.554
It's time for a real
duelist to take charge.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.189
I'm still on
this case!

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.091
So back off, Nezbitt.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:46.726
Quiet.

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.695
(Nezbitt)
It's about time
that I stepped in

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.397
to rewire this duel.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.532
I am Nezbitt.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.534
Now meet my Deck Master,

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.669
the unstoppable
android Robotic Knight.

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:58.972
It's him!

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:00.974
He's the one
who did this to Tristan.

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:02.475
(shrieking)

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:03.476
Prepare to lose.

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:06.312
That fool Yugi
has played a monster

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.315
weaker than my Machine King
and a face-down card.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.351
It appears
he has constructed

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:13.319
quite an amateur trap,

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:16.623
and I think he knows
I'm on to him.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.059
You look
a bit nervous.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.294
(Joey)
Nezbitt knows his plan!

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.197
Yugi may as well be wearing
a sign that says

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.066
"I set a trap,
so attack me!"

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.334
First thing I'll do
is rid the field

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:29.235
of your face-down card.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.104
So sorry,
but take this!

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.106
Heavy Storm!

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:38.011
It destroys all your magic
and trap cards on the field.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.216
Mirror Force was
your face-down card.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:46.352
That's right.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.222
My plan was to reflect
the attack of Machine King

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.191
right back at you, Nezbitt.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.126
Come on, Yuge!

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.428
That's the oldest
trick in the Duel Book!

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:57.664
It was worth a try.

00:09:58.198 --> 00:09:59.065
Worth a try?

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.267
There's too much
at stake here

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:03.336
to try a lame
move like that, Yuge.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:04.971
All right, kid,

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.372
it's time to
dismantle you.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.308
Go, Machine King!

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:10.009
Attack now!

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.578
Don't do it,
Nezbitt!

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.014
Disassemble his
Des Volstgalph!

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:18.651
Thank you!
What?

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.621
Looks like you fell for
my real trap, Nezbitt!

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:23.389
What trap?

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:25.992
You have no more
trap cards left in play!

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:28.595
You're obviously
unaware of

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:30.463
Des Volstgalph's
special abilities

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.665
so allow me to explain.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.368
When you played your
magic card,

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:39.330
you increased my monster's
attack strength by 200 points,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.307
giving it a total
of 2,400!

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.280
And now,
Des Volstgalph, attack!

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.553
Lucky break, kid.

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.157
And my monster
has one more effect.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.459
When it destroys your
monster,

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.561
you lose 500
Life Points, Nezbitt.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:04.564
I'm not impressed.

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:06.432
500 points is nothing.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.502
I still have plenty
of Life Points left.

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:11.504
You fool.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.039
Think!

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.475
Don't you realize what he
just forced you to do?

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:16.743
What?

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:17.744
Hey, I get it.

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.113
Get what, Duke?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.182
See, Yugi just tricked
Nezbitt into attacking him

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:24.584
instead of attacking Joey.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.687
You mean 'cause Joey is
down to 300 Life Points?

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.391
So Joey would have
lost the duel.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:32.992
That's right.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.161
Without any monsters on
the field to protect him

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.230
Joey would have been
crushed by Machine King!

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.266
So that's why Yugi set
such an obvious trap!

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:42.535
Nezbitt was
sidetracked,

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:43.970
so he forgot Joey!

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.439
(Serenity)
Nice one, Yugi!

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:47.674
Way to protect Joey!

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.309
Your acting was key.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.277
That made it
convincing!

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.046
Eh?

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:54.047
Ah, so Joey knew!

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.149
He was
playing along!

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.517
Well, I'm impressed.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.052
He managed to
fool me!

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:00.987
Good acting, Joey!

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.455
(shrieking)

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.457
Way to fake 'em out, Joey!

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.293
Uh, yeah, that was no sweat
at all for me, Serenity.

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.129
(nervous laughing)

00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:11.664
(Joey)
That was close.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:14.968
If it weren't for Yugi,
I'd be a goner for sure.

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.002
That won't work again!

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:18.571
(Leichter)
It certainly won't,

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.574
because I'm about to step in
and take charge of this body.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.142
Once I eliminate
Mr. Wheeler,

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.046
crushing Yugi will be simple.

00:12:30.924 --> 00:12:33.066
All right, you corporate
creep-a-zoid.

00:12:33.304 --> 00:12:34.171
You're outta luck, pal.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:36.006
'Cause other than that
walking junkyard

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.741
you call a Deck Master,

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.844
it looks to me like
you're out of monsters,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.178
leaving your Life Points
wide open.

00:12:42.313 --> 00:12:43.180
Here goes!

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.782
(Joey)
Aw, yeah,
Panther Warrior, baby!

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:46.584
Wait, he can't attack

00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:48.719
unless I sacrifice
another monster first.

00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:50.120
And I'm fresh out!

00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:53.490
Maybe dueling every member of
The Big Five at the same time

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.492
wasn't such a great idea.

00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:57.962
'Cause if we lose,
they'll get <i>all</i> our bodies!

00:12:59.196 --> 00:13:02.166
I summon Panther Warrior
in defense mode!

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:05.069
I'm not gonna let these
business buttheads

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:06.737
get to my Life Points.

00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:08.138
Now I'll wrap things up by

00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:10.007
placing this
little number face-down.

00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:11.775
It's all you, Yuge.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.777
Right.

00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:15.579
And I know
what I need to do.

00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:16.881
I'm sorry, Tristan,

00:13:17.615 --> 00:13:18.616
but I must
attack directly.

00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:21.785
Do what you
gotta do, Yugi!

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.787
Just don't mess up
the hair!

00:13:24.655 --> 00:13:25.656
It's gonna be fine,
Tristan.

00:13:26.357 --> 00:13:27.224
Now, Des Volstgalph!

00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:29.093
Attack his Life Points
directly!

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:32.997
♪

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:37.601
Now, I'll summon
Big Shield Gardna

00:13:38.869 --> 00:13:39.737
in defense mode!

00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:42.273
That's all for now,
Nezbitt.

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:46.076
(Leichter)
I'm not Nezbitt any more,
you fool!

00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:52.016
(Kaiba)
Looks like Noah didn't
have enough imagination

00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:54.852
to fill this place
with anything.

00:13:55.953 --> 00:13:56.820
(gasping)

00:13:57.354 --> 00:13:59.023
It's another one of that
twerp's virtual doorways.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.158
If I had to guess,

00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:05.262
I'd say it leads to
more images from my past.

00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:07.932
What's this?

00:14:08.065 --> 00:14:09.066
A cheap old
movie projector?

00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:12.236
Get with the times, Noah.

00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:20.144
(young Noah)
<i>I betcha can't catch me, Dad!</i>

00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.211
(giggling)

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:22.212
It's Noah!

00:14:22.346 --> 00:14:23.213
Nice outfit, dork.

00:14:25.082 --> 00:14:25.950
How sad.

00:14:26.483 --> 00:14:28.319
That little twerp is still
trying to convince me

00:14:28.552 --> 00:14:29.553
that he's Gozaburo Kaiba's son.

00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:32.089
I'm afraid
it'll take more

00:14:32.556 --> 00:14:34.191
than a few fake home movies
to do that.

00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:37.061
What's this?

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:38.762
(woman)
<i>How can this</i>
<i>have happened?</i>

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:40.965
(Gozaburo)
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>Noah can still be saved.</i>

00:14:42.766 --> 00:14:43.634
<i>I'll find a way.</i>

00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:44.802
<i>But how?</i>

00:14:45.502 --> 00:14:46.503
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>I can't do.</i>

00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:48.605
What is all this
supposed to mean?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.175
That Noah was in some
sort of an accident?

00:14:52.376 --> 00:14:54.044
(Noah)
It's time you learned
the truth, Seto!

00:14:55.412 --> 00:14:56.613
If these images are real,

00:14:57.314 --> 00:14:58.849
then that would mean that
something devastating

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.785
happened to Noah right before
Gozaburo adopted me and Mokuba.

00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:06.256
But why would Noah
want me to know

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.925
all of this
information about his past?

00:15:09.593 --> 00:15:12.763
Unless someone else
is behind all this.

00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:15.232
All right.

00:15:15.532 --> 00:15:17.201
Say goodbye to Nezbitt
and his pathetic robot!

00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:19.937
I'm Leichter, and I'll be
controlling this body

00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:22.172
for the remainder
of the duel!

00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:24.208
Whatever, less talking,
more dueling!

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:26.076
Fine, I'll draw.

00:15:26.877 --> 00:15:27.745
Not quite!

00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:28.912
You triggered my trap.

00:15:29.546 --> 00:15:30.748
Sorry, Leichter,
meet Drop Off.

00:15:32.216 --> 00:15:34.585
My card sends the card you
just drew to the graveyard!

00:15:35.886 --> 00:15:36.754
Guess again.
Hmm?

00:15:38.122 --> 00:15:38.989
No way!

00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:41.625
What gives?

00:15:41.992 --> 00:15:43.160
How'd you
destroy my trap card?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.328
(laughing)

00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:46.263
Haven't you
noticed the monster

00:15:47.064 --> 00:15:48.599
I've chosen to be my
Deck Master?

00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:50.534
(Joey)
It's Jinzo!

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:51.702
My trap cards
are useless!

00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:53.003
That's right,

00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:54.838
he'll automatically
destroy every one of them.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.675
Now I play the magic card,
Pot Of Greed

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.680
allowing me to
draw two more cards.

00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:05.783
Excellent.

00:16:06.717 --> 00:16:08.352
Ha, you just played
a magic card which triggers

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:10.187
my Volstgalph's special
ability!

00:16:11.688 --> 00:16:12.856
So it gains
200 attack points!

00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:15.559
Now is that so?

00:16:15.993 --> 00:16:17.661
He won't be around for
much longer, anyway.

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:21.765
For I summon
my Fairy Lily!

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:24.334
Ha!

00:16:25.202 --> 00:16:27.037
Looks like she's only got
400 Attack Points, Leichter.

00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:29.206
Looks can be
deceiving, Joey.

00:16:30.107 --> 00:16:31.642
I give up
2,000 Life Points

00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:32.943
to increase her power!

00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:37.748
Lily, destroy
his Des Volstgalph!

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:44.721
That maneuver cost you more
Life Points

00:16:45.823 --> 00:16:46.857
than it cost me.

00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:48.759
Not exactly!

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.727
'Cause I'm about
to restore mine

00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:52.696
with my
Sebek's Blessing magic card!

00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:56.700
What's the deal
with that card?

00:16:57.234 --> 00:16:58.235
It increases Leichter's
Life Points

00:16:59.403 --> 00:17:01.672
by the same number of
Life Points I just lost.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.707
Exactly.

00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:05.943
And if my math
is correct,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.178
that gives me
1,000 more Life Points!

00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:11.048
And finally I'll place
one card face-down.

00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:14.151
Soon we'll claim
four more of your bodies

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.086
leaving your minds
trapped here!

00:17:17.488 --> 00:17:20.457
Yuge, we gotta do
something and fast!

00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:25.095
Get ready, boys...

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.164
to give up your
bodies that is!

00:17:28.899 --> 00:17:29.900
I just activated
Gravity Bind,

00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:31.768
which stops all monsters

00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:33.904
with four or more
stars from attacking.

00:17:34.538 --> 00:17:36.073
That includes everything
except my Fairy Lily!

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.509
That's a trap,

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:40.544
and your Jinzo's
supposed to destroy

00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:42.045
all trap cards
on the field!

00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:43.714
That's usually true.

00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:45.516
But since Jinzo's
my Deck Master

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.284
he only destroys
my opponents' traps.

00:17:48.552 --> 00:17:49.219
Oh, yeah?

00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:50.254
Now...

00:17:50.587 --> 00:17:51.255
(Joey)
Awesome.

00:17:52.656 --> 00:17:53.524
This body-snatching bozo's

00:17:54.057 --> 00:17:55.893
about to get a taste
of his own medicine

00:17:56.593 --> 00:17:57.761
'cause I got
a Jinzo, too!

00:17:58.095 --> 00:17:59.930
I sacrificed Panther Warrior
so I can summon this!

00:18:01.632 --> 00:18:02.299
My own Jinzo!

00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:04.768
(roaring)

00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:07.004
Your Jinzo
may not cooperate,

00:18:07.938 --> 00:18:08.805
but mine definitely
will!

00:18:10.807 --> 00:18:11.675
All right, Jinzo!

00:18:12.643 --> 00:18:13.310
Destroy his trap!

00:18:14.645 --> 00:18:16.079
(roaring)

00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:21.618
Oh, yeah!

00:18:22.472 --> 00:18:23.693
Celebrating so soon?

00:18:23.921 --> 00:18:24.788
Yeah, why?

00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:26.323
You may have
destroyed my trap card,

00:18:26.657 --> 00:18:27.824
but my Fairy Lily is still

00:18:28.392 --> 00:18:30.060
the strongest monster
on the field, Mr. Wheeler.

00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:32.296
Once I power her up again,

00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:34.665
she'll wipe out your Jinzo
and your Life Points!

00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:37.634
Joey, Leichter is right!

00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:40.938
Her special ability allows him
to raise her Attack Points

00:18:41.805 --> 00:18:43.273
higher than any other
monster on the field!

00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:44.841
Oh, yeah.

00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:45.909
But then again...

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.945
Attack Points aren't
everything, are they, Joey?

00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:50.781
(Joey)
Wait a sec.

00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:52.549
Yugi's trying to tell me
something.

00:18:52.683 --> 00:18:54.518
There is a way to
crush this guy's monster

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:55.219
before it crushes me.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.222
Even though Leichter can raise
his fairy's attack points,

00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:00.757
her defense points
stay pretty low.

00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:03.794
I play Block Attack!

00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:06.163
This magic card
switches your fairy

00:19:07.264 --> 00:19:08.265
from attack to
defense mode.

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.034
You can't!

00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:12.936
I just did.

00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:14.905
Jinzo, do us all
a favor

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.741
and send his little monster
back to fairyland, will you?

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:19.776
Cyber Energy Shock Attack!

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:22.746
(screaming)

00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:25.315
Well, that's all
from me, Leichter.

00:19:26.817 --> 00:19:27.818
Now, back to you,
Yuge.

00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:29.753
Pound this poser!

00:19:30.287 --> 00:19:31.154
Right.

00:19:31.288 --> 00:19:32.990
Time to take you down!

00:19:35.025 --> 00:19:37.561
And I have just the card
to do it in my hand.

00:19:38.128 --> 00:19:41.531
Come forth,
Dark Magician Girl!

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.067
Your Life Points
are wide open!

00:19:45.402 --> 00:19:48.705
Dark Magician Girl,
attack him directly!

00:19:54.378 --> 00:19:56.980
He just lost
2,000 Life Points!

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:00.417
It's your move.

00:20:01.918 --> 00:20:03.220
The time has arrived,
my young friends,

00:20:05.822 --> 00:20:07.291
to reap the benefits
of my magic card!

00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:09.593
Say what, man?

00:20:10.927 --> 00:20:11.795
Wait, he's right!

00:20:12.262 --> 00:20:14.264
It's been three turns since
he played Altar of Mist.

00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:16.933
Now he can summon
almost any monster he wants!

00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:19.369
You are correct!

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:23.607
(laughing)

00:20:24.508 --> 00:20:25.575
What's so funny,
Leichter?

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:26.843
(laughing maniacally)

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:30.047
That's getting
real annoying.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:33.984
If you were me,
you'd laugh too!

00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:35.919
(grunting)

00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:37.988
For in my hands
I hold The Big Five's

00:20:39.222 --> 00:20:40.090
most powerful creature!

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:42.659
Say goodbye
to your bodies!

00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:46.296
(laughing maniacally)
