00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:35.694
OF YUGI'S
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!

00:09:35.694 --> 00:09:39.000
DOES THAT MEAN
THEY'RE EQUAL
IN STRENGTH?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.436
NO!

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:41.938
MARIK'S IS JUST
A CHEAP COPY
OF THE ORIGINAL!

00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:43.942
HIS WANNABE
OBELISK ONLY HAS

00:09:43.942 --> 00:09:45.645
3,000 DEFENSE
POINTS,

00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:47.649
SO THE REAL
OBELISK

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:50.355
CAN KNOCK IT
INTO NEXT WEEK
WITH ONE BLOW!

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:53.527
YUGI'S GONNA
DESTROY THAT FAKE
NEXT TIME HE ATTACKS,

00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:54.529
RIGHT, SETO?

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:55.597
NOT QUITE.

00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:57.768
I'M SURE THERE'S
MORE TO MARIK'S MONSTER

00:09:57.768 --> 00:09:59.605
THAN MEETS THE EYE,
MOKUBA.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:03.379
JUST KEEP WATCHING.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.583
Yami-Yugi:
YOUR CARBON COPY

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:08.355
PALES IN COMPARISON
TO THE ORIGINAL, MARIK!

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:11.260
Yami-Marik:
MY EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
IS MORE POWERFUL

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.763
THAN YOU THINK,
PHARAOH,

00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:15.268
BUT YOU'LL FIND
THAT OUT SOON ENOUGH!

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:18.307
NOW FINISH YOUR MOVE
SO MY ASSAULT CAN CONTINUE!

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:19.376
FINE!

00:10:19.376 --> 00:10:20.778
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN.

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:23.317
IT'S YOUR MOVE!

00:10:23.317 --> 00:10:25.688
VERY WELL, FOOL!

00:10:25.688 --> 00:10:28.459
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
THAT'S THE EXACT CARD
I NEEDED

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.632
TO MAKE MY EGYPTIAN
GOD SLIME UNSTOPPABLE.

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.337
NOTHING WILL BE ABLE
TO DESTROY IT!

00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:37.376
MY LIFE POINTS
WILL BE PROTECTED
INDEFINITELY.

00:10:37.376 --> 00:10:41.418
NOT EVEN THE MIGHTY OBELISK
WILL GET THROUGH.

00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:44.022
PHARAOH,
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:48.397
SOON, MY WINGED DRAGON OF RA
WILL RETURN TO THE FIELD
AND WIPE YOU OUT.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:52.471
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
I HAVE MY EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME

00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:56.813
TO SERVE AS A WALL
BETWEEN YOU
AND MY LIFE POINTS.

00:10:56.813 --> 00:10:59.919
AND NOW FOR THE CARD
THAT WILL MAKE THAT
ALL POSSIBLE--

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:03.692
THE INDESTRUCTIBLE
REVIVAL JAM!

00:11:03.692 --> 00:11:08.635
I SEE YOU RECALL
YOUR LAST ENCOUNTER
WITH MY REVIVAL JAM,

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:13.478
WHEN YOU FACED
MY MIND SLAVE, STRINGS!

00:11:13.478 --> 00:11:16.984
Yami-Yugi:
MAGIC CYLINDERS, FIRE!

00:11:16.984 --> 00:11:22.728
SAY, GOOD-BYE, MARIK!

00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:26.768
SO YOUR REVIVAL JAM
IS ABLE TO BLOCK
ALL OF MY ATTACKS!

00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:28.506
YES!

00:11:28.506 --> 00:11:30.543
THEN IT REGENERATES,
PHARAOH!

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:32.346
[YAMI-MARIK LAUGHS]

00:11:32.346 --> 00:11:35.118
NOW I HAVE
ONE MORE CARD TO PLAY--

00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:37.322
POLYMERIZATION!

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:41.797
THIS ALLOWS ME TO FUSE
MY EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
WITH MY REVIVAL JAM!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.712
SO WHAT DO YA THINK
MARIK IS COOKIN' UP
NOW, GUYS?

00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:53.886
Tristan: UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT!

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:55.055
Yami-Marik:
AND NOW THE FUSION

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:59.297
OF MY TWO CREATURES
IS COMPLETE!

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:02.670
Yami-Yugi:
BUT IT LOOKS THE SAME!

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.542
I ASSURE YOU
MY EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
HAS TRANSFORMED

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:06.811
INTO A NEW,
MORE POWERFUL BEAST.

00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:09.616
IT'S YOUR MOVE,

00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:11.887
SO GO AHEAD AND ATTACK IT,
IF YOU DARE!

00:12:11.887 --> 00:12:13.657
VERY WELL!

00:12:13.657 --> 00:12:15.427
STAND BACK!

00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:19.134
I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:22.373
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO DESTROY

00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:24.711
YOUR EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IMPOSTER, MARIK!

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:28.719
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR,
ATTACK!

00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:32.125
NICE ONE, YUGE!

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:36.099
YOU LIQUEFIED DAT PHONY!

00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:37.736
[LAUGHS]

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:42.544
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS INDESTRUCTIBLE!

00:12:42.544 --> 00:12:46.084
Yami-Yugi:
MARIK'S FUSION MONSTER
IS REGENERATING ITSELF!

00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:47.688
PRECISELY!

00:12:47.688 --> 00:12:50.660
THAT'S BECAUSE MY MONSTER
HAS THE COMBINED POWER

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.470
OF EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
AND REVIVAL JAM!

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.774
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:57.774 --> 00:12:58.775
MY PLAN'S COMPLETE.

00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.914
THANKS TO MY INVINCIBLE
DEFENSE MONSTER,

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.584
MY LIFE POINTS
CAN NO LONGER BE DAMAGED.

00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:07.024
THEREFORE, DEFEATING ME
IS IMPOSSIBLE, PHARAOH!

00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:08.760
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.531
THIS WAS MY PLAN
FROM THE START,

00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:12.802
AND YOU FELL FOR IT!

00:13:12.802 --> 00:13:15.673
HOW NAIVE OF YOU!

00:13:15.673 --> 00:13:17.177
THAT'S INSANE!

00:13:17.177 --> 00:13:19.180
Joey: I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT
A THING, TRISTAN.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.152
YUGI WILL FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TAKE THAT
BIG SLIMEBALL DOWN!

00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:24.957
WELL, IT DOESN'T
LOOK TOO PROMISING
FROM WHERE I'M STANDING!

00:13:24.957 --> 00:13:26.961
COME ON.

00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:30.000
NOW WHAT?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.839
Kaiba, voice-over: I KNEW
THIS WAS ALL PART OF
MARIK'S STRATEGY ALL ALONG.

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:37.849
HE LET YUGI'S
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR
ATTACK HIM ON PURPOSE.

00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:43.459
THAT ALLOWED MARIK
TO CREATE AN UNSTOPPABLE
OBELISK CLONE.

00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:45.563
NOW WHENEVER
YUGI ATTACKS IT,

00:13:45.563 --> 00:13:49.170
MARIK'S EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
WILL ABSORB THE BLOW

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.006
AND THEN REGENERATE ITSELF.

00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:53.712
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:57.051
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE!

00:13:57.051 --> 00:13:59.054
IT'S OVER FOR YOU,
PHARAOH.

00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:01.460
ALL YOU CAN DO
AT THIS POINT IS WAIT,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.563
FOR SOON YOU SHALL
WITNESS THE RETURN

00:14:03.563 --> 00:14:06.903
OF THE MOST POWERFUL
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD--

00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:08.940
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.646
AND EVEN IF
YOU COULD ATTACK ME,

00:14:11.646 --> 00:14:14.551
IT'S MY WEAKER HALF
WHO PAYS THE PRICE!

00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:17.222
I'VE WANTED TO BANISH HIM
INTO THE SHADOWS
FOR SOME TIME NOW,

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:21.230
SO FEEL FREE
TO DO THAT FOR ME.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.169
THANKS TO YOU,
HE'S SUFFERED
QUITE A BIT ALREADY.

00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:26.507
MOST OF HIS BODY
HAS VANISHED.

00:14:26.507 --> 00:14:28.811
Marik, voice-over:
PLEASE, PHARAOH,

00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:32.016
DEFEAT MY DARK SIDE
AT ALL COSTS.

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:36.759
ALL RIGHT!
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:42.035
AND THEN I SUMMON BOWGANIAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:44.006
WHAT IS THAT?

00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:46.010
A CREATURE
WITH THE ABILITY

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.450
TO REMOVE 300
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS
EACH TURN,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.721
CAUSING YOU KNOW WHO
TO SUFFER!

00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:54.659
YUGI.

00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:55.895
Yugi: I'LL BE FINE,
I PROMISE.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.199
HOW TOUCHING!

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:01.005
ALL RIGHT, MY MOVE.

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:04.511
I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:07.851
AND THEN I'LL SACRIFICE
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:11.858
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:15:14.196 --> 00:15:16.768
SUMMONING HER
WAS POINTLESS, PHARAOH,

00:15:16.768 --> 00:15:20.141
AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY
SOON ENOUGH!

00:15:20.141 --> 00:15:22.879
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:26.887
NOW, DARK MAGICIAN GIRL,
ATTACK HIS BOWGANIAN!

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:32.129
NOT QUITE! NOW OBSERVE!

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:35.002
YOUR ATTACK HAS TRIGGERED
MY ULTIMATE TRAP CARD--

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.506
JAM DEFENDER!

00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:40.913
[CACKLING]

00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:43.952
AS LONG AS JAM DEFENDER
IS IN PLAY,

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:48.193
MY EGYPTIAN GOD SLIME
IS ABLE TO INTERCEPT
EVERY ATTACK YOU MAKE!

00:15:48.193 --> 00:15:50.197
AND NOW, WATCH THIS.

00:15:50.197 --> 00:15:55.841
YOUR ATTACK BACKFIRES!

00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:57.243
OH, NO!
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:15:57.243 --> 00:16:01.919
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.257
I'VE SUCCESSFULLY
EXECUTED A STRATEGY

00:16:04.257 --> 00:16:06.561
THAT PREVENTS ME
FROM LOSING THIS DUEL.

00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:09.233
THANKS TO THE BEAST
THAT STANDS BEHIND ME,

00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:11.937
I'VE ACHIEVED
COMPLETE IMMORTALITY.

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:15.310
AND SINCE YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL'S
ATTACK BACKFIRED,

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.786
YOU LOSE 1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:21.088
NO, YUGI!

00:16:21.088 --> 00:16:22.758
AAH!

00:16:22.758 --> 00:16:26.933
BUT WAIT.
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
IS ABOUT TO LOSE

00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:29.838
EVEN MORE OF HIMSELF
TO THE SHADOW REALM,

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:33.846
THANKS TO
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF MY BOWGANIAN!

00:16:39.222 --> 00:16:41.226
NO! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:16:41.226 --> 00:16:43.263
[COUGHS]

00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:44.799
IT'S YOU
I'M WORRIED ABOUT!

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:47.270
DON'T. I'M FINE.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.776
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
YES, BUT FOR HOW LONG?

00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:59.022
Yami-Marik:
THE SHADOWS ARE FEASTING
ON LITTLE YUGI!

00:16:59.022 --> 00:17:01.427
LOSE A FEW MORE LIFE POINTS

00:17:01.427 --> 00:17:04.532
AND YOUR FRIEND'S BODY
WILL BE COMPLETELY GONE!

00:17:04.532 --> 00:17:09.476
AND THEN...
ALL 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
WILL BELONG TO ME,

00:17:09.476 --> 00:17:12.414
ALONG WITH
ALL OF YOUR POWER,

00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:16.222

YOU OK, TEA?

00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:32.418
Marik and Tea: HOLD ON.

LISTEN, PLEASE.

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:39.398
YOU MUST OVERPOWER
MY DARK SIDE AT ALL COSTS,

00:17:39.398 --> 00:17:40.400
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT PROTECTING ME.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.673

IN ORDER
TO REASON WITH YOU.

DESTROY MY EVIL HALF

AND LET THE SHADOWS
TAKE ME!

00:17:55.028 --> 00:17:56.430
OH, NO!

SETO? WHAT'S
GOING ON?

00:17:58.334 --> 00:18:01.172
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
IT APPEARS MY WEAK SIDE

00:18:01.172 --> 00:18:03.009
DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO GIVE UP.

00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:05.514
WELL, SOON HE'LL BE
OUT OF MY WAY FOR GOOD.

00:18:05.514 --> 00:18:06.683
Marik:
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
PHARAOH.

00:18:06.683 --> 00:18:09.354
MY FAMILY AND I
WERE CHARGED

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.791
WITH PROTECTING
YOUR TOMB

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:12.427
UNTIL YOUR RETURN,

00:18:12.427 --> 00:18:16.200
AND I ALWAYS
RESENTED THIS TASK.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.373
SO HE WAS BORN
AS A RESULT
OF MY ANGER!

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:21.377
NOW HE MUST BE
DESTROYED,

00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:23.281
AND I SHALL GO
WITH HIM!

00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:25.284
YOU'LL WHAT?

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:28.023
IS TEA HOME?

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:29.626
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:31.529
WHAT A PATHETIC SIGHT!

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:34.368
YOU'VE REJECTED THE PHARAOH
FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

00:18:34.368 --> 00:18:36.772
AND NOW YOU BEG
FOR HIS FORGIVENESS?

00:18:36.772 --> 00:18:39.578
I'M AFRAID
IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE
FOR THAT, YOU FOOL.

00:18:39.578 --> 00:18:42.149
YOU'VE ALREADY CREATED ME

00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:44.520
AND NOW YOUR BODY
BELONGS TO ME,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.522
AND YOU BARELY EXIST!

00:18:45.522 --> 00:18:48.728
JUST LOOK AT YOURSELF!

00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:50.599
YOU'RE A MERE SHADOW
OF THE PERSON
YOU ONCE WERE.

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:53.470
YOU CAN NEVER STOP ME.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.576
SO LET ME FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED!

00:18:56.576 --> 00:18:58.480
SHE'S UNDER
MARIK'S CONTROL!

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.016
BUT SHE MUST BE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE!

00:19:00.016 --> 00:19:01.552
EARTH TO TEA!

00:19:01.552 --> 00:19:03.322
Ishizu:
MARIK, DON'T DO THIS!

00:19:03.322 --> 00:19:06.327
PLEASE DON'T.

00:19:06.327 --> 00:19:08.131
DO WHAT?

00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:11.137
SURRENDER
YOUR OWN LIFE
TO STOP HIM.

00:19:11.137 --> 00:19:14.310
SORRY, SISTER,
BUT THERE ISN'T
ANOTHER WAY.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.479
ALL RIGHT!

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:17.750
Marik:
YOU MUST TAKE DOWN
THE EVIL FORCE

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.088
THAT NOW CONTROLS
MY BODY, PHARAOH!

00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:22.692
AND IF DESTROYING HIM
MEANS DESTROYING ME,

00:19:22.692 --> 00:19:24.528
THEN SO BE IT.

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:26.499
ISN'T THAT POETIC?

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.536
MY WEAKER SELF
WOULD RATHER BE SWALLOWED
BY THE SHADOWS

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:30.474
THAN SEE ME WIN.

00:19:30.474 --> 00:19:34.581
HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID
THIS IS ALL JUST
A WASTE OF TIME.

00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:36.318
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN LOSE.

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:40.526
NOW, THEN,
LET'S GET BACK TO
YOUR DEFEAT, SHALL WE?

00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:42.596
MY MOVE!

00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:45.201
STAND BACK!

00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:48.708
Yami-Marik, voice-over:
NOW I CAN BRING BACK
MONSTER REBORN!

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:51.112
THEN RA WILL FOLLOW!

00:19:51.112 --> 00:19:56.221
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC CARD
MINING FOR MAGICAL STONES!

00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:58.292
THAT'S RIGHT, PHARAOH!

00:19:58.292 --> 00:20:00.129
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO TRANSFER ANY MAGIC CARD

00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:03.202
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
TO MY HAND,

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.708
AND ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DISCARD TWO CARDS.

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:09.380
OF COURSE,
I'VE CHOSEN THIS CARD--

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.719
MONSTER REBORN!

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:14.389
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEXT.

00:20:14.389 --> 00:20:16.459
IN JUST ONE MORE TURN,

00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:19.899
I'LL BRING BACK
MY WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:20:19.899 --> 00:20:21.469
I THOUGHT SO!

00:20:21.469 --> 00:20:23.406
BUT HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESTROY!

00:20:23.406 --> 00:20:25.410
NO.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.912
THERE'S ONE CHANCE LEFT,

00:20:26.912 --> 00:20:28.749
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY.

00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:30.776
YOU'RE DONE.

00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:33.312
VICTORY IS MINE NOW,

00:20:33.312 --> 00:20:35.381
AND WITH IT WILL COME
ULTIMATE POWER!
