THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

IF JOEY IS DEFEATED BY MARIK,

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.679
HE COULD END UP LOSING
MORE THAN JUST THAN
JUST THIS TOURNAMENT!

OH, HEY, YUGE!

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.352
JOEY, THIS IS GOING
TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT

AND DANGEROUS DUEL
YOU'VE EVER FOUGHT!

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.790
NAHH! MARIK'S GOT
NO CHANCE!

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.124
I'M GONNA CRUSH
DAT CREEP.

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:20.526
JUST WAIT AND SEE!

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:22.361

DIS TOURNAMENT
BEFORE HE CAN SAY...

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.462
"FREAK SHOW!"

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:25.631
YOU COULDN'T
BEAT MARIK

00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.733
IF HE WAS
BLINDFOLDED
AND HANDCUFFED!

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:29.401
I DON'T REMEMBER
ASKIN' YOU!

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.136
WAKE UP, WHEELER!

KAIBA! YOU MAY NOT
REMEMBER THIS,

00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:39.778
BUT I WENT UP AGAINST
MARIK'S WINGED DRAGON
OF RA ONCE BEFORE, PAL!

AND I DID JUST FINE!

WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN!

I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DEFEAT RA!

00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:55.728
KAIBA, THE WINGED DRAGON
OF RA HOLDS SECRETS

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:57.663
THAT NONE OF US
UNDERSTAND YET!

00:03:57.663 --> 00:04:00.666
WRONG! I'VE UNCOVERED
THE SECRETS OF RA!

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:01.900
WHAT!?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.836
Kaiba: WHILE YOU
GEEKS WERE ASLEEP,

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:06.939
MY COMPUTER
WAS TRANSLATING
THE EGYPTIAN WRITING

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.007
THAT NO ONE ELSE
COULD!

00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:12.711
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
READING THE TEXT?

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.013
OR PERHAPS YOU'RE
IN NEED OF A LESSON

00:04:15.013 --> 00:04:18.250
IN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN
SCRIPTURES, MY DEAR!

HE'S GOT ME TRAPPED!

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:22.855
WELL, WHY DON'T I
READ THE TEXT

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.923
AND REGAIN CONTROL
OF RA!

00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:29.228
GREAT BEAST OF THE SKY,
PLEASE HEAR MY CRY.

00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:32.331
TRANSFORM THYSELF
FROM ORB OF LIGHT

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.335
AND BRING ME VICTORY
IN THIS FIGHT!

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:38.704
UNLOCK YOUR POWERS
FROM DEEP WITHIN,

00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:40.873
SO THAT TOGETHER
WE MAY WIN!

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:44.910
APPEAR IN THIS SHADOW GAME
AS I CALL YOUR NAME...

UH! WAIT! THIS CAN'T BE!

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.056
I...CAN READ IT!

00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:59.458
YOU WHAT!?

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:01.126

IS COMPLETELY CLEAR
TO ME!

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:04.263
I CAN READ
THAT PARAGRAPH

00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:05.964
AS IF IT WERE WRITTEN
IN ENGLISH,

00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:09.468
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT LANGUAGE BEFORE
IN MY LIFE!

00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:12.070
BIG DEAL, SO YOUR
COMPUTER FIGURED IT
ALL OUT!

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.540
Yugi, thinking:
I HAVE A FEELING THERE'S
MORE TO IT THAN THAT!

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.844
I BET KAIBA'S CONNECTION
TO THE ANCIENT PAST
SOMEHOW HELPED HIM!

00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:20.546
WHEELER.

00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:23.382
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DEFEAT
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA,

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:24.817
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HELP ME!

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:25.951
Joey: FAT CHANCE!

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.187
YOU'RE DA LAST PERSON
I'D EVA HELP!

00:05:28.187 --> 00:05:29.922
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE.

00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:32.991
I'LL BE WATCHING
YOUR DUEL AGAINST
MARIK VERY CLOSELY

00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:35.127
SO I CAN TEST
MY OWN STRATEGY

00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:37.830
AND TAKE HIM DOWN
IN THE FINALS!

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.131
Yami-Marik: WE'LL SEE.

00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.500
ONCE I DEFEAT YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.802
I'LL GAIN OWNERSHIP
OF SLIFER
THE SKY DRAGON,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.472
GIVING ME TWO
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
IN MY DECK!

00:05:46.472 --> 00:05:48.440
THEN I'LL BE READY
TO FACE MARIK,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.577
ONCE YOU'VE SERVED
AS MY LAB RAT,
OF COURSE.

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:53.612
I'M NO LAB RAT!!!

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:55.714
THE FACT THAT
AN AMATEUR LIKE YOU

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:58.717
MADE IT THIS FAR
IN MY TOURNAMENT
BOGGLES MY MIND,

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:00.085
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

00:06:00.085 --> 00:06:02.321
AT LEAST YOU'RE SERVING
A PURPOSE, WHEELER!

00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:05.591
WATCHING YOU LOSE
TO MARIK WILL HELP ME
PERFECT MY PLAN

TO CRUSH HIS
WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:09.895

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:18.737
BUT IN ORDER FOR THIS
SCHEME OF YOURS TO WORK...

00:06:18.737 --> 00:06:21.974
YOU HAVE TO
GET PAST ME FIRST!

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:23.075

00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.814
OUR DUEL IS NEXT.

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:29.882
BUT FIRST...

00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:32.284
WHEELER HAS A BATTLE
TO LOSE.

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:36.355
I HATE DAT GUY!

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:38.156
WE'RE HERE, BRO!

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:40.792
SO WHAT DID
WE MISS, GUYS?

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:43.529
YEAH, SOMETHING WRONG?
I SENSE TENSION.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.030
Duke: IS KAIBA
BUGGING YOU?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.131
NONE OF YOUR
BUSINESS!

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.600
WELL, EXCUSE US,
SUNSHINE!

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.603

IN A CHEERFUL MOOD!

[THINKING]
I GOTTA KEEP MY COOL.

00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:55.374
KAIBA'S JUST PLAYIN'
MIND GAMES.

00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.810
I HAFTA IGNORE HIM
AND FOCUS ON TAKIN' DOWN MARIK.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.479
IT'LL BE TOUGH...

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.048
BUT I DIDN'T GET WHERE I AM
BY TAKIN' IT EASY!

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.484
I CRUSHED SOME OF
DA STRONGEST DUELISTS AROUND

00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:07.853
TO GET TO
DA BATTLE CITY FINALS.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:12.190
BESIDES, DIS IS ABOUT MORE
THAN JUST WINNIN' A DUEL.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.227
IT'S ABOUT KEEPIN' A PROMISE
I MADE TO A FRIEND!

00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:23.463
Joey, thinking:
IT'S TIME TO SHOW MARIK

00:07:23.463 --> 00:07:25.131
THAT NO ONE MESSES
WITH MY FRIENDS

00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:26.699
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:28.001
A'RIGHT!

00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:30.370
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN, MARIK!

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.741

OF THE SEMIFINALS
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:37.444

00:07:37.444 --> 00:07:38.845

DAT'S MEEE!

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.917

YOU CAN DO THIS!

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:45.552

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO DO BUT WAIT.

00:07:53.793 --> 00:08:00.667
THE REST
IS IN THE HANDS OF FATE.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.669

I PLAY GIL GARTH
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.147
THEN I SHALL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:17.450
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE,
YA NUT CASE!

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.518
HMM.

00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:20.453
[THINKING]
I'M OFF TO A BAD START!

00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:22.589
HIS GIL GARTH
HAS 1,800 ATTACK POINTS,

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:25.225
AND NONE 'A MY CARDS
CAN BEAT IT...YET!

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:28.595
I'LL ALSO PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:29.996
AND THEN...

00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:33.967
I'LL SUMMON
MY ALLIGATOR'S SWORD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:35.201
HA HA HA!

00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:36.603
THE TIME HAS COME

00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:39.005
TO TAKE THIS DUEL
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:40.807
NEXT LEVEL?!

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:42.942
[THINKING]
I KNOW WHERE
DIS IS GOIN'!

00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:44.110
[GASP]

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.312
I WAS AFRAID MARIK
WOULD DO THIS!

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.047
COME ON! AGAIN?!

00:08:48.047 --> 00:08:49.282
JOEY!

00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:50.817
THIS DUEL'S NOW...

00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:53.887
A SHADOW GAME!

00:08:53.887 --> 00:08:57.624
SHOW SOME
ORIGINALITY, MARIK!

00:08:57.624 --> 00:09:00.426
HA! THE SHADOWS
HUNGER FOR YOUR MIND

00:09:00.426 --> 00:09:01.594
AND YOUR SOUL!

00:09:01.594 --> 00:09:03.630
YOU DON'T SCARE ME!

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.332
THEN WHAT'S THAT I SEE
IN YOUR EYES?

00:09:06.332 --> 00:09:08.635
I'D SAY
IT'S THE LOOK OF FEAR!

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:12.038
FEAR THAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO JOIN YOUR FRIEND
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:14.073
LOOK!
SHE'LL BE BACK!

00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:15.808
YOU'RE SO NAIVE!

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:17.544
SHE'S PERMANENTLY TRAPPED!

00:09:17.544 --> 00:09:19.646
AND WITH EACH
PASSING SECOND,

00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:23.316
ANOTHER PORTION
OF HER MIND IS ABSORBED
INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:09:23.316 --> 00:09:24.317
HA HA HA!

00:09:24.317 --> 00:09:26.653
SOMEONE! PLEASE! HELP!

00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:29.255
WHERE AM I?!

00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:30.423
HA HA HA!

00:09:30.423 --> 00:09:32.158
CAN YOU HEAR
THOSE SCREAMS?

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:35.061
THEY'RE THE HELPLESS CRIES
OF YOUR FRIEND MAI,

00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:38.665
AND THE WEAKER SHE GETS,
THE STRONGER MY POWERS GROW!

00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:41.367
HEH HEH.
HA HA HA!

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:42.702
YOU'RE NUTS!

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:45.104
WE CAN'T LET JOEY
GO THROUGH WITH THIS DUEL!

00:09:45.104 --> 00:09:47.941
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
MARIK DUELED MAI.

00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:49.342
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

00:09:49.342 --> 00:09:50.443
LET'S STEP IN!

00:09:50.443 --> 00:09:52.745
JOEY'S ALREADY
MADE UP HIS MIND!

00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:54.981
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
WHAT HE SAID TO ME?!

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.416
WHAT'S THAT?

00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:57.850
SORRY, YUGI.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.620
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.858
JOEY AND I HAD
A CONVERSATION AFTER
MAI'S DUEL WITH MARIK.

00:10:05.858 --> 00:10:07.927
I KNOW IF I BEAT
DAT EVIL FREAK IN A DUEL,

00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:09.762
I CAN GET MAI BACK!

00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:11.531
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS, JOEY?

00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:14.801
I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE SURE OF ANYTHING
IN MY LIFE.

00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:18.104
I OWE IT TO MAI
AND TO MYSELF
TO FACE MARIK.

00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:20.106
IF I BACK AWAY
FROM DIS FIGHT NOW,

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.275
I'LL NEVA BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:24.210
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.845
I GAVE MAI MY WORD

00:10:25.845 --> 00:10:28.648
DAT I WOULDN'T LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HER,

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:32.051
AND JOEY WHEELER
WOULD NEVER BREAK
A PROMISE TO A FRIEND...

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:35.655
SO LOOK OUT, MARIK,
'CAUSE HERE I COME!

00:10:35.655 --> 00:10:38.324
SO JOEY'S TRYING
TO RESCUE MAI OUT THERE,

00:10:38.324 --> 00:10:39.959
AND NOTHING WE SAY
CAN STOP HIM!

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.694
I THOUGHT SO!

00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:44.631
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO
TO SAVE JOEY!

00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:46.499
I KNOW HE PROMISED
TO BRING BACK MAI,

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.568
BUT THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER WAY!

00:10:48.568 --> 00:10:51.170
YUGI...
IT'S HIS FIGHT.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.438
[GASP]

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:54.974
JUST AS JOEY MADE
A PROMISE TO MAI,

00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:56.442
WE MADE A PROMISE
TO JOEY

00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:58.978
THAT WE WOULD STOP
PROTECTING HIM!

00:10:58.978 --> 00:11:01.881
WE MUST PROVE
TO JOEY THAT WE
BELIEVE IN HIM

00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:03.716
BY LETTING HIM DUEL
ON HIS OWN!

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:04.717
WE CAN'T!

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.486
TRUST HIM, YUGI!

00:11:06.486 --> 00:11:07.754
HE CAN WIN,

00:11:07.754 --> 00:11:10.356
BUT HE NEEDS OUR
FAITH AND SUPPORT!

00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:12.525
Tea: HANG IN THERE, JOEY!

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:15.061
WE'RE ALL RIGHT HERE!

00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:18.097
Joey, thinking:
I GOTTA BEAT MARIK
AT HIS OWN TWISTED GAME,

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:21.100
OR LOSE MY MIND TRYIN'!

00:11:26.532 --> 00:11:28.234
SO LET'S DO DIS!

00:11:28.234 --> 00:11:29.735
BRING IT ON!

00:11:29.735 --> 00:11:31.537
I'M READY
FOR YOUR SHADOW GAME!

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:35.107
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO EXPERIENCE?

00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:36.242
I DOUBT IT.

00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:38.177
THE ANCIENT DARK MAGIC
I'VE CONJURED

00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:40.079
WILL DEVASTATE YOU!

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:42.214
YOU POOR SOUL!
MY MOVE!

00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:45.484
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE POWER
OF THE SHADOWS BEFORE,

00:11:45.484 --> 00:11:47.753
BUT AS THE ENERGIES
WITHIN ME GROW,

00:11:47.753 --> 00:11:50.322
SO DOES THE STRENGTH
OF MY SHADOW MAGIC!

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:52.558
ARE YOU HERE TA TAWK,
OR ARE YOU HERE
TA DUEL?!

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:54.526
AREN'T YOU
THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:56.362
HOW THIS SHADOW GAME
WILL DIFFER

00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:58.497
FROM THE ONE
THAT YOUR FRIEND LOST?

00:11:58.497 --> 00:12:01.133
AS ALWAYS,
THE LOSER OF THE DUEL

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:04.103
WILL BE BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM
FOR ETERNITY,

00:12:04.103 --> 00:12:05.571
BUT THERE'S A BIT MORE!

00:12:05.571 --> 00:12:06.672
Joey: SAY WHAT?!

00:12:06.672 --> 00:12:08.474
YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT!

00:12:08.474 --> 00:12:10.609
AND THEN...
MARK MY WORDS...

00:12:10.609 --> 00:12:12.645
YOU'LL WISH
YOU NEVER FACED ME!

00:12:12.645 --> 00:12:13.646
GRR!

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:15.114
JOEY CAN'T LET MARIK

00:12:15.114 --> 00:12:17.349
KEEP MESSING WITH
HIS HEAD LIKE THIS!

00:12:17.349 --> 00:12:19.919
Duke: YEAH, IT'S ALL
PART OF MARIK'S
WARPED MIND GAME!

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:21.954
DON'T LET HIM
GET TO YA, JOEY!

00:12:21.954 --> 00:12:24.657
RIGHT! I'M READY
TA RUMBLE, YA BIG FREAK!

00:12:24.657 --> 00:12:27.092
THEN LET
THE SHADOW GAME BEGIN!

00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:29.295
READY?!

00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:32.164
HEY,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?!

00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:34.099
YOU MIND TELLIN' ME
WHY DIS DING

00:12:34.099 --> 00:12:35.968
IS CONNECTIN' ME
TO MY MONSTA?!

00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:39.305
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THAT THIS DUEL
WAS A BIT DIFFERENT?!

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:41.106
I DECIDED TO RAISE
THE STAKES

00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:44.043
BY ADDING THESE
ENERGY STREAMS TO OUR GAME.

00:12:44.043 --> 00:12:46.946
NOW WHENEVER
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACKED,

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:49.748
YOUR BODY WILL BE DRAINED
OF A LITTLE MORE ENERGY,

00:12:49.748 --> 00:12:52.217
LEAVING YOU WEAKER
THAN BEFORE.

00:12:52.217 --> 00:12:53.452
HA HA HA!
JUST GO!

00:12:53.452 --> 00:12:57.189
WITH GREAT PLEASURE,
MR. WHEELER!

00:12:57.189 --> 00:13:01.927
I'LL SUMMON DRILLAGO
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:04.663
DRILLAGO, ATTACK!

00:13:04.663 --> 00:13:09.768
DESTROY HIS ALLIGATOR'S SWORD
AND DRAIN HIS ENERGY!

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:13.939
AAH!

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:15.240
JOEY!

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.543
STAY STRONG.

00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:20.112
DAT WASN'T FUN.

00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:22.648
IT'S THE ULTIMATE TEST
OF HIS STRENGTH.

00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:24.149
C'MON, JOEY!

00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:28.187
A'RIGHT THEN,
SO DIS DUEL'S
GOT A LITTLE TWIST,

00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:30.155
BUT IT CAN WORK
AGAINST YOU, TOO!

00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:32.558
[THINKING]
HE DOESN'T REALIZE
THAT MY INNER STRENGTH

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:35.461
IS FAR SUPERIOR TO HIS!

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:40.933
GIL GARTH, ATTACK
HIS LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:42.301
JOEY! NO!

00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:45.304
I REVEAL MY
SCAPEGOAT MAGIC CARD
TO PROTECT ME!

00:13:51.777 --> 00:13:52.978
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:13:52.978 --> 00:13:56.015
AND SINCE MY SCAPEGOAT'S
NOT A MONSTER CARD,

00:13:56.015 --> 00:13:57.983
THERE'S NO ENERGY STREAM
TA ZAP ME!

00:13:57.983 --> 00:13:59.418
NICE MOVE, JOEY!

00:13:59.418 --> 00:14:03.489
HMM! WELL, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
I'VE UNDERESTIMATED YOU!

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:04.623
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:14:04.623 --> 00:14:05.958
OH, I WILL!

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.393
STAND BACK!

00:14:07.393 --> 00:14:09.228
READ IT AND WEEP!

00:14:09.228 --> 00:14:12.231
'CAUSE NOW I SUMMON
MY GOOD BUDDY
PANTHER WARRIOR

00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:14.900
TO DA FIELD

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.202
READY FOR A TASTE
'A YOUR OWN MEDICINE?!

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:20.506
I'LL SACRIFICE
ONE SCAPEGOAT
TO JUMP-START MY PANTHA

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:22.541
AND ATTACK
YOUR GIL GARTH!

00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:24.109
YEAH, BABY!

00:14:24.109 --> 00:14:27.513
UNH!

00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:33.018
DAT ONE WAS FOR MAI!

00:14:33.018 --> 00:14:36.488
HEH HEH! SPEAKING
OF YOUR FRIEND MAI,

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:39.058
HER MIND SHOULD BE
EMPTY BY NOW!

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:41.427
YOUR HEAD GAMES
WON'T WORK ON ME!

00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:42.694
MY TURN IS DONE!

00:14:42.694 --> 00:14:44.930
HMM. AND SO ARE YOU.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.399
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN,

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:48.700
BUT NOW...

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.137
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO END ALL THAT WITH THIS!

00:14:52.137 --> 00:14:54.640
MY TRIBUTE BURIAL CARD!

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.707
NO WAY!

00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:58.010
NOW I CAN BRING
ONE MONSTER BACK

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.711
FROM EACH
OF OUR GRAVEYARDS

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:03.282
AND SACRIFICE THEM

THIS NEW MONSTER OF MINE

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:24.736
IS MORE THAN HE
APPEARS TO BE!

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.405
[THINKING]
WHAT DOES HE MEAN
BY DAT?!

00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:28.607
IT'S GOT
THE SAME STRENGTH
AS MY PANTHER WARRIOR,

00:15:28.607 --> 00:15:30.642
UNLESS IT HAS
A HIDDEN ABILITY!

00:15:30.642 --> 00:15:33.645
I GOTTA FIND OUT,
OR I'M DONE!

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.347
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND THEN END MY TURN!

00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:43.414
HUH?

00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:45.016
Yugi, thinking:
WHY DIDN'T MARIK ATTACK?

00:15:45.016 --> 00:15:47.152
HE MUST BE UP TO SOMETHING!

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:50.088
TIME FOR ME TA PUT YOU
IN YOUR PLACE!

00:15:50.088 --> 00:15:52.157
SO LOOK OUT!

00:15:52.157 --> 00:15:54.526
[THINKING]
AWESOME! IT'S JINZO!

00:15:54.526 --> 00:15:57.395
DIS BAD BOY
CAN REARRANGE
HIS HELPOEMER'S FACE

00:15:57.395 --> 00:15:58.930
ONE, TWO, THREE,

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.431
BUT I GOTTA BE
CAREFUL.

00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:03.168
HE COULDA BLASTED
MY SCAPEGOAT LAST TURN,
AND HE HELD BACK!

00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:06.004
HE MUST WANT ME
TO ATTACK HIS HELPOEMER

00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:08.807
SO HE CAN SPRING
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ON ME!

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:11.142
I CAN'T RISK MY JINZO
JUST YET!

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:12.777
IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:16:12.777 --> 00:16:15.747
I SUMMON
ROCKET WARRIOR...

00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:17.215
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:17.215 --> 00:16:19.284
YOU FOOL!

00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:21.586
YOU FELL DIRECTLY
INTO MY TRAP!

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:23.288
REVEAL FACEDOWN CARD!

00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:25.723
BY SUMMONING A MONSTER
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:28.726
YOU ACTIVATED MY
HIDDEN SOLDIERS TRAP CARD!

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:31.296
THIS GIVES ME THE ABILITY
TO SUMMON ANY MONSTER

00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:33.798
WITH FOUR STARS OR LESS!

00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:36.034
MEET MY PLASMA EEL!

00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:37.101
UH!

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:39.704
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:45.743
THE POWER OF PLASMA GRIP!

00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:47.478
NOW FOR THE FUN PART.

00:16:47.478 --> 00:16:50.248
WHEN MY EEL ATTACHES ITSELF
TO A MONSTER,

00:16:50.248 --> 00:16:52.217
IT LOWERS THAT
MONSTER'S STRENGTH,

00:16:52.217 --> 00:16:55.253
SO YOUR PANTHER
LOSES 500 POINTS,

00:16:55.253 --> 00:16:58.423
AND ACCORDING TO THE RULES
OF OUR SHADOW GAME...

00:16:58.423 --> 00:17:00.725
AS YOUR MONSTER
IS DRAINED OF ITS ENERGY,

00:17:00.725 --> 00:17:02.560
SO ARE YOU, WHEELER!

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.996
[ROAR]

00:17:04.996 --> 00:17:07.732
UNH!

00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:08.967
FIGHT IT, JOEY!

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:10.068
HANG IN THERE!

00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:11.269
WELL, NOW.

00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:13.438
ARE YOU BEGINNING
TO REGRET DUELING ME?

00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:17.242
[THINKING]
I WON'T GIVE UP
ON YOU, MAI.

00:17:17.242 --> 00:17:19.244
FORGET ABOUT ME! JUST GO!

00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:21.246
NO WAY, MAI!
NOT WITHOUT YOU!

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:24.082
NOW, WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:17:24.082 --> 00:17:26.951
DESTROY THEM BOTH!

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:28.353
HANG IN THERE!

00:17:28.353 --> 00:17:31.055
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK, MAI!
I PROMISE!

00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:33.858
AND I NEVA BREAK A PROMISE
TO A FRIEND!

00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.560
HA HA HA!

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.396
YOU'LL NEVER...
BREAK MY SPIRIT...MARIK!

00:17:38.396 --> 00:17:40.298
I...MADE A...PROMISE!

00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:42.166
[THINKING]
UNH! DAT EVIL CREEP

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.702
CAN DRAIN MY PHYSICAL
STRENGTH ALL HE WANTS,

00:17:44.702 --> 00:17:47.505
BUT HE'LL NEVA DRAIN
MY DETERMINATION!

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:49.974
I GAVE MAI MY WORD
DAT I'D RESCUE HER,

00:17:49.974 --> 00:17:51.709
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GIVIN' UP!

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:54.212
UNH! AAH!

00:17:54.212 --> 00:17:55.280
WHAT'S THIS?

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.448
THAT FOOL SHOULD BE
BEGGING FOR MERCY!

00:17:57.448 --> 00:18:00.118
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME DOWN,

00:18:00.118 --> 00:18:02.887
NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE
SOMETHING TO FIGHT FOR!

00:18:02.887 --> 00:18:05.490
ACTIVATE
ROCKET WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.226
INVINCIBLE MODE!

00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:13.164
ATTACK HIS HELPOEMER!

00:18:13.164 --> 00:18:15.934
UNH!

00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.636
NOT ONLY DID HE DRAIN
THAT MONSTER'S STRENGTH,

00:18:18.636 --> 00:18:19.637
HE DRAINED MARIK'S, TOO!

00:18:19.637 --> 00:18:20.705
DAT'S RIGHT!

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.941
NEXT, I'LL SACRIFICE
A SCAPEGOAT,

00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:25.343
LETTING PANTHER WARRIOR
STRIKE BACK!

00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:27.145
TIME TO ATTACK NOW!

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:31.316
SLICE AND DICE
HIS HELPOEMER!

00:18:31.316 --> 00:18:35.553
AAH!

00:18:35.553 --> 00:18:37.555
UNH! UHH!

00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:38.856
EAT DAT!

00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:41.826
HEH HEH HEH.
HA HA HA!

00:18:41.826 --> 00:18:43.861
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:45.663
THANK YOU,
LITTLE JOEY.

00:18:45.663 --> 00:18:48.666
BY ATTACKING MY BEAST,
YOU'VE CAUSED
YOUR OWN DEMISE!

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:50.168
HUH? HOW'S DAT?!

00:18:50.168 --> 00:18:51.402
IT'S SIMPLE...

00:18:51.402 --> 00:18:54.472
WHEN YOU SENT MY HELPOEMER
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:57.442
YOU ACTIVATED MY MONSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:57.442 --> 00:18:59.110
WHAT'S ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY?!

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.979
PATIENCE, MY BOY,

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:03.047
FOR YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT,

00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:06.017
AND I DOUBT
YOU'LL LIKE IT!

00:19:06.017 --> 00:19:07.085
HUH? YOUR CARD!

00:19:07.085 --> 00:19:09.253
IT'S IN YOUR
GRAVEYARD NOW!

00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:12.156
HA! IT GETS MUCH BETTER!

00:19:12.156 --> 00:19:13.825
NOW IT CAN DESTROY YOU...

00:19:13.825 --> 00:19:16.394
FROM WITHIN
YOUR OWN DUEL DISK!

00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:18.763
I DON'T GET IT!
HOW'S IT GONNA
DESTROY ME?

00:19:18.763 --> 00:19:21.199
AAH! OH, MAN!

00:19:21.199 --> 00:19:24.469
TIME FOR YOU TO LEARN
HELPOEMER'S SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:25.770
YEAH?

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.506
SAY FAREWELL
TO A RANDOM CARD
FROM YOUR HAND!

00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:31.109
AAH! HEY!

00:19:31.109 --> 00:19:32.744
NOT DAT CARD!

00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:36.581
YES! AND I'M AFRAID
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM!

00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:40.284
FOR AS LONG
AS MY HELPOEMER REMAINS
IN YOUR CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:19:40.284 --> 00:19:42.120
YOU'LL LOSE ONE CARD
EVERY TURN!

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.287
Yugi, thinking: OH, NO!

00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:45.223
IF HE KEEPS LOSING CARDS
FROM HIS HAND,

00:19:45.223 --> 00:19:47.191
JOEY'LL NEVER BEAT MARIK!

00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:48.760
THIS IS
EVEN MORE AMUSING

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.129
THAN MY DUEL AGAINST
YOUR FRIEND MAI!

00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:52.630
BUT IN THE END...

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.434
I'M AFRAID YOUR FATE
WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME
AS HERS--

00:19:56.434 --> 00:19:58.770
AN ETERNITY
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.005
HEH HEH HEH.
HA HA HA HA!
