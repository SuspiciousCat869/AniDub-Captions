WEBVTT

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.384
YOUR MOVE. YOUR MOVE...

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:15.666
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:33.537
YU-GI-OH IS KING OF GAME.

00:00:38.147 --> 00:01:03.200
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.913
WHOA, WHERE AM I?

00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:17.029
AND WHY DOES EVERYTHING
LOOK SO HUGE?

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:18.164
HEY THAT'S CUTE.

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:21.038

OR SOMETHING.

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:23.208
HI! HUH?!

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.779

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:28.553
THEY MADE A MONKEY
OUT OF ME!!!!

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:29.755
POOR TRISTAN.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.526
DON'T WORRY.

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:35.000
THE BIG FIVE SAID
THEY HAD HIM IN SOME KIND
OF A VIRTUAL HOLDING AREA.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.340
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND HIM BEFORE
THEY TAKE CONTROL OF HIS BODY.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.413
THAT'S RIGHT AND HIS MIND
WOULD BE TRAPPED SOMEWHERE
IN CYBER SPACE!

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:53.105

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.385

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:03.252
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME!

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:06.225
GOODBYE.

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:08.596
WAIT! COME BACK!

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:12.204

00:03:37.692 --> 00:03:39.529
TOO LATE! HE'S GONE!

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.731

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:47.913

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.443
I DON'T TRUST
THIS LITTLE RAT.

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:03.779
HE'S A MONKEY.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.583
AND HOW DANGEROUS
CAN HE REALLY BE?

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.320
WAIT, DON'T TOUCH IT,
SERENITY!

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.092
FOR ALL WE KNOW THIS CHIMP
COULD BE A TRAP!

00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:11.629
GOOD POINT, DUKE.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.633
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
TAKE DIS GUY APART.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:17.307
YEAH, WE COULD UNSCREW HIS HEAD
AND TAKE OUT HIS BATTERIES.

00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:20.314
NO WAY! DON'T YOU LAY
A FINGER ON HIM!

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:22.085
WHAT'S DA PROBLEM
SERENITY?

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.857
THIS LITTLE GUY RISKED
HIS LIFE TO SAVE KAIBA!

00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:26.493
I GUESS THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:27.897
AND JUST LOOK
AT HIM.

00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:30.502
HI. HE'S ADORABLE!

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.608
JUST DO ME A FAVOR, OK?

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.947
KEEP THAT THING
OUTTA MY FACE.

00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:38.653
OK, WE GOTTA GET GOING
GUYS!

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.990
THE BIG FIVE
MAY HAVE TRISTAN'S BODY,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.663
BUT HIS MIND'S GOT TO BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE!

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:48.106

ON YOU YA ROBOT VARMINT!

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:50.911
JOEY STOP!

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:52.148
HANG ON, MOKUBA!

00:04:52.148 --> 00:04:57.960
I'LL RESCUE YOU FROM
THESE CORPORATE SLEAZE BALLS!

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:07.313
THIS SHOULDN'T BE TOO TOUGH.

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:08.649
HEY YOU!

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:19.505
GET OUT OF THE ROAD!

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:22.144
SO WE MEET AGAIN
SETO KAIBA.

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.246
WHO ARE YOU!?

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.921
HOW QUICKLY WE FORGET
OUR OLD FRIENDS.

00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.891
ENOUGH GAMES.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.228
WHERE CAN I FIND
MOKUBA!

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:33.234
IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE
THAT BROTHER OF YOURS AGAIN,

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:34.704
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT
PAST ME!

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:44.825
STOP RIGHT THERE,
NESBITT!

00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:45.994
YES, NOAH.

00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:48.466
ALRIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:51.372
WELL SIR...I'VE TAKEN
SETO'S BROTHER.

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:53.978
I CAN SEE THAT
BUT WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN HIM!?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.416
SIMPLE. WHEN I WORKED
FOR KAIBA CORP

00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:59.422
SETO TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME
SO THIS IS PAYBACK!

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:01.761
THAT WASN'T PART
OF THE DEAL, NESBITT.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.465
YOU'VE BROKEN MY RULES.

00:06:03.465 --> 00:06:05.502
BUT SIR
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:08.475
HAND THE BOY TO ME.

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:12.484
I'VE BEEN WAITING
TO TAKE YOU DOWN
FOR A LONG TIME!

00:06:12.484 --> 00:06:19.431
BRING IT ON!

00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:21.402
WHERE AM I?

00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:22.705
YOU'RE WITH ME.

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:26.313
NOAH! STAY AWAY
FROM ME!

00:06:26.313 --> 00:06:28.450
WAIT TIL SETO
FINDS OUT!

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.887
SETO? HA!

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:32.158
HE WON'T BE RESCUING YOU
ANY TIME SOON!

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.561
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.598
MY BROTHER WOULD
NEVER LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO ME!

00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:40.241
HE'S GOT HIS HANDS TIED...
SEE FOR YOURSELF!

00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:41.511
SETO!

00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.419
HE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT PAST
MY ASSOCIATE TO RESCUE YOU!

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.523
IS THAT ONE OF
THE BIG FIVE?!

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:50.931
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:52.534
WELL NOW I DO.

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:56.542
IT TOOK ME A MINUTE
BUT I RECOGNIZE YOUR
VOICE...LEICHTER!

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:59.115
SO LET'S GET THIS DUEL
OVER WITH.

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:01.687
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:05.762
SO GO AHEAD
AND CHOOSE YOUR DECK FROM
THE VIRTUAL CARD DATABASE.

00:07:05.762 --> 00:07:08.334
GLADLY.

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:12.243
NOW CHOOSE A MONSTER
TO ACT AS YOUR DECK MASTER!

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:14.781
THIS IS A NO-BRAINER,
LEICHTER!

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:19.157
I CHOOSE
LORD OF DRAGONS!

00:07:19.157 --> 00:07:22.664
AND I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN
THE FORM OF MY DECK MASTER...

00:07:22.664 --> 00:07:25.003
CAN YOU TELL WHICH MONSTER
I'VE BECOME?

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:27.775
NO AND QUITE FRANKLY
I DON'T CARE LEICHTER!

00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:30.948
BECAUSE CRUSHING YOU
WILL BE A SIMPLE TASK,

00:07:30.948 --> 00:07:32.819
REGARDLESS OF
YOUR DECK MASTER!

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.489
SO LET'S BEGIN!

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:38.130
IT'S TIME TO DUEL,
AS THEY SAY!

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.802
DON'T EXPECT
ANY COURTESY FROM ME.

00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:42.573
I'LL GO FIRST.

00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:44.811
I PLAY ONE MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:49.321
THEN I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:54.498
I SUMMON SPEAR DRAGON!

00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:57.303
YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT,
AREN'T YOU MR. KAIBA?!

00:07:57.303 --> 00:07:59.509
WELL, GO AHEAD
AND ATTACK ME.

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:03.750
MY MONSTER IS IN DEFENSE MODE
SO MY LIFE POINTS
ARE WELL-PROTECTED!

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.120
YOU'RE WRONG LEICHTER!

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.626
YOU DIDN'T DO
YOUR RESEARCH.

00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:10.598
SPEAR DRAGON!
ATTACK HIS FACE DOWN
CARD!

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:14.339
YOU'VE ATTACKED
HIRO'S SHADOW SCOUT,

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:17.513
SO YOU MUST DRAW THREE CARDS
AND SHOW THEM TO ME.

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:19.217
SO WHAT!

00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:20.886
YOU STILL LOSE
LIFE POINTS,

00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:23.793
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MONSTER
WAS IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:23.793 --> 00:08:26.399
THANKS TO
MY SPEAR DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.305
I TOLD YOU, YOU DIDN'T
DO YOUR RESEARCH!

00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:32.411
WELL YOU HAVE TO DISCARD
THE TWO MAGIC CARDS
YOU JUST DREW

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.348
THANKS TO
MY MONSTER'S ABILITY!

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.252
MY MOVE'S NOT OVER!

00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:38.824
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN!

00:08:38.824 --> 00:08:42.332
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
I'LL REVEAL
MY CRUSH CARD

00:08:42.332 --> 00:08:44.302
AND THIS DUEL
WILL BE OVER!

00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:47.008
SAY GOODBYE,
YOU FACELESS FOOL!

00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:52.519
BEFORE I TAKE MY TURN,
I'LL ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD
SOLEMN WISHES!

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:55.325
NOW, I'LL DRAW.

00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:58.199
AND SINCE MY TURN
HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN,

00:08:58.199 --> 00:09:00.203
MY LIFE POINTS
WILL INCREASE!

00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:02.775
THAT'S BECAUSE
MY SOLEMN WISHES TRAP CARD

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:07.118
BOOSTS MY POWER BY 500 POINTS
WITH EVERY CARD I DRAW!

00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:11.661
ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN,
BECAUSE YOUR NEXT TURN
WILL BE YOUR LAST.

00:09:11.661 --> 00:09:14.566
THEN YOU'LL ALL PAY
FOR TAKING MY
LITTLE BROTHER!

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:17.806
NOW I PLAY A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE...

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:21.013
AND PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN
ON THE FIELD!

00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:22.750
YOUR MOVE!

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.354
STRANGE.

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:25.656
HE MUST SEE THAT
MY SPEAR DRAGON

00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:27.760
GOES INTO DEFENSE MODE
AFTER IT ATTACKS,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.799
AND THAT IT HAS
ZERO DEFENSE POINTS.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:32.471
SO WHY DIDN'T
HE ATTACK IT?

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:35.477
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. KAIBA?

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:37.848
BECAUSE I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D MAKE YOUR MOVE

00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:41.322
SO I CAN DEFEAT YOU
AND TAKE OVER YOUR BODY!

00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:42.559
IN YOUR DREAMS!

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:45.631
I SUMMON GIANT GERM!

00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.139
THEN I'LL SWITCH
MY SPEAR DRAGON
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:52.045
NOW, SPEAR DRAGON,
DESTROY HIS FACE
DOWN MONSTER!!

00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:54.283
NOT SO FAST, SETO.

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:56.354
ACTIVATE TRAP CARD!

00:09:56.354 --> 00:09:59.962
MASK OF PERPLEXITY!

00:09:59.962 --> 00:10:02.467
WHAT IS THIS!?

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:04.772
I CAN HARDLY SEE!

00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:06.242
THAT'S THE IDEA!

00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:08.613
NOW YOU WON'T KNOW
WHOSE MONSTER YOU'RE
ATTACKING...

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:09.816
MINE OR YOURS!

00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:11.085
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:14.526
FINALLY,
A DUEL WORTH WATCHING!

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:17.198
TIME FOR YOU TO ATTACK
MR. KAIBA.

00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:20.572
BUT I DOUBT
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:26.083
SPEAR DRAGON,
ATTACK THAT CARD!

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:30.793
NOW TAKE A LOOK
AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE CHOSEN.

00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:33.632
TOO BAD, MR. KAIBA.

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:38.309
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE ATTACKED
YOUR OWN MONSTER, GIANT GERM!

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:41.349
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS AIMING FOR,
YOU FOOLISH OLD MAN!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.954
I HAD TO DESTROY
MY GIANT GERM...

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:51.403
SO I CAN ACTIVATE
MY ALL-POWERFUL
CRUSH CARD TRAP!!!

00:10:51.403 --> 00:10:53.241
IT'S DESTROYED!
BUT HOW?

00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:56.413
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DESTROY TRAPS?

00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:59.052
NOW I KNOW WHAT
MONSTER YOU ARE,
LEICHTER!

00:10:59.052 --> 00:11:02.860
THE ONLY MONSTER
I KNOW WITH THE POWER
TO DESTROY TRAP CARDS!

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.134
YES! I AM JINZO!

00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:09.508
AND WITH A MONSTER
THIS POWERFUL
AS MY DECK MASTER

00:11:09.508 --> 00:11:11.545
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE!

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:14.551
SO PREPARE TO LOSE
YOUR BODY TO ME FOREVER!

00:11:20.564 --> 00:11:22.602
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT

00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:24.774
FOR QUITE SOME TIME
MR. KAIBA.

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:28.348
FOR YEARS I STOOD BY
AND WATCHED YOU RISE TO POWER,

00:11:28.348 --> 00:11:31.387
A POWER THAT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE!

00:11:31.387 --> 00:11:33.859
AS YOUR STEP-FATHER'S
RIGHT HAND MAN,

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:37.701
I NOT ONLY
HELPED RUN KAIBA CORP,
I HELPED RAISE YOU.

00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:39.938
AND HOW DID YOU REPAY ME?

00:11:39.938 --> 00:11:41.943
BY TAKING AWAY EVERYTHING
I WORKED SO HARD TO GAIN!

00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:43.679
HOW DID I DO THAT,
LEICHTER!?

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:46.218
I WAS NEXT IN LINE
TO RUN THE COMPANY

00:11:46.218 --> 00:11:48.390
UNTIL YOU FORCED YOUR WAY
TO THE TOP!

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.661
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THAT!

00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:55.872
ALRIGHT SETO,
AS OF TODAY YOUR FORMAL
EDUCATION IS OVER.

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:59.446
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO

IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:01.751
NOW I HAVE SOMETHING
TO GIVE YOU.

00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:04.858
I THINK YOU'LL BE
QUITE PLEASED WITH IT.

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.495
HOBSON!

00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:10.904
PRESENT SETO WITH HIS GIFT
OF 10 MILLION DOLLARS!

00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:13.008
RELAX...YOU TWO!

00:12:13.008 --> 00:12:15.212
EVERYTHING IN LIFE
COMES AT A PRICE

00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:18.186
SO IF YOU THINK I'M JUST
HANDING THIS MONEY TO YOU

00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:19.990
THEN THINK AGAIN!

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.098
I AM LENDING YOU THIS
SMALL FORTUNE AS A TEST.

00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:25.167
A TEST?

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:26.670
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.609
YOU HAVE EXACTLY ONE YEAR
TO RETURN THE MONEY TO ME.

00:12:29.609 --> 00:12:30.913
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:34.186
BUT YOU MUST PAY ME TEN TIMES
THAT AMOUNT NEXT YEAR!

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:37.259
IF YOU PASS THIS TEST
YOU WILL PROVE TO ME

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.397
YOU HAVE
THE BUSINESS SKILLS
NECESSARY

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:41.501
TO CALL YOURSELF
A KAIBA.

00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:45.008
THIS IS ALL EXPLAINED
IN YOUR CONTRACT, SETO.

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:48.015
PASS AND YOU EARN
THE LAST NAME: KAIBA.

00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:49.953
FAIL AND IT'S BACK
TO THE ORPHANAGE!

00:12:49.953 --> 00:12:51.555
I ACCEPT.

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:56.500
NOW THAT'S A VERY WISE
DECISION ON YOUR PART.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.307
MY ASSISTANT LEICHTER
IS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED
TO HELP YOU.

00:13:00.307 --> 00:13:03.013
YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO PASS.

00:13:03.013 --> 00:13:05.719
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
SETO?

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:08.057
I MEAN, TURNING
10 MILLION DOLLARS

00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:10.763
INTO 100 MILLION DOLLARS
IN ONLY ONE YEAR

00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:12.166
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE!

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.402
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

00:13:13.402 --> 00:13:15.740
SEE, BUSINESS
IS JUST ANOTHER GAME.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.212
LOOK, THERE ARE
A HUNDRED CARDS HERE,
RIGHT?

00:13:18.212 --> 00:13:21.486
NOW PRETEND EACH CARD
REPRESENTS A PIECE
OF A COMPANY.

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:22.588
YEAH.

00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:25.127
WELL, THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL BECOMES A GAME.

00:13:25.127 --> 00:13:27.799
THE TRICK IS
TO OWN MORE CARDS
THAN ANYONE ELSE...

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:30.470
IF YOU CAN DO THAT
YOU'LL CONTROL
THE COMPANY.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.143
AND HOW MANY CARDS
DO YOU NEED TO DO THAT?

00:13:33.143 --> 00:13:35.582
THE MAGIC NUMBER IS 51.

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.588
NO ONE ELSE CAN EVER HAVE
MORE CARDS THAN YOU

00:13:38.588 --> 00:13:41.394
AS LONG AS YOU OWN 51
OUT OF A HUNDRED.

00:13:41.394 --> 00:13:42.830
THAT'S HOW YOU WIN.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.336
HEY...LEICHTER I NEED YOU
TO SPEND

00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:47.440
ALL 10 MILLION DOLLARS
OF MY MONEY

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.079
AND BUY ME FIFTY ONE
PERCENT OF A COMPANY.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.983
WHAT KIND OF COMPANY,
SIR?

00:13:51.983 --> 00:13:57.160
ANY KIND, AS LONG AS
THEY VALUE THEIR WORKERS.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.532
COME IN!

00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:02.438
SIR, I'VE FOUND AND PURCHASED
THE PERFECT COMPANY.

00:14:02.438 --> 00:14:07.683
THIS COMPANY IS KNOWN
FOR TREATING ITS EMPLOYEES
LIKE FAMILY.

00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:10.288
HOW COOL!
YOUR VERY OWN COMPANY!

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:12.192
IS IT GONNA MAKE YOU
ALL THE MONEY YOU NEED?

00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:13.628
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:14:13.628 --> 00:14:15.800
YOU SEE THIS COMPANY
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MONEY.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.706
BUT...THERE IS A WAY
THAT I CAN USE THIS COMPANY

00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.910
TO GET WHAT I NEED...
RIGHT NOW...

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.318
FORCE THE PRESIDENT TO RUN
THE COMPANY MY WAY.

00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:25.553
OH...

00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:26.856
WHAT!?

00:14:26.856 --> 00:14:28.593
WHY SHOULD I
BUY THE COMPANY BACK

00:14:28.593 --> 00:14:30.230
AT TEN TIMES THE PRICE!?

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.969
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL SHUT THIS
PLACE DOWN

00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:35.341
LEAVING ALL
YOUR EMPLOYEES JOBLESS!

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:38.781
YOU ARE HORRIBLE!
AND YOU LEAVE ME
WITH NO CHOICE!

00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:42.089
WITH MY HELP YOU MADE
TEN TIMES YOUR MONEY BACK

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.291
IN THAT ONE DAY.

00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:45.095
AND YOU GOT
ALL THE CREDIT!

00:14:45.095 --> 00:14:46.097
WELL OF COURSE!

00:14:46.097 --> 00:14:47.734
IT WAS
MY BUSINESS SKILLS

00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:49.738
THAT EARNED ME
THAT MONEY LEICHTER!

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:51.942
ALL YOU DID
WAS FOLLOW ORDERS.

00:14:51.942 --> 00:14:54.114
THAT'S ALL
YOU WERE GOOD FOR.

00:14:54.114 --> 00:14:56.686
YOU NEVER ONCE
HAD YOUR OWN IDEA.

00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.957
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
RUN KAIBA CORP!

00:14:58.957 --> 00:15:01.262
NOT ONLY COULD I,
BUT I WILL

00:15:01.262 --> 00:15:03.734
ONCE I ESCAPE
TO THE REAL WORLD
IN YOUR BODY!

00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:05.036
NOT QUITE.

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:07.007
WHEN MY GIANT GERM
WAS DESTROYED

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.179
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
WAS ACTIVATED

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:11.784
ALLOWING ME TO
SUMMON ANOTHER ONE!

00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:15.358
YOU'RE JUST DELAYING
YOUR EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION
MR. KAIBA.

00:15:15.358 --> 00:15:17.228
SINCE I'VE ASSUMED
THE FORM OF JINZO

00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:19.734
ALL OF YOUR TRAP CARDS
ARE USELESS!

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.538
AND YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO

00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:25.480
THAT NO ONE WINS A DUEL
WITH MONSTERS ALONE!

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.286
LEICHTER, I'LL NEVER
LOSE THIS GAME TO YOU!

00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:30.290
OH, YOU'LL LOSE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST THIS GAME!

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.974
LET THE ONSLAUGHT CONTINUE!

00:15:38.974 --> 00:15:42.014
REMEMBER, I GET 500 EXTRA
LIFE POINTS EACH DRAW

00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:44.319
THANKS TO MY
SOLEMN WISHES TRAP CARD!

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:47.359
AND NOW I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACE DOWN.

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:49.965
WHATEVER.

00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:57.947
SPEAR DRAGON, ATTACK
HIS FACE DOWN MONSTER
WITH CYCLONE BLAST!

00:15:57.947 --> 00:16:00.152
NICE TRY!

00:16:00.152 --> 00:16:02.390
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOUR ATTACK IS USELESS!

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.397
BECAUSE I ACTIVATE
CYBER JAR!

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.935
WHICH DESTROYS EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:15.985
OH NO!

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:18.291
IT MAY HAVE COST ME
A FEW LIFE POINTS,

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.930
BUT IT COST YOU
ALL OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.938
NOW WE DRAW FIVE CARDS AND
SUMMON ANY MONSTERS WE PICK.

00:16:24.938 --> 00:16:26.875
VORSE RAIDER
AND TWIN-HEADED
BEHEMOTH!

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:29.147
INJECTION FAIRY LILY!

00:16:29.147 --> 00:16:30.717
SO THEY BOTH
START OVER.

00:16:30.717 --> 00:16:32.053
GO SETO!

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:34.224
AND SINCE
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN

00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:36.629
I GAIN ANOTHER
500 LIFE POINTS,

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:39.669
THANKS TO MY SOLEMN WISHES
TRAP CARD!

00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:44.646
AND NOW I ACTIVATE

00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:48.287
THIS MAGIC CARD EQUIPS ME
WITH AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE

00:16:48.287 --> 00:16:52.896
THAT LOWERS THE ATTACK STRENGTH
OF YOUR OFFENSIVE MONSTERS,
MR. KAIBA!

00:16:52.896 --> 00:17:00.780
LET'S GIVE IT A TEST RUN,
SHALL WE?

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.991
MY WATCH TRANQUILIZER IS ABOUT
TO WEAKEN YOUR VORSE RAIDER!

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:09.832
SINCE IT'S A LEVEL FOUR MONSTER
IT WILL LOSE 400 ATTACK POINTS

00:17:09.832 --> 00:17:13.240
BRINGING IT DOWN
TO A TOTAL OF 1500!

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.742
THAT DOESN'T MATTER!

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.849
HIS FAIRY LILY
IS STILL WEAKER
THAN MY MONSTER!

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:22.993
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
EXPERIENCE MY FAIRY LILY'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:28.171
BY GIVING UP 2000 LIFE POINTS,
I CAN RAISE HER POWER BY 3000!

00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:31.445
ENOUGH TO WIPE OUT
YOUR MONSTER AND THEN SOME!

00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:39.595
LILY, ATTACK!!

00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:42.401
AND THAT'S NOT ALL
MR. KAIBA!

00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:45.540
ACTIVATE SEBEK'S BLESSING!

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.217
THIS MAGIC CARD ALLOWS ME
TO TAKE THE LIFE POINTS
THAT YOU JUST LOST

00:17:50.217 --> 00:17:52.122
AND ADD THEM TO MY OWN!!

00:17:52.122 --> 00:17:55.294
REDUCING YOUR CHANCES
OF SURVIVAL EVEN MORE!

00:17:55.294 --> 00:18:01.039
FINALLY, I'LL SUMMON
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE
MODE AND END MY TURN.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.877
VERY WELL.

00:18:02.877 --> 00:18:05.884
YOU'LL NEVER RECUPERATE
FROM THE BLOW
I JUST DELIVERED!

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:08.856
I'VE CONQUERED
EVERY CHALLENGE
LIFE HAS GIVEN ME.

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:11.328
THIS DUEL WILL BE
NO DIFFERENT.

00:18:11.328 --> 00:18:14.401
I'LL PLACE ONE MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:18.911
SO YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
PLAY IT SAFE BY SUMMONING
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE?

00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:22.018
WELL I HAVE OTHER PLANS
FOR YOU, MR. KAIBA!

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.524
ACTIVATE
LIFE ABSORBING MACHINE!

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:27.563
THIS TRAP CARD ALLOWS ME
TO RECLAIM

00:18:27.563 --> 00:18:31.070
HALF OF THE LIFE POINTS
I GAVE UP IN MY LAST TURN

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.308
GIVING ME QUITE
A POWER BOOST!

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:36.682
NOT THAT I NEED
EXTRA LIFE POINTS
TO ENSURE MY VICTORY,

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:42.660
BUT IT COULDN'T HURT!

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.034
NEXT I'LL SACRIFICE
MY FACE DOWN MONSTER

00:18:46.034 --> 00:18:55.989
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY ULTIMATE WEAPON!

00:18:55.989 --> 00:19:00.398
WHOA!
WHAT'S THAT?

00:19:00.398 --> 00:19:02.469
GOOD THING WE FOUND
THIS VIRTUAL PICK-UP TRUCK!

00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:05.609
YEAH, IT BEATS WALKING,
THAT'S FOR SURE!

00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:10.719
AND IT SHOULD HELP US
TO FIND--

00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:13.425
HEY, WHY'D YA STOP
THE TRUCK JOEY?

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:15.697
LOOK YUGE, WHAT IS DAT?

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:18.603
OH WOW!

00:19:18.603 --> 00:19:35.505
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF A ROCKET!

00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:50.169
Computer: NOW DEPLOYING
COMMUNICATIONS CENTER...

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:54.278
ACTIVATING
INFRA-RED SIGHTING BEAM.

00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:57.115
SEARCHING FOR
PRE-PROGRAMMED TARGET.

00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:59.283
SETO KAIBA LOCATED.

00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:03.221
