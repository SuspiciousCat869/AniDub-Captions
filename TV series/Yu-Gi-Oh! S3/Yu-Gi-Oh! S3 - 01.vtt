( Seto )
We're currently on course
for Kaiba Corp Island.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.575
This is where
the finals will end

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.780
and the champion
will be crowned.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.018
It's a fitting place
for my victory,

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.693
at the very sight where our
stepfather was last seen.

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:17.897
It won't be
long now, Mokuba,

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:20.369
before I prove to
the entire world

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.944
that there is no one on
Earth whose superior to me !

I couldn't sleep
at all last night !

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.261
After everything that
happened yesterday,

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:36.466
it's pretty obvious that
Marik will stop at nothing

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:39.239
to get his hands on the ancient
power of the Pharaoh

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.044
and he'll crush
whoever stands in his way !

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:44.885
So, how long
have you been here ?

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:46.955
Tell me what you've
done with Bakura !

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:49.394
If you mean
the Spirit of the Ring,

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.900
you should know what fate
befalls someone

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.240
unfortunate enough
to lose a Shadow Game !

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.813
But Bakura was only one of
Marik's victim's !

00:02:57.813 --> 00:03:00.084
And the list
is growing fast !

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:01.755
First Marik's servant, Odion,

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.327
took the fall when Marik angered
the Egyptian gods.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.202
( gasping )

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:11.777
Then Marik trapped Mai's mind
in the Shadow Realm !

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:14.516
There's no telling
who he'll target next.

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:17.088
I'm not just gonna sit around
and wait to find out.

00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:18.825
Marik's gotta be
stopped before...

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.295
( rumbling )

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.107
Hey, what was that ?

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:27.110
Wake up, guys !

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:30.818
( rumbling )

00:03:30.818 --> 00:03:32.054
Hey, Téa !

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.361
Did you
feel that ?

00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:36.597
I guess not...

00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:38.201
( rumbling )

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.203
Huh, huh ?

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:40.506
What... who ?

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.916
( Roland )
We appear to be
veering off course, sir.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.619
( Mokuba )
Well, we better
veer back on course

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.490
before my brother
finds out !

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.893
We're trying,
but it's not--

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:51.262
What's going on ?

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:52.499
Seto !

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.536
We've lost control,
see ?

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:57.610
The blimp is changing
direction on its own !

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.612
Impossible !

00:03:58.612 --> 00:03:59.747
How can this be ?

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:01.318
I don't know !

00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:04.190
It's as if the autopilot
was reprogrammed !

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.827
Then shut it down !

00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:07.230
And do it
right now !

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.869
Hey... what's up
with the turbulence ?

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.874
Yeah, some of us
sleep past 5:00.

00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:14.947
( Yami Marik laughing )

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:18.021
It appears someone else
has an interest

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:19.658
in bringing
chaos and misery

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:22.330
upon these fools as well.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.205
What an unexpected and amusing
turn of events.

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:27.441
Oh no !

00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:30.849
The autopilot isn't
responding, Mr. Kaiba !

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.219
Make it respond !

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.423
But it's rejecting every
one of my commands !

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:35.425
What should I do ?

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:38.432
I pay you good money !

00:04:38.432 --> 00:04:39.601
Now do whatever
it takes

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.908
to get us back on course
to Kaiba Corp Island !

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.412
That pile of junk ?

00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:45.580
( Mokuba )
Hey !

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.017
Watch what
you're calling junk !

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:48.654
That's where our company
started !

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.060
Is that the final
dueling site ?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.897
It is.

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:54.099
I built it
from the ruins

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.337
of my stepfather's
empire.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:57.908
It symbolizes
the triumph of

00:04:57.908 --> 00:04:59.177
new over old.

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:03.587
Kaiba Corp wasn't
always a game company.

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:06.359
The corporation was originally
set up by our stepdad

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:09.299
to construct
high-tech vehicles for war.

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:12.573
But then Seto took over
and changed all that.

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.611
That island out there
used to be the company's

00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.013
central headquarters.

00:05:16.013 --> 00:05:19.454
Until my brother tore down all
the military factories !

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:21.993
Then he built that
Duel Tower on top of the rubble,

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:24.332
as a symbol of the new
Kaiba Corp !

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.236
That's enough,
Mokuba !

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:28.942
( Joey )
I think we hit
a sore spot.

00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:30.946
( Seto )
What happened between
me and my stepfather

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:32.450
is family business.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.955
Besides, that's all
ancient history.

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:37.928
Now I command
an empire that dwarfs his

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:40.300
and once I'm crowned the world's
greatest duelist

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.970
on top of that tower,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.743
I'll be free from my
stepfather's shadow forever !

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:50.022
( Fuguta )
I've got it !

00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:51.124
Our navigation computers

00:05:51.124 --> 00:05:53.596
are taking commands from
outside the ship.

00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:55.400
Someone's hacked
into the main frame

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.537
and changed our destination
coordinates !

00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:58.607
( all gasping )

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:00.377
There's no way
that's true !

00:06:00.377 --> 00:06:01.446
The security system

00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:03.685
on this ship
is state-of-the-art !

00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:06.056
Our situation
is worsening !

00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:08.996
We're losing altitude
rapidly !

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:11.969
I can see that,
you buffoon !

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.174
Everybody hold on !

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:16.279
( all yelling )

00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:19.418
Is everyone all right ?

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:22.492
( Tristan )
You mean besides the whiplash
and the sprained ankle ?

00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:24.363
Can you say
"lawsuit" ?

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:26.801
Try the Emergency
Override System !

00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:28.070
It's no use !

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.109
I've been
completely locked out !

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:32.347
( Seto )
I don't know who's
behind all this,

00:06:32.347 --> 00:06:35.387
but I won't let my triumphant
return to Kaiba Corp Island

00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:38.661
be ruined by
some computer geek !

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.031

<i>Too late for that.</i>

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.073
<i>I already have !</i>

<i>Well, fine.</i>

<i>The name is Noah,</i>

00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:25.864
<i>and you and I go back</i>

00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.066
All right...

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:28.870

foolish games !

( Mokuba )
What do you think
he meant by that, Seto ?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.293
( Joey )
Unfortunately, I think
we're about to find out.

00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.337
( Téa )
What is that ?

00:07:44.337 --> 00:07:46.008
Seems like some kind of
underwater fortress

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.043
or something.

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:49.782
( Téa )
I don't like
the looks of it !

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:51.453
It's huge !

00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:53.256
( Joey )
And it's still growing !

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.769
( Fuguta )
I have bad news,
Mr. Kaiba.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.271
What is it ?

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.410
Well, sir, it appears that
floating fortress

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.612
is using a tractor beam

00:08:03.612 --> 00:08:05.349
to pull our
aircraft towards it !

was still
wearing diapers !

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:11.008
I used to create
virtual clones of myself

all the time to
duel against.

00:16:13.713 --> 00:16:15.317

Attention fools !

00:16:27.043 --> 00:16:30.116
It's time for us to demonstrate
the new dueling rules !

00:16:30.116 --> 00:16:32.321
What do you mean
"new rules ?"

00:16:32.321 --> 00:16:34.526
We've created a new
system of dueling

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.496
especially
for our tournament.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.833
So pay attention.

00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:39.337
And try to
keep up !

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:46.819

In our world, we play by
a new set of rules

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:48.522
called the Deck Master System.

00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:51.964

Total Defense Shogun !

00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:57.743
First, each duelist must choose
a Deck Master.

00:16:57.743 --> 00:17:00.048
Blue-Eyes will be
Virtual Kaiba's.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:34.155
And now, I'll move
my Deck Master

to the center
of the playing field !

00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:41.271
Cyber Kaiba played three
Blue-Eyes in one move !

to the field.

Lastly, I'll use
Polymerization
