WEBVTT

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:07.849
YOUR MOVE. YOUR MOVE...

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.785
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.601
YU-GI-OH IS KING OF GAME.

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:41.615
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.530
MOKUBA? HOW CAN YOU
STILL BE ON YOUR
BROTHER'S SIDE?

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.534
HE BETRAYED YOU
TO CONTROL KAIBA CORP!

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:11.339
I WOULD STAND BY MY BROTHER
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:14.078
WE'RE FAMILY AND NOTHING'S
GOING TO SEPARATE US!

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.551
Noah, voice-over:
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.722
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE SHOWN HIM FROM HIS PAST--

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:22.161
ALL OF THOSE TIMES
SETO MISTREATED HIM--

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.465
AND HE'S STILL BEING LOYAL
TO HIS BROTHER!

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.803
I'M SICK OF SETO
GETTING EVERYTHING

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.540
AND LEAVING ME WITH NOTHING!

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.446
I DESERVE TO HAVE
WHAT HE HAS!

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:33.950
AND I'LL START
WITH HIS LITTLE BROTHER!

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.694
FROM NOW ON I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT MOKUBA IS LOYAL
TO ME INSTEAD OF SETO!

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:40.931
I'LL CRUSH HIM BY TAKING
THE ONE THING

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.271
HE THOUGHT HE'D NEVER LOSE--
MOKUBA'S TRUST!

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.444
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR BROTHER'S
THINKING RIGHT NOW?

00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:48.612
HUH?

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.149
TELL ME...DO YOU
HONESTLY BELIEVE

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.320
YOUR BROTHER'S COMING
TO RESCUE YOU?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.860
OR IS HE GLAD
YOU'RE OUT OF HIS WAY
ONCE AND FOR ALL?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.264
SETO'S DEFINITELY
COMING HERE TO GET ME!

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:00.803
AND WHEN HE DOES
YOU'LL BE SORRY!

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:02.139
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.876
WELL WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:06.514
BECAUSE HE'S
RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:10.990
HUH? SETO!

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.795
THAT WAS FAST!
I KNEW YOU'D
COME GET ME!

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:16.100
DON'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
MOKUBA!

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.638
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT
YOU LITTLE BRAT!

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.446
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF YOU
ALWAYS HOLDING ME BACK MOKUBA!

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:25.217
IT'S YOUR FAULT
WE'RE STILL STUCK HERE!

00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:26.654
SETO NO!

00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:28.725
GET A LIFE.

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:31.463
PLEASE COME BACK!

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.902
SETO!!!!!!

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:36.573
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
HERE WITH HIM!

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.644
SETO WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:41.449
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.188
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOUR SO CALLED "BROTHER"

00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:47.294
COULDN'T CARE LESS
WHERE YOU END UP!

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:50.634
BUT I ON THE OTHER HAND
WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU MOKUBA.

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.506
LET ME BE HONEST WITH YOU...

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.378
I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHERS.

00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:57.547
SO I'LL SAVE YOU.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.484
SAVE ME?

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:03.025
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TRAPPED ME HERE.

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.463
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:09.571
I'M YOUR FRIEND.
SETO IS YOUR ENEMY, NOT ME.

00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:13.779
I AM THE ONLY ONE IN THIS WORLD
YOU CAN TRUST MOKUBA!

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.719
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN TRUST.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.762
AWESOME! KAIBA CRUSHED
THE LAST MEMBER
OF THE BIG FIVE!

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:23.866
Noah: WELL SETO...

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.235
WELL WHAT!?

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.571
HA HA HA!

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:28.141
YOU MAY HAVE WON
YOUR DUEL,

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.314
BUT YOU'VE LOST
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT
YOUR BROTHER!

00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:33.785
WHERE IS HE!?

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.756
HERE'S A HINT.
JUST LOOK DOWN.

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.693
THE ROAD'S BACK!

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:41.400
PROCEED AHEAD
AND YOU MAY FIND HIM.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.539
MOKUBA! I'M ON MY WAY!

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.111
KAIBA COME BACK!

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.484

WHEELER!

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.064
IT'S FAMILY BUSINESS!

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.738
OK FINE!

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:03.477

SLOW DOWN TEA!

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:28.059

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.384
WELL WE'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT!

00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:47.564
IT'S SOME KIND
OF AN OLD MANSION
OR SOMETHING.

00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:50.470
REALLY OLD.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.410
BE CAREFUL YUGI!

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.183
WHATEVER THIS PLACE IS
SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT US
GOING IN THERE!

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:58.987
BUT I WONDER WHY?

00:06:58.987 --> 00:07:02.861
HEY DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I HEAR?

00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:05.066

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:07.303
YEAH I DO HEAR IT.

00:07:07.303 --> 00:07:09.074
IT'S A BABY!

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:11.912
MAYBE THAT'S SOME KIND
OF VIRTUAL NURSERY.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:15.853
OR, WHAT IF...
THAT BABY IS ALL ALONE!

00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:18.525

00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:31.851

EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:07:43.173 --> 00:07:47.515
IT'S TIME I TOOK MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS AGAIN!

00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:50.554
Duke: IS IT ME OR DID IT

KIND OF STUNT YOU'RE
TRYING TO PULL!

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.712
JUST HAND HIM OVER.

00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:38.515
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:08:38.515 --> 00:08:41.320

NOAH! WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO MY BROTHER?!

WHAT KIND OF LIES
DID YOU POISON
HIS BRAIN WITH?

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.431
NOT ONE SETO!

00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:25.006
MOKUBA REALIZED HOW
LITTLE YOU CARE ABOUT
HIM ALL BY HIMSELF!

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:28.446
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
HIS ADVICE AND JUST GO!

00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:30.583
SNAP OUT OF IT MOKUBA!

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:32.721
OH, IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN SHOUTING

00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:37.096
TO ERASE ALL OF THOSE
PAINFUL MEMORIES FROM
YOUR BROTHER'S MIND, SETO!

00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:39.534
THINK OF ALL THOSE TIMES
YOU ABANDONED HIM

00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:43.041
JUST SO YOU COULD ACHIEVE
YOUR OWN SELFISH GOALS!

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.611
THAT'S A LIE!

00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:47.016
I'VE NEVER TREATED
MOKUBA LIKE THAT!

00:09:47.016 --> 00:09:49.120
MUST YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.790
MOKUBA, PLEASE!

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.961
DON'T LISTEN
TO NOAH'S LIES!

00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:55.365
HE'S TRYING
TO DRIVE US APART!

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:56.868
Noah: YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH!

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.038
IT'S OKAY.

00:09:58.038 --> 00:10:01.177
I WON'T LET HIM
HURT YOU ANYMORE.
LET'S GO.

00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:02.646
GET BACK HERE!

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:06.086
HEY, THIS IS NOT ONE
OF YOUR SICK GAMES NOAH!

00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:09.560
YOU WILL NOT DESTROY
THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE!

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.069
YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!
HA HA HA!

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:16.406
YOU'RE ALL ALONE NOW!

00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:20.014
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT MOKUBA WOULD
RATHER BE MY BROTHER.

00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:23.120
AND HE'S NOT
THE ONLY THING
I'LL TAKE FROM YOU!

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.222
ENOUGH!

00:10:24.222 --> 00:10:25.591
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.864
YOU DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING
THAT YOU HAVE NOW!

00:10:28.864 --> 00:10:33.072
SO I'LL MAKE SURE
YOUR POSSESSIONS GO
TO SOMEONE WHO DOES!

00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:37.013
AND WHO DESERVES TO HAVE
WHAT'S MINE!?

00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:39.418
ME, OF COURSE!

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:46.766
TEA! I STILL HEAR IT,
BUT THERE'S NOT
A BABY IN SIGHT!

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:48.102
AND IT'S GETTING LOUDER!

00:10:48.102 --> 00:10:49.338
LET'S GO THAT WAY!

00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:51.709
IT'S GOTTA BE COMING
FROM ONE OF THESE ROOMS!

00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:57.019
NO BABIES IN HERE.

00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.092
ANOTHER EMPTY ROOM!

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.363
THIS PLACE SEEMS
TO BE DESERTED!

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:04.167
WEIRD.

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:05.870
HEY, I FOUND SOMETHING!

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.241
IT'S A RATTLE!

00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:10.145
I'D BE CRYING TOO
IF I WERE STUCK

00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:12.116
IN A CREEPY OLD HOUSE
WITH NO RATTLE!

00:11:12.116 --> 00:11:13.618
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:17.192
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
REALLY A BABY IN THIS
PLACE AT ALL TEA!

00:11:17.192 --> 00:11:18.995
THEN WHO'S CRYING!?

00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:21.233
UNLESS IT'S JUST
A DIGITAL SOUND FILE

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:23.972
THAT'S PART OF NOAH'S
FREAKY VIRTUAL UNIVERSE.

00:11:23.972 --> 00:11:25.876
EXACTLY!

00:11:25.876 --> 00:11:27.045
HUH?

00:11:27.045 --> 00:11:28.647
CHECK IT OUT TEA!

00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:30.786
IT LOOKS LIKE A
PICTURE OF SOMEONE!

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:33.224
THIS MIGHT TELL US
WHERE WE ARE!

00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:36.163
SO WHO'S IN
THE SNAPSHOT YUGI?

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:37.665
THIS IS WEIRD.

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:39.001
WHAT IS?

00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:45.313
WHAT ARE ALL THESE CONTRAPTIONS?

00:11:45.313 --> 00:11:48.186
AND WHERE ARE...THOSE FOOLS?

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.090
WHAT'S THIS?

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.693
WELL, WELL.

00:11:51.693 --> 00:11:55.734
A LOCKED DOOR IS ALWAYS
A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN.

00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:59.675
Computer voice:
YOU HAVE ENTERED
AN INVALID PASSWORD.

00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:01.412
ENTRANCE DENIED.

00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:04.752
WHAT!? I HAVE
NO PATIENCE FOR THIS!

00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:07.189
I WON'T BE STOPPED!

00:12:07.189 --> 00:12:09.695
I'LL FIND YOU, YUGI!

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:14.137
ALRIGHT, BEING TRAPPED
IN THE BODY OF A ROBOT MONKEY

00:12:14.137 --> 00:12:17.243
IS NOT AS FUN AS IT LOOKS.

00:12:17.243 --> 00:12:18.713
AAH!

00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:21.151
GUYS! WHAT'S GOT 8 EYES
AND LIVES UNDER WATER?!

00:12:21.151 --> 00:12:22.453
IS THAT A JOKE?

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:25.359
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY IN THE MOOD
FOR LAUGHS, CHIMP-BOY.

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:28.165
THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN
THERE I THINK YOU GUYS
MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT!

00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:31.338
AND THERE I WAS
THINKING YOU COULDN'T
GET ANY MORE ANNOYING

00:12:31.338 --> 00:12:33.508
THAN YOU ALREADY WERE,
BANANA-BREATH.

00:12:33.508 --> 00:12:36.915
FIRST OF ALL!
HANDS OFF THE HAIR!

00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:39.519
YOU HAVE GOTTA CHILL OUT!

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.758
WHAT!?
DID YOU SAY "CHILL!?"

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:43.728
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A LOOK DOWN THERE FIRST!

00:12:43.728 --> 00:12:45.665
THE LITTLE MONKEY'S SCARED.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.369
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT!

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:50.008
IT'S MY DOUBLE MONKEY
NOOGIE ATTACK!

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:56.052
WHAT IS DAT DING!?

00:12:56.052 --> 00:12:59.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:00.528
NO WAY!

00:13:00.528 --> 00:13:01.997
IT'S FOUR 'A DA BIG FIVE!

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:04.636
WE BEAT YOU FREAKS-A-NATURE
FAIR AND SQUARE!

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:08.610
BUT WE STILL HAVE
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF!

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.049
WHAT DO YOU CREEPS
WANT FROM US?

00:13:11.049 --> 00:13:15.524
SIMPLE THE SAME THING
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED
YOUR BODIES!

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:18.062
NOW WHAT, JOEY!?
DON'T WORRY, SIS

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:21.869
DIS BUNCH-A-WACKOS
COULDN'T DUEL THEIR WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG!

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:24.542
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE WANT TO DUEL YOU!?

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:27.346
MY ASSOCIATES AND I
HAVE HAD ENOUGH GAMES.

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:29.785
NOW IT'S TIME FOR US
TO TAKE ACTION!

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:31.121
HOW'S DAT?

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.829
WHY DUEL YOU WHEN WE CAN
TAKE YOUR BODIES BY FORCE!

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:37.066
NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM!

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.276
DIS OUGHTA KEEP
DESE GUYS BUSY!

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:47.720

TIME TA BLOW DIS TACO STAND!

00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:53.932
HA HA HA HA!

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:58.074
WHAT'RE YOU WAITING
FOR, MAN!?

00:13:58.074 --> 00:13:59.510
DIS DING WON'T START!

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.182
COME ON YOU PIECE 'A JUNK!

00:14:04.786 --> 00:14:08.261
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT
FROM A PENGUIN, DID YOU?

00:14:10.798 --> 00:14:12.702
WITNESS DISMISSED!

00:14:16.075 --> 00:14:17.545
JOEY!!

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:19.382
I'M TRYIN' MY BEST!

00:14:19.382 --> 00:14:22.655
START YOU RUST-BUCKET,
COME ON!

00:14:24.392 --> 00:14:25.827
Both: IT STARTED!

00:14:25.827 --> 00:14:27.631
LET'S ROLL!

00:14:27.631 --> 00:14:29.735
WARN ME WHEN YOU'RE
GONNA DO THAT!!

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:32.641
I'M NOT WEARING
A SEATBELT!

00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:39.254
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED
THE TRUTH.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.991
WHAT TRUTH?

00:14:43.897 --> 00:14:46.869
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT
THE VIRTUAL PROJECTION
IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:49.474
IT'S YOU
AND MY STEP-FATHER.

00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:52.714
YES! HE AND I HAVE
A HISTORY, AS WELL!

00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:54.918
IT'S NOAH AND KAIBA!

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:57.290
BUT WHAT'S GOING ON!?

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.997
DOES THIS THING MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU KAIBA!?

00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:03.669
IT'S A TRICK.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.940
THIS IS A PICTURE
OF MY STEP-FATHER.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.578
YOUR STEP-DAD!?
WITH NOAH!?

00:15:08.578 --> 00:15:10.548
Noah: PAY ATTENTION
TO THE SHOW, SETO!

00:15:10.548 --> 00:15:13.221
I THINK IT WILL CLEAR
THINGS UP FOR YOU!

00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:19.867
WHO'S THIS KID?

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:22.239
HE'S MY LATEST
ACQUISITION.

00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:24.310
HIS NAME IS SETO
AND HE AND HIS BROTHER

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.414
WILL BE COMING
TO LIVE WITH US.

00:15:26.414 --> 00:15:28.016
HE'S EXTREMELY
INTELLIGENT.

00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:30.287
YOU COULD LEARN A LOT
FROM HIM!

00:15:30.287 --> 00:15:31.657
AND THAT'S MY PLAN...

00:15:31.657 --> 00:15:34.730
SETO WILL BE HERE
TO CONSTANTLY
CHALLENGE YOU.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.001
MY HOPE IS THAT HAVING
HIM AROUND THE HOUSE

00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:39.739
WILL MOTIVATE YOU TO
IMPROVE YOUR STUDIES.

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:43.947
AFTER ALL, IF I'M GOING
TO HAND KAIBA CORP OVER
TO YOU SOMEDAY, NOAH,

00:15:43.947 --> 00:15:46.553
YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE
TO ME THAT YOU HAVE
THE INTELLECT

00:15:46.553 --> 00:15:49.959
IT TAKES TO RUN
A COMPANY OF
THIS MAGNITUDE!

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:54.334
ALL RIGHT. YOU WON'T BE
DISAPPOINTED FATHER!

00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:56.673
WHAT DID HE SAY!?

00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:58.242
THAT'S HIS DAD!

00:15:58.242 --> 00:16:02.617
NOT QUITE WHAT YOU WERE
EXPECTING IS IT SETO?

00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:05.089
YOU AND I BEING STEP-BROTHERS?

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.592
BUT IT'S ALL TRUE!

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:08.996
I AM GOZABURO'S
ONE TRUE SON.

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:11.835
AND I WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED
TO INHERIT HIS EMPIRE!

00:16:11.835 --> 00:16:14.574
YOU WERE NOTHING
BUT ANOTHER ONE OF
MY FATHER'S SERVANTS...

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:16.445
BROUGHT IN TO MOTIVATE ME!

00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:20.753
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
MY FATHER LET RIFF RAFF
LIKE YOU INTO HIS HOUSE!

00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:22.389
TO TRAIN ME!

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:25.328
AND THAT'S THE STORY OF
HOW AN ORPHAN WITH NO CLASS

00:16:25.328 --> 00:16:28.334
BECAME THE PRESIDENT
OF KAIBA CORP.

00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:30.071
NOT TRUE!

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:31.507
OH, IT'S TRUE!

00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:33.478
AND NOW THE TIME
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED

00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:36.049
FOR ME TO RECLAIM
MY RIGHTFUL POSITION

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:38.688
AS THE HEAD
OF MY FATHER'S EMPIRE!

00:16:38.688 --> 00:16:42.395
SORRY I GUESS THIS MEANS
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB!

00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:45.401
NOAH! YOUR STORY
MAKES NO SENSE!

00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:47.271
IF YOU'RE REALLY
GOZABURO'S SON,

00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:49.509
HOW IS IT THAT I
NEVER MET YOU
BEFORE?

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.780
ANSWER THAT NOAH!

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.154
WELL THAT'S PART TWO
OF MY STORY!

00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:57.725
Computer voice:
ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:59.762
OH NO!

00:16:59.762 --> 00:17:02.702
SORRY BUT I HAVE
TO CUT THIS SHORT.

00:17:02.702 --> 00:17:03.770
DON'T MOVE.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.275
I'LL BE BACK
AFTER I DEAL WITH THEM.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:09.147
YOU'RE STAYING HERE!
UNDERSTAND!

00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:11.352
Yugi: THE REST OF
THE GANG'S IN TROUBLE!

00:17:12.822 --> 00:17:14.625
THEY'RE GAINING ON US!

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.161
Duke: JOEYYYY!

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.931
BE CAREFUL!

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.112
Duke: DUDE!
STRAIGHT AHEAD!

00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:26.515
DESE GUY'S WON'T QUIT!

00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.318
Serenity:
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!

00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:31.124
I'VE GOT YOU NOW!

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:40.776
ARE YOU STILL
IN ONE PIECE, DUKE!?

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:43.214
I THINK SO.

00:17:43.214 --> 00:17:44.250
SERENITY!

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.120
I'M OKAY!

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.523
FOR NOW MAYBE!

00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:51.731
BUT SOON ALL OF YOUR BODIES
WILL BELONG TO US!

00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:56.173
NOW...WHICH OF YOU TWO
SHOULD I CHOOSE
TO TAKE CONTROL OF?

00:17:56.173 --> 00:17:59.379
HOLD ON! I WANT TO HAVE
FIRST CHOICE LEICHTER!

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:03.387
WE'RE GOING
IN SIZE ORDER CRUMP,
SO YOU CHOOSE LAST!

00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:05.391
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

00:18:05.391 --> 00:18:07.028
I'M CHOOSING RIGHT NOW!

00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:10.134
KEEP YOUR WINGS TO YOURSELF
UNTIL I SAY SO!

00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:12.939
STOP IT, FOOLS!

00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:16.380
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ALL THIS BICKERING!

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.051
CHOOSE A BODY
AND STICK WITH IT!

00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.153
THEN LET ME GO FIRST!

00:18:20.153 --> 00:18:22.524
ENOUGH! CALM YOURSELF!

00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:26.632
WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY
IF WE WANT TO ESCAPE
INTO THE REAL WORLD!

00:18:26.632 --> 00:18:28.036
WHAT'S THAT!

00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:30.774
Noah: ATTENTION FOOLS!

00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:32.244
THIS GAME IS OVER!

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:36.084
MASTER NOAH!! IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

00:18:36.084 --> 00:18:37.287
REALLY?

00:18:37.287 --> 00:18:39.257
SO YOU'RE NOT
BREAKING MY RULES?

00:18:39.257 --> 00:18:41.996
WHAT KIND OF FOOL
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR!?

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.233
PLEASE! I CAN EXPLAIN NOAH!

00:18:44.233 --> 00:18:46.839
I GAVE YOU ALL THE CHANCE
TO WIN YOUR FREEDOM

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:48.275
AND YOU ALL FAILED!

00:18:48.275 --> 00:18:50.112
NOW YOU'LL PAY THE PRICE!

00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:53.385
[SHOUTING, GRUNTING]

00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:00.666
GENTLEMEN,
YOU'RE ALL DISMISSED.

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:04.340
NO ONE DISOBEYS MY RULES
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.542
OH MAN!

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:07.646
HEY, YOU ALRIGHT
THERE, DUKE!?

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.184
YEAH I'VE NEVER
BEEN BETTER.

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:12.288
Tea: HEY GUYS!

00:19:12.288 --> 00:19:15.294
Yugi: WE FOUND YOU!
IS EVERYONE ALRIGHT!?

00:19:15.294 --> 00:19:17.732
WE'RE ALL FINE!

00:19:17.732 --> 00:19:20.471
AWESOME!
THAT'S THE BEST NEWS
I'VE HEARD ALL DAY!!

00:19:20.471 --> 00:19:23.511
DOSE WIMPS
NEVER STOOD A CHANCE!

00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:25.548
I GUESS THE ACTION
NEVER STOPS!

00:19:25.548 --> 00:19:27.519
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN!

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:30.825
THIS JUST DOESN'T ADD UP!

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:32.495
Yugi: KAIBA?

00:19:32.495 --> 00:19:34.131
COULD NOAH'S STORY
ABOUT YOU BEING

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:37.137
HIS LONG LOST STEP-BROTHER
ACTUALLY BE TRUE?

00:19:37.137 --> 00:19:39.933
NOAH'S STORY IS NOTHING
BUT ONE BIG LIE

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.535
DESIGNED TO MESS
WITH MY HEAD YUGI!

00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:45.505
THE SUPPOSED
CONVERSATION HE HAD
WITH GOZABURO

00:19:45.505 --> 00:19:48.041
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
OVER SIX YEARS AGO.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:53.580
WHICH IS WHEN THIS
WAS TAKEN BASED ON
THE IMPRINTED DATE.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.181
BUT LOOK CLOSELY.

00:19:55.181 --> 00:19:59.652
NOAH LOOKS THE SAME
AS HE DOES NOW!

00:19:59.652 --> 00:20:02.222
Tea: HE HASN'T AGED
IN SIX YEARS!
