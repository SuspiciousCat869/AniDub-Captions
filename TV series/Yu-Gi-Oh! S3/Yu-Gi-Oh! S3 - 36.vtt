00:08:33.463 --> 00:08:36.600
NOW IT'S TIME TO BURY
THE PAST AND MOVE ON!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.936
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT
WE DUELED 5000 YEARS AGO,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.239
BE MY GUEST!

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:43.740
BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.877
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME
THAT IT'S TRUE!

00:08:46.877 --> 00:08:48.645
I BELIEVE IN
ONLY ONE THING

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:51.815
AND THAT'S MY SUPREME
DUELING SKILLS YUGI!

00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:54.184
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS MEANINGLESS!

00:08:54.184 --> 00:08:56.119
NOW THEN...

00:08:56.119 --> 00:09:00.624
LET'S GET ON WITH THIS DUEL
SO I CAN FINALLY RECLAIM
WHAT I RIGHTFULLY DESERVE!

00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:03.860
THE TITLE THAT YOU STOLE
FROM ME, YUGI!

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.898
I WILL BE KNOWN AS
THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DUELIST!

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:12.202
I'M AFRAID
THAT THIS IS
THE FINAL TURN.

00:09:12.202 --> 00:09:13.970
IT'S OVER!

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.573
I SWITCH LORD OF DRAGONS
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:21.978
THEN I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD,

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.415
THE FLUTE OF
SUMMONING DRAGON!

00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:27.718
Yami-Yugi: THIS CAN MEAN
ONLY ONE THING!

00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.787
I TAKE IT YOUR FAMILIAR
WITH MY STRATEGY!

00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:33.790
AS SOON AS MY LORD OF DRAGONS
PLAYS THIS FLUTE

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.126
TWO MORE DRAGONS WILL BE
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD!

00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:38.195
YOU'RE PLANNING TO
CALL FORTH

00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:41.098
TWO MORE BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGONS
AREN'T YOU!?

00:09:41.098 --> 00:09:45.635
THAT'S PRECISELY
WHAT I'M DOING YUGI!

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.237
[GROWLS]

00:09:57.114 --> 00:09:59.583
HOW CAN I FIGHT OFF
THREE BLUE-EYES!?

00:10:03.954 --> 00:10:06.957
NOW I SUMMON
STEEL OGRE GROTTO!

00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:10.961
AND I'LL PLACE HIM
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:13.864
DAT TIN CAN HAS
1400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:16.366
DATS ENOUGH TO TEAR
MY TIGER AXE
TA SHREDS!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.802
COME ON!
DIS IS MY DREAM!

00:10:18.802 --> 00:10:22.305
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT...

00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:25.242
BUT YOU BETTER WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE DUEL, WHEELER!

00:10:25.242 --> 00:10:28.111
'CAUSE THE WORST
IS ABOUT TO COME!

00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:30.480
IT'S CALLED POLYMERIZATION!

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.816
AND I'M USING IT
TO FUSE MY OGRE GROTTO

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.951
AND MY LESSER DRAGON
TOGETHER!

00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:38.255
TO FORM...
METAL DRAGON!

00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:41.191
NOW MY METAL DRAGON,
DESTROY HIS TIGER!

00:10:45.162 --> 00:10:49.366
LOOK KID!
DIS DUEL'S NOT DONE!

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:50.734
BY THE WAY YOU'RE PLAYING

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.436
I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS DUEL EVEN STARTED!

00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:53.737
REAL FUNNY!

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.672
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
EAT DOSE WORDS!

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:57.307
SO WATCH DA MASTER!

00:10:57.307 --> 00:10:59.810
FLAME SWORDSMAN!?

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.146
HE ONLY HAS
1800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:04.881
NORMALLY DAT
WOULDN'T BE SO BAD,

00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:08.218
BUT DIS KID'S
METAL DRAGON
HAS 1850!

00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:10.220
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PLAY IT SAFE

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.922
AND PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS!

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:14.224
NOW I SUMMON
HERO OF THE EAST

00:11:14.224 --> 00:11:15.992
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:17.561
I HOPE DAT HELPS!

00:11:22.126 --> 00:11:24.128
Man: THIS IS
RESCUE COPTER ONE...

00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:25.596
WE'RE APPROACHING
KAIBA CORP ISLAND...OVER.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.509
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE FOUR MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD NOW.

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:39.777
AND YOU...

00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:41.679
ALL YOU'VE GOT IS
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:44.215
AND YOU PATHETIC
MAGNET WARRIOR, YUGI!

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:47.018
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS...

00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:50.355
I CAN ANNIHILATE THEM
AND WIPE OUT YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.959
YUGI! JUST GIVE UP NOW!

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:57.228
Yugi: OH NO!
I'M OUT OF OPTIONS!

00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:04.135
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
GOING ON UP THERE, GUYS?

00:12:04.135 --> 00:12:05.636
LET'S HOPE
THAT YUGI'S WINNING

00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:08.740
SO THIS WHOLE NIGHTMARE
CAN END ALREADY!

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.043
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE GUYS!

00:12:12.043 --> 00:12:15.313
ISN'T THAT RIGHT JOEY?

00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:16.547
OKAY!

00:12:16.547 --> 00:12:18.349
NOW I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD...

00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:20.218
STOP DEFENSE!

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:21.719
Joey: WHAT!?

00:12:21.719 --> 00:12:23.688
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID
WHEELER!

00:12:23.688 --> 00:12:25.857
I'M USING
MY STOP DEFENSE
MAGIC CARD

00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:27.792
TO SWITCH YOUR
HERO OF THE EAST

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.961
FROM DEFENSE
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:33.231
NOW METAL DRAGON
ATTACK AND DESTROY
HIS MONSTER!

00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:39.370
NO, NOT AGAIN!

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.474
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS KID IS DUELING
CIRCLES AROUND ME!

00:12:43.474 --> 00:12:46.010
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
ON THE FIELD.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.412
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW!

00:12:47.412 --> 00:12:49.981
AND REMEMBER YOU ONLY HAVE
300 LIFE POINTS

00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:51.749
SO NEXT TURN YOU'RE A GONER!

00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:54.952
OH YEAH!? I GOT A PLAN,
DON'CHU WORRY!

00:12:54.952 --> 00:12:56.521
SHIELD AND SWORD.

00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:59.223
I WISH I REALLY DID
HAVE A PLAN!

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:01.626
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WIT A MAGIC CARD

00:13:01.626 --> 00:13:03.461
DAT SWITCHES THE ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.396
OF EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD?

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:06.697
LET'S SEE.

00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:08.566
DAT METAL DRAGON 'A HIS

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.068
HAS 1700 DEFENSE POINTS,

00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:12.970
SO IF I USE MY SHIELD
AND SWORD MAGIC CARD,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.907
HIS DRAGON'S ATTACK
POINTS BECOME 1700.

00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:17.742
DAT MEANS ALL I GOTTA DO

00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:20.111
IS PLAY A MONSTER WITH
HIGHER DEFENSE POINTS

00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:21.579
THAN HIS METAL DRAGON!

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:23.047
DA PROBLEM IS...

00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:24.382
I DON'T HAVE ONE!

00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:26.617
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT YOU PLAY...

00:13:26.617 --> 00:13:28.619
DON'T YOU KNOW
IT'S WAY TOO LATE

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:31.889
FOR YOU TO TURN THIS DUEL
AROUND WHEELER!?

00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:33.958
WHAT WOULD YUGI DO
RIGHT NOW?

00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.260
Yugi: REMEMBER...
ALWAYS LOOK CLOSELY

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.563
AND CONSIDER
ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS!

00:13:38.563 --> 00:13:40.665
WAIT! DAT'S IT!

00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:43.301
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
USE THAT MAGIC CARD

00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:45.236
ON HIS METAL DRAGON
FIRST!

00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:46.471
AND IF ALL GOES WELL

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.173
I SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SEND IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:49.173 --> 00:13:50.475
HERE GOES...

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.743
FIRST I'LL SUMMON
A GOOD BUDDY 'A MINE

00:13:52.743 --> 00:13:56.180
KNOWN AS
FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.782
WAIT...

00:13:57.782 --> 00:14:00.318
YOUR METAL DRAGON
IS A WIND ATTRIBUTE
MONSTER ISN'T IT?

00:14:00.318 --> 00:14:01.719
YEAH...

00:14:01.719 --> 00:14:03.521
THEN I CAN USE THIS!

00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:07.525
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY GUST FAN
MAGIC CARD!!

00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:10.194
IT RAISES
YOUR MONSTA'S
ATTACK POINTS,

00:14:10.194 --> 00:14:12.563
BUT LOWERS
ITS DEFENSE
POINTS!

00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:14.132
THAT WAS POINTLESS!

00:14:14.132 --> 00:14:16.300
WHY WOULD YOU WASTE
YOUR MAGIC CARD

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.636
JUST TO MAKE MY MONSTER
EVEN STRONGER!

00:14:18.636 --> 00:14:20.138
THE PRESSURE'S
GETTING TO YOU!

00:14:20.138 --> 00:14:23.474
HERE I AM
ABOUT TO END THIS DUEL
IN ONE MORE TURN...

00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:25.143
AND INSTEAD OF
HELPING YOURSELF

00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:27.311
YOU MAKE IT EVEN EASIER
FOR ME TO WIN!

00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:28.980

[GASP]

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:40.458
NOW YA GET
WHY I LOWERED

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:41.959
YOUR MONSTA'S
DEFENSE POINTS!?

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.628
WELL, ALLOW ME
TO EXPLAIN IT...

00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:45.630
MY SHIELD AND SWORD
MAGIC CARD

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.565
SWITCHES THE ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:14:47.565 --> 00:14:49.066
OF EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:51.736
THAT MEANS YOUR MONSTER'S
STRONGER NOW!

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:53.237
NOW YOU'RE CATCHIN' ON,
SHORTY!

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:55.673
FLAME SWORDSMAN,

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:13.624
LOOKS LIKE I'M ONE STEP
AHEAD OF YOU!

00:15:13.624 --> 00:15:15.860
I SPRUNG MY CARD
BEFORE YOU SPRUNG YOURS!

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.461
WAIT YOU DID WHAT!?

00:15:17.461 --> 00:15:19.830
I ADDED 500 DEFENSE POINTS
TO MY DRAGON

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.899
WHICH, THANKS TO
YOUR MAGIC CARD,

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:23.968
INCREASED IT'S
ATTACK POINTS INSTEAD.

00:15:23.968 --> 00:15:27.171
I GET IT, BECAUSE OF ME
YOUR METAL DRAGON

00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.640
WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER
MY FLAME SWORDSMAN.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.777
BINGO, AND I HAVE A FEELING YOU
KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS,

00:15:32.777 --> 00:15:33.978
DON'T YOU WHEELER?

00:15:33.978 --> 00:15:36.447
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS WERE 1600

00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:40.418
AND MY MONSTER'S ATTACK
POINTS WERE RAISED TO 2000

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:43.788
UGH, THAT MEANS I LOSE
400 LIFE POINTS NOW.

00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:45.556
I'M FINISHED.

00:15:45.556 --> 00:15:46.757
[SIGHING]

00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:48.159
THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:49.794

00:15:49.794 --> 00:15:51.095

00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:25.830
MAYBE I'LL USE IT
IN THE FINALS.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.298
THANK YOU.

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:32.069
THIS IS WHERE IT
ALL ENDS, YUGI.

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:34.138
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN ESCAPE
THE DEVASTATION

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:35.606
OF MY THREE BLUE EYES.

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.909
THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR IS FINALLY HERE.

00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:41.779
[LAUGHING]

00:16:42.813 --> 00:16:44.448
YUGI: I'M IN MAJOR TROUBLE!

00:16:44.448 --> 00:16:47.385
WITH THREE BLUE EYES WHITE
DRAGONS, KAIBA CAN EASILY

00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:50.655
WIPE OUT BOTH OF MY MONSTERS
AND THE REST OF MY LIFE POINTS,

00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:52.623
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:16:52.623 --> 00:16:56.627
IT LOOKS LIKE THE END
OF THE LINE FOR THE PHARAOH

00:16:56.627 --> 00:17:00.031
WHICH MEANS SETO KAIBA WILL BE
THE NEXT CASUALTY

00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:01.799
OF THE SHADOW REALM.

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:04.635
NOW MY THREE BLUE EYES ATTACK!

00:17:04.635 --> 00:17:07.138
FINISH HIM OFF
AND END THIS DUEL.

00:17:08.139 --> 00:17:09.540
HUH? NO!

00:17:15.438 --> 00:17:18.842
ONCE MY DRAGONS ATTACK
THIS DUEL IS OVER YUGI.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.177
[YUGI GRUNTS]

00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:22.345
Joey: HOLD ON YUG'.

00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:23.346
JOEY?

00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:25.849
YEP, THE ONE AND ONLY PAL.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:28.051
I'M ABOUT TO
LOSE THIS DUEL.

00:17:28.051 --> 00:17:30.887
GUESS AGAIN YUG',
IT'S LIKE YOU ALWAYS TELL ME,

00:17:30.887 --> 00:17:33.423
LOOK CLOSELY AND CONSIDER
ALL YOUR OPTIONS.

00:17:33.423 --> 00:17:34.858
ALL OF MY OPTIONS?

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:37.994
YUP, I THINK YOU'LL FIND
A CARD THAT CAN SAVE YOU.

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:40.530
LET'S SEE...

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.967
HE'S RIGHT,
THERE'S STILL HOPE!

00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:45.769
NICE TRY YUGI,

00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:48.004
BUT YOU'RE NO LONGER
THE TOP RANKED DUELIST

00:17:48.004 --> 00:17:49.773
WHAT?!

00:17:49.773 --> 00:17:52.709
IT'S RED EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:54.377
WHERE DID
THAT COME FROM?!

00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:57.747
IF YOU RECALL, YOU USED YOUR
FLUTE OF SUMMONING DRAGON

00:17:57.747 --> 00:18:00.050
TO SUMMON YOUR BLUE EYES
TO THE FIELD.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.217
BUT YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:18:01.217 --> 00:18:03.953
THAT YOUR FLUTE WORKS
ON MY HAND AS WELL.

00:18:05.455 --> 00:18:09.459
SO I OWE YOU A THANK YOU,
FOR BRINGING OUT THIS CARD.

00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:12.829
WHICH IS A GIFT FROM A VERY
CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, KAIBA.

00:18:18.535 --> 00:18:20.670
THIS DOESN'T
CHANGE A THING YUGI,

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.339
I CAN DESTROY YOU
AND YOUR RED EYES.

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:27.110
KAIBA, DON'T BE SO SURE
OF THAT YOU FOOL.

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:31.314
NOW, MY BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGONS
WILL DESTROY

00:18:31.314 --> 00:18:34.184
ALL THREE OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:36.086
ATTACK NOW!

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:38.488
ANNIHILATE HIS
DARK MAGICIAN FIRST.

00:18:41.758 --> 00:18:44.761
SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR
FAVORITE MONSTER.

00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:47.363
NOT SO FAST, KAIBA!
ACTIVATE TRAP.

00:18:48.965 --> 00:18:51.134
MAGICIAN SELECTION...

00:18:51.134 --> 00:18:53.870
THAT PROTECTS YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN FROM MY ATTACK,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.906
WHICH MEANS YOU AND YOUR
MONSTER WILL ESCAPE UNHARMED.

00:18:56.906 --> 00:18:58.842
THAT'S RIGHT, KAIBA.

00:18:58.842 --> 00:19:01.211
BUT MY TRAP ALSO SENDS YOUR
WEAKEST MONSTER

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:03.046
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:19:05.915 --> 00:19:08.751
FINE BUT YOU'LL NEVER
ESCAPE MY OTHER TWO ATTACKS.

00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:16.126
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR IS GONE
AND YOUR RED EYES IS NEXT.

00:19:16.126 --> 00:19:18.428
SO MUCH FOR WHEELER'S GIFT.

00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:20.630
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK, KAIBA.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.765
REVEAL FACE DOWN CARD.

00:19:25.335 --> 00:19:27.237
MY SPELL BINDING CIRCLE CARD

00:19:27.237 --> 00:19:29.439
PUTS AN END TO
YOUR BLUE EYES ATTACK.

00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:31.741
AND LOWERS IT'S
STRENGTH BY 700.

00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:35.178
NICE TRY, KAIBA.

00:19:35.178 --> 00:19:38.715
TIME FOR RED EYES
TO FIGHT BACK.

00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:41.151
DESTROY HIS
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON...

00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:43.653
WITH INFERNO FIRE BLAST.

00:19:48.992 --> 00:19:51.094
UGH!

00:19:51.094 --> 00:19:53.763
ALL RIGHT, YOU MAY HAVE
SAVED YOURSELF FOR NOW,

00:19:53.763 --> 00:19:55.899
BUT THIS DUEL'S
FAR FROM DONE.

00:19:58.168 --> 00:20:00.637
Yugi: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE I MADE
IT OUT OF THAT MESS

00:20:00.637 --> 00:20:03.139
AND I OWE IT
ALL TO YOU JOEY

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:06.643
Joey: ALL I DID WAS REMIND YOU
OF THE ADVICE THAT YOU GAVE ME.

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:08.711
NOW, WIN THIS FIGHT PAL.

00:20:08.711 --> 00:20:10.380
Yugi: YOU TOO, JOEY!

00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:13.183
[GROANING]

00:20:13.183 --> 00:20:15.618
HEY GUYS, LOOK!

00:20:15.618 --> 00:20:17.253
HE'S WAKING UP.

00:20:18.254 --> 00:20:19.789
Serenity: ARE YOU OKAY, JOEY?

00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:29.199
I MUST ADMIT, YUGI'S
MOVE TOOK ME BY SURPRISE

00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:31.901
BUT IF HE THINKS THIS IS
THE TIME TO CELEBRATE,

00:20:31.901 --> 00:20:35.438
HE'S SADLY MISTAKEN,
VICTORY WILL BE MINE.

00:20:35.438 --> 00:20:37.340
Yugi: I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.876
BUT AS LONG AS I HAVE FAITH IN
THE HEART OF THE CARDS

00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:43.012
AND IN MY FRIENDS,
I KNOW I CAN WIN THIS.

00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:47.650
Serenity: JOEY, SAY SOMETHING.
