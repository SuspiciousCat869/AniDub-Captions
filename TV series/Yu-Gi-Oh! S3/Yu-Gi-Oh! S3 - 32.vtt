YUGI'S WASTING HIS TIME
IN THE MEDICAL WARD.

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.013
BUT EVEN HIS
PATHETIC FRIENDS

00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:27.815

AWAY FROM OUR DUEL.

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.287

OF DANGER NOW!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.735
MORE THAN
YOU COULD EVER KNOW.

00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.405
WHEELER SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:26.707
I WARNED HIM
NOT TO PLAY WITH
THE BIG BOYS

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:29.610
AND IF YOU ASK ME
HE GOT JUST WHAT
HE DESERVED...

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.179
A SLAP IN THE FACE BY RA!

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.682
AND IF GETTING ATTACKED
BY AN EGYPTIAN GOD CARD

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:37.551

INTO THAT KID...

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.119
THEN NOTHING WILL!

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.021
THAT'S ENOUGH, KAIBA!

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.090
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DANGEROUS

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.693
THIS DUEL MONSTERS
TOURNAMENT OF YOURS

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:47.661
THE OUTCOME OF
THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:49.697
COULD PUT
THE WHOLE WORLD AT RISK!

00:02:49.697 --> 00:02:51.832
THE ONLY ONE AT RISK IS YOU!

00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:54.635
FOR ONCE I WIN...
YOU WON'T BE NUMBER ONE!

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:55.836
KAIBA!

00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:58.572
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT
BEING NUMBER ONE!

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:01.709
IT'S ABOUT DUELING
WITH BRAVERY, HONOR
AND RESPECT!

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.077
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:05.679
PUTTING THE NEEDS
OF OTHERS AHEAD OF
YOUR OWN!

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.282
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
JOEY WHEELER DID

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:10.417
EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE.

00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:12.319
THE REASON HE'S IN
THAT HOSPITAL BED

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.822
IS BECAUSE HE PUT
HIMSELF IN HARMS WAY

00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:17.291
JUST TO KEEP A PROMISE
TO A FRIEND!

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.692
PATHETIC.

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:21.662
LISTEN. WHEELER CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS!

00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:24.164
BUT I'M IN THIS THING
FOR ONE REASON ONLY!

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:25.899
AND THAT'S TO WIN
THE TOURNAMENT

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.169
AND BE RECOGNIZED AS
THE GREATEST DUELIST
IN THE WORLD!

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.672
SO WHY DON'T YOU SAVE
YOUR GIRL SCOUT SPEECH

00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:34.174
FOR SOMEONE
WHO ACTUALLY CARES!

00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:36.076
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:42.549
WHEELER NEVER
REALLY BELONGED HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.951
COME ON JOEY!

00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:45.319

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.121
I KNOW YOU CAN GET
THROUGH THIS!

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:49.656
HUH? CHECK IT OUT!

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.358

A REFLEX.

OUT OF IT.

WHEN DID THIS TOURNAMENT
GET SO OUT OF CONTROL?

00:04:06.673 --> 00:04:09.676
THE REASON I JOINED
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:11.678
WAS TO FULFILL
ISHIZU'S PROPHESY

00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:15.949
AND STOP THIS GREAT EVIL
FROM ENDANGERING MANKIND.

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.185
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:19.686
WHY SHOULD MY FRIENDS
HAVE TO SUFFER

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:22.689
JUST 'CAUSE SOME EVIL NUTCASE
CAN'T CONTROL HIS TEMPER!?

00:08:17.352 --> 00:08:20.222
CHOOSE THE MAGIC CARD
THAT I WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO LET YOU HAVE

00:08:20.222 --> 00:08:22.091
SO I CAN MOVE ON!

00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:23.425
Yugi: THAT WAS WEIRD.

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:25.394
WHY WOULD KAIBA WANT ME
TO HAVE INSTANT ACCESS

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:27.663
TO MY FAVORITE
MAGIC CARD?

00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:29.631
WHICHEVER CARD HE CHOSE

00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.233
MUST HAVE BEEN WORTH
THE RISK!

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:33.435
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:35.337
AND END MY TURN.

00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:36.772
BEFORE LONG,

00:08:36.772 --> 00:08:40.242
YUGI WILL BE STARING INTO
THE FACE OF DEFEAT!

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:42.111
Tristan:
YO, MOKUBA.

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:43.612
WHAT'S UP WITH
THE RESCUE TEAM?

00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:45.114
I CAN'T GET THROUGH!

00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:47.616
SOMETHING'S INTERFERING
WITH OUR COMMUNICATIONS.

00:08:47.616 --> 00:08:49.618
WE NEED THAT
HELICOPTER NOW!

00:08:49.618 --> 00:08:53.088
MAYDAY! THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY! ANYONE!

00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:55.557
WE NEED MEDICAL HELP NOW!

00:08:55.557 --> 00:09:01.029
JOEY, I KNOW
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:03.031
PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP!

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.000
KEEP FIGHTING BIG BROTHER!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.102
HUH? WHO SAID DAT!?

00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:09.371
AND WHERE EXACTLY
AM I ANYWAY?

00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:10.606
HUH?

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:13.041
IT'S MY DUELING DECK!

00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.077
RIGHT! DAT'S IT!

00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:21.917
I'M DREAMIN' ABOUT KICKIN' BUTT
AT DUEL MONSTAS!

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:28.690
POOR JOEY!

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.225
HMM!

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.528
IT WON'T BE LONG...

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:34.730
BEFORE I CONTROL THE WORLD!

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:40.002
AND THE PHARAOH
BOWS DOWN BEFORE ME!

00:09:40.002 --> 00:09:42.804
Crowd: KAIBA! KAIBA! KAIBA!

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:45.507
SOON I'LL GIVE
MY ADORING PUBLIC

00:09:45.507 --> 00:09:48.510
SOMETHING TO REALLY
CHEER ABOUT.

00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:53.043
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:54.478
NOW KAIBA...

00:09:54.478 --> 00:09:56.947
MY MOVE!

00:09:56.947 --> 00:09:59.049
Yugi:
KAIBA'S X-HEAD CANNON

00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:01.051
IS STRONGER THAN
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT.

00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.688
SO WHY DIDN'T HE ATTACK ME
WHEN HE HAD THE CHANCE?

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.690
HE MUST BE UP TO SOMETHING.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.827
Yami-Yugi: I SUMMON
ALPHA THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:14.298
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:17.201
AND THEN I'LL PLAY
ONE MORE CARD-FACEDOWN!

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:19.269
YOUR MOVE, KAIBA!

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:23.207
HMM. IF YUGI THINKS
HE CAN HIDE BEHIND THOSE
PATHETIC MONSTERS OF HIS,

00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:26.577
THIS DUEL WILL BE OVER
EVEN SOONER THAN I THOUGHT!

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:29.013
NOW, OBSERVE!

00:10:29.013 --> 00:10:30.547
EXCELLENT!

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.118
EVERYTHING IS FALLING
RIGHT INTO PLACE!

00:10:34.118 --> 00:10:35.285
FIRST OFF,

00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:37.421
I'LL ACTIVATE THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:39.123
SOUL EXCHANGE!

00:10:39.123 --> 00:10:40.958
THAT'S WHY
YOU SPARED MY QUEEN!!

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.663
VERY PERCEPTIVE!

00:10:45.663 --> 00:10:48.298
THANKS TO MY SOUL EXCHANGE
MAGIC CARD

00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:51.435
BOTH OF YOUR MONSTERS
NOW BELONG TO ME, YUGI!

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:54.838
SO COME FORTH MY MONSTERS!

00:10:54.838 --> 00:10:57.908
NOW I CAN SACRIFICE THEM
ALONG WITH MY MONSTER

00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.677
TO SUMMON MY GREAT BEAST!

00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:01.545
I'M AFRAID NOT, KAIBA!

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:03.647
REVEAL MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:05.015
CHANGE OF HEART!

00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:06.250
NO!

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.752
YES, I'M AFRAID SO
KAIBA!

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.689
THANKS TO
MY CHANGE OF HEART
MAGIC CARD'S EFFECT

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:18.796
YOU NO LONGER HAVE THREE
MONSTERS TO SACRIFICE!

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:20.531
NOW YOUR X-HEAD CANNON

00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:22.800
BELONGS TO ME
FOR ONE TURN!!

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.136
KAIBA! YOU WON'T SUMMON
OBELISK THAT EASILY!

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:27.871
NOW GO!

00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:30.140
HA! SO YOU PREVENTED
ONE MOVE.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.809
I'VE GOT PLENTY MORE PLANNED.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:33.110
LIKE THIS ONE!!

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.646
REVEAL FACEDOWN CARD!

00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:42.519
FOR THE PRICE OF
1000 LIFE POINTS,

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.421
THIS CONTROL PAD LETS ME
TO TAKE COMMAND

00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:46.356
OF ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:48.726
ENEMY CONTROLLER...
ACTIVATE!

00:11:48.726 --> 00:11:54.164
LEFT! RIGHT! A! B!

00:11:54.164 --> 00:11:56.300
AND NOW BRING
MY X-HEAD CANNON

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.302
BACK TO MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:03.040
SO I HAVE THREE MONSTERS
TO SACRIFICE ONCE AGAIN!

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.177
MY STRATEGY
WAS FOOLPROOF!

00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:08.312
[GASP]

00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:09.980
I SACRIFICE ALPHA,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.315
QUEEN'S KNIGHT

00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:12.983
AND X-HEAD CANNON!

00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:14.017
AND NOW!

00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:16.286
[GRUNTS]

00:12:16.286 --> 00:12:18.689
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR, COME...

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:20.457
HOLD ON KAIBA!

00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:24.962
GO LIGHTFORCE SWORD!

00:12:24.962 --> 00:12:26.463
OH NO!

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:27.865
OH YES!

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:29.933
NOW YOUR OBELISK
THE TORMENTOR

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:32.402
IS COMPLETELY
USELESS TO YOU FOR
THREE TURNS, KAIBA!

00:12:32.402 --> 00:12:34.571
THANKS TO MY
LIGHTFORCE SWORD!

00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:35.873
WHAT'S YOUR RUSH?

00:12:35.873 --> 00:12:38.609
THIS DUEL'S JUST GETTING
INTERESTING, KAIBA.

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:40.711
WHY TRY TO END IT
SO SOON?

00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:43.714
YOU MAY HAVE BOUGHT YOURSELF
A LITTLE TIME...

00:12:43.714 --> 00:12:49.887
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO FACE DOWN
OBELISK SOONER OR LATER!

00:12:49.887 --> 00:12:51.789
Duke: WHERE'S
TRISTAN ALREADY!?

00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:54.057
THAT HELICOPTER BETTER BE
ON ITS WAY!

00:12:54.057 --> 00:12:55.425
JOEY NEEDS HELP NOW!

00:12:55.425 --> 00:13:00.764
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:00.764 --> 00:13:03.700
THE EVIL INSIDE MARIK
MUST BE DEFEATED

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.372
IN ORDER TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE
THAT'S BEEN DONE.

00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.340
BUT WILL THE WINNER
OF TODAY'S DUEL

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:16.880
BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP HIM!?

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.950
YOUR SOUL EXCHANGE CARD
IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT!

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.853
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO
SACRIFICE MY MONSTERS!

00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:25.289
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
CONTROL THEM ANYMORE!

00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:29.960
AND OBELISK
WILL HAVE TO WAIT!

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.463
HUH! I WON'T BE WAITING
AS LONG AS HE THINKS!

00:13:33.463 --> 00:13:35.032
IN JUST THREE TURNS

00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:37.201
YUGI'S LIGHTFORCE SWORD
WEARS OFF

00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:40.204
AND OBELISK RETURNS
TO MY HAND.

00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:43.140
AND BY THEN, I'LL HAVE
ANOTHER WAY TO SUMMON IT!

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.309
MY TURN MAY BE OVER NOW.

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:47.444
BUT YOU'RE NOT SAFE YET!

00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:51.448
ALRIGHT! MY MOVE!

00:13:51.448 --> 00:13:54.318
Yugi: SO FAR
I HAVE TWO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:56.353
ONE MORE AND I'LL HAVE
ENOUGH SACRIFICES

00:13:56.353 --> 00:14:00.290
TO SUMMON
MY EGYPTIAN GOD CARD,
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.194
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO
DRAW SLIFER FROM
SOMEWHERE IN MY DECK!

00:14:04.194 --> 00:14:08.031
ANYWAY, FOR NOW
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH
KAIBA'S X-HEAD CANNON.

00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:10.033
NEITHER OF THE MONSTERS
I HAVE ON THE FIELD

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.635
ARE STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE IT DOWN

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:13.203
AND NOTHING IN MY HAND

00:14:13.203 --> 00:14:15.372
HAS THAT KIND OF POWER,
EITHER.

00:14:15.372 --> 00:14:17.808
SO I'LL JUST
HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

00:14:17.808 --> 00:14:21.078
Yami-Yugi: NOW I PLAY
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:23.814
THEN I'LL LEAVE
BOTH OF MY MONSTERS
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:25.449
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:30.520
HMM. I EXPECTED MORE
OF A CHALLENGE FROM
THE TOP-RANKED DUELIST.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.688
[GRUNTS]

00:14:31.688 --> 00:14:33.857
IF HE KEEPS
PLAYING IT SAFE,

00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:36.793
MY OBELISK WILL
WIPE HIM OUT IN NO TIME.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.161
HA HA HA HA!

00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:40.831
MY... MOVE!

00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:42.866
[YAMI-MARIK LAUGHING]

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:45.569
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:47.838
THIS DUEL SHOULD BE AMUSING.

00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:50.140
I WONDER
WHICH OF THESE FOOLS

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.143
WILL SUMMON
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD FIRST?

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.812
NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS,
OF COURSE.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.583
HA! BEFORE LONG
THEY'LL BOTH BELONG TO ME!

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:01.785
FOR WHOEVER WINS THIS BATTLE...

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.520
WILL BE CONFRONTING ME

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.456
IN THE MOST TREACHEROUS
SHADOW GAME EVER PLAYED!

00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:08.458
AND THEN, WHEN THE SHADOWS

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:09.960
ENGULF MY OPPONENT

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.095
I SHALL REIGN SUPREME!!

00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:15.098
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:19.330

READY YUGI!?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.731
I PLAY THIS!

00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:23.534

NOTICE ANYTHING SIMILAR

00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:29.106
ABOUT MY TWO MONSTERS?

00:15:29.106 --> 00:15:30.875
THINK ABOUT IT, YUGI.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.543
THIS ISN'T A TOUGH QUESTION.

00:15:32.543 --> 00:15:34.745
ONE IS X-HEAD CANNON

00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:37.014
AND THE OTHER IS
Y-DRAGON HEAD?

00:15:37.014 --> 00:15:38.582
Yami-Yugi: HOLD ON!

00:15:38.582 --> 00:15:41.018
ARE THESE TWO MONSTERS
ABLE TO COMBINE
TOGETHER!?

00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:42.419
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.489
ANY TWO OF
THE X, Y, Z MONSTERS
CAN MERGE TOGETHER

00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:47.958
TO FORM A NEW
MORE POWERFUL BEAST!

00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:54.632

00:15:54.632 --> 00:15:58.135
BEHOLD XY-DRAGON CANNON!

00:15:58.135 --> 00:15:59.203
OH!

00:15:59.203 --> 00:16:01.572
ONCE I SUMMON
MY Z MONSTER,

00:16:01.572 --> 00:16:03.641
MY DRAGON CANNON
WILL GET EVEN STRONGER!

00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.142

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:07.778
IF KAIBA MERGES
HIS Z-MONSTER
WITH THE OTHERS,

00:16:07.778 --> 00:16:09.246
THAT DRAGON WILL BE
UNSTOPPABLE!

00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:11.916
SO, I'LL HAVE TO
KEEP MY MONSTERS

00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:13.584
IN DEFENSE MODE
FOR NOW.

00:16:13.584 --> 00:16:15.753
BUT ONCE OBELISK
IS SET FREE...

00:16:15.753 --> 00:16:17.755
KAIBA CAN SACRIFICE
HIS THREE-HEADED BEAST

00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:20.124
TO SUMMON
HIS EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:22.826
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO STOP HIM!!

00:16:22.826 --> 00:16:25.963
AND I'VE ONLY GOT
TWO MORE TURNS
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT!

00:16:25.963 --> 00:16:28.532
NOW MY XY-DRAGON CANNON...

00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:35.940
ATTACK HIS MAGNET WARRIOR!!

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.511
YUGI, SAY GOODBYE!

00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:43.948
UHH!

00:16:43.948 --> 00:16:46.016
SINCE MY MONSTERS
ARE IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:48.419
MY LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE FOR NOW.

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:50.788
BUT IF HE WIPES
THEM OUT WITH
HIS X-Y DRAGON

00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:52.423
I'LL BE WIDE OPEN!

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:55.759
AND HIS OBELISK
CAN CRUSH ME
WITH ONE STRIKE!

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:56.927
HA HA HA!

00:16:56.927 --> 00:16:58.696
YOU LOOK SO WORRIED.

00:16:58.696 --> 00:17:02.266
AFRAID OF LOSING
IN SHAME ARE WE?

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:04.868
ONCE A DUELIST STARTS
THINKING ABOUT DEFEAT

00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:06.136
THEY'VE ALREADY LOST.

00:17:06.136 --> 00:17:07.204
Yami-Yugi: ENOUGH!

00:17:07.204 --> 00:17:08.606
PERHAPS IT'S TIME

00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:11.508
YOU SURRENDERED YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD TO ME!!

00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:12.643
[GASP]

00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:14.278
INTERESTING...

00:17:14.278 --> 00:17:16.580
KAIBA SEEMS TO BE
IN CONTROL.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.083
I'LL ENJOY SEEING
THE PHARAOH SQUIRM.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:21.185
NOW I ACTIVATE...

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:22.586
LULLABY OF OBEDIENCE!

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:23.654

THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME TO TAKE

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.658
A HIGH POWER MONSTER
FROM YOUR DECK

00:17:27.658 --> 00:17:29.360
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND!

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.761
AND I HAVE A FEELING

00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:34.064
YOU KNOW WHICH MONSTER
I HAVE MY EYE ON, YUGI!

00:17:34.064 --> 00:17:36.166
IT'S YOUR
EGYPTIAN GOD CARD!

00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:38.268
SLIFER THE SKY DRAGON!

00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.871
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME YUGI.

00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:42.673
BEFORE YOUR MOST
POWERFUL CARD

00:17:42.673 --> 00:17:44.842
WENT TO A MUCH MORE
WORTHY DUELIST.

00:17:44.842 --> 00:17:47.711
[GRUNTS]

00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:51.548
Crowd: KAIBA! KAIBA!
KAIBA! KAIBA!

00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:54.551

00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:57.087
THIS CARD
WILL RETURN TO ME.

00:17:57.087 --> 00:18:01.659
I DOUBT IT.

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:04.595
I WOULDN'T FEEL SO BAD
IF I WERE YOU.

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:06.764
SLIFER WAS BURIED
SO DEEP IN YOUR DECK

00:18:06.764 --> 00:18:08.432
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
DRAWN IT ANYWAY.

00:18:08.432 --> 00:18:10.434
HA HA HA HA!

00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:14.338
HA! IT APPEARS SETO KAIBA
OUTWITTED THE PHARAOH.

00:18:14.338 --> 00:18:17.207
BOTH EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS ARE MINE!

00:18:17.207 --> 00:18:18.609
KNOW WHY!?

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:20.778
BECAUSE EVERYONE GETS
WHAT THEY DESERVE!

00:18:20.778 --> 00:18:23.047
YES, I AGREE.

00:18:23.047 --> 00:18:24.581
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU

00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.617
FOR HELPING ME CLAIM
WHAT I DESERVE.

00:18:26.617 --> 00:18:28.018
WHAT!?

00:18:28.018 --> 00:18:30.621
KNOWING HOW GREEDY
YOU ARE, KAIBA,

00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:33.357
I SUSPECTED
YOU MIGHT TRY AND
TAKE MY SKY DRAGON.

00:18:33.357 --> 00:18:34.792
SO I WAS READY!

00:18:34.792 --> 00:18:36.760
REVEAL MAGIC CARD!

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.649

NOW HE CAN TAKE A CARD
FROM MY HAND!

00:18:42.553 --> 00:18:45.623
Yugi: I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE LAST TIME I USED
THIS CARD.

00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:50.327
IT HELPED ME
RESCUE JOEY FROM
MARIK'S MIND CONTROL!

00:18:50.327 --> 00:18:51.796
WELL, GO AHEAD...

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:53.731
PICK ONE OF THE CARDS
IN MY HAND.

INCLUDING THE RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:18:57.468 --> 00:18:58.676

OF YOUR BODY

00:19:05.817 --> 00:19:08.019
AND YOU WILL TAKE
THAT RED EYES!

00:19:08.019 --> 00:19:10.054
NO...
YUGI NEEDS IT...

00:19:10.054 --> 00:19:11.256
I CAN'T!

[GASP]

00:19:13.424 --> 00:19:15.760
AWESOME!
YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT!

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.495
HA! YEAH JOEY!

00:19:17.495 --> 00:19:19.530
I KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT!

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.134
JOEY FOUGHT OFF
MARIK'S DARK POWER
ONCE BEFORE...

00:19:23.134 --> 00:19:25.069
AND I KNOW
HE CAN DO IT AGAIN!

00:19:25.069 --> 00:19:26.504
IN THE MEAN TIME,

00:19:26.504 --> 00:19:29.407
I HAVE TO DEFEAT
KAIBA AND GET TO
THE NEXT ROUND.

00:19:29.407 --> 00:19:31.242

00:19:31.242 --> 00:19:33.645
SO GIVE SLIFER
BACK TO ME.

00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:34.946

BACK ON TRACK!

00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:39.951
