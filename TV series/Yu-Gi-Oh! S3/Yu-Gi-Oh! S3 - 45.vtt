00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.718
THERE'S STILL ONE MORE TASK
THAT YOU AND I MUST COMPLETE.

00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:03.188
I STILL HAVE
ONE LIFE POINT LEFT!

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:07.695
WAIT...HE'S RIGHT!
WE'RE NOT DONE!

00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:12.770
Yami-Marik: HUH?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.739
NO! THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING!

00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:17.210
MARIK'S DARK SIDE
IS BACK ON THE FIELD!

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.447
Yami-Yugi: YES,
BUT NOW THE TABLES
HAVE TURNED.

00:09:19.447 --> 00:09:21.450
MARIK'S GOOD SIDE
IS IN CONTROL

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.587
AND THE EVIL
HAS BECOME THE VICTIM.

00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:25.223
YOU CAN'T DO THIS
MARIK!

00:09:25.223 --> 00:09:26.658
LISTEN!

00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:28.661
WE CAN STILL
CRUSH THE PHARAOH
TOGETHER!

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:30.030
REMEMBER, HOW
YOU WASTED AWAY
YOUR CHILDHOOD

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.601
SERVING THIS FOOL!?

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.438
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO DESTROY HIM

00:09:34.438 --> 00:09:36.006
AND TAKE
WHAT YOU DESERVE!

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:38.043
THE INFINITE POWER
OF THE PHARAOH
COULD BE YOURS!

00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:40.680
IF WE WIN THIS DUEL,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.118
YOU AND I
CAN CLAIM THE THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:09:43.118 --> 00:09:44.821
AND THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE.

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.324
WE'LL RULE THE WORLD
TOGETHER!

00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:54.903
Yami-Marik: DON'T BE
A FOOL, MARIK!

00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:56.104
WE'VE COME SO FAR.

00:09:56.104 --> 00:09:58.040
DON'T THROW AWAY
EVERYTHING
WE'VE WORKED FOR.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.912
WE CAN STILL WIN!

00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:02.748
YOUR MOVE.

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:05.953
I'M SORRY PHARAOH.

00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:10.060
IT WAS MY DUTY TO HELP YOU
AND INSTEAD I TURNED MY BACK.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.631
I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,

00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:16.470
BUT I CAN START OVER BY
EMBRACING MY FAMILY LEGACY.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.475
I'M PROUD TO BE A TOMBKEEPER

00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:20.910
AND I'M PROUD OF MY SISTER
AND MY BROTHER.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.880
THANK YOU, SIR.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.987
MY FAMILY HAS WAITED
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
FOR YOUR RETURN.

00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:29.591
NOW YOU'RE HERE.

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:32.596
SO I MUST FULFILL MY DESTINY

00:10:32.596 --> 00:10:34.265
BY LETTING YOU FULFILL YOURS.

00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:37.604
Yami-Marik:
NO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:39.173
I MUST.

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:43.546
I HOLD THE KEY
TO HELPING THE PHARAOH
UNLOCK HIS TRUE POWERS.

00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:48.187
THE SECRET
IS IMPRINTED ON MY BACK
IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TEXT.

00:10:48.187 --> 00:10:50.992
BUT BEFORE I REVEAL
THIS MYSTERY,

00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:55.565
THE PHARAOH MUST BE IN
POSSESSION OF ALL THREE
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:57.936
Yami-Marik:
YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE!

00:10:57.936 --> 00:10:59.706
NO FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YEARS

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.208
I'M MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE.

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:02.644
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:05.247
I'M HONORING
THE ISHTAR NAME!

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:07.952
BY SURRENDERING THE DUEL.

00:11:07.952 --> 00:11:10.589
OF COURSE!

00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:12.158
BY FORFEITING THE DUEL,

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:14.161
HIS LIFE POINTS
WILL DROP DOWN TO ZERO

00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:17.133
AND HIS EVIL SIDE WILL
VANISH INTO THE SHADOWS.

00:11:17.133 --> 00:11:19.771
IF YOU DO THIS,
YOU'LL BE SORRY!

00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:20.839
YOU NEED ME!

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:22.508
BE GONE!

00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:24.946
I SURRENDER THIS DUEL
TO THE PHARAOH!

00:11:24.946 --> 00:11:29.152
NOOOOOO!

00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:33.726
IT'S FINALLY OVER,
MY PHARAOH.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.095
Yami-Yugi: YES,

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:40.971
AND THE DARKNESS
HAS LIFTED
FROM YOUR HEART.

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:43.108
WE WON THE DUEL!

00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:44.543
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

00:11:44.543 --> 00:11:46.447
Ishizu: MARIK HAS
OVERPOWERED THE EVIL

00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:49.518
THAT CONTROLLED HIM
FOR SO LONG.

00:11:49.518 --> 00:11:51.053
MY PHARAOH...

00:11:51.053 --> 00:11:52.790
THANK YOU.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.425
YOU'VE SAVED
MANKIND.

00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:55.961
WE DID.

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.631
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
VICTORIOUS

00:11:57.631 --> 00:12:01.538
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR
ALL OF YOU.

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:04.642
Roland: AND THE WINNER
OF THE BATTLE CITY
CHAMPIONSHIP CROWN

00:12:04.642 --> 00:12:06.779
IS YUGI MUTO!

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.082
YEAH!
WAY TO GO, YUGI!

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:10.084
DAT'S WHAT
I CALL A DUEL!

00:12:10.084 --> 00:12:12.655
Tristan:
ALL RIGHT!

00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:14.291
YOU'RE THE BEST, YUGE!

00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:15.326
YA DID IT!

00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:16.795
YOU DA MAN, MAN!

00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:18.263
Duke:
YUGI! YUGI! YUGI!

00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:19.666
Tristan:
THAT WAS
AMAZING, YUGI!

00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:20.868
Joey: YEAH!

00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:22.804
DA WAY EVERY MONSTA
IN YOUR DECK SHOWED UP!?

00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:24.140
DAT WAS CLASSIC!

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.542
UP HIGH, PAL!

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:29.548
DAT WAS TRULY
YOUR BEST WORK, YUGE!

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:32.019
MARIK.

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:33.621
ISHIZU...
I'M SORRY.

00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:36.793
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT YOU'RE SAFE

00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:39.564
AND YOU'VE RETURNED
TO THE WAY YOU WERE,
MY BROTHER.

00:12:39.564 --> 00:12:41.734
YOU HAVE FULFILLED
YOUR DESTINY

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:44.505
AND ENDED THE MISSION
OF THE TOMBKEEPERS.

00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:45.674
SISTER...

00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:48.011
DOES THIS MEAN THE THREE
OF US CAN START OVER

00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.047
AND BUILD A NEW LIFE
FOR OURSELVES?

00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:51.717
YES...

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:55.824
I THINK IT'S TIME
OUR FAMILY STARTED LIVING
IN THE LIGHT, DON'T YOU?

00:12:55.824 --> 00:12:59.062
SIDE BY SIDE
WITH THE REST OF MANKIND.

00:12:59.062 --> 00:13:00.664
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

00:13:00.664 --> 00:13:02.000
SO AM I.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.936
Kaiba:
SORRY TO INTERRUPT...

00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:06.908
BUT AS THE ORGANIZER
OF THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT

00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:09.612
I GUESS I SHOULD CONGRATULATE
THE WINNER.

00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:13.051
EVEN THOUGH
YOU ONLY WON THAT DUEL
DUE TO MARIK'S FORFEIT.

00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:14.185
Yugi: ACTUALLY,

00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:16.990
IF KAIBA HADN'T
GIVEN ME THE CARD
I NEEDED,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.060
I WOULD HAVE
LOST THE MATCH
RIGHT AWAY!

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.195
NICE DUEL!

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:21.965
AND AS THE WINNER,

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:24.035
YOU GET TO KEEP
THE RAREST CARD FROM
YOUR OPPONENT'S DECK!

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:25.804
HE'S RIGHT...

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:29.176
AND THE PHARAOH
IS GOING TO NEED
THAT CARD SOON.

00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:31.079
THAT'S TRUE!

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:32.081
Joey: MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T GIVE YA
DA FAKE ONE.

00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.017
Tea:
JOEY!

00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:36.087
Marik: PHARAOH...

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:38.325
AS I COMPLETE
MY FINAL MISSION,

00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:41.062
REST ASSURED THAT
EVERYONE WHO WAS BANISHED
TO THE SHADOW REALM

00:13:41.062 --> 00:13:43.099
BY MY DARK SIDE
WILL RETURN.

00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:44.100
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.102
YOU SAID IT!

00:13:45.102 --> 00:13:48.039
THANK YOU.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:50.877
YES. THANK YOU,
INDEED.

00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:53.615
TAKE THIS, MY RAREST CARD.

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:54.850
AND REMEMBER,

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.755
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THIS CARD, PHARAOH.

00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:00.526
Yugi:
THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA...

00:14:00.526 --> 00:14:03.798
WE HAVE ALL THREE OF
THE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS!

00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:05.768
BUT NOW THAT
THEY'RE IN OUR DECK,

00:14:05.768 --> 00:14:07.371
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THEM?

00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:09.941
HOW CAN WE USE THESE CARDS

00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.645
TO UNLOCK THE HIDDEN POWERS
OF THE PHARAOH?

00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:14.915
WE NEED MORE INFORMATION!

00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:16.585
PHARAOH.

00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:19.289
I HAVE ONE MORE TASK
TO PERFORM

00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:21.059
BEFORE MY TOMBKEEPER'S MISSION
IS COMPLETE.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:24.898
OBSERVE!

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.836
THE SECRET
OF THE PHARAOH'S POWER!

00:14:27.836 --> 00:14:29.606
THIS IS GETTING
WEIRD NOW.

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:31.142
YOU'RE
TELLIN' ME!

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:33.946
Marik:
THESE MARKINGS WERE PASSED DOWN
BY MY FAMILY

00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:38.854
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
FOR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS!

00:14:38.854 --> 00:14:41.792
WE WERE TAUGHT
THAT WHEN THE
ANCIENT PHARAOH

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:43.628
SAVED THE WORLD
FROM DESTRUCTION,

00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:46.032
HE WIPED HIS OWN
MEMORY CLEAN.

00:14:46.032 --> 00:14:48.702
BUT HE KNEW
THAT SOMEDAY
HE WOULD RETURN

00:14:48.702 --> 00:14:49.971
AND HE'D NEED
HIS MEMORY BACK.

00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:55.046
SO HE ENTRUSTED
ONE FAMILY WITH
HIS GREATEST SECRET.

00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:58.151
THE KEY TO
UNLOCKING HIS MIND
AND HIS POWER!

00:14:58.151 --> 00:15:01.090
NOW THAT YOU HOLD
THE THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.625
AND THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.362
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS READ
THE WORDS ON MARIK'S BACK.

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.232
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

00:15:07.232 --> 00:15:08.234
Joey: HEY YUGE...

00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:09.303
CAN YOU REALLY READ
DAT CHICKEN SCRATCH?

00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:11.806
Yami-Yugi:
I'LL TRY.

00:15:11.806 --> 00:15:14.811
Yugi: I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
THOSE ANCIENT SYMBOLS AT ALL,

00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.816
BUT I FEEL LIKE
THE THREE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:18.951
ARE TRYING TO SHOW ME
WHAT THEY SAY!

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:21.155
WAIT!

00:15:21.155 --> 00:15:23.258
THAT'S THE STONE TABLET
FROM THE MUSEUM!

00:15:23.258 --> 00:15:26.330
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:32.172
COULD THE PHARAOH'S SECRET
BE LOCKED IN THIS TABLET?

00:15:32.172 --> 00:15:35.144
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO LEAVE NOW PHARAOH.

00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:36.813
SO PLEASE TAKE THIS.

00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:38.983
THE MILLENNIUM ROD
BELONGS WITH YOU

00:15:38.983 --> 00:15:40.919
WHERE IT WON'T CAUSE
ANY MORE HARM.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:42.088
THANK YOU.

00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:43.824
AND TAKE THIS AS WELL.

00:15:43.824 --> 00:15:46.127
THE MILLENNIUM RING
IS SAFEST WITH YOU.

00:15:46.127 --> 00:15:48.598
ALRIGHT YOU GEEKS!

00:15:48.598 --> 00:15:51.937
THIS VICTORY CELEBRATION
HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH!

00:15:51.937 --> 00:15:54.607
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
IS OVER!

00:15:54.607 --> 00:15:56.610
SO IF YOU'D LIKE
A FREE RIDE HOME

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.781
I'D SUGGEST YOU BOARD
MY AIRCRAFT RIGHT NOW.

00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:00.384
IS THAT CLEAR!?

00:16:00.384 --> 00:16:03.021
IF ANYONE'S LEFT BEHIND
ON THE ISLAND,

00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:06.293
THE KAIBA CORPORATION WILL NOT
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY!

00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:08.196
SO GO!

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:10.032
CAUSE IN ONE HOUR,
THIS ISLAND WILL EXPLODE!

00:16:10.032 --> 00:16:12.670
SAY WHAT!?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.739
YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT!?
PLEASE SAY "YES."

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:16.342
Kaiba:
I DON'T KID.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.180
THE DUEL TOWER WILL
SELF-DESTRUCT IN ONE HOUR,

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.717
SO BOARD THE SHIP
AND GO HOME!

00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:23.253
I THOUGHT
MOKUBA SAID

00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:25.389
THAT THE ENGINES
WEREN'T WORKING
ON THAT THING!

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:28.294
IT'S ALRIGHT NOW.
THE SHIP'S BEEN
REPAIRED!

00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:29.797
ISN'T THAT RIGHT!?

00:16:29.797 --> 00:16:30.932
UH, WELL...

00:16:30.932 --> 00:16:33.436
GOOD BYE.

00:16:33.436 --> 00:16:35.873
Joey: CAN YOU BELIEVE
DAT SORE LOSER!?

00:16:35.873 --> 00:16:37.041
Tristan:
I KNOW.

00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.377
KAIBA LOSES
THE TOURNAMENT,

00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:44.087
SO HE DECIDES TO
TRASH THE PLACE.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:49.328
Kaiba: ACTIVATE
THE DETONATORS,
MOKUBA.

00:16:49.328 --> 00:16:52.634
Computer voice:
ACTIVATING KAIBA CORP DUEL TOWER
DETONATION SYSTEM.

00:16:52.634 --> 00:16:55.237
ONE HOUR IS PLENTY
OF TIME RIGHT?

00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:57.708
THE SHIP LEAVES NOW.

00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:59.311
ALRIGHT...

00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:01.314
THEN EVERYONE SHOULD BE
A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY.

00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:05.720
SO LET'S DO THIS SETO.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.725
Computer voice:
ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED.

00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:11.497
THIS IS IT...
GET READY.

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.266
Computer voice:

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:19.042
LAST BUT NOT LEAST...

00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:21.846
Computer voice:
KEY CARD A, DETECTED.

00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:24.918
KEY CARD B, DETECTED.

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:29.926
DETONATION SEQUENCE HAS BEGUN!
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.840

00:17:46.783 --> 00:17:47.884

00:17:47.884 --> 00:17:49.720

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.591

00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:53.059

WHAT'S GOIN' ON!?

00:18:21.104 --> 00:18:23.642

DID I HEAR YOU SAY
YOU'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO HAVE ME WAKE UP?

00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:30.085
'CAUSE THERE'S

00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:32.556

00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:50.985
Yami-Yugi:

00:18:50.985 --> 00:18:54.291

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:15.957
I WAS GONE FOR A LONG TIME.

00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:18.395
AND THERE'S NOT MUCH TO EAT
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:19:18.395 --> 00:19:22.301
GO FIGURE.

00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:25.173
Roland: THIS AIRCRAFT
IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:26.241
NOT WITHOUT THE KAIBAS!!

00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:27.643

00:19:27.643 --> 00:19:29.012

00:19:33.753 --> 00:19:35.089

00:19:35.089 --> 00:19:37.325
THIS WHOLE PLACE

00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:39.295
Duke: YEAH!
KAIBA SAID
THE DUEL TOWER

00:19:39.295 --> 00:19:41.198
WOULD SELF DESTRUCT
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR!

00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:43.969
KAIBA'S NOT

00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:45.972
I'M SURE HE'S

00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:50.046
WELL WE CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE!

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:52.416
HE'S RIGHT JOEY,
WE SHOULD GO LOOK
FOR THOSE GUYS.

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:54.919
WE'RE JUST WAY TOO NICE.

00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:55.921
LET'S GO...

00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:56.923
Tea: YEAH.

00:19:56.923 --> 00:19:58.325
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR

00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:00.162
AND DON'T LEAVE
'TIL WE GET BACK!

00:20:00.162 --> 00:20:03.066
I'D LIKE TA GET HOME
IN ONE PIECE!

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:05.303
PREPARE

00:20:05.303 --> 00:20:08.141
ROGER! ENGAGING
MAIN ENGINES!

00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:12.648
VOLTAGE, CHECK. FUEL CHECK.
STARTING REAR THRUSTER.

00:20:16.154 --> 00:20:17.256
Fuguta: OH NO!
WE HAVE A PROBLEM!

00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:19.759
I WAS AFRAID OF THIS!

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:22.197
THE ENGINES
ARE WEAK, RIGHT?

00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:24.100
WORSE, THEY'RE
COMPLETELY DEAD!

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.401
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:26.837
WAIT A SEC!

00:20:26.837 --> 00:20:29.341
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS SAID
THEY WERE FIXED!?!

00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:33.014
DOES THIS MEAN
WE'RE STUCK HERE?

00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:34.357
Computer voice:
WARNING...

00:20:34.357 --> 00:20:37.027
DUEL TOWER WILL SELF DESTRUCT
IN FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.094
EVACUATE THE ISLAND IMMEDIATELY.
