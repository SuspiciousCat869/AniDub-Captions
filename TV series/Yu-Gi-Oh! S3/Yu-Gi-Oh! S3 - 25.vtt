HE CAN BULLY US AROUND

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.083
WITH HIS MILLENNIUM ROD,

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.651
HE BETTER THINK AGAIN!

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.786
'CAUSE YOU AND I
ARE GONNA WIN
THIS TOURNAMENT!

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:09.889
AND HOPEFULLY WHEN WE DO
AND MARIK'S PLAN FAILS,

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.659
EVERYONE WHO FELL VICTIM
TO HIM WILL BE OK.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.894
I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS!

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.997
YOU'RE RIGHT...

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:20.166
WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER,
THERE'S NO STOPPING US!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.901
JUST AS ISHIZU TOLD US,

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.570
WE HAVE TO WIN
THIS TOURNAMENT

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.507
AND SAVE THE WORLD!

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.875
UH, HEY, YUGI!

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.677
IT'S ALMOST
THAT TIME, DUDE!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.080
SO GRAB YOUR DUELING DECK
AND LET'S GO!!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.515
HEY, WAIT.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.917
BAKURA'S
IN NO SHAPE TO BE
OUT OF BED, GUYS!

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.286
YEAH, HE WAS LOOKIN'
PRETTY BAD!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.022
Yugi: HE'S...UH...
JUST GETTING
SOME AIR.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.958
NOW...JOEY AND I
HAVE SOME DUELS TO WIN,

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.426
AND WE NEED YOUR HELP!

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:48.995
YOU BET!
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE
ON THE SIDELINES!

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.330
YOU CAN COUNT ON US!

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.965
Duke: FOR SURE!

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:55.068
Roland: WE ARE NOW
BEGINNING OUR DESCENT
UPON KAIBA CORP ISLAND

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.670
FOR THE CONCLUSION
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.240
WHEN WE TOUCH DOWN,
PLEASE EXIT THE AIRCRAFT

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:07.080
AND AWAIT
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS!

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.083
THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR IS FINALLY HERE.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:13.253
SOON I'LL BE CROWNED
THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DUELIST!

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.388
Yugi: WHOA,
CHECK IT OUT, GUYS!

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.491
Joey: DAT MUST BE
DA DUEL TOWER KAIBA
WAS YAPPIN ABOUT!

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.826
NOW WHAT?

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.095
I'M SURE WE'LL
FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:24.798
LOOK...THE ISLAND
WE'RE STANDING ON

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:27.567
IS THE SITE OF THE ORIGINAL
KAIBA CORPORATION,

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.002
BUT I TORE IT DOWN.

00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.637
AND IS THAT--
YES!

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.005
THAT'S
MY DUEL TOWER,

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.306
AND I PLAN
TO DEFEAT YOU

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:38.078
ON THE VERY TOP,
YUGI!

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.579
LOOK, RICH BOY!!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.082
IN CASE YOU FORGOT,
I'M IN DIS TOURNAMENT, TOO!

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.917
AND YOU WON'T BE
GETTIN' PAST ME!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.919
I'LL DUEL SO MANY CIRCLES
AROUND YA,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.522
YOU WON'T KNOW YA TRAP CARDS
FROM YA GRAVEYARD, PUNK!

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:52.859
MUST YOU INSIST
ON EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF, WHEELER?

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.929
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE IN MY TOURNAMENT,
YOU AMATEUR!

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:56.996
WHAT?!

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.765
HEY!
CALM DOWN, CHAMP!

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.301
DAT'S IT, MAN!
YOU WANT A PIECE A DIS?

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:02.836
LET'S GO!

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:04.537
SAVE IT
FOR YOUR DUEL, MAN!

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.106
Tea: YEAH!
USE ALL OF THAT ANGER

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.974
TO BEAT KAIBA
IN THE FINALS!

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:14.647
Kaiba: WHATEVER.
WE'RE WASTING TIME,
SO LET'S GO!

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.649
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.053
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY DAY,
ISN'T IT, PHARAOH!?

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:22.322
TOO BAD SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS
CAN'T ENJOY IT

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:24.757
FROM ALL THE WAY
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:25.892
UNH!

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.628
HEY, ARTICHOKE HEAD!
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.663
THEN LET'S GET ON
WITH THESE DUELS.

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:34.067
WHEN DO I FIND OUT
WHO MY NEXT VICTIM IS?

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.702
JUST CHILL OUT!

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:38.638
WE'LL TELL YOU
INSIDE THE TOWER,
IS THAT CLEAR?!

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.672
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.107
THEN WHY
DON'T WE PROCEED

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.611
SO THE FUN
CAN BEGIN.

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.212
Joey: SO WHAT'S INSIDE
DIS DING?

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:51.117
Kaiba: WHY DON'T
YOU TRY LISTENING
FOR A CHANGE, WHEELER?

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.888
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE!
STEP TO THE CENTER OF THE TOWER.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.323
THE SECOND HALF
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.025
WILL TAKE PLACE RIGHT HERE!

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:01.861
SO FAR,
IT'S NOT SO IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.097
THIS PLACE
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A DUELING ARENA.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:06.332
OH, YEAH?
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.502
AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
4 FINALISTS REMAINING--

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:13.473
YUGI, JOEY, MARIK,
AND, OF COURSE, MR. KAIBA.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:16.109
YOU'LL NOTICE
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY 4 DOORS.

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.912
EACH FINALIST MUST CHOOSE A DOOR
THROUGH WHICH TO ENTER.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.213
CHOOSE WISELY.

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.849
WHAT'S BEHIND THEM?!

00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:32.370
Roland: BEFORE WE MAY PROCEED
WITH THE NEXT ROUND

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.038
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS,

00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:36.674
EACH PARTICIPANT MUST CHOOSE
ONE OF THE 4 DOORS

00:11:36.674 --> 00:11:37.942
THAT SURROUND US!

00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:39.911
HUH? HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TA KNOW

00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:41.679
WHICH DOOR TA PICK?

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:42.981
WHAT DO YOU DINK,
YUGE?

00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:44.849
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A WRONG CHOICE.

00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:46.384
WELL, HERE GOES.

00:11:46.384 --> 00:11:49.620
1 POTATO, 2 POTATO,
3 POTATO, 4...

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.621
5 POTATO,
6 POTATO...

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:52.623
HOW DID THAT FOOL
MAKE IT THIS FAR?

00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:55.059
JUST PICK A DOOR,
YOU GEEK.

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:57.061
I...CHOOSE...YOU!

00:11:57.061 --> 00:11:58.730
WE HAVE A WINNER!

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.231
HMM!
EHH!

00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:04.002
HOLD IT! I ALREADY CALLED
FIRST DIBS ON THAT DOOR!

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:07.271
Yami-Yugi: JUST CHOOSE
THE DOOR CLOSEST
TO YOU, JOEY.

00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:09.240
BUT WHAT ABOUT
MY POTATO SONG?!

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.175
[GRUMBLE]

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:14.345
OH, WELL, I GUESS
IF YOU'VE SEEN ONE DOOR,
YOU'VE SEEN 'EM ALL.

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:16.948
EVERYONE ELSE,
COME ON AND FOLLOW ME!

00:12:16.948 --> 00:12:18.282
TOO BAD, MAN!

00:12:18.282 --> 00:12:20.385
I GUESS DOOR-CHOOSING'S
NOT YOUR THING!

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:22.453
GOOD LUCK, JOEY!

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:25.923
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD STAND
ON THAT PLATFORM.

00:12:25.923 --> 00:12:30.261
BUT WHY?
WHAT IS KAIBA PLANNING?

00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:38.569
ARE WE DUELING IN THESE?

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:39.937
[PANTING]

00:12:39.937 --> 00:12:41.005
COME ON!

00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:43.341
WHOA!
I CAN BARELY SEE

00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:44.609
THE TOP
OF THIS THING!

00:12:44.609 --> 00:12:46.411
Tristan:
SO WHAT GIVES,
MOKUBA?

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:47.545
Tea: YEAH.
YOU MIND TELLING US

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:48.713
WHERE THE DUELISTS ARE?

00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:51.315
WHY, HERE THEY COME
RIGHT NOW!

00:12:51.315 --> 00:12:53.351
UH...UH.

00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:59.223
IT'S JOEY!

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:02.193
Duke: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE GANG'S ALL HERE!

00:13:02.193 --> 00:13:03.928
SO WHAT'S DA DEAL?

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:06.264
IS DIS SOME KIND
OF A 4-WAY DUEL?!

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:08.132
ROLAND WILL EXPLAIN
THE RULES,

00:13:08.132 --> 00:13:10.701
AND I'VE ASKED HIM
TO SPEAK SLOWLY
SO YOU CAN FOLLOW...

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:12.336
YOU'RE LUCKY
I'M OVA HERE!

00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:15.239
BEFORE THE WINNER OF
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
CAN BE CROWNED,

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.642
WE MUST FIRST NARROW DOWN
THE FINALISTS!

00:13:17.642 --> 00:13:19.444
SO IN THE SEMIFINAL ROUND,

00:13:19.444 --> 00:13:22.346
THE 4 REMAINING DUELISTS
WILL BE REDUCED TO TWO.

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:23.848
BUT FIRST, GENTLEMEN...

00:13:23.848 --> 00:13:26.250
THE PRELIMINARY DUEL
MUST BE PLAYED.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.688
THIS SPECIAL DUEL WILL DETERMINE
WHO FACES WHO IN THE SEMIFINALS,

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:33.925
AND ALL 4 DUELISTS
WILL PARTICIPATE AT ONE TIME!

00:13:33.925 --> 00:13:37.261
AS YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS,
YOUR TERMINAL WILL CLIMB HIGHER.

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.430
THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS
TO REACH THE TOP

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.732
WILL FACE EACH OTHER
IN ROUND 1.

00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:44.735
HEAR DAT? IT'S A DUEL
TO SEE WHO DUELS!

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:48.106
EACH DUELIST WILL BEGIN
WITH 4,000 LIFE POINTS,

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:49.607
AND WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN,

00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:52.844
YOU CAN ATTACK
ANY OF THE OTHER PLAYERS.

00:13:52.844 --> 00:13:55.113
AND NOW FOR
SOME NEW REGULATIONS!

00:13:55.113 --> 00:13:57.181
YOU MUST ALL LIMIT
YOUR DUELING DECKS

00:13:57.181 --> 00:13:59.183
TO NO MORE THAN 40 CARDS,

00:13:59.183 --> 00:14:02.820
SO TAKE THIS TIME
TO PREPARE YOUR DECKS.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.824
NOW CONNECT YOUR DUEL DISKS
TO THE MONITOR IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:14:06.824 --> 00:14:10.094
THIS SCREEN WILL
DISPLAY THE IMAGES
OF THE CARDS YOU PLAY.

00:14:10.094 --> 00:14:13.231
REMEMBER, WINNING
OR LOSING THIS DUEL

00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.367
HAS NO EFFECT ON HOW
YOU PLACE IN THE FINALS.

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:18.302
THIS IS SIMPLY
A STRATEGIC WAY

00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:22.640
TO DETERMINE WHO YOUR OPPONENT
WILL BE IN THE SEMIFINAL ROUND.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.544
AGAIN, THIS DUEL WILL NOT AFFECT
YOUR OVERALL PLACEMENT!

00:14:26.544 --> 00:14:28.946
THAT'S GOOD.
SO AT LEAST ALL
THE PRESSURE'S OFF!

00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:30.948
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER WHO WINS

00:14:30.948 --> 00:14:33.284
AND WHO LOSES
IN THIS DUEL,
RIGHT, GUYS?

00:14:33.284 --> 00:14:34.886
THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY TRUE.

00:14:34.886 --> 00:14:37.822
THIS COULD BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT DUEL
THESE GUYS PLAY!

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:40.424
AND HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT, DUKE?

00:14:40.424 --> 00:14:43.027
THEY CAN CONTROL
WHO THEIR OPPONENT
WILL BE!

00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:45.263
SO THEY MIGHT CHANGE
THEIR STRATEGIES

00:14:45.263 --> 00:14:46.797
DEPENDING ON WHO
THEY WANT TO FACE

00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:48.599
IN THE SEMIFINAL ROUND!

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:52.303
TWO DUELISTS
CAN EVEN GANG UP
ON ONE IF THEY WANT!

00:14:52.303 --> 00:14:53.638
GANG UP, HUH?

00:14:53.638 --> 00:14:55.373
I WONDER WHICH ONE
OF THOSE GUYS

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:58.042
IS IN DANGER OF GETTING
DOUBLE-TEAMED, TEA?

00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:00.545
KNOWING JOEY'S LUCK,
THEY'LL GO AFTER HIM.

00:15:00.545 --> 00:15:01.913
Joey: HEY!
AAH!
AAH!

00:15:01.913 --> 00:15:02.947
Tristan: YES?

00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:04.215
YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ME?

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:06.717
WE WERE, UH, JUST MAKING UP
A CHEER FOR YOU.

00:15:06.717 --> 00:15:08.019
YEAH, THAT'S IT...

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:11.189
OK...BUT IT
BETTER HAVE LOTS
OF COOL RHYMES!

00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:13.291
Yugi, thinking:
THIS ENTIRE DUEL WAS SET UP

00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:17.261
TO MAKE US CHOOSE THE OPPONENTS
WE'LL FACE IN THE SEMIFINALS!

00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:20.431
BUT WHO SHOULD I PICK?

00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:22.300
[THINKING]
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.435
AND ALL 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:26.404
I'LL HAVE TO FACE MARIK LAST.

00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:30.441
SINCE HIS WINGED DRAGON OF RA
IS THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE 3,

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:33.377
I'LL NEED THE OTHER TWO
IN MY DECK TO WIN IT,

00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:36.314
AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN, YUGI!

00:15:36.314 --> 00:15:39.250
[THINKING]
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
WHO I DUEL NEXT.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.888
EITHER WAY, I'LL DRAIN
THE PHARAOH OF HIS POWERS
IN THE END!

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:50.728
Roland: PREPARE YOURSELVES,
DUELISTS!

00:15:50.728 --> 00:15:53.664
THE 4-WAY BATTLE
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:57.068
REMEMBER, THE FIRST TWO DUELISTS
TO LOSE THEIR LIFE POINTS

00:15:57.068 --> 00:15:59.537
WILL FACE EACH OTHER
IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:01.572
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN!

00:16:01.572 --> 00:16:05.176
NOW TO DETERMINE WHICH DUELIST
WILL MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:06.677
WHY DON'T I
JUST GO FIRST?

00:16:06.677 --> 00:16:08.746
WHY DON'T YOU
PAY ATTENTION TO THE RULES

00:16:08.746 --> 00:16:11.282
THAT MR. KAIBA
WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE?

00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:13.184
NOW YOU'LL EACH DRAW
A MONSTER CARD,

00:16:13.184 --> 00:16:16.520
AND THE ATTACK POINTS
WILL DETERMINE WHO GOES FIRST.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.658
HOWEVER, THE MONSTER YOU CHOOSE
CANNOT BE USED IN THIS DUEL!

00:16:20.658 --> 00:16:22.059
Yugi, thinking:
SO IF I WANNA GO FIRST,

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:24.161
I HAVE TO SACRIFICE
A POWERFUL MONSTER!

00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:25.696
[THINKING]
IN ORDER TO ENSURE

00:16:25.696 --> 00:16:28.032
THAT I FACE YUGI
IN THE SEMIFINALS,

00:16:28.032 --> 00:16:30.468
I'LL NEED TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE!

00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:31.869
HMM!

00:16:31.869 --> 00:16:34.505
[THINKING]
SHOULD I PICK DAT CARD?
OR DIS ONE?!!

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:37.308
UH-OH, JOEY LOOKS
A BIT FREAKED OUT...

00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:39.744
IT IS NOW TIME
TO REVEAL YOUR CARDS!

00:16:39.744 --> 00:16:44.615
YES. HOLD THEM UP SO ALL
THE PLAYERS CAN VIEW THEM!

00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:46.851
[THINKING]
IT LOOKS LIKE MY CARD
IS THE MOST POWERFUL,

00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:51.789
SO I GET TO START THINGS OFF!

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:54.292
[THINKING]
I'M GONNA SAVE
ALL MY BEST CARDS

00:16:54.292 --> 00:16:56.160
FOR THE DUEL!

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.429
THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN TALLIED!

00:16:58.429 --> 00:17:00.898
THE ORDER OF DUELISTS
IS AS FOLLOWS...

00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:02.366
FIRST MR. KAIBA...

00:17:02.366 --> 00:17:03.668
AND THEN MARIK,

00:17:03.668 --> 00:17:05.870
THEN YUGI, AND THEN JOEY!

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.706
[THINKING]
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN!

00:17:08.706 --> 00:17:12.143
I'LL SPARE YUGI
SO I CAN FACE HIM
IN THE SEMIFINALS...

00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:13.844
AND I'LL FOCUS
ALL MY ATTENTION

00:17:13.844 --> 00:17:16.447
ON ELIMINATING
MARIK!

00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:19.817
AND GETTING RID
OF WHEELER
WILL BE SIMPLE!

00:17:19.817 --> 00:17:22.019
[THINKING]
AS MUCH AS I WANNA CRUSH KAIBA

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:24.522
AND PUT AN END TO HIS INSULTS
ONCE AND FOR ALL...

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:26.857
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT REASONS
FOR BEIN' HERE.

00:17:26.857 --> 00:17:31.228
I PROMISED YUGI AND MAI
DAT I WOULD TAKE MARIK DOWN!

00:17:31.228 --> 00:17:34.298
Yugi, thinking:
THE ENTIRE WORLD IS
DEPENDING ON OUR VICTORY!

00:17:34.298 --> 00:17:35.733
BUT WHAT IF WE FAIL?

00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:37.034
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH!

00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:38.669
YUGI...

00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:41.072
WE JOINED THIS TOURNAMENT
TO SAVE THE WORLD,

00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:43.140
AND RIGHT NOW,
THAT MEANS STOPPING MARIK

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.276
FROM COMPLETING
HIS EVIL PLAN!

00:17:45.276 --> 00:17:50.548
SO...LETTING HIM WIN
IS NOT AN OPTION!

00:17:50.548 --> 00:17:53.451
MY FAMILY HAS SLAVED
FOR CENTURIES...

00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:56.554
PROTECTING THE TOMB
OF THE PHARAOH UNTIL HIS RETURN.

00:17:56.554 --> 00:17:57.888
AND FOR WHAT?!

00:17:57.888 --> 00:17:59.657
I SHOULD BE THE PHARAOH!

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:02.326
I WAS RAISED
ON THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:18:02.326 --> 00:18:03.861
LEARNING ALL THERE IS TO KNOW

00:18:03.861 --> 00:18:06.964
ABOUT KING YAMI THE PHARAOH
AND THE SHADOW GAMES.

00:18:06.964 --> 00:18:09.133
THE KEY TO HIS POWER
IS YOUR PUZZLE

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:11.469
AND THE 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:14.939
BUT I CAN'T JUST TAKE
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE FROM YOU.

00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:16.707
ACCORDING
TO THE ANCIENT SCRIPTURES,

00:18:16.707 --> 00:18:18.909
I HAVE TO DEFEAT YOU
IN A DUEL FIRST,

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:21.011
THEN I'LL BANISH YOU
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:22.346
Yugi, thinking: OH, NO!

00:18:22.346 --> 00:18:25.383
ONCE I GAIN CONTROL
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:28.152
AND OBTAIN ALL 3
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS,

00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:30.755
I'LL BE KING!

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:32.957
AND MY MILLENNIUM ROD
WILL ENSURE

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:35.593
THAT I GET EVERYTHING I NEED!

00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:37.228
Yami-Yugi: THE FATE OF
THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:18:37.228 --> 00:18:39.330
RESTS ON THE OUTCOME
OF THE BATTLE CITY FINALS,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.198
AND WE MUSTN'T LOSE HOPE!

00:18:41.198 --> 00:18:46.370
YOU'RE RIGHT!
AND TOGETHER,
YOU AND I CAN DO THIS!

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.572
Kaiba: ALL RIGHT!
ENOUGH WAITING AROUND!

00:18:48.572 --> 00:18:50.608
LET'S START THIS DUEL!

00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:51.809
AND NOW!

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:54.078
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN,

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.448
AND THEN I'LL SUMMON
VORSE RAIDER IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:58.849
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:00.551
[THINKING]
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE

00:19:00.551 --> 00:19:03.053
THAT MARIK AND WHEELER
LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:19:03.053 --> 00:19:05.856
OR MY ENTIRE PLAN IS RUINED!

00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:07.925
NOT BAD, SETO KAIBA.

00:19:07.925 --> 00:19:13.764
THEN AGAIN...YOUR MONSTER'S
NO MATCH FOR MY NEWDORIA!

00:19:13.764 --> 00:19:14.765
[GROWLING]

00:19:14.765 --> 00:19:16.000
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.235
[THINKING]
THIS CREATURE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:20.171
WILL COME IN QUITE HANDY!

00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:22.907
ALL RIGHT THEN...
MY MOVE!

00:19:22.907 --> 00:19:24.909
Yugi, thinking:
I KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:27.044
I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO DEFEAT MARIK,

00:19:27.044 --> 00:19:30.114
BUT I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHO I SHOULD FACE
IN THE SEMIFINALS

00:19:30.114 --> 00:19:32.116
TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS!

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:34.552
Yami-Yugi: I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA TO THE FIELD,

00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:37.555
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:43.060
AND PLACE THESE FACEDOWN!

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.862
LAST BUT NOT LEAST...

00:19:44.862 --> 00:19:48.566
[THINKING]
AW, MAN! DIS HAND IS DA PITS!

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:50.501
BUT I GOTTA RELAX
AND PLAY IT COOL!

00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:54.004
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:19:54.004 --> 00:19:56.106
Kaiba: WHICH BRINGS IT
BACK TO ME!

00:19:56.106 --> 00:19:58.008
JUST AS I SUSPECTED...

00:19:58.008 --> 00:20:00.044
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE,
WHEELER!

00:20:00.044 --> 00:20:02.480
SO I THINK I'LL DO US
ALL A FAVOR

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.015
AND ELIMINATE YOU
FROM THIS DUEL!

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:08.786
VORSE RAIDER, ATTACK
HIS LIFE POINTS NOW!!!

00:20:08.786 --> 00:20:09.954
[GROWLING]

00:20:09.954 --> 00:20:11.021
UNH!

00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:12.590
JOEY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY MONSTERS

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.124
ON THE FIELD
TO PROTECT HIM!

00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:16.794
THAT'S NOT GOOD!

00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:19.930
HA HA HA! SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THOSE LIFE POINTS!

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.565
I'LL PROTECT YOU!

00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:24.301
AND I'LL DO IT BY ACTIVATING
MY TRAP CARD--

00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.871
THE REGULATION OF TRIBE!

00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:28.873
[GROWLING]

00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:30.875
AAH! HUH?

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:31.909
OH, NO!

00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:33.043
OH, YES!

00:20:33.043 --> 00:20:34.912
THANKS TO THIS TRAP CARD,

00:20:34.912 --> 00:20:38.082
I CAN STOP THE ATTACK
OF ONE TYPE OF MONSTER!

00:20:38.082 --> 00:20:41.519
I CHOOSE BEAST WARRIORS!
LIKE VORSE RAIDER!

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:42.520
UNH!

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.021
DANKS, YUGE!

00:20:44.021 --> 00:20:46.524
JOEY, YOU AND I ARE A TEAM,

00:20:46.524 --> 00:20:48.092
AND I'LL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU!
