00:08:16.293 --> 00:08:19.796
I HAVE NEVER SERVED
ANYONE BUT MYSELF

00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:21.131
AND I'VE NEVER
BACKED DOWN

00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.266
FROM A CHALLENGE
EITHER GOZABURO!

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:25.836
SO LET'S DUEL!

00:08:25.836 --> 00:08:29.039
THE SATELLITE'S ALMOST
REPROGRAMMED FOR DESTRUCTION!

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:34.010
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.713
I'LL FIND YOU PHARAOH!

00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:39.783
HA HA HA HA!

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:42.786
EVEN IF THAT MEANS
SHUTTING THIS PLACE DOWN!

00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:47.891
Computerized voice: WARNING,
MAIN POWER IS OFF LINE.

00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:50.627
MAIN POWER IS OFF LINE.

00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:53.530
NO! I WAS ALMOST FINISHED!

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.066
RELEASING MAGNETIC DOCK.

00:08:56.066 --> 00:08:58.435
HEY, WE'RE NO LONGER
LOCKED DOWN!

00:08:58.435 --> 00:08:59.970
EXCELLENT!

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.905
NOW WE HAVE TO FIND
THE OTHER PASSENGERS!

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:03.974
MARIK!

00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:08.178
ARE YOU PREPARED TO
HUMILIATE YOURSELF,
SETO?

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:09.379
YOU TELL ME!

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:10.780
LET'S GET STARTED!

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.416
NOW THEN...
I'LL GO FIRST!

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:17.287
AND YOU CRITICIZED ME
FOR HAVING NO MANNERS?

00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:19.022
GO AHEAD AND MAKE
YOUR MOVE.

00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:21.024
I PLAY PAINFUL CHOICE.

00:09:21.024 --> 00:09:24.294
IT'S A MAGIC CARD
THAT ALLOWS ME TO TAKE
ANY FIVE CARDS FROM--

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:27.297
I KNOW WHAT THE CARD
DOES, YOU FOOL!

00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:30.100
FIRST YOU SHOW ME
ANY FIVE CARDS
FROM YOUR DECK,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.768
THEN I PICK ONE
OF THEM.

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:33.270
THAT CARD GOES
INTO YOUR HAND.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.105
THE OTHERS HEAD TO
THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.874
NOW! SHOW ME YOUR
FIVE CARDS ALREADY!

00:09:37.874 --> 00:09:41.444
WELL SOMEONE'S FEELING
A BIT ANXIOUS.

00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:44.014
SO FEAST YOUR EYES
ON MY CARDS.

00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:47.250
I HAVE A STRONG FEELING
YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED THEM
BEFORE!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.119
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK!

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:53.290
DO THESE FIVE CARDS
SEEM FAMILIAR TO YOU!?

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.526
IT CAN'T BE!
NOT THOSE CARDS!

00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:59.796
IT'S THE FIVE PIECES
OF EXODIA
THE FORBIDDEN ONE!

00:10:02.354 --> 00:10:03.755
Gozaburo: YES!

00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:06.449
I HAVE ALL FIVE PIECES
OF EXODIA IN MY DECK!

00:10:06.449 --> 00:10:08.885
BUT NOT FOR LONG!
TRUST ME!

00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:12.355
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT SETO.
AFTER ALL WE'VE JUST BEGUN.

00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:13.890
AND I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.725
PAINFUL HISTORY WITH EXODIA!

00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:19.729
EXODIA!

00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:21.431
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:24.300
Yami-Yugi:
EXODIA! OBLITERATE!

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.473
AAH!

00:10:32.008 --> 00:10:33.209
YOUR POINT?

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:34.778
THAT'S HISTORY!

00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:36.246
BESIDES
I'M ABOUT TO SEND

00:10:36.246 --> 00:10:38.882
FOUR PIECES OF EXODIA
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:42.318
HA HA HA HA HA!
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:10:42.318 --> 00:10:46.790
ANY DUELIST HOLDING ALL
FIVE PIECES OF EXODIA
AUTOMATICALLY WINS!

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.158
BUT SINCE HE DREW THEM

00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:50.059
USING A PAINFUL CHOICE
MAGIC CARD,

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.695
I CAN SEND FOUR OF THEM
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:55.565
DIDN'T I TEACH YOU
THAT HESITATION IS
A FORM OF WEAKNESS

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.535
WHEN FACING DOWN
YOUR ENEMIES SETO?

00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:01.304
HE MUST BE
UP TO SOMETHING!

00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:02.806
EVEN HE'S NOT
DUMB ENOUGH

00:11:02.806 --> 00:11:04.974
TO THROW AWAY
HIS BEST CARDS!

00:11:04.974 --> 00:11:06.943
I'LL LET YOU KEEP
THAT ONE.

00:11:06.943 --> 00:11:09.212
THEN THE RIGHT ARM OF EXODIA
GOES TO MY HAND

00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:11.281
AND THE OTHERS GO AWAY.

00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:15.018
NOW I'LL PLACE ONE MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:17.420
AND END MY TURN
FOR NOW.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.291
BUT IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOU HEAR ME SAY
"CHECKMATE!"

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:23.293
STAND BACK.
IT'S MY MOVE NOW!

00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:27.297
Computerized voice: EMERGENCY
BACK-UP GENERATORS ACTIVATED.

00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:30.433
ALL SYSTEMS OPERATING
NORMALLY.

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:33.436
GOOD. WHERE WAS I?

00:11:33.436 --> 00:11:35.471
ONCE THAT SATELLITE
ATTACKS...

00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:38.308
THE ENTIRE VIRTUAL WORLD
WILL INSTANTLY SHUT DOWN

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:40.376
ALONG WITH
EVERY MIND INSIDE!

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:41.711
Yami-Marik: TAKE THAT!

00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:43.646
AN UNINVITED GUEST.

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:45.748
IT'S NOT LIKE IT MATTERS.

00:11:47.317 --> 00:11:50.320
THIS PLACE IS HISTORY!

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.056
Computerized voice:
THIRTY MINUTES TO
SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:11:54.858 --> 00:11:56.726
DA COAST IS CLEAR.
LET'S GO!

00:11:58.895 --> 00:12:00.630
Yugi: COME ON, JOEY!

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.632
ARE THOSE MONSTERS
COMING BACK?

00:12:02.632 --> 00:12:04.033
DON'T WORRY
SERENITY.

00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:05.902
IT SEEMS LIKE
WE'RE SAFE
FOR NOW.

00:12:05.902 --> 00:12:07.237
HUH?

00:12:07.237 --> 00:12:08.504
OR MAYBE NOT!!
RUN!

00:12:08.504 --> 00:12:10.974
LOOKS LIKE OUR
WORK'S NOT DONE!

00:12:10.974 --> 00:12:12.475
A'RIGHT! LET'S DO
OUR THING, YUGE!

00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:17.947
Computerized voice:
TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES
TO SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:19.816
EVACUATE
VIRTUAL SIMULATORS.

00:12:22.118 --> 00:12:24.954
Yami-Marik: HA HA HA!
I MUST FIND THOSE FOOLS!

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:27.991
WHAT'S THIS?

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:30.526
Computerized voice:
SATELLITE SET TO DESTROY
CENTRAL COMPUTER.

00:12:30.526 --> 00:12:33.930
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.165
TWENTY-THREE MINUTES
TO SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:12:36.165 --> 00:12:38.468
THIS IS IT! RIGHT FATHER?

00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:40.870
YOU'RE FINALLY GIVING
KAIBA CORP TO ME!

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.473
YOU HAD
YOUR CHANCE NOAH!

00:12:43.473 --> 00:12:46.576
HE'S LIED TO ME
FOR THE LAST TIME!

00:12:57.887 --> 00:13:01.591
IT'S TIME TO MAKE MY ESCAPE
AND LEAVE THOSE FOOLS BEHIND!

00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:06.796
MY FATHER SAID HE'S BRINGING
THE WHOLE WORLD IN HERE.

00:13:06.796 --> 00:13:10.400
AND THAT MEANS I'LL NEVER
HAVE TO BE ALONE AGAIN.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.069
WE'LL BE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY!

00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:16.406
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.041
Mokuba: NOAH STOP!

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:20.043
YOU GOTTA GET A HOLD
OF YOURSELF!

00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:21.411
YOU'RE IN DANGER TOO

00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:23.880
AND WE ALL HAVE TO
WORK TOGETHER NOW!

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.815
MOKIE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:27.884
MOKUBA'S A FOOL!

00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:30.453
I JUST REMEMBERED
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE WITH US

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:32.455
TO THE REAL WORLD
WITHOUT A BODY.

00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:35.625
BUT, I BET SETO
CAN MAKE YOU A BODY!

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:38.161
I MEAN, YOU'RE
OUR FAMILY NOAH!

00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:42.031
WHY CAN'T I STOP THINKING
ABOUT THIS?!

00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:43.900
I MEAN,
AFTER ALL NOAH,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.069
WE ARE BROTHERS
AREN'T WE?

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:49.872
HE TRUSTS ME!
AFTER ALL I DID!

00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:59.382
BROTHERHOOD!? FAMILY!?
WHO NEEDS IT!

00:13:59.382 --> 00:14:01.784
THAT'S BEHIND ME!

00:14:01.784 --> 00:14:05.355
SOON MY SO-CALLED FAMILY
WILL BE GONE FOR GOOD!

00:14:05.355 --> 00:14:07.457
Computerized voice:
TWENTY-ONE MINUTES
TO SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:14:07.457 --> 00:14:09.058
EVACUATE
VIRTUAL SIMULATORS.

00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.626
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

00:14:12.562 --> 00:14:13.896
OH NO.

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:18.801
BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER,
ATTACK!

00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:24.140
NOW...
GO AXE RAIDER!

00:14:27.477 --> 00:14:29.946
Computerized voice:
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO
SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:36.285
MY BROTHER BELIEVES IN ME!
I CAN'T LET HIM DOWN!

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:38.721
I HAVE TO STOP
THAT SATELLITE!

00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:43.159
AAH! THE CONTROLS!
I CAN'T STOP THE ATTACK!

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:46.529
NO! THAT INTRUDER
MUST HAVE DONE ALL THIS!

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:48.498
NOW MOKUBA AND THE OTHERS
ARE DOOMED.

00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:50.133
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:51.834
Computerized voice:
FIFTEEN MINUTES TO
SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:53.403
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.567
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN

00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:01.569
AND SUMMON VORSE RAIDER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:07.141
HE HAS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:09.810
IT COULD BE
MORE POWERFUL THAN
MY VORSE RAIDER.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.447
BUT THEN AGAIN,
KNOWING GOZABURO,
HE'S BLUFFING.

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.416
VORSE RAIDER,
ATTACK NOW!

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.918
DESTROY HIS
FACEDOWN MONSTER!

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.875
WHAT!?!?

00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:29.818
WHY DID YOU PUT
EXODIA'S RIGHT ARM
ON THE FIELD?!

00:15:29.818 --> 00:15:31.386
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
FIND OUT!!

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:33.121
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?!

00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:35.757
NOTHING...NOW THAT
I HAVE WHAT I NEED.

00:15:35.757 --> 00:15:39.027
IT'S OVER SETO! MY MOVE!

00:15:39.027 --> 00:15:41.363
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD

00:15:41.363 --> 00:15:43.665
CONTRACT WITH EXODIA!

00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:48.070
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT CARD BEFORE!

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.638
WHAT IS THAT!?

00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:52.307
BEFORE I COULD ACTIVATE
THIS MAGIC CARD...

00:15:52.307 --> 00:15:55.277
I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT
ALL FIVE PIECES OF EXODIA

00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:57.646
WERE SENT TO
MY CARD GRAVEYARD!

00:15:57.646 --> 00:16:00.048
NEXT I'LL GIVE UP
2000 LIFE POINTS,

00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:02.885
ALLOWING ME TO SUMMON
EXODIA NECROSS!

00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:05.320
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT!?

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.525
SETO! IT'S OVER!
SO PREPARE FOR DEFEAT!

00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:12.361
MEET THE MOST FEARED CREATURE
IN DUEL MONSTERS!

00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:16.465
THE MIGHTY
EXODIA NECROSS!

00:16:16.465 --> 00:16:20.202
IT'S THE LAST MONSTER
YOU'LL EVER SEE MY BOY!

00:16:20.202 --> 00:16:22.804
I'VE WAITED YEARS
FOR THIS MOMENT!

00:16:22.804 --> 00:16:24.806
CHECKMATE SETO!

00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:26.942
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:38.086
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE...

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:39.588
EXODIA!

00:16:39.588 --> 00:16:43.425
HA HA HA! WELL SON...
ARE YOU FRIGHTENED?

00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:44.626
NOT QUITE!

00:16:44.626 --> 00:16:46.361
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR EXODIA NECROSS

00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:48.463
ONLY HAS
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:49.932
AND MY MONSTER'S
STRONGER!

00:16:49.932 --> 00:16:52.568
DON'T JUDGE A MONSTER
BY ITS COVER!

00:16:52.568 --> 00:16:54.202
HA HA HA HA!

00:16:54.202 --> 00:16:58.574
EXODIA NECROSS
MAY BE STRONGER THAN
IT APPEARS MY BOY!

00:16:58.574 --> 00:16:59.875
WATCH THIS!

00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:02.110
EXODIA NECROSS
ATTACK HIM NOW!

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.378
WHAT'S THIS!?

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:05.447
WHY IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU ATTACKING ME

00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:08.517
WITH A MONSTER
THAT IS CLEARLY WEAKER
THAN MINE, GOZABURO?!

00:17:16.358 --> 00:17:19.428
WHY IS YOUR MONSTER
STILL STANDING!?

00:17:19.428 --> 00:17:20.696
TELL ME!

00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:23.031
MY VORSE RAIDER SHOULD
HAVE DESTROYED IT!

00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.868
IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY
ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:29.871
AND IN ADDITION IT GAINS
1000 ATTACK POINTS

00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:32.941
WHENEVER IT ENGAGES
IN A BATTLE!

00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:34.443
OH NO!

00:17:34.443 --> 00:17:36.311
ARE YOU BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:38.814
THAT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN THIS DUEL?

00:17:38.814 --> 00:17:41.083
EXODIA NECROSS
IS INVINCIBLE!

00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.718
YOU'RE FINISHED MY BOY!

00:17:42.718 --> 00:17:44.720
NOT QUITE! MY MOVE!

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.222
HE MAY THINK HIS EXODIA
CAN'T BE DESTROYED,

00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:48.557
BUT HE'S MISTAKEN!

00:17:48.557 --> 00:17:50.959
I SUMMON SPIRIT RYU!

00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:55.631
ALRIGHT! SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR MONSTER!

00:17:55.631 --> 00:17:58.634
NOW I ACTIVATE MY
BURST BREATH TRAP CARD!

00:17:58.634 --> 00:18:02.504
THIS LETS ME SACRIFICE
SPIRIT RYU!

00:18:02.504 --> 00:18:04.873
WHICH DESTROYS EVERY
MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:18:04.873 --> 00:18:07.309
WITH FEWER THAN 1000
DEFENSE POINTS!

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:10.245
SO MUCH FOR YOUR EXODIA!

00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:11.546
HOLD ON!

00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:13.715
EXODIA NECROSS HAS
ZERO DEFENSE POINTS

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:15.484
SO WHY WASN'T IT
DESTROYED!?

00:18:15.484 --> 00:18:18.553
HA HA HA!
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN!

00:18:18.553 --> 00:18:21.023
MY MONSTER IS GRANTED
SPECIAL EFFECTS

00:18:21.023 --> 00:18:23.792
FROM EACH OF THE FIVE
EXODIA CARDS IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:26.328
LISTEN CAREFULLY!

00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:29.364
AS LONG AS THE LEFT LEG
IS IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:18:29.364 --> 00:18:33.035
NO MAGIC CARD CAN
DESTROY EXODIA NECROSS.

00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:35.537
EXODIA'S RIGHT LEG
PROTECTS MY CREATURE

00:18:35.537 --> 00:18:37.773
FROM ALL OF
YOUR TRAP CARDS!

00:18:37.773 --> 00:18:40.308
THE LEFT ARM IN
MY GRAVEYARD ENSURES

00:18:40.308 --> 00:18:42.310
THAT EXODIA NECROSS
IS PROTECTED FROM

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.980
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS
OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.482
EXODIA'S RIGHT ARM
ALLOWS MY CREATURE

00:18:47.482 --> 00:18:51.286
TO GAIN 1000 ATTACK POINTS
WITH EVERY BATTLE.

00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:56.291
AND FINALLY, HAVING THE HEAD
OF EXODIA IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:59.194
PROTECTS MY BEAST
FROM BEING DESTROYED

00:18:59.194 --> 00:19:02.397
BY ANY OF YOUR MONSTERS
IN BATTLE!

00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:04.099
THAT'S INSANE!

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:06.368
THE FIVE PIECES
OF EXODIA ARE
EVEN POWERFUL

00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:08.403
WHEN THEY'RE SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:19:08.403 --> 00:19:11.039
I CAN'T DESTROY
HIS EXODIA NECROSS

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.475
WITH MONSTER, MAGIC
OR TRAP CARDS!

00:19:13.475 --> 00:19:14.676
IT IS INVINCIBLE!

00:19:14.676 --> 00:19:16.712
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:19:16.712 --> 00:19:19.514
YOU MAY AS WELL GIVE UP
AND ADMIT DEFEAT!

00:19:19.514 --> 00:19:22.184
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME!

00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:25.353
I REFUSE TO BE
BEATEN BY YOU!

00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:27.355
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN

00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:30.325
AND SWITCH VORSE RAIDER
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:19:30.325 --> 00:19:33.695
Computerized voice:
WARNING. TEN MINUTES
TO SATELLITE ATTACK.

00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:37.566
EVACUATE
ALL VIRTUAL SIMULATORS NOW.

00:19:37.566 --> 00:19:39.835
Joey: LET'S FRY
DIS CREEP, YUGE!

00:19:39.835 --> 00:19:42.204
I SUMMON
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:42.204 --> 00:19:43.939
I SUMMON
ROCKET WARRIOR!

00:19:43.939 --> 00:19:47.109
Yugi:
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:48.710
Joey:
INVINCIBLE ATTACK!

00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:56.151
Noah: ATTENTION!
CAN ALL OF YOU HEAR ME!

00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:57.786
THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!

00:19:57.786 --> 00:19:58.787
I KNOW THAT VOICE!

00:19:58.787 --> 00:19:59.888
NOAH!

00:19:59.888 --> 00:20:02.257
A'RIGHT! GET DOWN HERE
YA LITTLE TWERP!

00:20:02.257 --> 00:20:05.193
Noah: THIS IS A WARNING
TO ALL OF YOU!

00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:07.629
LOOK. THE VIRTUAL WORLD
THAT YOU'RE ALL IN

00:20:07.629 --> 00:20:09.297
IS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED!

00:20:09.297 --> 00:20:11.133
OH NO! NOAH!

00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:13.702
SAY WHAT!? I KNEW
WE COULDN'T TRUST HIM,

00:20:13.702 --> 00:20:15.971
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D DESTROY THIS PLACE!

00:20:15.971 --> 00:20:17.372
DAT PUNK!

00:20:17.372 --> 00:20:19.574
I'LL GIVE HIM DA VIRTUAL
BUTT-KICKIN' OF A LIFETIME!

00:20:19.574 --> 00:20:22.043
YOU BETTER LET US
OUTTA HERE NOAH!

00:20:22.043 --> 00:20:23.945
[HOOTING]
YEAH!!

00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:25.547
NOAH...

00:20:25.547 --> 00:20:27.883
Noah: I'M SO SORRY FOR THE WAY
I TREATED YOU ALL!

00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:29.151
BUT NOW A SATELLITE

00:20:29.151 --> 00:20:30.318
IS SET TO DESTROY

00:20:30.318 --> 00:20:31.987
THE MAIN COMPUTER SYSTEM.

00:20:31.987 --> 00:20:33.655
WHEN THAT COMPUTER SHUTS DOWN,

00:20:33.655 --> 00:20:35.657
THE VIRTUAL WORLD WILL COLLAPSE!

00:20:35.657 --> 00:20:39.528
YOU MUST ESCAPE OR YOUR MINDS
WILL BE LOST FOREVER!

00:20:39.528 --> 00:20:41.596
[ALL GASPING]

00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:43.765
Computerized voice:
BEGINNING DESTRUCTION SEQUENCE.
