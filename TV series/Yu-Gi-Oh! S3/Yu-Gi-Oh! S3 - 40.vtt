00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.398
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:05.271
MARIK, I OCCUPY
YOUR BODY NOW!

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.677
I KNOW AND I'VE RETURNED
TO RECLAIM IT FROM YOU!

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:11.515
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE TOO WEAK NOW!

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.753
I TOLD YOU
YOU WERE TOO WEAK!

00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:16.191
TIME FOR ME TO BANISH
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU

00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.128
INTO THE SHADOWS
WHERE YOU BELONG.

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:19.297
Ishizu:
STOP THIS AT ONCE!

00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:21.734
SISTER, IT'S TOO LATE!

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.907
ALRIGHT,
THIS HAS GONE
FAR ENOUGH MARIK.

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:26.376
WELCOME, PHARAOH.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.048
OUR BATTLE WILL BEGIN
SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:31.219
IT'S TIME I GAVE YOU
A FIRSTHAND LOOK

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.156
AT THE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR SKILL LEVELS

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:34.758
SO STAND BACK, WHEELER!

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:36.429
I'M JUST GETTING'
WARMED UP!

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.102
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,
RETURN TO THE FIELD!

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.842
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO USE MY DRAGON
TO FINISH YOU OFF!

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:47.849
AND EXPOSE YOU AS THE FAILURE
YOU TRULY ARE!

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:53.560
♪ YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE ♪

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.464

♪ YU-GI-OH ♪

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.574
YOU WERE A FOOL
TO CHALLENGE ME, WHEELER!

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:58.013
NOW MAYBE YOU'LL REALIZE
WHAT I KNEW ALL ALONG!

00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.916
YOU ARE WORTHLESS!

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:03.123
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
IN MY TOURNAMENT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.660
NOW THEN, GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.666
'CAUSE YOU'VE WASTED
ENOUGH OF MY TIME ALREADY!

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.071
LOOK! I FINISHED
IN DA TOP 4!

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.306
AND SO DID YOU!

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:15.044
AND ONCE I WIN THIS DUEL
I'LL OUTRANK YOU!

00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:16.648
MY MOVE!

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:18.651
Joey, voice-over:
IF ONLY WINNIN'
WERE DAT EASY!

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:22.224
BUT FIRST, I GOTTA
DESTROY HIS BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:23.728
DIS CARD COULD HELP,

00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:26.466
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE LUCK
AND A LOTTA FAITH!

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:31.408
NOW, I SUMMON
BABY DRAGON
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:33.112
DAT'S ALL FOLKS!

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:35.917
ALRIGHT, JOEY'S GONNA
NEED OUR SUPPORT.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.319
SO WHERE'S YUGI?

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.156
N' TEA?

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:40.927
THEY SHOULDA BEEN
BACK BY NOW!

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.262
YEAH THAT'S NOT COOL!

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:47.705
JOEY NEEDS ALL OF US!

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.411
Yami-Yugi:
SO MARIK'S GOOD SIDE
DOES STILL EXIST!

00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:51.513
Ishizu: YES.

00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:53.416
AND HE WAS ABLE
TO CONFRONT HIS DARK SIDE

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:56.922
BY CONTROLLING TEA'S BODY.

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:59.126
BUT THE GOOD MARIK IS WEAK.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.831
AND HE'LL GROW WEAKER
WITH EVERY PASSING SECOND

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.069
UNTIL THE SHADOWS
ENGULF HIM.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.110
PLEASE, PHARAOH,
DON'T ALLOW THE EVIL WITHIN
MY BROTHER TO PROSPER.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.013
YOU CAN DESTROY IT.

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:12.852
BY DEFEATING MARIK
IN YOUR NEXT DUEL!

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:15.524
AND STOPPING HIM
FROM GAINING YOUR POWER!

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.528
I WILL.

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:19.532
THANK YOU, MY PHARAOH.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.601
I KNOW THAT
YOU WILL PREVAIL.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:22.803
YOU HAVE TO.

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:26.745
OTHERWISE
THE WORLD WILL CRUMBLE.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.514
ISHIZU'S RIGHT!

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.188
YES, IF WE ARE VICTORIOUS
AGAINST MARIK'S DARK SIDE,

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:35.193
WE'LL GAIN ALL 3
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:37.831
BUT IF WE LOSE,
THEY'RE HIS!

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:40.437
AND HE'LL ALSO GET
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:43.776
GIVING HIM
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS
TO ABSORB YOUR POWER!

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:45.212
I PROMISE YOU,

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:48.586
I SHALL SAVE THE WORLD
FROM MARIK'S EVIL, ISHIZU!

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:51.057
AND SAVE YOUR BROTHER
FROM HIMSELF.

00:03:51.057 --> 00:03:52.559
I JUST HOPE
THAT DEFEATING HIM

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.197
WILL ALSO REVERSE
THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE.

00:03:55.197 --> 00:03:57.201
SO DO I.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.481
TEA!

00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.318
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:07.487
WHY AM I UP HERE?

00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:09.190
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.563
YEAH, BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW I GOT HERE.

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:15.902
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
IS WATCHING JOEY DUEL KAIBA.

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:20.511
Kaiba: MY BLUE-EYES IS READY
TO DEVOUR YOU, WHEELER!

00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.415
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD!

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:25.921
YEAH, JOEY'S LIFE POINTS
MAY BE PROTECTED RIGHT NOW,

00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.559
BUT NONE OF HIS MONSTERS
ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK!

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.735
HE BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING, AND QUICK!

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:36.106
TIME TO ERASE WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:38.545
WIT WHAT!?
WITH THIS WHEELER!

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.814
STOP DEFENSE!

00:04:39.814 --> 00:04:43.287
SWITCHING YOUR KNIGHT
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:44.890
HE'S WIDE OPEN NOW!

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.127
YES! NOW SETO'S GONNA WIN!

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:49.331
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.905
WIPE OUT JOEY'S KNIGHT
AND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:05.428
IT'S OVER!

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:09.368
I TOLD YOU,
YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE!

00:05:09.368 --> 00:05:11.873
DON' BE SO SURE!

00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:12.875
WATCH DIS!

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.246
NOW REVEAL TRAP CARD!

00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:16.381
OH NO!

00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:17.884
YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.454
MEET NUTRIENT Z!

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:22.659
IT WORKS WHENEVER
I'M ABOUT TO LOSE 2,000
OR MORE LIFE POINTS!

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.232
IT GIVES MY STRENGTH
A 4,000-POINT BOOST

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:28.103
BEFORE YOUR ATTACK HITS!

00:05:28.103 --> 00:05:29.172
AWESOME!!

00:05:29.172 --> 00:05:30.875
PRETTY SWIFT THINKING
THERE, JOEY!

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:34.214
YEAH! NOW YOU HAVE
MORE LIFE POINTS
THAN KAIBA DOES!

00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:36.585
SO WHAT WAS DAT
YOU'RE WERE SAYIN'
ABOUT ME?

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:39.458
I SAID YOU'RE AN AMATEUR!

00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:42.496
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:45.969
MAKING ONE DECENT MOVE
DOESN'T IMPRESS ME, WHEELER.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.513
THE NEXT TURN
WILL BE YOUR LAST!

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:53.150
Wheeler, voice-over:
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.419
BUT I KNOW
I CAN BEAT KAIBA

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.155
AND SHUT HIM UP FOR GOOD!

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.928
I JUST NEED TA DRAW
DA RIGHT CARD.

00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:02.333
AND IF I DON'T, HE WINS!

00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:09.045
A'RIGHT! MY MOVE!

00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:12.318
Joey, voice-over:
ONLY ONE CARD
CAN SAVE ME!

00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:13.720
JACKPOT!!!!!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.457
READ IT AND WEEP, KAIBA!

00:06:15.457 --> 00:06:18.496
I PLAY TIME WIZARD!

00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:20.833
YOUR PLAN WILL NEVER WORK!

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:21.902
OH NO?

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:23.806
WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT DAT WON'T WE?!

00:06:23.806 --> 00:06:26.010
I STILL GOT
ONE MORE CHANCE
TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.221
SO, TIME WIZARD, GO!

00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:33.557
Joey, voice-over:
IF DIS WORKS,

00:06:33.557 --> 00:06:34.793
KAIBA'S BLUE-EYES
WILL CRUMBLE

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:37.765
WHILE MY DRAGON GROWS!

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:39.435
IT'S TOO RISKY!

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:41.639
JOEY COULD LOSE
ALL HIS MONSTERS!

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.981
Mokuba, voice-over:
AND SETO COULD LOSE
HIS BLUE-EYES!

00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.051
Joey, voice-over: COME ON!

00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:50.088
Tristan, voice-over:
NO SKULLS, BABY! NO SKULLS!

00:06:50.088 --> 00:06:52.960
Kaiba, voice-over:
HE'S FINISHED!

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.998
Joey, voice-over: NO! NO!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.066
YES!!!

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:58.604
A'RIGHT!
IN YOUR FACE!

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:02.277
DANKS TO MY TIME WIZARD,
DA CALENDAR IS SPEEDIN' UP,

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:05.116
CAUSING MY BABY DRAGON
TO AGE A THOUSAND YEARS!

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:07.921
AND WITH AGE
COMES EXPERIENCE!

00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:10.126
THEY GROW UP SO FAST
DON'T THEY?

00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:12.363
BUT THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN YOU GOTTA LET GO!

00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:14.701
SO, GOOD-BYE, BABY DRAGON,

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:21.814
HELLO, THOUSAND DRAGON!

00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:23.116
THAT'S TOO BAD!

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:25.954
I GUESS TIME JUST WASN'T
ON YOUR SIDE, KAIBA!

00:07:25.954 --> 00:07:31.965
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT A THOUSAND YEARS
DOES TO YOUR DRAGON!

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:34.070
Kaiba, voice-over:
IF HE THINKS
HE CAN WIN THE DUEL

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.873
WITH THIS LITTLE STUNT,

00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:41.517
HE'S MORE OF A NOVICE
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:43.353
I DID IT?

00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:44.756
ALL RIGHT!

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.428
LOOKS LIKE TIME
TOOK ITS TOLL
ON KAIBA'S BLUE-EYES!

00:07:47.428 --> 00:07:49.799
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK
AT THE FIELD, WHEELER!

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:56.846
NOW BLUE-EYES,
RETURN TO ME!

00:07:56.846 --> 00:07:58.081
SAY WHAAAAAT?

00:07:58.081 --> 00:07:59.183
OH, MAN!

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:00.419
NO WAY!

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:01.955
OL' BLUE EYES IS BACK!

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:06.497
THANKS TO MY INTERDIMENSIONAL
MATTER TRANSPORTER,

00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:11.272
MY MONSTER DEMATERIALIZED
JUST BEFORE YOUR TIME WIZARD
WAS ABLE TO AFFECT IT.

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:12.909
AND NOW HE'S BACK!

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:17.416
JUST IN TIME TO TEAR
YOUR THOUSAND DRAGON
TO SHREDS, WHEELER!

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:19.154
EXCELLENT MOVE, SETO!!

00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:20.122
THAT'S NUTS!

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.691
JOEY HAD THIS DUEL WON!

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:24.429
YOU MAY DEPEND ON LUCK
TO WIN YOUR DUELS,

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:26.500
BUT I DEPEND ON MY SKILLS.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.869
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US!

00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:31.510
[LAUGHING]

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.380
YOU REALLY KILL ME,
YA KNOW DAT?

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.584
YOU'VE LOST IT.

00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:36.853
WRONG.

00:08:36.853 --> 00:08:38.757
I JUST FIND YOU
RIDICULOUS!

00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:39.859
COME ON!

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:41.261
I MEAN
LIGHTEN UP, MAN!

00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.133
LOOK, YOU AND I
ARE FIGHTIN' A GREAT
DUEL RIGHT HERE.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:46.103
SO RELAX AND HAVE FUN!

00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:47.539
I DON'T HAVE FUN!

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:50.212
DEN I GUESS
YOU'RE AN EVEN MORE
MISERABLE PERSON

00:08:50.212 --> 00:08:51.948
DEN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE, KAIBA!

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.619
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:56.890
I DUEL TO GAIN POWER
AND TO BE THE BEST

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.560
NOT TO HAVE FUN!

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.496
BUT WHEN YUGI BEAT ME,

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:07.509
HE STOLE MY GLORY
ONCE AGAIN!

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.949
YOU WERE GOOD,
BUT YUGI WAS BETTA.

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:13.287
I JUST DON'T SEE
WHY YOU CAN'T
ACCEPT DAT!

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:16.660
I WOULDN'T EXPECT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.063
WHAT'S DAT MEAN!?

00:09:18.063 --> 00:09:19.966
LET'S JUST MOVE ON,
WHEELER!

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:23.806
MY MOVE! NOW!

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.910
I'LL DISCARD
MY THUNDER DRAGON

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.716
IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:32.023
THIS LETS ME DRAW
TWO MORE THUNDER DRAGONS!

00:09:32.023 --> 00:09:35.194
THEN I'LL USE POLYMERIZATION
TO FUSE THEM TOGETHER!

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.376
NOW, MEET MY TWIN-HEADED
THUNDER DRAGON!

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.300
NEXT I PLAY QUICK ATTACK!

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.438
THIS CARD ALLOWS
MY NEW MONSTER

00:09:58.438 --> 00:10:01.911
TO ATTACK YOU
IMMEDIATELY!

00:10:01.911 --> 00:10:04.148
YOU HAVE NO CHANCE
AGAINST MY DRAGONS!

00:10:04.148 --> 00:10:07.154
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:13.060
THANKS, YUGI.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.799
I'M STILL A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT
ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:18.337
I MEAN, I NEVER SLEEPWALK.

00:10:18.337 --> 00:10:20.274
ESPECIALLY
NOT DURING THE DAY,

00:10:20.274 --> 00:10:21.843
AND FOR OVER A MILE!?

00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:23.781
Yugi, voice-over:
MAYBE I SHOULD TELL TEA

00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:25.183
THAT MARIK TOOK OVER HER MIND

00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:27.354
SO HE COULD CONFRONT
HIS EVIL SIDE!?

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:29.792
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE NOT.

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.363
HEY, WAIT,

00:10:32.363 --> 00:10:35.302
DID JOEY EVER FINISH HIS DUEL
AGAINST KAIBA OR WHAT?

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:39.409
NO. I LEFT WHILE THE DUEL
WAS STILL IN PROGRESS!

00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:44.084
IF WE HURRY
WE SHOULD GET THERE
BEFORE IT ENDS!

00:10:44.084 --> 00:10:47.057
I'D NEVER LET
A HACK LIKE YOU
DEFEAT ME!

00:10:47.057 --> 00:10:49.027
TWIN-HEADED THUNDER DRAGON,

00:10:49.027 --> 00:10:52.033
ATTACK HIS
THOUSAND DRAGON NOW!!

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.714
HE'S MY LAST HOPE!

00:11:07.795 --> 00:11:10.132
NOW FOR YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:11:10.132 --> 00:11:11.870
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.879
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY
AND WIPE HIM OUT!

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:18.949
LOOKS LIKE I WIN!

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:21.955
Joey, voice-over:
I GUESS DIS IS IT!

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:37.017
THAT'S RIGHT!
BOW DOWN IN DEFEAT!

00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:38.519
YOU DID IT, SETO!

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:40.823
HEY, JOEY, YOU DID OK

00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:44.230
BUT YOU'RE STILL NO MATCH
FOR MY BROTHER,
RIGHT, SETO!?

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.504
OUT-DUELING JOEY WHEELER
IS NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION.

00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:50.508
I COULD HAVE BEATEN HIM
BLINDFOLDED.

00:11:50.508 --> 00:11:53.514
WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME.

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.618
HOLD ON, KAIBA!

00:11:55.618 --> 00:11:57.120
RE-LAX.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.562
WHEELER, CAN'T YOU JUST
LET IT GO, IT'S OVER.

00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:04.567
NO! IT'S NOT OVER, KAIBA!

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:07.105
IT'S NEVER OVER.

00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:08.976
NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY.

00:12:08.976 --> 00:12:11.413
YOU MAY HAVE BEATEN ME
IN DIS DUEL,

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:13.951
AND YOU MAY EVEN BEAT ME
IN THE NEXT DUEL, TOO,

00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:17.424
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP COMIN' BACK
UNTIL I WIN, KAIBA!

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:20.464
DAT'S CAUSE JOEY WHEELER
DOESN'T GIVE UP!

00:12:20.464 --> 00:12:23.837
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE THE SKILLS
TO DEFEAT ME.

00:12:23.837 --> 00:12:25.039
OH, YEAH!?

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:27.443
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME SKILLS,
YA STUCK UP PUNK!

00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:28.946
Tristan:
FORGET HIM, JOEY!

00:12:28.946 --> 00:12:30.916
Duke: YEAH, HE'S NOT
WORTH THE EFFORT, MAN!

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.552
YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT!

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.790
I DUELED MY BEST OUT THERE!

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.796
AND I MADE DAT RICH BOY
SWEAT A FEW TIMES, TOO!

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:39.298
YEAH, LET'S GO!

00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:41.770
HEY, COME TA THINK OF IT,
WHERE'S YUGI AND TEA?

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.673
THEY DIDN'T STICK AROUND
TA SEE MY BIG FINISH?

00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:44.675
DAT'S NOT COOL!

00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:46.812
LET'S GO, MOKUBA.

00:12:46.812 --> 00:12:50.052
THERE'S NO REASON
TO STICK AROUND
THIS DUMP ANYMORE!

00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:54.226
Mokuba: BUT THERE'S
STILL ONE MORE DUEL!

00:12:54.226 --> 00:12:56.230
Kaiba: WHAT DO YOU WANT,
ISHIZU!?

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.300
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
TO BE PRESENT

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.139
FOR THE FINAL DUEL
OF YOUR TOURNAMENT,
KAIBA.

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:02.542
YUGI WILL NEED
YOUR HELP

00:13:02.542 --> 00:13:04.813
TO DEFEAT MARIK
AND FULFILL
HIS DESTINY.

00:13:04.813 --> 00:13:08.753
NO THANKS, AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED I'M DONE.

00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:10.890
BATTLE CITY'S OVER FOR ME

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.996
AND THE SOONER
I PUT THIS ALL BEHIND ME
THE BETTER.

00:13:13.996 --> 00:13:16.501
I'VE HAD ABOUT ALL
I CAN TAKE OF YOU PEOPLE.

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:19.272
SO LEAVE ME ALONE
AND HAVE A NICE LIFE.

00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:21.176
KAIBA, WAIT!

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.814
WALKING AWAY NOW
IS A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:13:23.814 --> 00:13:27.154
REALLY?
AND WHY IS THAT, ISHIZU?

00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:28.824
LET ME GUESS,
YOU READ ABOUT IT

00:13:28.824 --> 00:13:30.760
IN ONE OF YOUR
ANCIENT FAIRY TALES?

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.764
COME ON, MOKUBA!

00:13:32.764 --> 00:13:37.840
YOUR FUTURE'S AT STAKE!

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.581
AND DEEP DOWN YOU KNOW THAT
AS WELL AS I DO, RIGHT?

00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:44.920
I KNOW YOU ARE ABLE
TO READ THE ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN TEXT.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.293
AND YOU'RE WELL AWARE
OF WHAT IS WRITTEN
ON THE STONE.

00:13:48.293 --> 00:13:50.899
THE SORCERER MAY HAVE BEEN
THE PHARAOH'S RIVAL,

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:53.068
BUT HE WAS ALSO HIS FRIEND!

00:13:53.068 --> 00:13:56.041
THE SORCERER IS YOU, KAIBA.

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:57.610
AND YOU MUST DO FOR YUGI

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.650
WHAT YOU DID FOR THE PHARAOH
5,000 YEARS AGO--

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.587
HELP YOUR FRIEND!

00:14:02.587 --> 00:14:05.725
WITHOUT YOU
HE CAN'T SAVE THE WORLD
FROM DESTRUCTION!

00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:07.429
GOOD-BYE.

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:11.436
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT
IF YOU CONTINUE TO DENY
YOUR ANCIENT HERITAGE,

00:14:11.436 --> 00:14:15.444
THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL SUFFER BECAUSE
OF YOUR STUBBORNNESS!

00:14:15.444 --> 00:14:21.689
YOUR RIVALRY WITH YUGI
HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS!

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:25.629
AND IT WILL CONTINUE
TO EXIST FOR ETERNITY!

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:29.202
AS A SKILLED SORCERER,
YOU CONSTANTLY
CHALLENGED THE PHARAOH,

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.340
STRENGTHENING
HIS SKILLS IN BATTLE.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.943
AND IT WAS
WITH YOUR HELP

00:14:32.943 --> 00:14:36.350
THAT THE PHARAOH
WAS ABLE TO SAVE
HIS PEOPLE.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.488
HISTORY IS NOW
REPEATING ITSELF, KAIBA.

00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:41.325
YUGI NEEDS YOU!

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:43.663
THAT'S ENOUGH, ISHIZU!

00:14:43.663 --> 00:14:45.232
I HOSTED THIS TOURNAMENT

00:14:45.232 --> 00:14:46.936
SO I COULD BECOME
NUMBER ONE!

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:48.805
NOT TO HELP YUGI!

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.141
WRONG.

00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.913
YOU WERE DESTINED
TO ORGANIZE
THIS EVENT, KAIBA!

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:55.251
AND YOU HAD
NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER!

00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:58.256
YOU WERE GUIDED BY
A FORCE BEYOND
YOUR CONTROL.

00:14:58.256 --> 00:15:02.231
AND IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
YOU'LL BE TURNING
YOUR BACK ON MANKIND!

00:15:06.237 --> 00:15:08.575
Kaiba: THAT DUEL TOWER
STANDS AS A SYMBOL

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.479
OF MY HATRED FOR MY FATHER!

00:15:10.479 --> 00:15:13.083
I CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF IT, ISHIZU!!

00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:14.085
I SEE.

00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:15.321
THAT'S WHY YOU MUST GO?

00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:17.291
TO RUN AWAY
FROM YOUR FATHER!?

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.662
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT THIS IS ABOUT MORE

00:15:19.662 --> 00:15:21.967
THAN JUST YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY, KAIBA!?

00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:23.035
NO!

00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:25.540
I DESIGNED
THIS WHOLE TOURNAMENT!

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.512
AND I WAS ROBBED
OF MY VICTORY!

00:15:28.512 --> 00:15:30.682
BUT I CAN STILL
BURY MY PAST

00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:33.522
BY DESTROYING
THAT DUEL TOWER!

00:15:33.522 --> 00:15:36.693
MOKUBA,
PREPARE FOR DETONATION!

00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:38.931
MOKUBA! DID YOU HEAR ME?

00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:40.501
I HEARD YOU,

00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:43.106
BUT I DON'T THINK
DESTROYING THE TOWER'S
GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

00:15:43.106 --> 00:15:45.277
ALL IT'S GONNA DO IS
CAUSE MORE DESTRUCTION,

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.180
MORE ANGER,
AND MORE HATRED.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.250
MOKUBA...

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.223
I THINK WHAT YUGI SAID
ABOUT YOU IS RIGHT!

00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:53.892
YOU'RE FILLED WITH HATE!

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:58.134
Yami-Yugi: YOU BATTLE
FOR ALL THE WRONG
REASONS, KAIBA!

00:15:58.134 --> 00:15:59.803
FUELED BY YOUR ANGER,

00:15:59.803 --> 00:16:02.041
YOUR HATE,
YOUR JEALOUSY,

00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:06.649
YOUR RAGE, AND LASTLY,
THE DENIAL OF YOUR PAST!

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:09.421
AND YOU'LL NEVER
BE A SUCCESS, KAIBA,

00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:12.460
UNTIL YOU DEFEAT
THE MONSTERS INSIDE
YOUR HEART!

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.033
[LAUGHING]

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.804
YOU REALLY KILL ME,
YA KNOW DAT?

00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:20.809
YOU'VE LOST IT.

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:21.878
WRONG.

00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:23.313
I JUST FIND YOU
RIDICULOUS!

00:16:23.313 --> 00:16:24.382
COME ON!

00:16:24.382 --> 00:16:25.952
I MEAN LIGHTEN UP,
MAN!

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:29.157
LOOK, YOU AND I
ARE FIGHTIN' A GREAT
DUEL RIGHT HERE.

00:16:29.157 --> 00:16:31.095
SO RELAX AND HAVE FUN!

00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:33.366
WHY DON'T YOU SMILE ANYMORE!?

00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:35.236
I KNOW OUR CHILDHOOD
WASN'T THE BEST

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:37.707
BUT AT LEAST
WE HAD FUN SOMETIMES!

00:16:37.707 --> 00:16:39.845
AND NOW YOU'RE ALWAYS
IN A BAD MOOD!

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:41.614
AND I WANT IT BACK
THE WAY IT WAS!

00:16:41.614 --> 00:16:43.050
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.087
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE!

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.490
YOU CAN CHANGE!

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.160
INSTEAD OF CAUSING
MORE DAMAGE

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.429
WHY DON'T YOU
HELP YUGI WIN

00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:51.399
AND PREVENT MORE DAMAGE?

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:56.542
IF YOU KNOW THE SECRET
TO DEFEATING MARIK,
THEN TELL YUGI!

00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:59.414
Kaiba, voice-over:
HOW CAN I HELP YUGI
WIN MY TOURNAMENT!?

00:16:59.414 --> 00:17:05.325
THE REASON I ORGANIZED
THE BATTLE CITY TOURNAMENT
WAS SO I COULD DEFEAT HIM!

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:08.698
Joey:
WELL, LOOK WHO FINALLY
DECIDED TO SHOW UP!

00:17:08.698 --> 00:17:10.068
Tea: IS YOUR DUEL OVER?

00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:11.837
YES IT'S OVER!

00:17:11.837 --> 00:17:14.943
WHAT'S DA BIG IDEA
WALKIN' OUT ON ME
WHEN I NEEDED YA?!

00:17:14.943 --> 00:17:17.081
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU THINK, JOEY.

00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:18.650
Tristan:
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, GUYS.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.486
JOEY GOT HIS BUTT KICKED.

00:17:20.486 --> 00:17:24.127
THE ONLY THING YOU MISSED
WAS SEEING KAIBA
MAKE THE POOR GUY SQUIRM.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:28.301
AWWWW, JOEY,
YOU LOST YOUR DUEL?

00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:30.238
YESSSSSSIR!

00:17:30.238 --> 00:17:34.178
COME ON, TRISTAN,
JOEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB!

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:37.318
KAIBA JUST DID
A MUCH BETTER JOB
THAT'S ALL!

00:17:37.318 --> 00:17:38.987
YOU'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME.

00:17:38.987 --> 00:17:40.758
OR THE TIME AFTER THAT.

00:17:40.758 --> 00:17:42.060
Joey: LOOK,
CAN WE JUST DROP IT!?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.064
LET'S ALL FOCUS ON YUGI,
A'RIGHT?

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.967
HE'S ABOUT TO FIGHT
DA DUEL OF HIS LIFE

00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:48.973
AGAINST DAT EVIL FREAK,
MARIK!

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.959
Marik, voice-over:
SOON ALL 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
WILL BELONG TO ME,

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.965
AND THE WORLD WILL COWER
AT MY FEET!

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:08.609
AH! THE PHARAOH HAS ARRIVED!

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:11.648
HE'LL SOON LEARN
WHAT SUFFERING
IS ALL ABOUT,

00:18:11.648 --> 00:18:14.887
AS HE JOINS HIS FRIENDS
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:19.329
AND BEFORE LONG
THE BOUNDLESS POWER
OF THE ANCIENT RULER

00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:21.600
WILL COURSE
THROUGH MY VEINS!

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.474
[LAUGHING]

00:18:25.474 --> 00:18:26.642
MARIK!

00:18:26.642 --> 00:18:29.047
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE
MESSIN' WIT!

00:18:29.047 --> 00:18:31.051
JUST BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE, YUGE.

00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:38.866
AND REMEMBER,
DIS NUTCASE PLAYS BY
HIS OWN RULES.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.003
YEAH, JUST THINK A' MAI.

00:18:41.003 --> 00:18:43.574
HAVIN' HER
IN DA SHADOW REALM'S
BAD ENOUGH.

00:18:43.574 --> 00:18:45.512
BUT IF YOU BEAT
DIS FREAK, YUGI,

00:18:45.512 --> 00:18:48.550
YOU'LL SAVE MAI--
NOT TO MENTION
THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.387
I'LL DO MY BEST.

00:18:50.387 --> 00:18:53.559
Marik, voice-over:
THAT FOOL THINKS HAVING
TWO EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.463
WILL GIVE HIM THE ADVANTAGE.

00:18:55.463 --> 00:18:57.801
BUT EVEN SLIFER
AND OBELISK TOGETHER

00:18:57.801 --> 00:19:00.807
ARE NO MATCH FOR
MY WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:09.355
I'M AFRAID YUGI'S CHANCES
OF DEFEATING MARIK

00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:11.326
AND WINNING THE TOURNAMENT
ARE SLIM.

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:12.862
MARIK'S TOO TOUGH.

00:19:12.862 --> 00:19:14.866
BUT AS MOKUBA SAID,
I'VE FIGURED OUT

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:17.838
THE ONLY WAY TO BEAT
HIS WINGED DRAGON OF RA!

00:19:17.838 --> 00:19:19.308
THERE'S ONE CARD.

00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:21.779
JUST ONE THAT CAN DO IT!

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:27.388
THIS ALL-POWERFUL CARD
LIVES IN MY DECK
AND MY DECK ALONE!

00:19:27.388 --> 00:19:30.361
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER
OF HOLDING THIS CARD.

00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:32.298
IT HAS TO BE PLAYED
IN A CERTAIN WAY

00:19:32.298 --> 00:19:34.134
IN ORDER TO TAKE DOWN RA.

00:19:34.134 --> 00:19:36.672
HEY! WHERE YA GOIN'!?

00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:41.849
TO THE TOP OF MY DUEL TOWER.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.821
Mokuba: DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE GONNA HELP YUGI
WIN, SETO!?

00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:50.231
JUST FOLLOW ME.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.235
Kaiba, voice-over:
I COULD JUST STAND BY

00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:55.140
AND WATCH YUGI FALL
AT THE HANDS OF MARIK.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.413
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I'D ENJOY SEEING
YUGI LOSE.

00:19:58.413 --> 00:19:59.916
BUT IT MIGHT
BE INTERESTING

00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:01.419
TO SEE IF HE HAS
WHAT IT TAKES

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:06.528
TO PROPERLY
USE THIS CARD.

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:09.534
Ishizu: I HOPE
YOU'VE MADE THE CORRECT
DECISION, KAIBA.

00:20:15.044 --> 00:20:17.849
RAISE THE PLATFORM!

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.920
THE FINAL DUEL
OF THE BATTLE CITY
TOURNAMENT

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.458
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.530
Kaiba: HOLD ON, YUGI!

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.369
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED!

00:20:28.369 --> 00:20:29.471
Yami-Yugi: REALLY?

00:20:29.471 --> 00:20:32.877
AND WHAT'S THAT, KAIBA!?

00:20:32.877 --> 00:20:37.319
TAKE THIS!

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.191
Kaiba, voice-over:
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE TEST
OF YUGI'S SKILL.

00:20:40.191 --> 00:20:42.374
IF HE PLAYS THIS CARD CORRECTLY,

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:45.143
THERE'S A SLIGHT CHANCE
HE'LL DEFEAT MARIK.

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.711
IF NOT, IT'S ALL OVER!
