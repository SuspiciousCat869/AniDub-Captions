00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:04.411
GREETING, DUELISTS.

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.183
IDENTIFY YOURSELF!

00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:07.620
THE NAME IS NOAH.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.825
WHAT IS IT YOU
WANT FROM US, NOAH?

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.630
Noah: EVERYTHING
WILL BE MADE CLEAR.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.535
JUST CONTINUE TO
THE END THE HALLWAY

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.540
WHERE MY ASSOCIATES
WILL GREET YOU.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.144
IT CAN'T BE!

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.419
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WE'D BE BACK, SETO KAIBA.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.822
THESE ARE
THE 5 CREEPS

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.226
THAT TRIED TO
GET RID OF SETO

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:24.730
AND TAKE OVER
KAIBA CORP!

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.470
WE'VE DEVISED A NEW
GAME WITH NOAH'S HELP.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.843
A VIRTUAL DUEL
MONSTERS TOURNAMENT.

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:32.517

I'M GANSLEY, FOUNDING

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.710
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN
THIS DUEL.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.551
KURIBOH IS NOW

YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:55.509
AND IF I WIN,

COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH OUR
DECK MASTER DUELING SYSTEM!

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.664
Yugi: I'M
A FAST LEARNER!

00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:10.201
AND YOU HAVEN'T
WON YOUR FREEDOM

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.872
FROM THIS PLACE YET!

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:14.579
DON'T THREATEN ME,
YOU LITTLE WHIPPERSNAPPER!

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:15.782
YOU'RE WEAK!

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:17.553
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES!

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:20.461
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT IN
THE DUELING BUSINESS, KID!

00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.399
SO JUST GIVE UP NOW

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.939
AND LET ME TAKE
CONTROL OF YOUR BODY...

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.451
THEN I CAN FINALLY ESCAPE
FROM THIS VIRTUAL NIGHTMARE!

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:31.121
NOT IF YOU LOSE.

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:32.993
YOU TALK A BIG GAME,

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:36.001
BUT YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD TO PROTECT YOU!

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:39.042
LEAVING YOU WIDE OPEN
FOR AN ATTACK...

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:40.445
A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:42.417
OBNOXIOUS CELTIC

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.368
NOT BAD, YUGI...

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.843
YOU CLAIM TO BE
A SUCCESSFUL MAN
OF BUSINESS,

00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:55.016
YET YOU'VE ALLOWED
YOUR COMPETITION

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:56.620
TO GET THE BEST OF YOU!

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.957
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:57.957 --> 00:02:59.561
WELL, NOT QUITE.

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.065
ON THE CONTRARY,

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:04.073
I LED YOU TO DO EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED YOU TO!

00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:07.448

BUT HOW CAN YOU
SUMMON A MONSTER

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.929
IF MY TURN'S
NOT OVER?

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.834
SIMPLE--RUKLAMBA
IS ONE OF MY

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:16.905
MORE PROFITABLE
INVESTMENTS.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.610
WITH THIS CARD
IN MY DECK,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.550
EVERY TIME I LOSE 1,000
OR MORE LIFE POINTS

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.725
I GAIN THE ABILITY TO SUMMON
ANOTHER ONE TO THE FIELD...

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.132
STRENGTHENING MY
STAFF OF WORKERS!

00:03:27.132 --> 00:03:29.103
SO, WHAT WAS THAT
YOU WERE SAYING

00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:30.941
ABOUT MY SUCCESS
IN BUSINESS?

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.045
LOOKS LIKE I'M STILL

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.551
ONE STEP AHEAD OF MY
COMPETITION, YUGI,

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:36.991
WITH PLENTY OF
MONSTERS LEFT!

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.464
IT'S NOT HOW MANY
MONSTERS YOU HAVE...

00:03:39.464 --> 00:03:42.739
IT'S HOW SKILLFULLY YOU
USE THEM THAT COUNTS.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.212
I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
A LONG TIME,

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:47.284
AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A LARGE LABOR FORCE.

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:51.194
THAT GAVE ME THE FREEDOM
TO FIRE WHOMEVER I WANTED,

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:53.500
FOR THERE WAS ALWAYS
ANOTHER EMPLOYEE

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.472
WHO COULD PICK UP
THE SLACK.

00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:57.109
AND THAT'S
HOW I DUEL!

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.847
IF ONE MONSTER
HAS TO GO,

00:03:58.847 --> 00:04:01.085
I HAVE ANOTHER TO
TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:02.423
THAT'S JUST SAD.

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:03.659
HA.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.348
I'M GLAD I HIRED YOU TO
DO MY DIRTY WORK, GANSLEY.

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.754
NOW TO CHECK
ON THE OTHER FOOLS.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.993
HOW DOES THAT FEEL
TO BE ALL ALONE

00:04:16.993 --> 00:04:18.697
IN MY VIRTUAL UNIVERSE

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:22.174
JUST WAITING TO LOSE YOUR MIND?

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.685
LOOKS LIKE TEA'S MET
MY HITOTSU-ME GIANTS!

00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:30.127
AND THESE TWO THINK THEY
CAN ACTUALLY ESCAPE!

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:31.163
Tristan:
COME ON!

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:32.333
CHOP LIKE
YOU MEAN IT!

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.238
Noah: AND I SEE
THE KAIBA BROTHERS

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:36.243
HAVE HAD A LITTLE RUN-IN
WITH THEIR PAST.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:37.479
Mokuba: I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.320
I WAS HOPING I'D NEVER HAVE
TO SEE THIS PLACE AGAIN.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.656
I TOLD YOU, MOKUBA,

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.263
THIS ORPHANAGE IS JUST
A VIRTUAL ILLUSION

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:45.701
AND NOTHING MORE!

00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:48.106
WELL, IT STILL BRINGS
BACK BAD MEMORIES!

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:50.279
WHY DID WE GET
SENT THERE ANYWAY?

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.184
Kaiba: AFTER OUR
PARENTS DISAPPEARED,

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:54.456
THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT
TO TAKE CARE OF US.

00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:55.960
SO, WE GOT DUMPED OFF HERE

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.898
UNTIL THEY COULD FIND
ANOTHER FAMILY

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:59.135
TO TAKE US IN.

00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:00.337
Mokuba: WELL, I'LL
NEVER FORGET THE DAY

00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:01.742
WE FIRST SAW THIS PLACE.

00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:04.215
IT WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:05.417
Man: WELCOME, BOYS.

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:06.420
Both: HUH?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.923
SOMEONE'S HERE,
SETO.

00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:11.065
MOKUBA,
THAT'S US!

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:14.106
SOMEHOW NOAH WAS ABLE
TO TAP INTO OUR MEMORIES

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:17.381
AND DIGITALLY REPLAY
EVENTS FROM OUR PAST!

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.119
Noah: VERY PERCEPTIVE!

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.626
NOW, ENJOY THE TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE!

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:22.662
HUH?

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:23.932
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:24.934
I REMEMBER NOW.

00:05:24.934 --> 00:05:26.304
ON OUR FIRST
DAY HERE,

00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:28.777
I SAT IN THAT
SWING ALL DAY.

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:30.816
BUT HOW COULD NOAH
HAVE KNOWN THAT?

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:33.055
I WAS ALONE
THE ENTIRE TIME.

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:35.795
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO
SAW ME THERE WAS SETO!

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.700
ACTUALLY, SETO
WAS THE ONLY ONE

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.605
WHO EVEN CARED ABOUT ME.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.641
HEY, MOKIE!

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:42.312
HEY, SETO.

00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:43.582
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS OUT HERE?

00:05:43.582 --> 00:05:44.986
LUCKY GUESS.

00:05:44.986 --> 00:05:46.924
LOOK, PAL,
CHEER UP!

00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:49.398
WE GOT TO MAKE
THE MOST OF THIS PLACE.

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:50.901
COME ON, MOKIE,

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.706
LET'S TAKE
A LITTLE WALK.

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:55.914
OK, SPILL IT.

00:05:55.914 --> 00:05:57.351
WHAT'S ON
YOUR MIND?

00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:59.690
I MISS MOM AND DAD.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.664
I WISH THAT THEY WERE
HERE WITH US RIGHT NOW.

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:07.377
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THEY
LEFT US HERE ALL ALONE.

00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:08.780
COME ON...

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.083
NO CRYING.

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:12.490
TEARS AREN'T GONNA
HELP US NOW.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.927
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY YOU AND I

00:06:13.927 --> 00:06:15.765
ARE GONNA GET
THROUGH ALL THIS.

00:06:15.765 --> 00:06:17.670
WE'VE GOT TO GET TOUGH!

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.878
EMOTIONS WILL ONLY GET IN
THE WAY OF OUR SURVIVAL...

00:06:20.878 --> 00:06:22.716
TOUGH...

THAT'S RIGHT...

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:27.461
DON'T EXPECT ANYONE ELSE
TO HELP US EVER AGAIN...

00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:29.968
YOU AND I ARE
ON OUR OWN NOW.

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:33.711

WAS YOUR IDEA
OF A PEP TALK.

WELL, ALMOST.

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:58.976
OH, YEAH?

00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:00.914
NAME ONE PERSON
WHO'S BETTER AT
CHESS THAN YOU!

00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:02.551
YOU, IF YOU JUST
CONCENTRATE.

00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:03.854
FINE,
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:06.862
Noah: THESE VISIONS MUST
BE PAINFUL TO WATCH.

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:11.007
I BET SETO KAIBA NEVER
EXPERIENCED VIRTUAL SOFTWARE

00:07:11.007 --> 00:07:13.914
THAT INTERACTS WITH
A PERSON'S MEMORY!

00:07:13.914 --> 00:07:15.150
IT'S JUST WHAT I NEED

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.423
TO DESTROY HIM
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:07:17.423 --> 00:07:19.428
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS DAY

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:22.503
FOR WHAT FEELS
LIKE AN ETERNITY.

00:07:22.503 --> 00:07:25.076
HIS EMPIRE WILL BE MINE!

00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:28.451
KEEP WATCHING
YOUR PAST, SETO.

00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:29.921
YOUR MOVE,
MOKIE.

00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.726
OK, I'LL GO HERE.

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:32.829
HMM.

00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:34.868
Man: AND HE DID IT
ONCE AGAIN, FOLKS!

AS THE WORLD
CHESS CHAMPION!

00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:41.619
THE CORPORATE GENIUS
AND 6-TIME WORLD CHAMP

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:43.156
IS A MASTER STRATEGIST,

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.261
WHO HAS NEVER ONCE
LOST A SINGLE MATCH!

00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:46.799
HE MAINTAINS HIS CLAIM

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.970
THAT THERE'S NOT A PERSON
ALIVE WHO CAN DEFEAT HIM!

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.608
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE,

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:53.683
THIS OUTSPOKEN BUSINESS
TYCOON HAS A HEART OF GOLD.

00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:55.688
HERE HE IS DONATING
A PORTION OF HIS WINNINGS

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.192
TO A LOCAL ORPHANAGE!

00:07:57.192 --> 00:08:00.233
I'M SURE HE JUST MADE A LOT
OF CHILDREN VERY HAPPY.

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.441
[THINKING] THAT WAS THE DAY
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER--

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.916
THE DAY I MET MY STEP-FATHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:13.266
Kaiba: LOOK, SETO,
IT'S HIM!

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.204
Man: WELCOME,
MR. KAIBA.

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:18.212
Seto: IT'S JUST A CHEAP
VIRTUAL PROJECTION,

00:08:18.212 --> 00:08:19.784
THAT'S ALL.

00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:21.087
'CAUSE HE'S LONG GONE.

00:08:21.087 --> 00:08:23.025
WELL, SIR...

00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.897
THE CHILDREN
ARE THIS WAY.

00:08:24.897 --> 00:08:26.433
THEY'LL BE THRILLED
TO MEET YOU.

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:29.943
LOOK, I DON'T
WANT ANY OF THESE
BRATS TOUCHING ME.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.680
LET'S JUST TAKE
A FEW PICTURES

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.718
FOR THE PAPERS
AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:35.925
TIME IS MONEY,
YOU KNOW.

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:37.395
WHAT'S THAT STENCH?

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:40.436
YOU DO BATHE THESE LITTLE
URCHINS, DON'T YOU?

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.444
THAT GUY IS OUR TICKET
OUT OF THIS DUMP, MOKIE.

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:44.546
BUT HOW...

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:48.256
HE'S JUST HERE TO VISIT,
NOT ADOPT ANYONE.

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:50.596
I'LL MAKE SURE
HE TAKES US!

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.632
WHAT? HOW!?

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:54.672
JUST FOLLOW ME,
AND DO WHAT I SAY, BRO.

00:08:54.672 --> 00:08:56.143
FINE.
OK.

00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:57.747
GOZABURO...

00:08:57.747 --> 00:08:59.485
IT'S TIME TO MATCH
WITS WITH ME...

00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:02.793
AND LOSE AT YOUR OWN GAME.

00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:05.635
Seto: GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. KAIBA.

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:07.038
HMM?

00:09:07.038 --> 00:09:08.675
YEAH. I SUPPOSE.

00:09:08.675 --> 00:09:09.945
IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME, KID...

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:11.483
I'M IN A RUSH.

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:13.053
I'VE GOT A CHALLENGE FOR YOU,

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.125
AND I KNOW YOU
NEVER PASS ONE UP.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.598
HMM! YES, GO ON.

00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:19.536
HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE:

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:21.943
ONE GAME OF CHESS,
ME AGAINST YOU...

00:09:21.943 --> 00:09:24.951
IF I WIN, YOU ADOPT MY
BROTHER AND ME TODAY,

00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:26.521
NO QUESTIONS ASKED...

00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.657
[LAUGHS]

00:09:27.657 --> 00:09:29.362
THAT'S A GOOD ONE!

00:09:29.362 --> 00:09:32.135
NO ONE BEATS ME
AT CHESS, KID.

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.442
AND I'VE BEEN PLAYING
IT FOR YEARS.

00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:36.045
I WAS A WORLD CHAMPION

00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:37.850
WHEN YOU WERE
SUCKING YOUR THUMB.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.056
YOU'RE IN OVER
YOUR HEAD, KID.

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:42.028
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN BEAT ME?

00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:44.501
BECAUSE I NEVER
LOSE EITHER.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.338
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:47.408
WELL, YOU'VE
CERTAINLY GOT

00:09:47.408 --> 00:09:49.079
A GREAT DEAL OF
CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF,

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:50.583
I HAVE TO CREDIT
YOU WITH THAT.

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:52.187
BUT I'M A BUSY MAN...

00:09:52.187 --> 00:09:54.660
AND BABYSITTING FOR YOU
ISN'T ON MY SCHEDULE!

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.832
SO, THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GONNA BACK DOWN?

00:09:56.832 --> 00:09:58.804
WAIT TILL
THE NEWSPAPERS FIND OUT

00:09:58.804 --> 00:10:00.007
YOU'RE SCARED OF A KID!

00:10:00.007 --> 00:10:01.344
WHAT'S THAT!?

00:10:01.344 --> 00:10:03.149
YOU WOULDN'T DARE
TELL THEM THAT!

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:06.357
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD, YOU BRAT!

00:10:06.357 --> 00:10:07.660
ALL RIGHT THEN.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.797
LET'S PLAY, KID.

00:10:08.797 --> 00:10:12.506
ONE MATCH,
ONE CHANCE ONLY.

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:14.511
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:17.085
SET US UP IN
A QUIET ROOM NOW!

00:10:17.085 --> 00:10:18.521
SURE!
YES, RIGHT!

00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:22.398
HMM! LET'S GET
THIS GAME OVER WITH.

00:10:22.398 --> 00:10:26.208
Seto: PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
FOR A 12-YEAR-OLD.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.344
WHAT MADE YOU SO SURE

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:30.017
YOU WERE GOING TO BEAT
GOZABURO AT CHESS, SETO?

00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:31.488
SIMPLE...

00:10:31.488 --> 00:10:32.959
MY DESIRE TO
WIN THAT GAME

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:35.297
WAS FAR GREATER
THAN HIS, MOKUBA.

00:10:35.297 --> 00:10:37.035
BY CHALLENGING GOZABURO,

00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:39.742
I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE
AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN.

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:41.480
TO HIM IT WAS JUST A GAME.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.987
THIS WON'T TAKE
VERY LONG, JUNIOR.

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.760
THOSE WERE MY
THOUGHTS EXACTLY, POPS...

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.498
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:50.203
AFTER YOU.

00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:52.542
YOU'LL NEED
ALL THE HELP
YOU CAN GET.

00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:54.514
PAWN TO E3.

00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:55.716
HMM!

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:58.758
THAT'S MY
OPENING MOVE, KID.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.061
I KNOW.

00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.668
I'VE STUDIED
ALL YOUR MATCHES.

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:06.612
STUDYING IS ONE THING;
MASTERING IS ANOTHER.

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:10.455
KNIGHT TO G5.

00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:12.995
YOU'VE LEFT YOUR
LEFT FLANK EXPOSED.

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:14.332
HMM!

00:11:14.332 --> 00:11:17.172
I HAD HIS STRATEGIES MEMORIZED.

00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:19.812
BISHOP TO B6,
CHECKMATE!

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.717
OOH!
YOU LOSE!

00:11:21.717 --> 00:11:24.691
NO! HOW COULD
YOU BEAT ME?!

00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.733
NOW YOU HAVE TO ADOPT US
LIKE YOU PROMISED, MR. KAIBA!

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:29.270
OH.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.311
Seto: THAT WAS THE DAY
I TOOK CONTROL OF MY FUTURE.

00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:33.714
YEAH?

00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:36.121
WELL, IT WAS ALSO
THE DAY YOU STOPPED
CALLING ME "MOKIE."

00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:37.424
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME

00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:39.964
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
ESCAPED THAT RAT HOLE.

00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:42.404
I TURNED OUR LIVES
AROUND THAT DAY.

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:43.472
HMM!

00:11:43.472 --> 00:11:45.945
HEY,
COME BACK, NOW!

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:49.522
I LIKED THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE WE GOT HERE!

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:50.892
AT LEAST BACK THEN,

00:11:50.892 --> 00:11:53.532
YOU ACTUALLY SMILED
ONCE IN A WHILE!

00:11:53.532 --> 00:11:55.537
AH! WAIT A SECOND,

RIGHT INTO NOAH'S TRAP!

THESE ILLUSIONS

TO TURN US
AGAINST EACH OTHER!

IT'S FAKE!

00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:07.334
THE PAST IS OVER.

A VALUABLE ASSET!

NOW I'LL PLAY THE MAGIC

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:59.869
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS INVEST
A MERE 800 OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:12:59.869 --> 00:13:03.211
