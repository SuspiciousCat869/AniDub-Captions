00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:02.741
Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON YU-GI-OH...

00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:04.346
WE GOTTA GET
GOING, GUYS.

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:07.087
THE BIG FIVE MAY
HAVE TRISTAN'S
BODY,

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:09.527
BUT HIS MIND'S
GOT TO BE AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE!

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:11.867
WHOA, WHERE AM I?

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.337
OH NO!

00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:15.711
THEY MADE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!!!!

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.816
PARDON ME!

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:19.054
TRISTAN?

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:20.992
MY NAME'S NOT TRISTAN.

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.903
KAIBA, I'VE TAKEN SOMETHING
FROM YOU SO WE'RE EVEN NOW!

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:26.241
HANG ON, MOKUBA!

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.550
I'LL RESCUE YOU FROM THESE
CORPORATE SLEAZE BALLS!

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.558
SO WE MEET AGAIN,
SETO KAIBA.

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:35.434
SO LET'S GET THIS DUEL
OVER WITH, LEICHTER!

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:39.778
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT FOR QUITE
SOME TIME, MR. KAIBA.

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:43.322
I WAS NEXT IN LINE TO RUN
THE COMPANY UNTIL YOU FORCED
YOUR WAY TO THE TOP!

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.862
YOU NEVER ONCE HAD
YOUR OWN IDEA.

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:48.169
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
RUN KAIBA CORP!

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:52.682
NOT ONLY COULD I, BUT I WILL
ONCE I ESCAPE TO THE REAL
WORLD IN YOUR BODY!

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:01.841
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE,
YOUR MOVE, YOUR MOVE...

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.345
♪ YOUR MOVE! ♪

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:10.833
♪ YU-GI-OH IS KING OF GAME ♪

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:35.536
IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-DUEL!

00:01:59.403 --> 00:02:01.910
SO WHAT WAS THAT
THING, YOU GUYS?

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.383
SOME KINDA VIRTUAL
ROCKET, I GUESS.

00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:06.456
YEAH, BUT WHO DO YOU
THINK LAUNCHED IT?

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.462
THE BIG FIVE?

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:11.938
THE ONE UPSIDE TO HAVING
YOUR MIND TRAPPED IN
THE BODY OF A ROBOT MONKEY

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:14.713
IS GETTING TO HANG OUT IN
SERENITY'S ARMS ALL DAY!

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:17.220
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
TRISTAN, REMEMBER?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.560
SHE'S SO CUTE
WHEN SHE ACTS TOUGH!

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.672
AND THE BEST PART IS:
ALL SHE CAN THINK ABOUT
IS TRYING TO FIND ME!

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:26.045
I MEAN MAYBE SERENITY
REALLY LIKES ME.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.084
NOT THAT I CAN
EXACTLY BLAME HER.

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:29.454
LET'S FACE IT...

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:32.697
I'M WAY COOLER THAN THAT
ROMEO WANNA-BE DUKE DEVLIN!

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:35.839
WEIRD.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.744
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I JUST HEARD
TRISTAN'S VOICE.

00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:40.084
YEAH.
IT CAME FROM HIM.

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:43.528
IF I STAY STUCK IN
THIS ROBO-CHIMP'S
BODY TOO LONG,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:46.402
I MAY START CHOWING
ON BANANAS AND BUGS!

00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:47.572
AH, TRISTAN?

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:48.977
ARE YOU IN THERE?

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:50.982
DID I JUST SAY
THAT OUT LOUD?

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:52.419
COME HERE!

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.991
WHO ARE YOU!?

00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.665
I DON'T TRUST YOU
ONE BIT, APE-BOY!

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:58.470
JOEY! IT'S ME!

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.876
I DINK YER A ROBOT SPY
SENT BY NOAH!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.355
HEY, I'M A MONKEY,
NOT A MAD DOG!

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:07.729
WITH THE BIG FIVE
RUNNING AROUND IN DISGUISE,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.768
WE'RE NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES!

00:03:09.768 --> 00:03:11.440
I'M TELLIN' YA
IT'S ME!

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.448
CUT A CHIMP
SOME SLACK!

00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:17.657
NOW MR. KAIBA,
WHERE WERE WE?

00:03:17.657 --> 00:03:18.794
OH, YES.

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:21.535
I HAD THREE TIMES AS MANY
LIFE POINTS AS YOU

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.173
AND I WAS ABOUT
TO FINISH YOU OFF.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:24.176
JUST TRY.

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:25.612
VERY WELL.

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:28.655
FIRST I'LL ACTIVATE MY FAIRY
LILY'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:30.193
YOU REMEMBER...

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:32.766
I GIVE UP 2000
OF MY LIFE POINTS

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:35.240
TO BOOST HER ATTACK
STRENGTH BY 3,000.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.984
LILY! ATTACK AND DESTROY
HIS BEHEMOTH!

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:46.538
YOU'VE OVERLOOKED
MY MONSTER'S SPECIAL
ABILITY!

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.711
IT MAKES A QUICK
RECOVERY!

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:55.965
TOO BAD I'M ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD
OF YOU, MR. KAIBA!

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:58.572
FIRST I'LL PLACE
THIS CARD FACE DOWN.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:03.186
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE THE MAGIC
CARD EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:08.133
BY DESTROYING MY OWN
FACE DOWN CARD,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:13.915
THE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS
MAGIC CARD BOOSTS
MY LIFE POINTS BY 1000!

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:16.857
AT THIS RATE WIPING
YOU OUT WILL BE SIMPLE!

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.634
AND SEIZING CONTROL OF YOUR
BODY WILL BE EVEN SIMPLER!

00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:28.055
REMEMBER THAT ENORMOUS ROCKET I
LAUNCHED, EARLIER IN OUR DUEL?

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:31.866
WELL IF I WERE YOU,
I'D KEEP AN EYE ON ITS
ENERGY GAUGE, MR. KAIBA!

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.905
IS THAT SO,
LEICHTER?

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.521
KAIBA!

00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.195
YUGI.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:43.767
EXCELLENT.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:45.973
THE GANG'S ALL HERE.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:49.616
NOW SETO... YOU'VE GOT
AN AUDIENCE TO WITNESS
YOUR DESTRUCTION.

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.321
THEY FOUND HIM...

00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:53.493
SETO'S GONNA STOMP THAT FREAK!

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.499
THEN HE'LL RESCUE ME!
GOT THAT!?

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.909
YOU SEEM QUITE CONFIDENT
THAT YOUR BROTHER CARES
ABOUT YOU MOKUBA.

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.048
WELL GUESS AGAIN.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:05.895
YUGI!

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:08.803
KAIBA'S UP AGAINST
ONE OF DA BADDEST DECK
MASTERS OF ALL TIME!

00:05:08.803 --> 00:05:11.812
YOU'RE RIGHT JOEY!
IT'S JINZO!

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.687
AND YOU KNOW WHAT DAT
MEANS, DON'T YA YUGE?

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:16.090
I SURE DO.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.634
IT MEANS THAT
KAIBA'S TRAP CARDS
ARE TOTALLY USELESS!

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.071
OH NO!

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.244
IT'S LIKE
DUELING WITH
HALF A DECK!

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:26.788
LEICHTER THINKS HE HAS ME
BACKED INTO A CORNER.

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:30.498
BUT THAT OLD FOOL IS IN
FOR QUITE A SURPRISE!

00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:32.503
MY MOVE!

00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:34.944
HMM...OH WELL...

00:05:34.944 --> 00:05:37.484
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
BAD WEATHER AHEAD!

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:39.590
'CAUSE I ACTIVATE THIS!

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.131
MY HEAVY STORM MAGIC CARD!

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:49.184
TIME FOR MY STORM TO BLOW
AWAY ALL OF YOUR MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS LEICHTER!

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:52.894
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE DONE POWERING
UP YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.867
AS YOUR STEPFATHER'S
RIGHT HAND MAN,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.073
I LEARNED TO ANTICIPATE
HIS EVERY MOVE!

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:59.647
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'VE JUST DONE TO YOU!

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:03.858
FOR I ACTIVATE
IMPERIAL ORDER!

00:06:03.858 --> 00:06:04.861
OH NO!

00:06:04.861 --> 00:06:07.369
OH YES, MR. KAIBA!

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.976
FOR A MERE 700 LIFE POINTS
PER TURN,

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:12.884
THIS CARD CANCELS OUT
ALL YOUR MAGIC CARDS.

00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:15.525
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS DON'T YOU!?

00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:21.308
NOW YOU CAN'T USE ANY
TRAP OR MAGIC CARDS FOR
THE DURATION OF THE DUEL!

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:22.377
THAT'S NOT GOOD!

00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:23.514
OH, MAN!

00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:25.587
TALK ABOUT NOT PLAYIN'
WITH A FULL DECK!

00:06:25.587 --> 00:06:28.060
HANG IN THERE!

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.336
FINALLY, ONE OF THE BIG
FIVE CAN HOLD HIS OWN
IN A DUEL!

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:34.378
AND NOW THE FUN
CONTINUES!

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:38.289
I'LL ADD 500 LIFE POINTS TO
MY TOTAL WITH SOLEMN WISHES

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.398
AND A THOUSAND MORE WITH
LIFE ABSORBING MACHINE.

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:45.376
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE 700 TO
ACTIVATE IMPERIAL ORDER!

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:48.283
NOW THAT THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF,
I CAN FINALLY UNLEASH

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.089
THE POWER OF
MY ULTIMATE WEAPON!

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:51.660
GO AHEAD...

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.537
SATELLITE CANNON,
BEGIN FIRING SEQUENCE!

00:06:55.537 --> 00:06:58.078
WHEN YOU TOOK OVER
KAIBA CORP, YOU DESTROYED
ALL OF THE MISSILES

00:06:58.078 --> 00:07:01.254
THAT YOUR STEPFATHER AND I
WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD...

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.298
SO IT'S QUITE FITTING THAT
I USE THIS SATELLITE MISSILE
TO DESTROY YOU!

00:07:07.337 --> 00:07:11.182
NOW SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR
FACEDOWN MONSTER!

00:07:27.996 --> 00:07:32.074
MY WICKED WORM
BEAST!

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:33.110
PERFECT!

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:38.391
YOU SEEM A LITTLE STUNNED
TO ME, MR. KAIBA.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.698
HOW CAN I STOP
A WEAPON THAT'S...

00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:42.135
UP THERE!?

00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:43.439
YOU CAN'T!

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:47.082
ORBITING THE EARTH AT
AN ALTITUDE OF 240 MILES,

00:07:47.082 --> 00:07:50.560
MY SATELLITE CANNON IS
VIRTUALLY UNREACHABLE!

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.431
IT CAN'T BE BEAT!

00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.169
I NEVER HEARD OF
A DUEL MONSTER

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.142
DAT CAN ATTACK
FROM OUTER SPACE!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.585
SATELLITE CANNON
IS SO HIGH ABOVE
THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:04.265
THAT IT'S SHIELDED FROM
THE ATTACK OF ALMOST
EVERY MONSTER!!

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:05.768
ALMOST!

00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:07.674
HOW DO YOU KNOW I
DON'T HAVE A MONSTER

00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:09.679
IN MY DECK THAT CAN
REACH IT, LEICHTER?

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:11.485
TRUST ME, MR. KAIBA.

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:15.563
BY THE TIME YOU SUMMON
A MONSTER WITH THE ABILITY
TO ATTACK MY SATELLITE,

00:08:15.563 --> 00:08:18.337
IT WILL BE TOO POWERFUL
TO DESTROY!

00:08:18.337 --> 00:08:22.081
THAT'S BECAUSE IT GAINS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS
WITH EACH TURN!

00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:26.661
AT LAST, THE MIGHTY SETO
KAIBA IS ABOUT TO LOSE
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS!

00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:28.934
AND IT SERVES YOU RIGHT,

00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:32.778
AFTER DESTROYING
YOUR OWN STEPFATHER AND
BETRAYING THE BIG FIVE!

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:35.519
NOW IT'S TIME
YOU PAID THE PRICE

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.558
FOR USING OTHERS
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT!

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:39.864
EVEN YOUR OWN BROTHER!

00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:41.069
WHAT'S HE TALKING
ABOUT?

00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:42.372
NO WAY!

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:44.210
SETO AND I
ARE A TEAM!

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.249
NOT ALL THE TIME.

00:08:46.249 --> 00:08:50.127
MOKUBA, IT'S TIME YOU
LEARNED THE HARSH TRUTH
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:53.838
LISTEN TO WHAT
LEICHTER HAS TO SAY.

00:08:53.838 --> 00:08:56.912
YOU'LL STOP AT NOTHING
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT,
MR. KAIBA,

00:08:56.912 --> 00:09:00.423
EVEN IF IT MEANS DECEIVING
THOSE MOST LOYAL TO YOU.

00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:04.601
YOUR TREACHERY BEGAN WHEN
YOUR STEPFATHER, GOZABURO,

00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:08.478
GAVE YOU TEN MILLION DOLLARS
TO TEST YOUR BUSINESS SKILLS.

00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:11.654
WHEN YOU INCREASED THE CASH BY
THREATENING A SMALLER COMPANY,

00:09:11.654 --> 00:09:15.198
HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR
ABILITIES AND YOUR CRUELTY.

00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:17.906
BUT THAT WASN'T GOOD
ENOUGH FOR YOU, WAS IT?

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:20.079
YOU WANTED MORE.

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.886
SETO, AS KAIBA CORP'S
BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:25.627
WE'RE CURIOUS WHY
YOU'VE CALLED US HERE.

00:09:25.627 --> 00:09:27.466
LET ME GET STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.970
YOU ARE ALL VERY
TALENTED MEN,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.875
YET MY FATHER TREATS
YOU LIKE DIRT.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:33.115
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME
TO YOU TODAY WITH
A PROPOSITION

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:36.124
THAT YOU'D BE FOOLS
TO REFUSE.

00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:37.728
SIGN ON
TO MY PLAN...

00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:41.572
AND WE'LL RULE
THE KAIBA CORPORATION
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:45.416
SO SLOWLY WE ALL STARTED
BUYING PIECES OF KAIBA CORP

00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:47.155
TO TRY AND TAKE
OVER THE COMPANY.

00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:51.199
BUT SECURING THE 51 PERCENT
WE NEEDED PROVED DIFFICULT.

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:55.879
THEN WE REALIZED THAT
SOMEONE WAS LEAKING OUR
PLAN TO GOZABURO KAIBA.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:10:00.525
YOU TOLD US THAT SOMEONE WAS
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER MOKUBA!

00:10:07.745 --> 00:10:10.086
HOW DARE YOU
BETRAY ME!

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.523
SETO!

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.827
TELL ME!

00:10:12.827 --> 00:10:14.532
HOW COULD YOU RAT ME
OUT LIKE THAT?

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:16.537
I DIDN'T TELL
GOZABURO.

00:10:16.537 --> 00:10:17.741
I SWEAR SETO!

00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:19.044
YOU LIAR!

00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:22.120
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.896
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.
THE MOST HORRIBLE DAY
OF MY LIFE.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.379
BY TURNING ON YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER YOU FORCED MOKUBA

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:34.621
TO RUN TO YOUR STEPFATHER,
GOZABURO, FOR COMFORT.

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.930
OF COURSE, GOZABURO
HAD HIS OWN AGENDA.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.672
YOU SEE, MOKUBA OWNED
2 PERCENT OF KAIBA CORP,

00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:44.617
EXACTLY WHAT GOZABURO
NEEDED TO STAY IN CONTROL.

00:10:44.617 --> 00:10:46.689
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:50.132
THE BIG FIVE AND I HAVE
DECIDED TO TAKE CONTROL
OF KAIBA CORP.

00:10:50.132 --> 00:10:52.237
WRONG!
BUT NICE TRY!

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:55.213
SEE I KNEW ABOUT
YOUR PLAN TO BUY OUT
KAIBA CORP.

00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:58.456
BUT YOU WERE ONLY
ABLE TO BUY
FORTY-NINE PERCENT!

00:10:58.456 --> 00:11:01.765
AND I'M AFRAID THAT
LEAVES ME WITH
FIFTY-ONE!

00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:05.709
YOU LOSE, SETO,
BECAUSE THIS COMPANY
IS STILL MINE!

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:07.647
AND AS FOR YOU FIVE...

00:11:07.647 --> 00:11:10.389
AS PUNISHMENT FOR
BETRAYING ME
YOU'RE ALL FIRED!

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:13.063
AND I'LL MAKE SURE YOU NEVER
WORK IN THIS TOWN AGAIN!

00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:16.573
NOW CLEAN OUT YOUR DESKS
AND GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
RIGHT NOW!

00:11:16.573 --> 00:11:19.213
AND DON'T THINK
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK, SETO.

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:20.451
YOU'RE HEADED BACK
TO THE ORPHANAGE

00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:23.426
WHERE UNGRATEFUL BRATS
LIKE YOU BELONG!

00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:25.164
NOT QUITE!

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:26.233
HE'S STAYING!

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:27.236
WHAT? HOW!?

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.841
EASY!

00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:31.816
BECAUSE I'M GIVING MY TWO
PERCENT OF KAIBA CORP
STRAIGHT TO YOU!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.788
YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE MOKUBA.

00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:35.259
REMEMBER HOW BADLY
HE TREATED YOU?

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.031
SETO AND I ARE A TEAM!

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:39.003
I'D NEVER TURN
MY BACK ON HIM!

00:11:39.003 --> 00:11:40.340
YOU FOOL!

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.281
I HAVE MADE UP
MY MIND!

00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:44.652
YOU HEARD
MY BROTHER.

00:11:44.652 --> 00:11:47.660
NOW I'M THE NEW PRESIDENT
OF KAIBA CORP.

00:11:49.533 --> 00:11:52.073
GOZABURO WAS SO ASHAMED
THAT HE RAN AWAY.

00:11:52.073 --> 00:11:53.644
NO ONE'S HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE!

00:11:53.644 --> 00:11:55.850
SO YOUR CRUEL PLAN WORKED!

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.023
WHAT'S YOUR POINT...
LEICHTER?

00:11:58.023 --> 00:11:59.929
YOU PLAYED US LIKE FOOLS!

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:03.472
MOKUBA WASN'T THE SNITCH,
NOW WAS HE!?

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:07.283
IT WAS YOU!
WASN'T IT MR. KAIBA?

00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:09.422
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:12.665
YOU KNEW THAT YOUR
STEPFATHER LIKED PEOPLE
TO THINK THEY WERE WINNING,

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.974
SO WHEN HE BEAT THEM,
THEY'D FEEL THAT MUCH WORSE!

00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:18.648
SO YOU USED MOKUBA
AS A PAWN.

00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:21.891
YOU BEGAN LEAKING INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR PLAN TO GOZABURO

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:25.567
AND MADE EVERYONE, INCLUDING
HIM, THINK IT WAS MOKUBA!

00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:29.746
SO YOUR STEPFATHER LET YOU
GAIN 49% OF HIS COMPANY,

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:34.325
THINKING MOKUBA WOULD
GIVE HIM THE 2% HE NEEDED
TO STAY IN CONTROL!

00:12:34.325 --> 00:12:38.136
BUT YOU KNEW BETTER
DIDN'T YOU MR. KAIBA!?

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:40.710
YOU KNEW THAT YOUR
LITTLE BROTHER WOULD
BE LOYAL TO YOU...

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.919
NO MATTER HOW POORLY
YOU TREATED HIM!

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.289
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:47.229
MOKUBA WAS THE ONLY
ONE I TRUSTED.

00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:50.805
I KNEW THAT TOGETHER
HE AND I COULD TAKE
OUR STEPFATHER DOWN!

00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:52.309
YOU USED HIM...

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:54.449
TO ACHIEVE YOUR OWN
SELFISH GOALS.

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:58.795
YOU TOYED WITH YOUR BROTHER'S
EMOTIONS AND TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF HIS TRUST FOR YOU!

00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:04.076
THEN YOU DESTROYED
THE VERY MAN WHO RESCUED
YOU FROM THAT ORPHANAGE!

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:05.346
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:08.254
SETO WOULD NEVER
HURT ME ON PURPOSE!

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:12.467
YOU NEVER INTENDED TO
RUN KAIBA CORP WITH US AS
A TEAM, LIKE YOU PROMISED.

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:16.009
WHEN YOU BECAME
PRESIDENT YOU TOOK AWAY
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES!

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:17.949
YOU USED ME,

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:21.090
JUST LIKE YOU USE
EVERYONE INCLUDING
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.063
LOOK, LEICHTER.

00:13:23.063 --> 00:13:26.774
LIFE IS A GAME AND IF
YOU CAN'T WIN IT THEN
DON'T PLAY!

00:13:26.774 --> 00:13:29.347
NOW, LET'S DUEL!

00:13:29.347 --> 00:13:32.757
I SUMMON SPIRIT RYU!

00:13:35.765 --> 00:13:38.105
AND SPEAKING OF
WINNING WATCH THIS!

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:42.284
SPIRIT RYU, ATTACK
HIS FAIRY LILY NOW!

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.825
WITH SONIC FLASH ATTACK!

00:13:48.802 --> 00:13:50.908
HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN, SETO?

00:13:50.908 --> 00:13:53.950
I CAN ACTIVATE LILY'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.660
BY GIVING UP 2,000
LIFE POINTS I BOOST
HER ATTACK STRENGTH!

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.663
KAIBA NO!

00:13:58.663 --> 00:13:59.900
AW MAN!

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.371
HE SHOULDA SEEN
DAT COMIN'!

00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:03.243
NOW KAIBA'S GONNA
LOSE THE DUEL!

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.482
FAREWELL, MR. KAIBA!

00:14:05.482 --> 00:14:06.585
NOT SO FAST!

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:09.426
IT'S TIME FOR SPIRIT
RYU'S SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:12.435
HE GAINS AN EXTRA
1,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:16.647
FOR EACH DRAGON
I DISCARD FROM MY
HAND--AND I HAVE TWO!

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:22.297
NOW I'LL ONLY LOSE
400 LIFE POINTS

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:24.703
WHILE YOUR LILY
DESTROYS MY MONSTER!

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.575
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF GAME YOU'RE PLAYING,
MR. KAIBA,

00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:41.316
BUT WITH ONLY 800
LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:44.325
YOU WON'T BE PLAYING
IT MUCH LONGER.

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.910
THIS DUEL'S ALMOST DONE!

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.518
WHY DID KAIBA LET HIM
DESTROY THAT MONSTER?

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.390
MAYBE DA PRESSURE'S
GOTTEN TO HIM!

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.626
NOT QUITE GUYS.

00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:58.599
I JUST FIGURED OUT
KAIBA'S STRATEGY!

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.404
SO HE MEANT
TO DO DAT!?

00:15:00.404 --> 00:15:01.841
MM-HMM.

00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:03.446
BEHEMOTH!

00:15:03.446 --> 00:15:06.053
ATTACK HIS FAIRY
NOOOOOOOW!

00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:07.825
NO!

00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:10.533
I DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH LIFE POINTS TO
INCREASE HER STRENGTH!

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.251
MY PLAN WORKED!

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:21.964
I FORCED YOU TO GIVE
UP 2,000 LIFE POINTS
LAST MOVE...

00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:25.708
SO YOU COULDN'T
POWER UP YOUR FAIRY
THIS MOVE!

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:30.422
YOU SEE GUYS, LEICHTER HAS
TO GIVE UP HIS LIFE POINTS
TO ACTIVATE HIS BEST CARDS.

00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:32.461
SO HE NEEDS HIS
LIFE POINTS TO BE HIGH!

00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:33.831
MY MOVE!

00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.475
FIRST I GAIN 500 LIFE POINTS
THANKS TO SOLEMN WISHES

00:15:37.475 --> 00:15:40.316
THEN ANOTHER THREE FIFTY
THANKS TO LIFE ABSORBING
MACHINE.

00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:41.586
WAIT, LEICHTER.

00:15:41.586 --> 00:15:43.994
DON'T FORGET TO PAY
OUT 700 LIFE POINTS

00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:46.233
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
IMPERIAL ORDER
IN EFFECT.

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:52.049
I CAN'T AFFORD TO
GIVE UP THAT MUCH,
SO I'LL DESTROY IT!

00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:54.991
NICE! NOW KAIBA CAN
USE HIS MAGIC CARDS
AGAIN!

00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:56.128
AWESOME!

00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:58.166
NOW I UNDERSTAND
KAIBA'S GAME PLAN.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.139
IF LEICHTER CAN'T
RESTORE HIS LIFE POINTS,

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:02.780
THEN HIS WHOLE DUELING
STRATEGY GOES DOWN
THE DRAIN!

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.353
NOW KAIBA MAY WIN
THIS DUEL AFTER ALL!

00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:08.094
LEICHTER, HOW DID
YOU EVER THINK YOU
COULD RUN KAIBA CORP

00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:09.632
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN
CONTROL THE NUMBERS

00:16:09.632 --> 00:16:11.938
IN A SIMPLE GAME
OF DUEL MONSTERS?

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.613
SILENCE!
I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:16:14.613 --> 00:16:16.719
I SUMMON A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:20.128
THEN COMMAND MY SATELLITE
CANNON TO ATTACK
YOUR BEHEMOTH!

00:16:26.178 --> 00:16:31.192
I'M SO SORRY I HAD TO
RUIN YOUR GOOD MOOD,
MR. KAIBA.

00:16:31.192 --> 00:16:33.466
DON'T WORRY.

00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:36.241
NOT BAD.

00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:38.847
FIRST I'LL ACTIVATE
MY POT OF GREED CARD.

00:16:38.847 --> 00:16:42.793
THIS ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:46.770
AND THEN I'LL SUMMON
THE MONSTER POSSESSED
DARK SOUL!

00:16:50.514 --> 00:16:51.951
NOW DARK SOUL!

00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.359
ATTACK LEICHTER'S
FACEDOWN MONSTER!

00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:01.211
STOP RIGHT THERE!

00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:03.651
REVEAL DREAMSPRITE!

00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:06.693
ATTACKING THIS ACTIVATED
ITS SPECIAL POWER!

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:09.769
IT CAN REDIRECT
YOUR ATTACK TO ANY
OF MY OTHER MONSTERS!

00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:12.175
JUST WATCH, MR. KAIBA!

00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:20.097
SO I'LL TRANSFER
YOUR ATTACK TO
MY SATELLITE CANNON!

00:17:20.097 --> 00:17:21.501
HOLD ON!

00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:24.209
KAIBA'S MONSTER'S NOT STRONG
ENOUGH TO REACH THAT HIGH!

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.847
I'M UNTOUCHABLE!

00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:28.888
JUST ONE MORE TURN AND
MY SATELLITE CANNON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:17:28.888 --> 00:17:30.894
WILL BE RAISED TO 2,000--

00:17:30.894 --> 00:17:35.508
ENOUGH TO WIPE
OUT YOUR REMAINING
LIFE POINTS, MR. KAIBA!

00:17:35.508 --> 00:17:41.390
I'LL TAKE A LIFE POINT
BOOST FROM MY TRAP CARD
AND END MY TURN!

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.928
THAT SNAKE!

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:43.998
HOW COME HE DIDN'T
ATTACK?!

00:17:43.998 --> 00:17:45.368
YOU HEARD HIM JOEY.

00:17:45.368 --> 00:17:47.541
HE'S CHARGING UP
HIS CANNON!

FOR ONE FINAL ATTACK!

00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:52.589
I'LL TAKE DOWN YOUR
LITTLE SPACE CANNON!

00:17:52.589 --> 00:17:54.159
GOOD LUCK!

00:17:54.159 --> 00:17:56.266
MOST MONSTERS COULD
NEVER REACH THAT HIGH!

00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:57.904
AW MAN!

00:17:57.904 --> 00:18:00.946
DOES KAIBA HAVE
A MONSTER STRONG ENOUGH
TO CRUSH DAT THING?

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:03.587
WAIT. THERE MAY BE
ONE IN HIS DECK...

00:18:03.587 --> 00:18:06.227
BUT WHO KNOWS IF
HE CAN SUMMON IT
IN TIME!

00:18:06.227 --> 00:18:10.104
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS NEXT DRAW.

00:18:10.104 --> 00:18:12.312
C'MON, SETO.

00:18:12.312 --> 00:18:15.621
THIS IS IT.

00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:18.429
AND NOW BEHOLD MY
ULTIMATE CREATURE!

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.808
WHAT IS IT!?

00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:24.446
YOU'LL SEE!

00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.187
BUT FIRST I'LL PLACE
THIS IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:31.699
NOW MY DECK MASTER! SHOW
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:34.875
AT A COST OF 500
OF MY LIFE POINTS,

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:39.120
LORD OF DRAGONS ALLOWS
ME TO SUMMON ANY DRAGON
FROM MY HAND!

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.429
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
BOTH OF MY MONSTERS!

00:18:45.973 --> 00:18:48.413
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING MR. KAIBA!?

00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:51.220
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT!

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.163
I SUMMON BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:01.984
THERE'S YOUR TARGET!

00:19:01.984 --> 00:19:03.422
GO BLUE EYES!

00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:09.706
TAKE DOWN HIS
SATELLITE CANNON
NOW!!

00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:13.216
NO! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS!?

00:19:13.216 --> 00:19:15.690
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IT MEANS LEICHTER!

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.729
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.342
I KNOW YOUR
SATELLITE CANNON
ONLY HAS

00:19:22.342 --> 00:19:24.715
ATTACK POINTS
WHEN IT'S ABOUT
TO ATTACK.

00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:29.595
OTHERWISE IT HAS
AN ATTACK POWER
OF...ZERO!

00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:30.765
NO!

00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:32.504
THAT MEANS ONCE
I ATTACK...

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.941
YOU LOSE EVERYTHING!

00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:42.097
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO CHALLENGE ME!

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:44.337
NOW MY BLUE EYES,
FINISH HIM OFF

00:19:44.337 --> 00:19:46.543
WITH WHITE
LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:19:56.003 --> 00:19:59.379
LOOKS LIKE YOU WON'T
BE LEAVING CYBER
SPACE ANYTIME SOON!

00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:00.617
NICE JOB!

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.890
KAIBA WASTED THAT
BIG FIVE CREEP!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.059
NO!

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:06.867
I WAS SO CLOSE
TO FINALLY ESCAPING

00:20:06.867 --> 00:20:08.873
FROM THIS DIGITAL DUNGEON!

00:20:08.873 --> 00:20:10.945
WHERE'S MOKUBA!?

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:14.990
YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR
BROTHER AGAIN, MR. KAIBA!

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.798
HOWEVER, I'LL BE BACK!

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:22.296
I KNEW SETO WOULD
CRUSH THAT CREEP!

00:20:22.296 --> 00:20:24.065
MOKUBA?

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:26.033
HOW CAN YOU
STILL BE ON YOUR
BROTHER'S SIDE?

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:27.868
HE BETRAYED YOU TO
CONTROL KAIBA CORP!

00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:30.671
I WOULD STAND BY
MY BROTHER NO MATTER WHAT!

00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:33.307
WE'RE FAMILY AND NOTHING'S
GOING TO SEPARATE US!

00:20:33.307 --> 00:20:35.076
NOTHING!

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:36.911

FAMILY!

00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:42.016
