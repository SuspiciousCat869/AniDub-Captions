[YORIMICHI]
This jackass here...

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
He pushed another
teammate over the edge

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
for not listening to him.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
The kid tried to off himself.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50% align:center
You mean suicide?

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
Yori, he's had enough.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
You don't have to hurt the guy.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
He's the one
who tried attacking me.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
You listenin'?

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
Athletes shouldn't go
around starting fights,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
especially ones they can't win.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
You ought to be thanking me
for not kicking your ass.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
You believe me now?

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
Quit volleyball.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
You saw how he reacted.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.187 position:50% align:center
What everyone said about him,
they were right.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO] So apparently,
it's called Meisei Academy,

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
and they're kind of a big deal.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
It's this private academy for
both middle and high school.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
As for their sports teams,

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
they're supposed to be,
like, legendary or something.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.840 position:50% align:center
Seems like all the students
in Kanto know its reputation

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
and how it's a
big deal to get in.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
Not like we'd ever know
how that feels, would we?

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
Not a huge selection
to choose from.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.390 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot, but we're going
to the city after school.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
Wanna come along?

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
Maybe Haijima will be there.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
You're all
buddy-buddy again, right?

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
Yeah, um... Thanks for
sharing the info with me.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
Let's talk soon. Later.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
There's no way he'd show up.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
Haijima. Let's go.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout. Well. Hey!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA'S MOTHER] Yuni. Have
you finished taking your bath?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
No. Not yet. Just one sec.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
[PRINCIPAL] Today marks the
final day of your third term.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Don't get too lazy
over spring break.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
You need to prepare
for the new school year

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
by learning to use your--

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE]
Let's go!

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
Hey, Yuni.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
Where'd Haijima go?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
He wasn't in class. Got no idea.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
Then you'll do. Here.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
For real? The hell is all this?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
Give him that sheet
when you see him.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
No one wanted to practice
that much over spring break.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Well, except your club.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
You pretty much got all
the days you asked for.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA'S GRANDMA]
Oh, well, if it isn't Yuni.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hello. Is, uh...

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA'S GRANDMA]
Kimichika.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
You have a visitor
waiting out here for you.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Kimichika.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] You got a full
schedule, like you wanted.

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
Some days, we're in both slots.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Basically, we'll be practicing

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
all through spring break.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA clears throat]

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
Uh, you know, there's
not gonna be much free time

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
for me to hang out with Yori.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
And as for losing interest,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
you don't really have
to worry about that.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
Soooo, yeah.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
I suppose volleyball's getting
to be pretty fun after all,

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
and I do wanna keep on playing.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me to quit.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
What he told you...

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
Won't that change your mind?

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Just so you know, Yori
didn't tell me anything else,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
and I didn't go searching
about you online either.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
Those guys in Tokyo,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
all the crap they've been
saying about you,

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
none of that matters to me now.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
Why would I trust
a bunch of randos?

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
You're here and they're not.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
What I mean is...

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna decide how
I feel about you for myself.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
See you tomorrow.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
At practice.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
Next!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Yuni? Be more careful.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
You were the one
with your eyes closed.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
You headed off to your club?

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
That's right.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Hmmm...

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50% align:center
Hard at work like a sports star.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
Hey! Come on, gimme a break!

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
Chill out.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
I'm not messing with you.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
It was a compliment.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
That's great, then how about
you stop talking down to me?

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
Weirdo. Look, keep your
hands to yourself, all right?

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Did you get taller again?

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
Uh... You think so?

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
One hundred and seventy-nine.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
On the dot.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
She's right! I did grow!

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's 179.2.
Don't be stingy.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
I'm still
2.3 centimeters shorter.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
Heh Heh. Looks like I'm gonna
make it past 180 before you.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Out of curiosity,
do your knees hurt?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
I guess they feel
a little weird.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
Why're you asking? Do yours?

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sometimes
I can't even sleep.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
Oh... Well, that sucks, man.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
Could you sound
any less concerned?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
Gather round. Got a meeting.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
So, for this year,
the Prefectural Championship

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
is July 26th through the 27th.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
That's right when summer
vacation starts, though.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
Lose early, you'll still
have time to enjoy it.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
If we're serious about this,

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
then we'll see it all
the way through to the end.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
So going off
last year's schedule,

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
the first day will be
both round one and two.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
The second day will be the semi-
finals to see who places third.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
The top three teams will head to
the Hokushin'etsu Championship.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
And that's all?

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
You're saying there're
no division qualifiers?

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Huh. I suppose that's
how it typically goes,

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
but our situation's a
bit different this year.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
Somehow, we lucked out.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
Our block doesn't have any.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
The girls' team
will have qualifiers,

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
but the past few years,
the boys' have been split up.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
We don't have as many schools
as you did back in Tokyo.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Four games and we'll win.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
Three, and we'll make it past
the Prefecture Championship.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Maybe we'll actually...

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
We can do this.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
We are gonna win this thing.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
First, The Hokushin'etsu
championship

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
and then the Nationals.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
He sounds so sure.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
But, I mean, let's be real.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
We've never even played
an official match.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Still though... Nationals, huh?

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Sorry!

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
[FUKUI C]
A pipe attack?

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
--Yes!
--Yuni!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
Wow. He scored again.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
This guy's a major threat.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there's also that guy.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
Their setter's too good.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Kuroba!

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Yuni!

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
My dude's on fire today!

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
That's one more!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN A] I didn't think
it was possible, but...

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN B]
We won!

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN I] Even though we only
have eight players on our team!

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Hey, man, that big hit you made?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
You were something else.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
I know! It's weird.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
I'm so focused on the ball.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
Also, whenever I saw
the other team's faces,

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
it felt like I knew what
they were thinking about.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Better watch out.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
You keep talkin' big like that,
I might fall for you.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
Hey, Teach. You seen Haijima?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
He's back inside the gym.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
The second game's about
to start over at Court A.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Whoever wins determines
the team we play next,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
so he's watching.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
He didn't have to go
all by himself, though.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
He's probably
just being thoughtful

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
and letting you guys rest up
before the next match starts.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
Honestly, though.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
I knew Haijima had
volleyball experience,

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
but I didn't know
he could play that well.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
I even had a bunch of coaches

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
from other schools come up
to me afterwards wanting

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
to know all about the
star athlete I was coaching.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
Yeah? And, uh,
did anyone ask about me?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
Uh... No, I don't think so.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
That figures.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile Haijima's over here,
hogging all of the glory.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
You'll get your
time to shine soon.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
All right, keep up the momentum.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
But more importantly,
have fun out there!

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Right!

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
We're so close.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
Just two more wins.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
That's all we need.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
Uh... Was that out?

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[TAHARA A]
Brush it off.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
He's not worried
about missing a serve.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
Even if we get the point there,

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
he used that spike to
throw our team off balance.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Whoever that Haijima kid is,
he's got experience.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
Hey! Kuroba!

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Hold on,
I'm still on the left?

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Wake up!

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yeah, sorry.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
My body feels on edge.

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
Am I nervous? Why?

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Get a grip. We're in a game.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
Get the serve in
just like you always do.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
I forgot how.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
What foot do
I usually step off with?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
When do I toss the ball?

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
I can't remember anything.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
[whistle sounds]

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Eight-second violation?

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
Hey, ref! Time out!

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You're feeling
nervous, aren't you?

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
Is it 'cause you're
put on the spot?

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
Well, I've never had so
much riding on me before,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
so I'm not sure.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Figure out a way
to calm down then.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Seriously?

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
That's the best advice
you've got for me?

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
All I can do is help
out with the plays.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
I don't know anything
about being nervous.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
Look, Yuni.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
I'm on edge,
the same as you are.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
Dude, just try not
to worry about messing up.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
Right. Thanks.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
A pipe attack.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Back row attack.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Wait, there's a wall?

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
But how did...?

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Yuni? What's wrong?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
The game... I'm losing it.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
The blockers are focused on me.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Sorry. It couldn't be helped.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
They figured out you're the only
one who can get a decent hit.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
Stay calm and
watch the blockers.

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
We'll get them down to one,

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
then you'll start
making it through again.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yeah. Sure.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
Calm down and
watch the blockers.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
Watch the blockers.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
Watch the--

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Yuni!

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What? Come on.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
Why can't I get it in?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
Am I not jumping high enough?

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
Or am I exhausted?

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
I felt so light, but now it's
like my body's weighed down.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
We're losing all because of me.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
Tell me...

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.572 position:50% align:center
Somebody, help me...

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You're useless.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
No way. How did we win?

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
At some point I stopped
touching the ball all together.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
You see, Haijima?

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
The guy was an absolute
beast on that court.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
That's right. He had enough.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
And started
changing up his plays.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
First, he switched to dumps
and once they figured that out,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
he started going after rebounds.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
--[HAIJIMA] Get it up!
--Uh, okay!

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Then he got one
spike serve in after another.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
He kept scoring on his own.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
Almost like he
didn't need a team.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
We're nowhere near his level.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though,
how is he so good?

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need us.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
He can win any match.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
by himself.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Just you wait, Yuni.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna help you get your head
back in the game tomorrow.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
You've got this. I know it.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hey, Ryo. It's me.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so about today's game.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
What's Yuni doing?

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
It's past meet-up time.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
What'd his family say?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
[RYO] Apparently, he left
the house a while ago, but...

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
You don't think that he was
in some kind of accident?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR] An accident?
Don't be ridiculous.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Ooo, visitors!

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
Were you boys worried about me?

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
The hell is this?

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
You seem fine to me.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
What'd you do?

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
I worked all night
long on this flag.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
The plan was to take it
to the gym on my bike,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
but I lost my balance,
ended up in a ditch,

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
and sprained my ankle.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
You idiot.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Of course you were gonna
fall off your bike.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
Look at the size of that thing.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we
rushed over here for this.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
We both thought
you were really hurt.

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
Hold up, isn't your game
supposed to start soon?

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
So why are you here
instead of with your team?

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
'Cause I ran into
Yori on the way over,

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
and he told me you had
to be taken to the hospital.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I'm fine.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
So, hurry up and get over
to your match already!

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
The thing starts
in five minutes,

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
so I'm not gonna
make it in time.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
Besides, as long
as Haijima's there.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Hey, your ankle.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
Quit your whining and
get your butt to the game!

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
You hear me?

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
Won't matter if we hurry.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
You're still getting
there way after 10:30.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
So listen, Yori.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
Remember what you said
about Haijima's old school?

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
And how a bunch of his
classmates were bashing him?

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
Posting stuff online?

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
Well, I kinda did
the same thing last night.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
I called my other teammates, and
I was talking trash about him.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] As long as Haijima's
there, they'll be fine.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
He can win the game by himself.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need me.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
I didn't even want to play.

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
That's basically why
I went to check on Itoko,

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
so I'd have an excuse
for not showing up

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
and being in the game.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
I mean, really though...

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
What was I trying to do?

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
We lost? There's no way.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
It's only been an hour
since the game started.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
Why would I lie?

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
We lost during the semi-finals.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Forfeited the
match deciding third.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
As you can imagine, no one
was eager to stick around.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
But, how?

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
I mean, Haijima should've
won like yesterday.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
Are you stupid?

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
Yes, the team definitely
benefits with him on it,

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
but there's no way
he could win on his own.

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
Or did you forget?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
A player can't come into contact
with the ball twice in a row.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
Volleyball 101.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
You need a damn rulebook?

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
I guess you
didn't talk to Haijima

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
after the game yesterday, huh?

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
See, that was a surprise
attack and for that match,

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
it got the job done.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
But even he
realized the truth...

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
It wasn't going
to work a second time.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
He thought we could win,

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
as long as you
picked yourself back up.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
His words.

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
He said that?

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
You know how he is.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
Even though you weren't here,
he acted strong,

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
then ended up injuring
himself during the first set.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
I figured something must
have been off with him,

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
but he kept right on playing
and not letting on.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
Oh. Haijima, are you hurt?

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Yeah, just dislocated
my right middle finger.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
I'll drive you to
the hospital. Let's go.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.974 position:50% align:center
That's good.
At least you're alive.

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:50.810 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haijima. I was gonna-- 

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You made it loud
and clear what you think of me.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
Go home. It's over.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
He pushed another teammate

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
over the edge for not listening.

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
The kid tried to off himself.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I'm gonna decide
how I feel about you for myself.

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
[ADVISOR]
He thought we could win,

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
as long as you
picked yourself back up.

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Is this the end? It can't be.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
Our last middle school
tournament's over

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
and it's all my fault.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:24.678 position:50% align:center
I was the one off my game.

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:28.807 position:50% align:center
We lost 'cause of me
and then I just gave up.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.643 position:50% align:center
Even then, you wanted
to do everything you could

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:35.271 position:50% align:center
to help us win, and we did.

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:39.067 position:50% align:center
But afterwards,
I talked behind your back.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.152 position:50% align:center
like a coward.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.241 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Go home. It's over.

00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:54.040 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I don't want it to end.
Not like this.

00:22:54.124 --> 00:22:57.377 position:50% align:center
I still want to play.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.256 position:50% align:center
I want to play
volleyball with Haijima.
