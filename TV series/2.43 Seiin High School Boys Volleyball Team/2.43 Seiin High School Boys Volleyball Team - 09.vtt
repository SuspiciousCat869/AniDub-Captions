00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
[HATA] Sorry for stopping
by so early, Subaru,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.645 position:50% align:center
but I wanted to see
how you were doing.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
Feeling better, I hope?

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
My knees're getting' fixed up
no matter what it takes,

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.945 position:50% align:center
so just wait a year
for me, all right?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] By the way,
is there anybody else

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
from my grade
you've been thinking

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
about adding to the team?

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
Hmm... Let's see.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
First up, there's Jungo Takasugi
from Nanwa Middle School.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
Then, there's Issei Asamatsu,
one of your classmates.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
Yuhi Sawatari from
Komabiki Middle

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
and Ryudai Jinno from Okuetsu.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
And Ochi from Matsumotoichi?

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
Ochi?

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
No, the name's
not ringing a bell.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Mitsuomi Ochi.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
He doesn't stand out much,
but he's incredibly skilled.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
Oh... I'll keep
an eye out, then.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
Lemme write his name down
so I don't forget it.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Sounds like
you're making the dream team

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
from Fukui.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
Seriously, I'm all about that.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
Nothing's going to stop me
from going to Fukuho!

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
[RYOUN B]
Nice serve!

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
There's no quick!
Eyes to your left!

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
I'm not getting through.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
Hey! Up top!

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
--[MIMURA] Issei!
--[ASAMATSU] Right!

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
Nice save.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
Man, that was intense.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
In case you didn't notice,
you just beat us good.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have to
be you who scores.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
That's what you've
got teammates for.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
From what I've seen,
you're going places.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Thank you!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, we definitely
gotta look out for them.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Next up,
we have Seiin's number eight.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
But when it comes to Haijima,

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
I can't see what's unique
about his setting.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
There's no particular
direction where he excels.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
Or rather, nothing
he's terrible at.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
He pays more attention
to how the other team blocks

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
and less how his team
receives the ball.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
A genius and a huge pain.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
In short, the best way
to deal with him

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
is for us to keep
on the lookout for places

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
that will be hardest to defend.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
That's actually
way more difficult

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
than you're making it sound.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
If you're not able
to deal with Haijima,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
instead of focusing
on him go after Kuroba.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
If we can shut down
both first-years,

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
they'll be the
same team as last year.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
No way we're losing to Seiin,

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
a team that goes down in
the first round every season.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
Well, listen to you
getting' all fired up!

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
Ochi, you're so awesome!

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
Hold me!

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
Subaru, Jungo, and Issei,
you're taller than Kuroba,

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
so you'll be on the left.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
We'll force them
to make Kanno hit.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
That's the plan right now.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
He's really good at line shots,

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
so diggers, keep
your eyes open for that.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
As for Aoki, when he
and Haijima are up front,

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
watch for feints and dumps.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
All bases covered.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Subaru, wait!

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
You had another appointment

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
with Doctor Toyama
next Saturday, right?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do, but it's only
for my usual checkup.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
After it's done, be sure
to let me know how it went.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, Coach.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
Subaru!

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna play beach
volleyball with us or what?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50% align:center
So, you've got that much
leftover energy, do ya?

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
Then how does
waking up early tomorrow

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
for an extra practice sound?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Subaru! Don't make us wait!

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Man, what's
with this training camp?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
So lame.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
It's go time!

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
First- and second-years on a
team against the third-years!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You better bring it!

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
You realize you're encouraging
their behavior, right?

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
Whatever energy we've
got left over's for today.

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
Let's leave tomorrow's
practice out of it!

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
Haijima, how're
we stopping Mimura?

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
If we give that rocket arm
of his any opportunity to hit,

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
it's all over and we'll
have no way of stopping him.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
Meaning, we need to
find a way to make sure

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Mimura doesn't get a
chance to hit our serves.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
And if we can't do that,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
we should focus on
how to score as opposed

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
to focusing all our efforts
on keeping them from scoring.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you're saying
blocking's out of the question.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Not entirely.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
This is interesting.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
Aoki's asking
Haijima for advice.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
How 'bout it?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can come up
with a plan of attack for us?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
I've thought of at
least three strategies.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
I'll incorporate them
into practice today.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
We're counting on you.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
To think our team
that lost in the first round

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
every year is
really gonna make it

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
to the representative playoffs.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
We're finally gonna challenge
the Fukui champions.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
We should be proud of ourselves!

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
First up, we defeat Fukuho!

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
Then, the Spring Tournament!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
Subaru.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
Once your high school
tournament's over,

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
would you consider
having surgery again?

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
On my knees?

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
Uh... How come?

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
The Spring Tournament's
in January,

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
so for the time being,
you're in the clear.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
But basically,
you're walking around

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
with a couple of timebombs
in those knees of yours.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
You'll be attending
some major college

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
in the Kanto or
Kansai region, right?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, there are
offers on the table.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
Then you're fortunate.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
You can see some reputable
doctors in Tokyo or Osaka,

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
depending on
which school you go to.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
You'll most likely have
to take some down time

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
during college in order
to heal, maybe a year or two.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
Did you say two years?

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
You're young, Subaru,
but high school's nearly over.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
You should be thinking
about what comes next,

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
for the rest of your career!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] I really don't want
these opened up again...

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
Not to mention
sitting out for two years.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
Will I even bounce back
like I did before?

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
Uh! How rude of me.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
I didn't see you. Take my seat.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center
Much appreciated.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're that volleyball
player, aren't you?

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
Mimura, right?

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I am.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, I wasn't
entirely sure at first,

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
then I noticed the tracksuit.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.710 position:50% align:center
Keep doing your best out there.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
I sure will.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
[TEAM E]
That's Mimura from Fukuho.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
--[TEAM F] He's so cool!
--[TEAM E] Dude's tall!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but, um,
please take this, Subaru!

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Hey, thanks a bunch.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
Well, what do we have here?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I've seen these before.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
Are they new?

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
[TEAM A] I was walking through
the convenience store yesterday

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
and instantly bought 'em.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
They're raspberry milk flavored!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd like them
since you're into things

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
that're berry-flavored, right?

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Wow, how did you know that?

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
[TAKASUGI]
Subaru!

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
Coming or what?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
You're way late.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
The opening ceremonies are over.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
We're already seeded though.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
It's not like we
have a match today.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
Why are you
always getting hit on?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
You can't have any.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
Never asked!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
So, where'd Ochi run off to?

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
He's back over at headquarters.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
Coach has him doing
some sorta errand.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
[JINNO] Subaru, doesn't look
like anyone from Seiin is here.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
Well, that's not
surprising since Oda's team

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
doesn't have that many
first- or second-years.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
I don't expect
we'll see 'em around,

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
not until the
representative play-offs.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't doubt it.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
Yo, Kohei.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor
and don't screw up,

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
at least until
we play our new rivals.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
You don't win, you're not
gonna be in the play-offs.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
I'm getting all of my line shots
through and winning this!

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
I sure hope so.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, there's gonna be
a punishment waiting for you.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
Where did punishment come from?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
And what kind?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
Something good.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
A one-man cheer squad
for the girls after school!

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
Wha...? No way!

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
Gimme something less
humiliating, please!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
I'd rather jump in the moat

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
in front of the prefectural
office, fully naked.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
Cool, that works.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait!

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay, fine,

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
but only if the other
second-years have to as well.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
--Shut up!
--You're on your own!

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
The pressure's on, Kohei.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
Let's go find Ochi
and get outta here.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna watch
the other schools play?

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
Let's just worry about
our team being in top shape.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
Hey, here comes Ochi now.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
[SAWATARI] There's this
new place I've been meaning

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
to try for a while.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
So, Subaru, how'd things
go with Doctor Toyama?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
All good.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
No changes to report.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
Great to hear.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
Yep! Doc said I was
in perfect shape!

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
Then again, I have to be

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
if I'm gonna get you to
the Spring Tournament, right?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
This will be our final one.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
[JINNO]
You think if Kohei screws up...

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
I know our team will make it.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
We'll be playing
on that center court.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you, Ace.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
Yeah, naturally!

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
Next up! Fourth rotation!

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
Kuroba! Gotta move your feet!

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
Next, fifth rotation!

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
With two attackers up front-

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
All right, stop!

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
Haijima, you good?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
We should wipe down the floor

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
before things gets dangerous.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
You two outta energy?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
Capital "L" lame, my dudes.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Stop acting like
you didn't take a break!

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
It's time to get serious!

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
This training camp's three days.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
We have to perfect
our team by then!

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
--Do you wanna win?
--[TEAM] Yeah!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
Well, well, working hard, I see.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
What do you say, Oda?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
How about pairing up
with Hokao for this practice?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Kanno with Uchimura.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
Okuma with Kuroba.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
And Aoki with Haijima.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor and
make sure you get along

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
outside of practice,
too, all right?

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
Okay, how about a
friendly competition?

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
You know,
to help you get closer.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
We'll work on serving.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's the case,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
then there should be
some kinda prize.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
Wait, how about we say the duo

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
who wins gets to order
the others around?

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
That sounds less like a prize

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
and more like a form of torture.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
Then you won't need any
encouragement to try and win.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Look at it from
this perspective:

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
at least this'll
keep us on our toes.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
So, make sure you get along
with your partners.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're doomed.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
That's three in a row.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
How're we supposed to beat that?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
He's gonna hit 'em all without
letting Aoki serve once?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Why the hell do ya have to be

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
so competitive all
the frickin' time?

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
Haijima!

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me,
just keep hitting those targets!

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
Huh?! How'd he make that
shot with a jump floater?

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
If you hit the ball
in the right spot,

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
you can sorta control
the way it's going to curve.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
All done!

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
Court looks pretty clean,
wouldn't you say, Coach?

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
That's not fair.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Something tells me

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
he knew he was getting
paired with Haijima.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
Aoki's more calculating
than I thought.

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
All right, whoever's next,

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
go and do your best out there!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have
to work on hitting the ball

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
where you're aiming, Okuma.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
And Kuroba, when you know
where you're gonna strike,

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.072 position:50% align:center
instead of hitting
at a hundred percent,

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
try bringing it down
to about 70, okay?

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
Once we're done for the day,

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
you two will practice
your serves.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sir!

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
One more thing,

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
about those orders
I mentioned earlier--

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
--[OKUMA] What?
--[KUROBA] Huh?

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
You seriously mean
there's more to do?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
You still haven't received
my assignment yet.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
So not fair!

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
Dude, this sucks.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Quiet!

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
Since you were in last place,

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
you're gonna raise
your rank on your finals

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
for each subject by
at least 20 percent.

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Third, 10 percent.

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Second, five percent.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
If you're unsuccessful,
further punishment awaits.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
--Huh?!
--Huh?!

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
You can't do this!

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
This is super harsh,
even for you!

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
Students need to put
their studies first.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
Even if we go to
Tokyo in January,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
your finals still await.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
I'm not asking for
the impossible here.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
Say your current rank is 100,

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
you just need to go up 20 spots.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Ugggghhhh!

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
I heard that!

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
Don't you go sighing in relief

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
as if you're totally out
of the woods here.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
You mind telling me what
your grade is in modern lit?

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
I placed first.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.464 position:50% align:center
Not like this applies to me.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, how are your
Japanese classes? Good scores?

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm doing fine.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
No, you're not!

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
We're doing this.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
Your vice captain orders you.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
How'd the girls do?

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
Lotta newbies on the team.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing they busted out
in their second round.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
I did hear Fukuho kept up
their winning streak.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
Their team's pretty strong,

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
even without any
of their third-years.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
I heard they also did
training camp last week.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
A pretty intense regimen, too.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
They practiced against a
college team and everything.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
For real, those are
some impressive connections.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
They've got alums, after all--

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
players competing
at the university level.

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
It's easy for them
to pull strings.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
Actually, I was talkin'
about how good you are

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
at gathering intel.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
Aoki.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
Y'know, for not having
played any sports

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
back in middle school,
you're in excellent shape.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
My first year, I was
nothing but skin and bones.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
Huh. You must've
been practicing a ton then.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
Dude, try not to go
around mentioning that.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
You're gonna ruin
my whole image here.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
Also, there's no need
for the compliments.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
Fine, but you
seem okay letting me

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
have my way running practice.

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I don't need
to tell you this,

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
but the chances of us
winning are slim

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
unless we connect like
we should've during prelims.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thank you, really.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
There's no need
for gratitude, either.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
You're not the only one
who wants to win.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
It's the end of a long
journey for me and Oda.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
It would be sweet
to go out on top.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
You know, after graduation,

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
I'm not going
to keep on playing.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
Is it really that surprising?

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.904 position:50% align:center
This is just a club for me,
not a passion.

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
Can't lie, though.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
The last three years I spent
on the team were pretty great.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
I've always been the tall kid.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
I never saw it as
any kind of strength,

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
but when I started
playing volleyball,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
I felt like I finally
found a good use for it.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
I'm glad Oda
talked me into joining.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.213 position:50% align:center
He's a real pal.

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
He asked you?

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Yeah, as soon as
we started high school.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
You're like some kinda giant.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
So, you wanna play
volleyball with me?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
Volleyball? With you?

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm not the
tallest person in the world,

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
but wait till my growth spurt.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:49.611 position:50% align:center
Then, I'm gonna be a super ace
like Gaichi, you'll see!

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
What's a super ace?

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
The best spiker on the team,

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
and also the coolest player who
everyone relies on most of all!

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
So, are you on board or what?

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
Honestly, although
I can't thank Oda enough,

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
the reality is I don't think
I'll play past high school.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
The finals are two weeks away.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
If we lose, Oda and I are
retiring from volleyball, but--

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
I'll probably end up going
to a university around here.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
So, not like it'll be
goodbye or anything.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll keep in touch
when we come back into town.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Haijima!

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Promise we're gonna make it
to the Spring Tournament.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
And no matter what, I'll back
your strategy every time.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Trust me, we'll make it.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
Didn't even need
to think that over, huh?

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
Because I've decided.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
You're dependable.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't still be
here if I wasn't.

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
It's still only November.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
Too early for snow.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
[car honks]

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
Kuroba!

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
Good luck riding
your bike in this weather.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and go get ready.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
You can ride down there with us.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
Well, Seiin?

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
Everybody with me?

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
It's strange how even though

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
we've been here
a bunch of times,

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
the snow makes this place feel
like we're in another world.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
What are you going
on about, captain?

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
We're in our own prefecture.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, just
waxing poetically.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
Anyway, back to business.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
Let's take down Fukuho
and head to Tokyo!

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
Our team is the dark horse
with just eight measly players.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
And yeah, we're facing
an army of champions.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
At least according
to the local paper,

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
that's the position
we're in here.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
So, what do you say
we prove everyone wrong!

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yeah!

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Think fast!

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
Close one.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
What the heck is Fukuho doing?

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Subaru Mimura.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
Not a single care
in the whole world.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Nice.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
All right! Bring it in!

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
Man, that wore me out.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
Guys, what did I just say?

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
It's been too long

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
since I've played center court
at a venue this size.

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
The team representing
Fukui's decided here.

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:17.629 position:50% align:center
We're doing this.

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.005 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:20.632 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Dude! Your face just now!

00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:23.301 position:50% align:center
You looked almost like
a girl at a cake buffet,

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:24.636 position:50% align:center
and you were totally committed

00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:26.596 position:50% align:center
to eating a slice of
every kind they had.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
[siren blaring]

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:31.267 position:50% align:center
That sounds like an ambulance.

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:35.939 position:50% align:center
Our team's all here and
there's no audience yet.

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:37.148 position:50% align:center
That only leaves--

00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:38.942 position:50% align:center
Fukuho.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
It looks like one of the players
on their team got hurt.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
It's not Mimura.

00:22:57.627 --> 00:22:59.337 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Then who was it?
