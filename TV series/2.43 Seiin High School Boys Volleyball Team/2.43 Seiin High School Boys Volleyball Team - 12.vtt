Whoa. I can't believe we won.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
We actually beat them!

At long last, we were finally

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
able to break your
winning streak.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
Wasn't easy.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
You talented young men
put up quite the fight.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
I commend you on your efforts.

Thank you very much, sir!

Don't you worry, son.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
Uh, sir?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
This isn't the end
of the road for you,

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
and you'll grow stronger
from here on out.

We love you, Subaru!

[MIMURA] It's been seven years
since I first made that promise.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I couldn't take you
to nationals in the end.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center

[TOGURA]
Really?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the
three amazing years.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
These guys will be ones
to lead Fukuho to victory!

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Hope we'll see you back in the

Thank you, third years!

[ODA]
I think he'll be okay.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
I hope whatever
he's going through

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
won't hurt him at nationals.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
Haijima's basically
your secret weapon.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
Speaking of hurt, did you
bust your knee earlier?

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Aw, man!

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
I never thought you'd end up
being the jerk to block me!

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
I guess it's my fault
for underestimating you.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
Let's play each other
again in uni.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
Of course, it might
take me a little while

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
to circle my way around.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
Stay patient for me
in the meantime, will ya?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
I promise.

--Damn it.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center

aren't crying your eyes out.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] While you're stuck
keeping a brave face?

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
That's no fair.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day, I got
nothing to feel bad about.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
At least I didn't
have to make a speech.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
If I did, I would've made
a lame joke about being grateful

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
that you got hurt instead of me.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
So, it's probably
better that we lost.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong, though.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
We didn't let our guards down
for a single moment.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
Their team demolished us,
fair and square.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
Do you remember that serve?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
I should've said the ball
was out without hesitation

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
instead of making us chase it.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
Wow. I can think of a
gazillion mistakes I made.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
Everybody messes up
during matches sometimes.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
We played the best
game we could.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
Stop beating yourself up.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
I know that, but if
we hadn't screwed up,

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
we could have turned
things around.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
We panicked and lost every deuce
we should've had in the bag!

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's my fault.
I couldn't score that one point.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
I didn't want to lose.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
I wanted to win.

So badly!

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
Enough! Just shut up.

There you go.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
Relax, dude, I can feel
your cast digging into me.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
I, uh, I'm sorry for not
taking you to nationals.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
You'd better cut that out.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare apologize.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
Bet you were planning
to cry alone later, huh?

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not going
anywhere, you idiot!

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center

You're still here?

Hi, Coach.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
Not to be sappy,
but sorry 'bout today.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
You've mentored me
since grade school,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
and I've kept you waiting
eight years for nothing.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
Quit moaning.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50% align:center
I waited for you
because I wanted to.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
You did great, kid!

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
Yep, there's no doubt you
gave it everything you had.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
This loss isn't your fault.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
I should've done more.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
[TAKASUGI]
Subaru.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
We're so sorry.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
We let you down.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
We should've
supported you more.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
Knock it off. C'mon.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry!

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Whatever it takes, I'll be back.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
Even if that dream's
a bit farther away.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
I'm way too deep in my feelings
to even think of giving up.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
Mark my words.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
I'll get my surgery,
scrape through my PT,

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
and once I'm ready,
I'm playing volleyball.

Crap, there's a game!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center

because of the snow?

Huh? Why'd you guys drive
all the way out here?

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
Hey, you could sound nicer.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
Kuroba's folks want to
throw us an after-game party

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
at their place, so they
figured they might as well

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
give us a ride, right?

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center

Yep.

You're the best. C'mere!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
Because of you,
we actually beat Fukuho.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
The odds are against us,
but I still think we can win.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
You probably think I'm
dreaming, don't you, Haijima?

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
You can say it.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
It's not a dream.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
I can see the eight
of us in uniform,

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
stepping onto that orange center
court at the Tokyo Metropolitan.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
It's happening.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center

make it there someday!

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Pay attention.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna explain this
one more time.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
First, we agreed on this
at the serving challenge,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
so no complaining.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
You guys came in fourth,
which means you'll need

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
to improve your scores
by 20% on each midterm.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
Those who came in third
will raise theirs by 10%.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
And 5% for second place.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
If you fail to follow
through for any reason,

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
there will be a penalty.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
Uh, can I bow out
since I did best?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center

I don't think I'm mentally
prepared to hear it out loud!

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
We'll be facing Shofu High,
which is in Tokushima.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
Does that school have
a good reputation?

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Whaddya know
about their team?

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
I'm fairly sure this'll be their
first appearance at nationals.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Not too different from us.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
We lucked out, if you ask me.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN sighs]

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Then that settles it, right?
This'll be a super easy victory!

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Not so fast.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
Take a closer look
at how we're positioned.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
We play the top-seeded
team in round three.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
And what does that say
about them exactly?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] It means they're the
toughest players in the country.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
Prelims to nationals,
they managed to dominate

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
every tournament they
played this year.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Fukuoka powerhouses,
Miboshi High School.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
So, you're saying
they're good?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Yes, obviously.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
We might hit Keisei
Academy in round four.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Tokyo teams go hard.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
With that much competition,
they must be stellar.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
Love that for them.
We're screwed.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
So, everyone is incredible.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Yep, they sure are.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, why the gloomy
faces all of a sudden?

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
We're making our
debut, aren't we?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
As the underdogs, the only
thing we can do is our best!

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
Let's keep climbing higher,
one step at a time.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
What else can we do?

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Even if we wanted to,

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
it's not like we can
back out at this point.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
When you put it that way,

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose we've
got anything to lose.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
There's no good reason to be
scared of Miboshi or Keisei!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
Time for us to take
down the nationals!

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN chattering]

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hm?

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
What's up with you?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Uh, Haijima? You okay?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Yeah, don't worry.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Is he for real?

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
Why isn't he excited?

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I think we got here a
bit too early, right, Haijima?

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
[sighs] What's gotten
into you lately?

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
You been acting kinda weird.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
You've seemed depressed
ever since we saw the match ups.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
--I'm starting to get worried--
--[ODA] Level with me, Aoki.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
Think we can win
the Spring Tournament?

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
It probably isn't realistic.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, it's a longshot.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
Don't let them see you!

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
We're still just
a bunch of rookies.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
Plus, we don't have
any reserve players.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
I don't see us sweeping
the whole thing.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's an uphill
climb for the underdogs.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
I suppose you're right.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'd be a safer bet
to shoot for top four

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
and at least make it
to the center court.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] Not to be a downer,
but it'll take nothing short

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
of a miracle for that to happen.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
If you think that
idea's impossible,

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
then you're gonna lose it
once you hear the other

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
pipe dreams I've got
spinning around my head.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Go ahead, try me.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Do you remember that match?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
You might say it inspired
a new ambition in me,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
thanks to Haijima and Mimura.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
I'm doing it.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna pursue
volleyball in college.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
I know it sounds crazy,

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
but I'm not ready to give up
on what I wanna do yet.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Playing Fukuho made
me realize that.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
[AOKI chuckles]

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Wait a sec,
what're you chuckling for?

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
You realize you've never
mentioned quitting volleyball?

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
That's coming out of nowhere.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
I never said or
implied at any point

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
that I thought you
should pack it up.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
Well, don't start then,

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
because killing it on the court
is all I've got in this life!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
[AOKI laughs]

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Know what, Aoki?

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
I always thought that you were
different from the rest.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
You could have so much going for
you outside of running warm-ups.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
With your skills, you
could drop everything

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
and walk away from this
game if you wanted to.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Thing is, and I realize
this is gonna sound selfish,

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
but there's something important
I've been wanting to ask you.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
Shoot.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
Keep playing volleyball
with me, okay?

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
Do we stand a chance, or are
we just chasing a fairy tale?

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
I plan on winning.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
That's been the case
this whole time.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's big talk,

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
considering you've been in a
funk since we saw the bracket.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
I don't see the point in
getting emotional over it.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
We're facing off against
a powerhouse school.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
That might just beef us up
and make things easier for us

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
in later games.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
Whoa. That's a surprisingly
practical way of looking at it.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
But about yesterday, you were
really down, weren't you?

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
I didn't make that up?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
I felt unsure. Conflicted.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Because none of it's enough.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
Could you be a
little more specific?

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
I want more for us and Oda.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
For us to win better medals
than the ones we just got.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
But that still wouldn't be
epic enough for me either.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
I want more,
something even bigger!

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Don't you hear how
stupid you sound?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
Bigger my butt.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
Everything that you're
describing would be plenty epic!

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
Why did I bother
being concerned?

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
You weren't in a funk yesterday,

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
you were sulking around
like a spoiled brat!

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you desperately need
to find a new hobby.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
Are we even ready
to be playing

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
against college students?

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
We're here because
Coach Hata invited us

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
to a special joint practice
with teams from all over.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
We won't get an opportunity
like this again.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Right. Our mission's
to soak up everything we can

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
and then use it
in the tournament.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
You boys ready to sweat?

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN]
Yeah!

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Crap. No towel.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Wanna use mine?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks, man.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't gawk.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
They're making me use
these even though

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
I can totally walk
fine without 'em.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
So, how's practice coming?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
You guys are heading out
after New Year's, right?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Well, that's
the plan, anyway.

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Why're you suddenly
acting so mild-mannered?

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna
shoot me the evil eye?

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] I don't see
a reason to do that.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
That your way of saying

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
you don't see me as
a threat anymore?

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
Because that would
definitely ruin my day.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
What? You have got to be
kidding me, four eyes.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
You sure do know
how to bum me out.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
I was watching
you guys practice.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
I noticed right off the bat
that you definitely weren't

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
as focused as you
were at prelims.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
Like you were just another
decent player among many.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Question for you: the thought
of winning at nationals,

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
was it enough to push you?

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
Huh? I can hardly believe
you're actually asking me that.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
I chased that for three years.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
If you have any doubt how bad
we wanted that moment

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
to happen for Fukuho, then
you've got some balls, dude.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I apologize.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
What a joke.

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
You really are on another
planet, aren't you?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
Once you get to the
Spring Tournament,

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
the other teams'll bring
you down to earth.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
There's always someone
better than you.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
True.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Also, it must be so
frustrating to deal with,

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
sitting on the bench.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
It sucks. I feel useless.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Then there's the pent-up energy.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
So, I can't sleep at night,
just lay awake.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
Which means I drown in thoughts
I shouldn't be thinking.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
It's way too easy to
spiral into hopelessness.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
Know what?

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
That reminds me of something
a friend said once.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
Thing is, if you ever feel
betrayed by volleyball,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
I kinda suspect it might
hit you pretty hard.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
It was Kuroba.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
He thinks I'm rushing and
getting ahead of myself.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Well, I'll tell you this much:

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
when you get injured,
the regrets flood in.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
But you also realize some things
you never realized before.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Everything you took for
granted suddenly disappears

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
and the dreams you were
working to achieve?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
They come into clearer focus.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
You understand how much
they meant to you.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
As humiliating as it is
to admit, it becomes clear

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
how much you love the game

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
and that you'd give
anything to play it.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
'Cause in my opinion,
you shouldn't be scared.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
Would've been cool
if we could've played

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
on the same team, but never
say never, am I right?

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
The junior championships.
Know about those?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
I'm scheduling my knee surgery
at the beginning of the year.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
After that,
it's college in Tokyo.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
Then I'll continue my PT

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
and come back in fighting
shape the next year.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
From there I'm gonna work
my way up to the U21 league.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
You and Kuroba are still young.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
You'll probably qualify
for U19 soon.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
It rarely happens,
but there are candidates

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
that do get picked
for both sometimes.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
If you're scouted,
you'll be playing abroad.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
We'd be spiking against
top-tier athletes our age

00:18:58.513 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
from around the world.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but before
that can happen,

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
you'll have to get to
center court first.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Hey! Sorry,

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
but I've gotta go
talk to Kuroba.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Later!

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
Guess that towel's yours now.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
It's happening!

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
I started getting worried,
so I came out here...

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] We're getting
picked for U19 and U21!

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Then we'll finally
be able to play

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
on the same team
as Subaru Mimura!

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna explain what
those numbers mean? Slowly?

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
It's the national youth team.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
The junior players
that'll represent Japan.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
If we're picked,
we get to play abroad!

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
Overseas?

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
Exactly. We'll travel,
which is why

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
we need to clean up at the
Spring Tournament first.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
We're gonna dominate that
center court together!

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Try to relax, would you?

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
Take it one step at a time!

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Jeez. You never
slow down, do you?

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
I remember you were bent
on going to Hokushin'etsu

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
all the way back
in middle school.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
Old habits die hard, huh?

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
Is it me, or do you
always have to punch it

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
zero to 60 like a madman?

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm sure
they'd pick you,

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
but I doubt I'd ever be
considered for a team like that.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
I'll personally see to it
that you are.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Uh--

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
You're coming
everywhere with me,

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
'cause you're basically
my right-hand man.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Are you being shady?

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
I dunno know why, but I feel
like there's an insult in there.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Your skills are
gonna take you far,

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
'cause when you play,
you practically sprout wings

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
like you're flying.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
I told you, as long
as I'm your ace,

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best
anytime you need me.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
I plan on living up
to those words, got it?

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
Keep playing volleyball with me.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'm gonna get greedy.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
Easy victories?

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
Those aren't good enough for me.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Kuroba, get ready.

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
Let's play volleyball
as long as we can.

00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:55.000 position:50% align:center
Here we are. On to center court.

00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:56.126 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.714 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA, HAIJIMA]
And to the world beyond that.
