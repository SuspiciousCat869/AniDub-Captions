00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
All right! Bring it in!

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
Man, that wore me out.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Guys, what did I just say?

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
Idiots!

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
You knew I was fine

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
with you having some
fun during warmups,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
but what happened out there?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
And you!

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to
be this team's captain!

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
You should've known when things
were getting outta hand!

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about what happened.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
It was all my fault!

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna change the
fact Ochi's suffered a fracture.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
Our crowd support
just took a huge dip!

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
Imagine if something
happened to you!

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
We'd be finished!

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
You realize you
boys can't afford

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
to lose this match now,
for Ochi's sake.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.812 position:50% align:center
I want every one of you

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
to get your heads
back into the game!

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
What happened to Ochi
really sucks, but I'm fine.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness only
one of us got injured.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
Before this match
became about him,

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
we all came here to win

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.080 position:50% align:center
and nothing about
that has changed.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
Let's get out there
and crush Seiin!

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yeah!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:30.715 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Welcome.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
We'll now begin the playoffs

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:36.179 position:50% align:center
for the Fukui Prefect Spring
National Representative team.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.681 position:50% align:center
For the boys' finals,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.976 position:50% align:center
the two teams competing are
Fukuho Technical High School

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
up against
Seiin Nanafu High School.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.107 position:50% align:center
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
introducing the starting
lineup for Fukuho Tech.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
Number one, Subaru Mimura.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:59.369 position:50% align:center
Number two, Jungo Takasugi.
Number three...

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] The louder they cheer,
the stronger they make me.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win this!

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO SQUAD] Go, go,
go, go go! Go, Fukuho!

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
[HATA] Looks like they aren't
starting with Oda after all.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
Their new lineup's matching
their heights with ours.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
I plan on ending this quickly,

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
before they even
get off the ground.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
But if the game goes longer,

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
we'll still have the advantage.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like Seiin
has even had the chance

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
to play an official
five set match yet.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
Subaru, be honest,
are you sure you're good?

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
Why, did someone say something?

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
Well, sort of, yeah.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
When you fell,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
Tomoki said it kinda looked
like Ochi was protecting you.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
He seemed worried
you might feel responsible

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
for what happened outside.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
He's got absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
Ochi and I are both
on the exact same page.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Thank you for patience.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
The match is about to begin.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
Please give both teams
a huge round of applause.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
Listen, make sure you
get all the sets to me,

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
just like we
did during practice.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
Set it up!

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
Keep it up, guys!

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
Remember, we're gonna bring
this match home for Ochi!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
It's almost like you guys
weren't even listening to me.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
Whatever, our team's
gonna win this,

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
whether it be for Ochi or not.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
It's falling forward?

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
Nice! Good call
on that one, Yuhi!

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Now it's not falling.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Kuroba! Go!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yes!

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Don't worry 'bout it!

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
Keep calling those shots!

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
And eyes on the left side!

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Ochi,
everything's going according

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
to your strategy.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
I made up my mind--at
that moment,

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
when Ochi protected my fall...

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Kuroba.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
He isn't great
with overhand serves

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
or when the ball wavers.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
So, whoever's doing
jump float serves,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
make sure they land near him.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Yeah, I got it.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
You already told us.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
Listen close.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
Everyone else, make sure
they don't worry about me.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
I'm a klutz, and they
should all laugh about it.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
Promise me.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
Promise.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
I'm sorry.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'll have to be away

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
from the front lines
for a while,

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
but I'll be back
as soon as I can.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Before Ochi comes back...

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
...we're gonna end this!

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
Hell yeah!

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center
We owned that first set!

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
Let's keep up the momentum!

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yeah!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks, Och--

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
No prob.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, thank you.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO SQUAD]
Who is our hero?

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
Subaru's our hero! Go!

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
Weird. It's like we're the
visiting team or something.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
They won that set by seven.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
Fukuho took control
over the flow of the game.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, guys.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get any in.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
That's because their
entire team is locked on you.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
Don't let them get to you

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
and just focus on
hitting every ball you can.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
All it proves is they
see you as a genuine threat,

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
so keep your head up.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Fukuho's got three
blockers covering Kuroba.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] They keep aiming
their serves at him, too.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
We're hitting the ball back
at less than 20 percent.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
Not only that, he's not
even playing seriously yet.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'll dump, and--

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
Mimura, too?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Shake it off!

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Relax and let's
get this next one!

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
They're four points ahead.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
We can't let them
extend their lead anymore.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
Uchimura!

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
Their lead's down to three.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
We can catch up in no time!

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
[KANNO]
Free ball!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Move!

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Just two points. Not for long!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
Time out!

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.631 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Did it!

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Just one more point.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[KANNO] I had that 13th point
if you would've let me hit it.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
Honestly?

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
You're being a
little pushy, Haijima.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
There was a better
opportunity and I took it.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
You'd have done
the same thing there.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
[KANNO]
Yeah, but--

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
With Kuroba marked, we've
gotta break through 'em.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
I need all of you
to concentrate more.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I'm not gonna
be able to set to any of you!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
Do you want to make it
to Tokyo or not?

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
Dude! You hear yourself?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
No.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
If I don't change something,
history'll repeat itself.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
I don't want
to make everyone mad.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
I want to win as a team!

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
For all of us
to go to nationals!

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
You realize we can't
really argue with him.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
He's just telling us the facts,

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
and we're the ones
forcing him into that role.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
We decided to give it our all,
to win and go to nationals.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
But we're barely hanging on,

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
and the only reason
we are is because of him.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
I'm backing Haijima on this one.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Good call. Thank you.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Nice save, Hokao!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
[KANNO]
We just need one more!

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! We're tied now!

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Hokao, Kanno!

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
Great hustle out there!

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
Yeah, nice work.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
Well, if Vice Cap'n
Aoki's got your back...

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
You can count on us
to do the same!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
Let's finish this set!

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
That sound good?

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
All right, you're up, Kuroba.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
[HATA] Seiin's number eight
really pulled one over on us.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
So that's the genius from Tokyo.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
But he's just one player,
while we're the superior team.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Don't lose heart

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
and we'll turn things
around in the third set.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
Tighten your blocks and
watch out for their spikes!

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
Yuhi, I want you to keep

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
a sharp eye on
number eight and his dumps.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
It's exactly like they said.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
He's a monster.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
Ochi, I need ice.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
Whoops, sorry 'bout that.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
Force of habit, I guess.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
Ice! I'll bring you some!

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
Sweet. Thank you.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Everything will be fine.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
My knees are holding up.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
I don't feel any pain.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
But that monster, number eight.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
What would you do
if you were here, Ochi?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
[TAKASUGI]
Subaru.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
He's planning on coming

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
from the hospital
straight to the bench.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
What a freak.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
He's the craziest
one on the team.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
[TAKASUGI]
Guess it's time.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
Welp!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
Time to wrap up the
next two sets as a gift

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
for when Ochi
makes it back here!

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Get a load of that confidence.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
He's only looking at the court,

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
playing volleyball with
the purest of feelings.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
There was time I used
to be just like him.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
But now, there's
more at stake for me.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
Can't say I envy you, kid.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Because there's
so much riding on this,

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
I feel like I can do
something you can't.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
Hey, Subaru!

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
The first set's going to you,
so blast it in there!

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
They call me the Demon Bazooka.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
I don't know who
came up with that one.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
I thought it was lame.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
I've gotta admit though,
it's growing on me.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Try and stop this,
all two and half blockers!

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Mimura took it up a notch.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
That spike just now,

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
the speed and sound
were way different!

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Stay cool! You've got this!

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
Don't let 'em get too far ahead!

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
Every point counts, guys!

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Cut him off at one!

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
Like vice cap'n says!

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about him!

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Now! Touch!

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.544 position:50% align:center
Block it, Kuroba!

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
The hell?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
That cross shot was insane.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
--All right!
--All right!

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
The Demon Bazooka strikes again.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
He's trying to copy him?

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
In that case--

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
I touched the net?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[KANNO]
Let it go!

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Finally.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] We're going
to take back this game!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
When Kuroba goes to the back,
we're switching out.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna leave the court
without doing anything?

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
On the left!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.078 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Hit a cross shot!

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
Break through 'em!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
Haijima, stop running!

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
--Let go!
--The game's paused!

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.431 position:50% align:center
Kuroba!

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I'm super late
thanks to the snow!

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
Hope the game... Yuni?

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I knew Kuroba was gonna end up

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
with three blockers defending,

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
but I forced him to hit anyway.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
What was I thinking?

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Haijima!

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
Hey, no reason
to panic, Haijima.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Time out.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Thank you!

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
No sweat.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Man, five points ahead already.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
Fukuho's not messing around.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
I felt like we might've been

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
on the same level during
our practice match,

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
but the way
they're playing today,

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
they're an even bigger obstacle.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
But having said all that,
I still think we can win.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're a little team
with only eight players,

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
and totally unbalanced.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.168 position:50% align:center
But you know what?

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
We're still gonna beat
Fukuho and go to Tokyo.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
I'm fully convinced of that.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
You probably think I'm dreaming,
don't you, Haijima?

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and say it.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
t's not a dream.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
I saw it from the beginning.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
The eight of us stepping out
onto that orange center court,

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
at the Tokyo Metropolitan
Gymnasium.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
Well, you heard what the
brains of our team said.

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
This is the same guy
who said my height

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
would be a disadvantage
against Fukuho.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
So, you know he's not
about sugarcoating anything.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
Listen, we're holding out
till Kuroba gets back,

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
whenever that may be, till the
ball falls on the last set.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
Because this team is
gonna win, aren't we?

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
Before we go, I'm sorry.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
I'll never be
the same as Mimura.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
Bottom line, I know
you're hurtin' out there,

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
but gimme all the sets you can.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
Remember when I asked you
to wait for my answer?

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to hear it?

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Listen, Oda.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
You said you
wanna play this game.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
For one day, even just a second.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
For as long as you can.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
But are you willing to
stay off the court as well?

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
To take one for
the good of the team?

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
Are you?

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
Or did you only intend
to put yourself first?

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Ask anyone, and they'll tell you

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Fukuho is Mimura's team.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
But ours?

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make any difference

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
whether it's seen
as mine or not.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
I'm not the one who's going
to be scoring out in front.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
We've got Kuroba
and Kanno, and you.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
If my contribution to
the team lies elsewhere,

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
that's good enough for me.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
I won't be self-conscious
as long I'm helping out.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
I'll play with no regrets!

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Guess they got
back onto their feet.

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
Without their
number seven on the court,

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
Seiin's a wounded lion.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
They'll still fight with
everything they've got.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
And we'll do everything
to shut 'em down!

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Dummy.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
You gave me a scare back there.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.620 position:50% align:center
I battle the snow and
finally make it down here

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
only to find you're being
carried off, gushing blood.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
Stop saying the same
thing over and over!

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
So annoying.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
Somebody's in a bad mood.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
Embarrassed 'cause your nose

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
starting bleedin'
in front of everyone?

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
You always were obsessed
with appearances.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
Remember the sports
festival way back

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
when you were in
the third grade?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
You got all dizzy
and had a nosebleed.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
Threw a fit in front of Auntie

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
and said, "Oh, don't
make me go back to--"

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
I told you to shut up already!

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
As if it makes any
difference how I look!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
If I had to go out there naked,

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't hesitate
for a second!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
You know there are
TV crews here, right?

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
You'd be kicked out for sure.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
As if!

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
By the way, tilting your head up
won't stop the bleeding.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I'm just trying
to get it to clot!

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Hmm...

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
So, you're not planning
on running away

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
the way you did last year?

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a relief.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Of course I'm not!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and clot. Clot! Clot!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Oh, Haijima.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
Someone call time out?

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
What happened
during the third set?

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
We lost. 16 to 25.

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Just leave for a bit.

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
There's no need to get snippy.

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
How?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.711 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Kanno was acting as
the ace while you were gone,

00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
and Oda tried
his best on defense--

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.884 position:50% align:center
But their lead
slowly started growing

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
until they took the set.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.389 position:50% align:center
The fact is, you're the only one

00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
who can get a
spike past their defense.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.018 position:50% align:center
We need you for
the last two sets.

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:34.104 position:50% align:center
I just don't see any other way.

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:37.232 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I'm fine now. Let's go.

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:40.026 position:50% align:center
Fine? Yeah, right!

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.821 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Damn it. Why now?

00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:44.656 position:50% align:center
Stop bleeding!

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:48.660 position:50% align:center
I still haven't done
what I needed to out there.

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:52.580 position:50% align:center
I can't let it end,
not like this.

00:22:57.002 --> 00:23:01.089 position:50% align:center
Oh... Not the reaction
I was expecting.
