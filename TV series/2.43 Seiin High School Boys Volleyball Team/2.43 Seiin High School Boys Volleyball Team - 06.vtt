00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Subaru!

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Over here!

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
Tomoki. You keep on
setting the ball to me.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
We got this!

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
We still have a chance!

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.924 position:50% align:center
We're not done yet!

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
Hey, Coach.
You think they'll pull through?

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
Of course they will.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
Coming in hot!

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50% align:center
Subaru. Give it to 'em!

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Fukuho Technical High School.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center
They've repped our
district in the Inter-High

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
and Spring Tourneys
for seven years straight.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
Seven whole years.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
they've been winning

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.887 position:50% align:center
ever since we were
in grade school?

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.138 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
That's right.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
So, if we wanna make it
to the Spring Tournament

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
and show up for Fukui,
we'll have to beat them first.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
Which means taking
down Mimura, too.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.024 position:50% align:center
Wait, who're you
talking about now?

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:52.445 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Subaru Mimura,
Fukuho's ultimate ace.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
[ODA] People call him
the Demon Bazooka

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
because he's the
best spiker in Fukui.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.956 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Hey, chin up!

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
Eyes on the prize.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.127 position:50% align:center
Ochi. We los--

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] It's almost time for
the Spring Tournament.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
And I'm expecting you
to bring us all the way

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center
to the center court, buddy.

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
You make it sound so easy.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
But don't worry,
I'll take you there.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
Line up, guys!

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.893 position:50% align:center
Stop crying,
there's always next year.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center
You're looking like
a bunch of losers.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
C'mon, shake it off!

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
And look alive!

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Here, Coach.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
I cut together some footage

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
from our practice match
with Kodzu High.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
Good work.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
So, what'd you think
about the match?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
Their defenders kept
piling up on the left side.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
Subaru ended up
getting blocked a lot.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
I mean, we didn't lose
any points, but still...

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
By the way,
do you mind reserving

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
the AV room for us
this Saturday?

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Yes, sir.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ochi.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Have you decided who's
taking over manager duties?

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
I wasn't going
to step down just yet.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
You sure 'bout that?

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to college?

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
As long as Subaru keeps winning,
I'll keep doing my job.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] It happened the summer
of my first year in high school.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
I got hurt during practice.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
I couldn't believe it.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
My dream was
to play beside Subaru,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
to go to nationals with him,
the golden boy of Fukui.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
Team manager? Really?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
Kida's already
a third-year student.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
Once the Inter-High's finished,

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
I want him to quit so
he can focus on exams.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
I'm not asking you simply
because you got injured.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
It's honestly because
you're perfect for the job.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
Like that's really what
I wanna be doing with my time.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Huh?
You come here, too, Ochi?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
Anyway, was'sup?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
Mimura. Uh, wait. What're you--?

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Dude, nobody calls me that.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
My name's Subaru,
so you can just use that.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
Oh, 'kay.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] I messed up
my knees in middle school, too.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
I got scars on both legs.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
Surgeries.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
But, you've never missed
any tournaments.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, this last one
happened during spring break

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
before third year
and the first one

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
was a year before that, I think.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
And you're back.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
But, why?

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
I just stopped by
for my usual checkup.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
They said I'll be fine as long
as I take good care of them.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
But enough about me, dude.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
How're you holdin' up?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Well, they
told me I'd have to be

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
in physical therapy
for four months.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
Long haul, huh?

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
But if everything goes well,

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
you should be able to
play the Newcomer Match.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
And make the starting lineup?

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
Fat freakin' chance.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Not that I'd heal in time.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Doesn't everyone
have a fair shot--

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
No, they don't.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
You have no idea what it's like.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
The second I fell,

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
the coach practically wrote me
off to team manager.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
But you wouldn't understand,
so save the pep talk.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
Yo, wait a sec. Hey!

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
Why'd I go off like that?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
Whoa! But your knees!

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
Why you trying to ghost on me?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
I wasn't finished talking.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
Look, everything I said earlier,
I didn't--I didn't mean it.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I think
you're incredible.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
I never should've
snapped at you.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
But I-I can't look
at it the same way you do.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
I need to concentrate
on getting better,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
so I can get back
to playing again.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
Sure, I get it.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
But then, I start
thinking 'bout stuff,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
and I get so depressed it hurts.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Do you regret it now?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
Coming to Fukuho?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned,
here's the truth.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
There's no
other school for miles

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
that stands a chance
of making nationals.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
And that's the reason
why you chose to enroll.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
That right?

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Mm.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
So why not give manager a try?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna
mope around anyway,

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
then you should go for it

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
'cause that way you'll
get on the bench for sure!

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
What kinda dumb logic is that?

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
Ochi, you wanna be at the center
court this spring, don't you?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
You heard me.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna go
or do you want out?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I want to go.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
But how do I--

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Then quit being a crybaby.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
Leave your next three years
of high school up to me, bro.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure you
get to be the manager

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
running the center court.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
Just imagine it.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
Everyone's gonna see
you calling the shots!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA] You guys remember
that girl manager from Kodzu

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
who came to get
Subaru's autograph?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
Like the short one?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Because I heard she goes out
with their team captain.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, the girl with the ponytail.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
I think she seems pretty nice.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
More like pretty dangerous!

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Hmph! That's why coed
schools are weaker.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
News flash,
we're coed, too, Kohei.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.631 position:50% align:center
It's not fair.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
I sorta wish we had
a girl manager, too.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
In any case, it
wouldn't hurt to try it--

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] If you want all
that nonsense so badly,

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
then go to Kodzu.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
Where did you come from?

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Ochi, take my seat.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
I've gotta run off
to study hall now, anyway.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Oh, Tomoki.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
The tape and cooling spray
should get here by Saturday.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Try to hold up till then.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
Yep. Sweet. Copy that.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Togura, we can't
afford to get distracted.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten our goal?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
Right, right. I guess I'll
settle for you in the meantime.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--I said you're the best, bro!

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
The bee's knees.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
Nobody was expecting you
to pamper us in that way, man.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
We don't wanna imagine you

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
batting your eyes
at us like a chick.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
I'd say our man's already
got enough on his plate.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
Subaru does have
a fair point there.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Ever since Ochi
became our manager,

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
we've been wrecking the
other teams even harder.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
And he films everything
so it's easy to watch.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have started
babbling like a douche.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
Yo, Kohei.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
I think I could use
some dessert, y'know?

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Sir. I'll get it now!

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Buy me a big choccy pudding.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
If they're out, grab whatever.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
You can count on me!

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
What a pushover.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
I suppose the second-years
aren't in a rush

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
to lead the team quite yet.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
Not while Subaru's
still leading the pack.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
All of the junior squadmates
look up to the guy.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
Can't blame 'em
when he's such a big deal.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
What did you want to talk about?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
Afternoon classes are starti--

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Subaru.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
During our match with Kodzu.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
We lost. What's your point?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
You were totally phoning it in.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
It's like you don't care!

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
I understand you're
trying to move on

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
from what happened
back at nationals,

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center
so I won't pry about that, but--

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
I'm just not that into it,
so why act all gung-ho.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
It won't increase
our chances of winning.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Either way,
we're still repping Fukui.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be
our ace player, remember?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
Dude, nobody cares about us.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
The first thing
that everybody says

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
at the Inter-High venue
is always the same.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
"Fukui? Where the heck is that?"

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
Then don't let those stupid
comments drag you down.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Once we get to center court,
we'll be freaking huge!

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
Got that?

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
They'll know where we are

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
after we put
ourselves on the map!

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.306 position:50% align:center
Look at you,

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
whipping everyone into fighting
shape like a sergeant.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
You aren't the same crybaby
I met at the hospital.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. That was rude.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
You can always give it
to me straight any time.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
Let's get to class.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.995 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Ochi.

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
You wanna be in the
center court, don'cha?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
In the spring?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure I've told you that.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Say it like you mean it.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
Say you want me

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
to take your manager skills
to the Spring Tourney.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
Okay. You are the person
who inspired me.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
It's all up to you, then.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
No matter what,

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
you better help me see this
dream through to the end.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA chuckles]

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
You got it, man!

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
Sure, we may have
qualified for the top 16

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
at the Inter-High,
but, of course,

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
we'll need to push
our teamwork to the limit

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
'cause we intend to place even
higher at the Spring Tournament.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
That's the Fukuho Tech boys'
volleyball captain,

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Mister Subaru Mimura.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN] By the way, no doubt
you'll come out on top again,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
but are there any schools
you're looking out for?

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure
anyone comes to mind.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN]
You haven't heard?

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
They say that Seiin's putting
together an interesting team.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
They withdrew from
the Fall semi-finals.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
I've heard of those guys.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
Their setter may only
be a first-year student,

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
but the kid was on a team that
broke the top six back in Tokyo.

00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Hmmm?

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
That sounds fancy.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
[CAMERAMAN] Well, that made
your ears perk up, didn't it?

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
You boys better
stay on your toes

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
or someone just
might take your spot.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
It gets old watching
Fukuho score an easy win.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
The hell was that about?

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
If you're gunning for
our players to lose,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
then don't bother interviewing
us in the first place.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
Seiin High.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
their team's starting

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
to catch some attention.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect that.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
Their captain's a guy named Oda.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
I don't remember them
being much to deal with.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
They always whiff it
at the Inter-High.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
They made a bit of splash
at the Fall Tournament, though.

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
They've got an
impressive ace and setter.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
The kid who made
the Tokyo top six?

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center
A first-year named Haijima.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
At the Kanto Tournament,

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
he was the setter for
a Tokyo junior high team

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
that made it
into the final four.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
I believe he was a second-year
when he was in the top six.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
A second-year in middle school.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
Subaru, your talent
is a blessing for Fukui.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
It makes me truly proud to
say we have you on our team.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
Though you have two years
of experience on Haijima,

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
you aren't the only prodigy that
this district has right now.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
[ASAMATSU] He pulled a
quick one during that rally.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[SAWATARI]
Not to mention that B pass.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
Somebody's got
some serious balls.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
Not sure why, but Seiin withdrew
from the semi-finals last Fall.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
However, their coach
was definitely present

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
at the meeting for
the prefect qualifiers.

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
They'll be there.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
Five of 'em are at
least a 180 centimeters.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
[SAWATARI]
Where the hell'd they come from?

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
These are the players that
were at the Fall Tournament.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
On the left,

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
they've got their Number One
and their Number Seven.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
Oda's the captain
at 163 centimeters.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
Kuroba's a first-year and 184.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
Their Number Four's
on the right.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
Kanno's a second-year and 181.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.733 position:50% align:center
Their middle blockers are
their Number Two and Ten,

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
at 193 and 187.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Number Two is Aoki, who
I think everybody's seen before.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
The guy we haven't seen is
a second-year named Okuma.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[KAKEGAWA]
And their number eight

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
who got that service ace...

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
He must be their setter.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Yep. Not only can he
pull off a strong spike serve,

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
but he's a tall setter at 181.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
And he's a first-year.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
Hey, I was wondering,

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
why didn't this kid
come play for our school?

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
[TAKASUGI]
Coach, don't you always

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
watch the junior high tourneys?

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
That's right.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
I did have my eye on Haijima
after I saw what he could do.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
In the end,

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
I couldn't quite figure out
how to fit him onto our lineup,

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
'specially knowing Subaru
was gonna be a third-year.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
I admit part of me was curious
to see what he'd be capable of.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
If he'd been on
our team with Subaru...

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
Wait a second!

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
You saying the rest of us aren't
good enough for you, Coach?

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
[HATA] Uh, no,
I didn't mean it that way!

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
I bet that's what some
people out there think.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
At least, the media types.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
For seven years,

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
we're the only team that's
managed to make the nationals.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
I can imagine
everybody's assuming

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
that if some
other school beats us,

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
then the winners'll just breeze
their way to the top somehow.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
That's savage, bro!

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
That's enough of that.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for the
distraction, boys!

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
We can keep tabs on Seiin,

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
but there's no need
for us to get paranoid.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Anyway, practice starts at nine!

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Sir!

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
Didn't see you there, Ochi!

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
You seem healthy for someone

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
who bailed on practice
because of a stomach ache.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA] Actually, I thought
I'd go watch Seiin practice.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Snooping around on
a team we might never play?

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
Don't you have better things
to do with your time?

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
Well, yeah. I'm just curious.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
Then I'll go with you.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
letting you get distracted

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
by them during prefect matches.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
Uh, excuse me.

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Do you know where the boys
volleyball team is practicing?

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
Wait, we have a
boys volleyball team?

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
I feel like we
probably would, right?

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
You could try the gym or
maybe one of the courts outside.

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA] What is this,
a junior high PE class?

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
Talk about basic.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
We might as well take a look.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
I'll go check
the gymnasium inside.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
You stake out whatever those
courts are supposed to be.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
Roger.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Excuse me. Boys' volleyball?

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
Actually, they're outside today.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
Oh, my bad.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
I think they'll be wrapping
things up pretty soon.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
The school's letting us have
the whole gym after six o'clock.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
So, they don't get
to practice here every day?

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
The boys and girls teams
both have tourneys coming up,

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
but as soon as the
other clubs leave for the day,

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
we can come in and use
the gym until 7:30 tonight.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
So, do you manage
the girls' team, or...?

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
Nope.
I'm actually on the boys' team.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
If you're looking
for the outdoor courts...

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] He's totally Kanno,
their number four.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
Guy's a whole year
younger than me.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have
bothered playing nice.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
What was that?!

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
Say that again, punk!

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
The hell's your problem?!

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA] Whatever it takes
for you to get it!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
Take that back!

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Okuma!

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Kohei! That's enough!

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
But, Ochi! This punk here,

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
he said that Fukuho couldn't
be worth playing against

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
if we came here to spy on them!

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
Look, you've got it twisted.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
I didn't say all that.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
I said it sounds like you losers
just got torn a new one!

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
Say it to my face, bastard!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA]
And who's this shrimp?

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
A third-year named Ochi.

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
I'm Fukuho's manager.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA]
Seriously, dude?

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
It must be a real
drag playing housemaid

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
for a bunch of cavemen!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
You watch your mouth, punk!

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Knock it off, you guys.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Aoki?

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Well, what have we here?

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
You causing a ruckus, Ochi?

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
'Cause I snagged a spicy clip
of your lapdog throwing hands.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
It looks super violent.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
It'd be a real shame if
it were ever made public.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's messed up!

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Your teammate's
the one who started it!

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
And If you scumbags weren't so--

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Knock it off!

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Uh. Subaru. But why?

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
That's a steep hill.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
I hope we can keep this
whole thing between us.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
It's over if I let
my team get in trouble.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
I apologize for the
disrespect we've shown.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
So, I'm begging you
to show us mercy.

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
Please, Oda! For me.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
That's enough Subaru!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
We're the ones
who should apologi--

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Back off.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
Nothing you could
say would mean squat.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
Look, Oda.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
If we're disqualified over this,
we'll never live it down.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Fukuho's legacy
can't end this way.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to face
our senior players again.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
[TOGURA]
I'm so sorry!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
I'm the only guy to blame here.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
If throwing me off the team
is what it takes, then I--

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Can everyone calm down?

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
This isn't that big of a deal,
so no need to be dramatic.

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
You can stand up already.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Mimura, I don't want any
trouble, either, okay?

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
So, whatever it is our idiot
teammate said, I apologize.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
Okuma!

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have gone off.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
Sorry, everyone.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Aoki, you can
delete the video now.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
Relax, buddy.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
I wasn't even recording.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
We owe you one.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Didn't you come
to see our team in action?

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
You're welcome
to stay a while longer.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
Nah. Now that we've
kissed and made up,

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
it's time I drag these
two knuckleheads home.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
Then again,
if your team's up for it...

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
...why don't we have
a practice match?

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
I think that sounds like
a great idea.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
[OCHI gasps]
It's him.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
You aren't the only prodigy

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
that this district
has right now.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
That's Haijima.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Sure, why not?

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
No reason to be shy.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
As far as I can gather,

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
they're practically dying
to get to know us better.
