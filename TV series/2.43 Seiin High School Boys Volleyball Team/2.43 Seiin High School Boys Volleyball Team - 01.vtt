[MEISEI A]
Over to the left!

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
So close!

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Miles away more like it.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Three blockers
on the left again.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Step back when receiving!

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] We could shut the
PTA up by winning for once.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
It's Sota's fault
for not showing up.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
Not a damn thing.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
We're right in the
middle of a match here.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:21.790 position:50% align:center
The hospital? Are you
sure it's Yoshino Sota?

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
They found him at home?

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.085 position:50% align:center
He tried to...?

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Chika! Wait up!

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Yuni.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
So, you're moving to Tokyo?

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna see
each other anymore!

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Yeah. But I promise--

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
No matter what I'll
never forget you, Yuni!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
I promise, too! Don't worry!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
I won't forget you, either!

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] I wish we could
have stayed together forever.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Yuni.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Guess what I heard.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
The transfer student's
gonna be late.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he's hot.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
Please tell me he's hot.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, he's average.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
Maybe even below so.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
Stop me if I'm wrong,
but last time you saw him

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
was back in kindergarten, right?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
There's no telling what
he's gonna look like now.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
Fine, then here's my best guess.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's still a four-eyed
shrimp who sucks at sports.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
What's with you?

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Always pouting like a kid.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Is 'lil baby Kuroba grumpy?

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Give it a rest!

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
What are you?
My older sister?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
Go annoy your own class.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah.
I was leaving anyway.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
I'm wearing shorts underneath,

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
so there's no point
trying to sneak a peek.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
There're not even cute ones.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
What're those made of, wool?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
The school's heated.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
Why even wear them?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
Because, dork, they're stylish.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
No point trying to explain
the concept to you.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
You know what never gets old?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
All the different ways your
cousin gives you crap.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor
and shut your mouth.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
This transfer student--

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
they're like a childhood
friend of yours?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
Back from kindergarten.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
That long?
Reunited at last, huh?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Please.
He's just a dude.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
I was pretty excited.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
What's Chika's problem?

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
The guy finished moving back
during the winter break.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
He didn't even
stop by to see me once.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Chika!

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Huh?
Maybe he didn't recognize me?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] This is
Haijima Kimichika from Tokyo.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
I understand his
grandfather lives here,

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
and he resided in Suzumu

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
until he was in kindergarten
and had to move away.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I'll ignore you.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
--[TEACHER] Kuroba.
--Huh? What?

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
Haijima played volleyball

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
at his previous school and
has decided to join our team.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Since he's a
brand-new student here,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll make sure

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
to show him around
our school, won't you?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
why don't you take a seat
in front of Kuroba?

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
What position?

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Well?
You do play volleyball?

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
You're talking about
my position on the team.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
The truth is,

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
I don't really have like a
designated spot or anything.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I understand.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
You have a system
to decide during matches?

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
You're gonna laugh,

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
but I've never played
an actual match before

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
and our practices
are kinda whenever.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Full disclosure,
most of the guys on the team

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
just needed some
sort of club to join.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. Joining a club.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
It's sort of
required by the school,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
but I guess you
wouldn't have known that.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:46.948 position:50% align:center
Hey, did your last
school have some kind of

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50% align:center
super outstanding volleyball
team or something?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
You're a waste of centimeters.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Wha...? A waste?

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
What's going on with him?

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
Chika? Wait. Kimichika?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I remember that kid.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
Good to know, because
if you do, he must be real.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
Not some figment
of my imagination.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
You didn't seriously
think he was a ghost?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I swear, you're
as stupid as ever.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
If you're so smart, then tell me
the reason he moved to Tokyo?

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
Or do you actually know?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
'Cause of his mom dying and all.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
I can still remember
the geezer all dressed up

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
on the day of her funeral.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
As for his pops, he was
originally from Tokyo.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
Kinda makes me wonder why

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
he ended up coming
back to this place.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
Man, like I know.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
Ask him yourself.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
If I could, do you think
I'd be in this mess?

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
He's got this barrier
around right now.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, I'm not a waste
of centimeters, am I?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
I'm the wrong person to ask.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
As a fellow pointlessly tall
person, I can't be objective.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Still, you ain't got
nothin' on my height.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
No need to go and brag.

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
--[YORIMICHI] Here.
--[ITOKO] You there, Yuni?

it's time for dinner.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hold on a sec.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
How did Itoko know
I was with you?

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
Seriously, you're such an idiot.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.536 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
Hello, Kuroba.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hey, Chika! I mean, Haijima.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
Why're you out so late?

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I had club.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
As in, like, volleyball?

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Practice was today.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
Sure, but no one else was there.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
No.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
You practiced by yourself?

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
Hey. This is Chika, huh?

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
You were a runt
last time I saw you.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Dude's almost
as tall as you, Yuni.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
This is Yori. You've met before.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
He's my cousin who used
play <i>shogi</i> at Gramp's place.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
I remember him. So what?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Just so you know, you're wasting
your height and your life.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
You think you're going around

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
doin' something amazing
with yours, huh?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
Compared to you two, yeah.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
What's his problem?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Height's not the only thing
that's changed about him.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
He acts the same way at school.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
[BASKETBALL CAPTAIN]
Come on! Next up! Go!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
That's a heckuva spike serve.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center

Hey, Transfer Student.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
By yourself again, I see.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
Don't know if
you've noticed or not,

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
but we're kinda short
on space 'cause of you.

don't have a team,

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
how 'bout practicing
in a corner?

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
[BASKETBALL A]
We need to use the whole gym.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
Anything less,
we're missing out.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] And my sport
requires half the gym.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
There're more of you, so what?

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
If you don't have
enough room to practice

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
then take it up
with your advisor.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
You just got here, and you act
like you run the school.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Yo. Now there're two
of us, so stop complaining.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry for
being late and stuff.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
What's your deal?

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Just sizing you up.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
After you had
the nerve to tell me

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
I was wastin' my life yesterday.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
I figured why
not stop by the gym

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
and see what you
were doing with yours?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
And in case you were wondering,

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here
to help you out, okay?

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
It's not like you needed it.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
Still, one up against
20 isn't an even match.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Not sure two against
20 will make that much

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
of a difference in
the long run either.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
of how annoying you are?

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
For real though,
is it any wonder

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
you don't have
a single friend at school?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] By the way,
those spike serves earlier

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
were looking pretty awesome.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] I need to get better,
or I can't use them in matches.

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha, so that's why you were
here working on your serves.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
No, that's all I can do
while practicing alone.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
I don't have my tracksuit, but I
suppose I could do some drills.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not like
I made plans with Yori today.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
Fair warning to you though,
I'm still pretty sucky,

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
so I might not be much help.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
You feel you're better off
on your own, I'll go.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
Cool?

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
What's with that look dude?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Hang on.
I'll put in my contacts.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
Uh... Why?

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
I was holding back,
but you showed up.

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Also, that warm up routine
of yours is absolute trash.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
We're gonna start
with some proper stretches.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Stay there.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
In math, you got a 95?

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
And a 99 in social studies?

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center

A 30 in Japanese?

Would you shut up?

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center

goin' on about my grades?

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
A 42 in math.

Wanna compare test scores, fine.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
What about in Japanese then?

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
Which one of us made an 87?

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
Ow! Take it easy!

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
You and I have pretty different
ideas of warming up.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Kuroba,
how tall are you right now?

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hundred
seventy-three centimeters.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
When did you last check that?

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Hmm... Some time back
in the fall I guess.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You're a 175.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, tacked on two centimeters.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
Now measure me.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
A 172.7.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
You're not that much taller.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Two centimeters.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
Uh, 2.3, actually.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
Still, you're a setter, right?

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
Not like you have to worry
that much about height.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
Let me tell you
about a tall setter.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
A player on the
national team named Abe.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
He's a setter, a 191.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.308 position:50% align:center
The taller you are, the higher
all your sets will be.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
That's why Abe's a master
at the front of the net.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
Plus, he's ambidextrous
with sweet left-hand dumps.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Oh, yeah.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
So, I noticed earlier,
you were using both hands, too.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
You're ambidextrous?

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
No, but I trained myself.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
How would you even start?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
That blows my mind.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Ryo? What's up?

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
Not much.

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so, uh, I heard
the volleyball club

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
was meeting up here
for practice today.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
It's only us, but--

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
Now that you're here we can
get a serious practice in.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kuroba.

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
During practice games,
look at the block

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
before choosing
a cross or a straight.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
Lemme see if
I can remember this.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
So, a straight attack is

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
when you hit the ball
right through the court,

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
while a cross is one
that's more on the outside.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Other way, genius.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
A spike you hit diagonally
through the court is a cross

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
while a hit that's parallel

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
to the sideline is
called a straight.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Whenever you're up
front by the net,

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
you've got a habit
of taking a step

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
while facing towards the middle.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
If you just hit it naturally,
that'd be a cross

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
but if you wanted
to aim for the outside,

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
then it would be
a straight, 'kay?

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
That's real confusing.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
It's beginner level stuff,
but whatever.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.434 position:50% align:center
We'll do drills
so you don't forget.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
Afraid you'd say that.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Mentally you don't get it,

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
but you know how
to get around blocks.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
The way you use your upper body,

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
the flexibility
of your shoulders,

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
how you stay in the air.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, though.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
While those are the only natural
talents you have for the sport,

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
in time, you'll get better.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
But only if you put in the work.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
Getting taller
wouldn't hurt, either.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the
first part at least.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
What's your deal?

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
Was something I said incorrect?

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
You're always acting like you're
better than everybody else,

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
so hearing you offering me
a legitimate compliment

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
is a little disconcerting,
no offense intended.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm going to
acknowledge something

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
that deserves to be
acknowledged.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
Even if I ended up
being great at volleyball,

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
I'd still be unpopular.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
So, what's the verdict
on high school?

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.695 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna go here?

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
For now, that's the plan, but...

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
There's more?

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
It's not like you
have to stay, right?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
More importantly,

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
we've got first-year
students joining in April.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right, but

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
you shouldn't get
your hopes up too much.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
We can probably snag one or two.

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
If we get more,
I want to compete.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
I don't know whether
the schedule here

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
is like most other places,

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
but before the nationals,

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
there should be a
prefectural tournament.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
Not to be a downer,
but even if we entered,

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
I doubt we'd make it that far.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
Volleyball's not fun
if you're not competing.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
That's the entire purpose.

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure we're
presentable by summer.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
Keep showing up to practice.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
I'll figure out the rest.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
Welp, good luck.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
But don't we have
to have an advisor

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
before we enter a tournament?

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Why don't we ask around
at school tomorrow?

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Uh...

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
I've only got
some pocket change.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
I don't carry much since
I leave my bag lying around

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
while I'm in club.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B]
You're in a club?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A]
Yeah, so we heard.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
Yorimichi mentioned
somethin' 'bout that.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
Volleyball, I think he told us.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
Well, come on,
let's see some moves.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
How about showin' us
a receive, bro?

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I always forget
what those look like.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
Refresh my memory.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I think it's sorta like this?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A]
We got ourselves a natural here!

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B chuckles]
Looking real cool,

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
like you're a legit
volleyball player.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
--Haijima?
--Stop playing games

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
and let's go. Waste of time.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Could you stop pulling me first?

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center
It's only a game, don't forget.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI] Don't tell me
you're actually serious

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
'bout joining this stupid jock.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
You're not mad at me,
are you, Yori?

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
a chance to hang out recently,

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
but we should totally
meet up during the break.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
We practice during spring break.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
We're not talkin' about
every day though, right?

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
If we're going to enter
the summer tournament,

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
I doubt even
that'll be enough time.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
Are you for real?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
Yuni.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
You realize, don't you, that
you're never gonna make it?

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
Treat it like a game and you
won't make a fool of yourself.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
So what's it gonna be,
him or us?

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
I ain't the type
to wait around for long.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
We're only kidding here, right?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
You're just as bad as he is.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
Man. Money sure
makes you popular.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
You turn around for a
minute and he replaces you.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
Some friend, huh?

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
We're cousins.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
You know how I always dive
into new things all excited

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
and then get bored
with them just as quickly.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
And sooner or later, I'll wind
up getting tired of volleyball.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Were you serious just now?

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Well, I... The thing is...

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Then go ahead and quit!

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
Why're you taking
this from zero to a 100?

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting you
ruin the tournament.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
And what does that mean?

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
You'd only get in my way.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
I want to actually
play in matches!

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
Ha! Bingo.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
Showing your
true colors, at last.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
The genius setter from Meisei,
living up to his reputation.

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
Always putting himself
before anyone else,

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.055 position:50% align:center
especially his own teammates.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
What are you
talking about, Yori?

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI] The reason
Chika came back to town.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
You said you wanted
to know, didn't you?

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
So, I did some digging.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
You hear me?

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
Everyone reaps what they sow,
you little punk.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
So don't go blaming
your problems on Yuni.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
--Yori, wait.
--Stay outta the way.

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
I managed to get your old
school name from your gramps.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
Thought you could keep it
a secret from everyone, huh?

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
I did a little snooping online
to see what I could find out

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
and did I hit the jackpot!

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
Page after page about
the volleyball prodigy

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
who went to school there,
up until last year.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
Boy, do they hate you now.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Yuni.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah?

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
to think this is just

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
some personal
vendetta against Chika.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
Although he'd deserve that.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
We're doing this for you.

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you, don't even
get involved with volleyball.

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
But, why not?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
Because this loser here will
do whatever it takes to win.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
And I mean anything.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Play the game right!

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
You're on the left,
so receive the ball!

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
Then you make sure
to get it to me!

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
The setter!

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
How many times
do I need to tell you?

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
If you can't even do that right,
then what are you good for?

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.469 position:50% align:center
[MEISEI COACH] You won't
be in the starting lineup

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
for tomorrow's game.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, that'll diffuse
things with Yoshino

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:09.060 position:50% align:center
and the rest of the team,
as well as the parents.

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
The hospital?

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
Are you sure it's Yoshino Sota?

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
They found him at home?

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
He tried to...?

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
Wanna know the dirty truth?

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
This jackass here,

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
He pushed another
teammate over the edge

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
for not listening to him.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
The kid tried to off himself.
