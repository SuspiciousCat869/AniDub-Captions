00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
[AKAO B]
Yeah!

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
[AKAO C]
Awesome!

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
[AKAO D]
Nice shot!

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
This venue's kinda on
the small side.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
Not a lot of room
for spectators.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
Almost like it was made for you.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
Less people, less chance
your stage fright'll--

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
Moron.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
Would ya stop
pressuring the guy?

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need any reminding.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling fine today, really.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Kuroba, over there.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Ah! Fukuho...

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] If you think
some kind of truth

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
is waiting over there,

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
then let's go get it.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Here's what
I know: We're gonna win.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.748 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
Fukuho's just a stepping stone
on our way to the top.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
You mean our ultimate goal.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
Getting all the way to
the Spring Tournament.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
We're gonna stand on
that center court.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] Once the teams
from the third match move,

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
we can go on
the practice courts.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have an
early lunch before that.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't get full.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
That means you,
Okuma and Kuroba.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA, KUROBA]
Why are you singling us out?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
The weather report said today's
gonna be a real scorcher,

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
so this might be our roughest

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
and sweatiest
tournament of the year.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
Nobody here's sick, are they?

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
No!

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
Haijima, are you good?

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
In that case, here's the deal:

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
The starting lineup for the
first game's been decided,

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
so listen for your name.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
On the court are:
Aoki, Kanno, Uchimura,

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
Okuma, Haijima, and Kuroba.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
We're going with you six.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
Hokao's our libero.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
Could you sit out
when we play Fukuho?

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
Haijima, give me some time
to mull this over, okay?

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
I don't have a ready response
to your proposition right now.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting
some big changes here,

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
so I wanna be totally sure.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
Uchimura.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since you started,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
but I'm counting on you.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
Until you get put
back in the game,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
I'll do the best
I can to try and keep up!

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[ODA] I'm sure
everything will be fine.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
Plus, we're facing Ikeda Biz.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
Last year's team
was able to beat 'em.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
We're switching the rotation.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
Kuroba's in and I'm out.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
Kanno, Haijima?

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
Back him up.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir.
--Yes, sir.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Kuroba.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
Could you at least try to
act like this concerns you?

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
You need to keep working,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
whether you're playing up
front or in the back.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Your cross shot is going
to be our bread and butter.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
And no daydreaming,
out here or on the court.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
I-- Yes, sir!

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
I promise you.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
Seiin has just one ace,
Yuni Kuroba.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
And that's you.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yes sir!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
They wanna know how
hard we've been workin'?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
We'll show 'em!

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yeah!

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Hey, first-year.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
While I'm pleased as
punch you got your way,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
I've got to say, switching
out Oda with Uchimura?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
Don't know if that's
the right answer.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
If you're willing
to put others on the line,

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
you gotta be willing to put
yourself out there with them.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
What'd Coach mean by that?

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
Haijima?

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
This first one,
attack from the back line.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
And make sure you stuff them.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
--[UCHIMURA] All right!
--[HOKAO] That's the stuff!

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
Nice job! One more!

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
You heard Captain Oda!

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
Yes! Just like that! Again!

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
--[HOKAO] Too good!
--[KUROBA] Heck yeah!

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
Uchimura! Nice one!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
[HOKAO]
Way to go!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
Seriously,
you're killin' it today

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
with the spikes and blocking!

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
I know! Everything's clicking!

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
Let's end this
in the second set.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
I want to watch
Fukuho's first match.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
Don't worry 'bout them.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
Let's stay focused!

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.200 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Right!

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
It's off.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
He made double contact!

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you
doing out there, Haijima?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Unreal. He made
a rookie mistake?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
Well, dang.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
I read that signal all wrong.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
I... My set was way off.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
Stop hogging the blame.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
Hey, Coach! Call time.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
Dude. I'm sorry!

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Nah. I should've
gone for it, man.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] What do you mean?
That was my fault.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
Let's turn things around!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
Right! Here goes!

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Yeah!

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
[IKEDA D]
All right!

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What?

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
They got 20 points before us?

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Looks like Fukuho's
match is about to start.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
No, wait.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
Why're you looking
over there now?

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
We're still playing.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
What about our game?

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What's happening?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
We were crushing it,
then suddenly we're not.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
[IKEDA E]
All right!

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Where'd our focus go?

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
This is really freakin' me out.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA] Can someone explain
what the hell happened?

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
You all made one
mistake after another.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'cause you
were the exception.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Captain?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
Two things:
I want you to keep doing

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
what you're doing and
remember to communicate.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
Call the shot.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
And is that it?

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
Isn't there something
else you want to--

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
There's nothing else.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Just make sure we're connecting.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
Uchimura, don't worry
about screwing up.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
And no holding back.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
Remember our practice.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
Right. Sorry.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
No need to apologize.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
Sorry, I'll stop.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
It was a simple combo miss.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
You're wonderin' if Aoki
missed on purpose, aren't you?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe for a split second.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
But, I mean, he didn't, right?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
There's no way.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center
I would've been able to
tell if he was doing that.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
It wasn't Aoki's fault.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
We're just out of sync is all.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Yeah, okay, but you're
also putting strain on Uchimura

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
with the way
you're setting to him.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
I'll do better then.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
No more screwing up.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
If we lose this
next set, we're done.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What? Why would you say that?

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
You tryin' to make me panic?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
Besides, we should be
focused on playing

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
and not worrying
about winning or losing.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
We definitely should be
panicking, though.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
And of course it matters
whether or not we win.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
Why else are we playing?

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] We're not gonna lose
'cause of a suggestion I made.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
'Cause of him?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
I hope I'm wrong.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
But it kinda sounds
like he's gonna try

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
doin' everything
on his own again.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
All right. You're up, Uchimura.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
I'm just like Oda.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
When you're not a pain,
I think you guys're pretty okay.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I want to help Uchimura.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
but I don't know how.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO]
Yeah!

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
Let's take this first match!

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO]
All right!

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I...

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
With both of
our skills combined,

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
we have what it takes
to be like Subaru.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Kuroba! Get out on the court!

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yeah! Sure!

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
He believes in me.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
But can I actually do it?

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
That's not enough.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
You need to catch up to

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
that guy's level on
your own, understand?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
You need to surpass him.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Wait.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do it.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
Watch me!

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
Over here, Kanno!
Gimme the ball!

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Back line! Dude!

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Too late!

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Don't fall!

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Hit it!

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Try blocking this!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
Nice kill!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
[HOKAO]
That ball went Mach Three!

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
That's one!

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
No one else could be our ace.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
Seiin has just one ace,
Yuni Kuroba.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
And that's you.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
We're winning this.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
Leave this set to me.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
I'll get every point.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
No matter the ball.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna score on it!

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
--It's up!
--He dug the ball?

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
We're good!

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
I'll cut it off at one!

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You promised us.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
Don't go back on
your word, Kuroba!

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI] If you're willing
to put others on the line...

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Kuroba!

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
Hey, Coach.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
Are you seein' this?

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
Okuma!

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
Man, you saved my--

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA] Yeah, well,
what were you expecting?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
I can't let a first-year
take all the glory!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
Dude. Same team.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
Haijima's changing up
his playing style,

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
actually following up
on spikes and digging.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
Looks like the kid's pretty
decent when it comes to defense.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
Although, if at all possible,
he'd rather avoid receives.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, he's not going
to be able set up attacks.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
However...

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Even then...

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
Haijima!

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
If Kuroba's gonna score,

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
we just need to keep
the ball airborne!

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Crap!

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
Aoki. Nice save.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Y'know, brute force
only goes so far.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
Use your brain occasionally.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
I know you have one.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
You don't always
have to smash the ball.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Sometimes just a feint
or a light touch is enough.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
Style doesn't
earn you extra points,

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
just as long as
that ball goes over.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor and
quit looking so pathetic.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna sit,
then do it on the bench.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Oda, did we?

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
Great work out there.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
But now, we've got it.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
Take a break.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
Hope you don't
mind me winning this.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Please. Go right ahead.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
I was only messing around.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
You're the hero of this set
and nobody's gonna forget that.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
[ODA] All right!
Ready to wrap this up?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Yeah!

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Was it the right or wrong play?

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
You tell me.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
Your plan was for
Haijima to give it his all.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
As long as he was stubborn

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
and didn't change up
his play style

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
we were going to lose.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
The whole season
would've been doomed.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI laughs]

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
Something you'll
eventually come to understand

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
is how rare it is for anyone
to actually be doomed.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
But you're still young

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
and I suppose that's a lesson
that only age can teach you.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
For now, cheer.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
One more!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
Oda!

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
Another one!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
Don't let up until
we win! Hear me?

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yeah!

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
First-years! Hey! You awake?

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
Bus leaves at 15 after.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
If you're late,
we go without you.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Got it. Be there in a sec

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
We won.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
We actually won.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
Haijima. You heard him.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
The bus is on its way.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yo? You good?

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
We've got two games tomorrow.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
Not like you forgot.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
We get to play two more.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
I can't wait until then.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] You really are in love
with volleyball, aren't you?

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
That goes without saying.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
Where else am I gonna see
those killer moves of yours?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
Play that way all the time.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
That second set.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
Your first attack from the back.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
I got goosebumps.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
Huh?
[chuckles]

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
You're serious?

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I kinda figured
you didn't have much fun

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
at today's game because
of that combo miss earlier,

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
not to mention you had to give
up setting to play defense.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] If something's wrong,
we'll work to fix it.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Still, you were super annoyed.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Only 'cause I didn't
want things ending today.

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
I want to win with this team.

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
To keep going all the way there.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
You ought to say stuff like that

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
in front of the
others more often,

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
instead of just to me.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] That's why
I'll do whatever it takes

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
to connect tomorrow.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
As long as the game's not over,
we can turn it around.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
There's still so much we can do

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
with this new team of ours.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
When I think about it at night,

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
imagining what we're
capable of, I can't sleep.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
You're obsessed.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I know.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Just to give you a fair warning,

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to back you up
for the rest of my life.

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
As if I needed you to. But...

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
But?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we're on the same team.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.460 position:50% align:center
'Cause that back attack?

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
I've gotta see that again.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
Knowing I'll be the one setting
you the ball means a lot.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I... I'll show you.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center
As many times as you want.

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
Anytime, anyplace!

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Thank you!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
You and Aoki
were killing it today.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
No prisoners.

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
Of course. Said we would.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
Plus, those guys
underestimated us

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
after watching
Aoki miss yesterday.

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
So, we used that.

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] You turned yesterday's
mistake against them?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
Man, I am glad
we're on the same team.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
Volleyball really
is the greatest.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
Where the heck
did that come from?

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.872 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Fukuho.

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
So, your team finally
decided to show up.

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:18.838 position:50% align:center
Glad I didn't waste my time
waiting on you guys, Oda.

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:21.508 position:50% align:center
Kuroba!

00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:45.323 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:49.369 position:50% align:center
That's quite the display.

00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't regret it,
for your sake.

00:22:57.961 --> 00:22:59.170 position:50% align:center
For real, though.

00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.006 position:50% align:center
You better not regret that.
