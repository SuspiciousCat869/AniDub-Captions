[loud radio playing]

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
Say, uh, could ya turn
the volume down some?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
The volume!

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
Never mind!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
They went overboard
with the supplies.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
What? Do they think
there're a hundred people

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
in the club or something?

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
I said that this was too much,

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
but gramps told me to
take it all with us anyway.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
Ah... Man, it's hot.
I'm burning up.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
How much underwear'd you bring?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
This isn't a field trip.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
What are you, five?

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.054 position:50% align:center
No, but it is
my first training camp.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
For real though,
how many pairs did you bring?

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
I don't know

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
'cause my grandmother
ended up packing for me.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Huh? Wait, you didn't
even pack your own clothes?

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
Now who're you calling five?

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
I took care of this
bag all on my own.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
No clue what
she put in that one.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
Y'know, you're not as
extreme as you pretend to be.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Like I said, I'm quitting.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.581 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna play volleyball
with someone like Haijima.

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.000 position:50% align:center
The guy's extreme.
It ruins the fun.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
I wanna actually enjoy club
activities. Are you coming?

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I'm gonna stay.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.801 position:50% align:center
Because I wanna play
with Haijima.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Nothing at all.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Listen up.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
Once this training camp's over,

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
it's on to the Fall Tournament.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
We're putting this team
together in five days.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm sure some of you
came here just to mess around,

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
but trust me when I say
I'm gonna work you to the bone.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
So, I hope you're ready.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
Also, you probably noticed Okuma

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
from the rugby team is here.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
He decided to make the switch
and join us on volleyball.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Like Kanno, Uchimura,
and Hokao, he's a second-year.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
Okuma, introductions.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
For sure! Team members!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
Greetings and salutations!

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance!

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
We'll take real
good care of you.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
I guarantee it.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Yeah, cool.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
Not ominous in the least.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
Would you care to say
a few words, Coach?

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[snoring]

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
Let practice begin!

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Right!

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
Kuroba!

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
You need to pay more attention
to where you're hitting those.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's hear it.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
What do you
think of our spikers?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Not terrible.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
The opposite hitters are decent,

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
so I'd like to increase the
middle and right-side combos.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
Like A and D quicks.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
Also, a C quick and
a slide hit on the right.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
As well as a pipe attack
with the middle and right.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
Aoki, Kanno, Okuma.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
Over here, bring it in.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
You too, Kuroba!

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
Have our left-side hitter
practice his receives.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
You heard the man.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Once the middle
hitter goes for an A quick,

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
our right-side hitter
should go for a D quick

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
that uses most of the court...

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
Or a time-difference attack
would also be effective.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
In this instance...

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
So... was he this intense
in middle school?

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the same.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[ODA] He's pretty much
volleyball personified.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
Which is great and all,

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
but whenever
he's not on the court,

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
there's a lot of teamwork
he ends up forgetting about.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
When he's not playing,
he's way different.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
[ODA] The team will either kill
him or get the most out of him.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
With those kinds of skills,

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
he should be a
top contender anywhere,

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
but I guess the opposite's true.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
Most teams wouldn't
be able to play with him.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
Being forced to work
with weaker players

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
could easily break the guy.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
It's risky on all fronts.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
But still...

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
We'll get the most out of him.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
I'm making it my mission,
my responsibility,

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
to make sure he has
all the skills he needs

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
by the time
college rolls around.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Captain.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
All right. Next one!

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Right up!

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
Our training camp's
five days and four nights.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
Two days after it's over,
the Fall Tournament starts.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
We'll have to work out
the kinks by then,

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
before the prefect qualifiers
in late September.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
These are important matches,
but this time...

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
Haijima will be on our team.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
Things will be different.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
We receive this food. Thanks!

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
Now that was a feast.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
Man, I'm stuffed.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
Itoko? And who is she?

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
Your girlfriend?
Give me the deets!

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
What? No! She's...

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
We aren't dating.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
She's just my cousin,
man, calm down!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
That's all? You could've said.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
Mind keeping it down?

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
The seniors are
gonna chew you out.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
Must be nice, my dude.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
Dating Suemori
from the girls' team.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
You are going out, aren't you?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
Seeing as you were at the
ball game festival together.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
So what if we were?

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
Ibari and I--no!

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
I meant Suemori
and I aren't, like...

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
Yo, Haijima! What 'bout you?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'm single. Always have been.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Figures. I mean, you probably
aren't even interested

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
in relationships and junk.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying there
haven't been girls I've liked.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Like who?

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
We're talking
actual humans, right?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
With one pair of arms and legs?

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
Vabo- <i>chan</i> 's got those.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
But wait,
they're not a real person!

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
I have to know, now!

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
I said I liked someone,
and you think it's a mascot?

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
I thought I was overdoing it!

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
That's classic, Kuroba.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Stop laughing!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
You think I'm joking around?

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
This is, like,
a serious matter, you guys!

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
What do you mean "serious"?

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center
All of you, pipe down,
and lights out, got it?

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
Better preserve your energy

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
or I'm gonna work you
till you puke!

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
If you're not tired,

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
we'll see how you feel
after some hill sprints.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Okuma, you seem wide awake.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
Nope! I'm dead tired!

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
I'll be out in a sec.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
Hey. Are you awake?

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Yes. Shut up.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
So, about this girl
you've got a thing for.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
Was it a while back
or someone from Monshiro?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
Go to sleep.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
Give me a hint at least.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.089 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's not Itoko, is it?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
What would make you
think it was Itoko?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
Answer the question!

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA sighs]

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
So, are you still hanging out
with your cousin?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
Hanging out? No!

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
Why does everyone think that?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
Plus, we're at
different schools!

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
We aren't a thing.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
She's more like a sister-in-law.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what? Your sister-in-law?

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
Ooh. When you said
"cousin" you meant Yori.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
No, I haven't seen the guy
in practically forever

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
or even talked to him
for that matter.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
So, there's no reason
for you to be mad.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
Well, who said I was mad
in the first place?

00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
Uh... Uh...

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
Hey, didn't see you there...

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.795 position:50% align:center
You two must be dreaming
of running laps up that hill.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
So, let's make it a reality.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
Twenty dashes! Move it!

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA, HAIJIMA]
Yes, sir!

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
Morons.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
[ODA] We'll work on attack
formations again today.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
The team's gonna try out

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
all the patterns Haijima
came up with yesterday.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
--[ODA] Kuroba.
--Yes, sir!

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You can sit out

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
since there's no point
in you practicing these.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
Go work on your receives.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
But... But we're
practicing attacks!

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
It's not fair for the setter to
kick out a hitter over a grudge!

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
What grudge?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
Just admit it,
you're pissed off we got caught

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
and had to do laps last night.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
As if I'd make a decision over
something so trivial. Moron.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Then why're you treating me--

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
I said you're not needed
for today's practice.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
Tell me why!

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Calm down!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA screams]

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot to
bring the detergent...

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Just you?

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Hey, lend me some detergent.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
Just give me your
laundry instead.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
We can do one load.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
Take it. You paid for laundry.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
That's right. Your arm.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I'm not apologizing,
since it wasn't my fault.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
I never asked you to,
but just practice the right way.

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Are you saying I'm not?

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
I know you're not
gonna set to me at all.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You made it loud
and clear what you think of me.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
It's over.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
No wonder you don't trust me.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Don't worry.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
I'll get my head
back in the game.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
My past, it's far from perfect,

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
but please don't
judge me for it.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
Right now, I'm trying
to be your ace.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
That's the truth.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
I'm trying.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
Just forget I said anything!

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You know,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
I think there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
From the start, you were
always this team's ace.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] The one player who
can hit the highest, fastest,

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.947 position:50% align:center
and strongest is you, Kuroba.

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
No one else on the team
could be our ace except you.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
And the others know it as well.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
Back in middle school,
you were all that I had.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
You were the best,
so I kept pushing you.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
But now, this new team,
they're all talented.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
This time, I swear, things
are gonna be different,

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
and I won't make
the same mistake again.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
I'm changing the way
I play the game.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'll prove it at the tournament.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
All my sets to you will be
nothing but the best.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I can't wait
for the Fall Tournament!

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
It's on!

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Yuni!

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hmm?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Yuni!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yori's here?

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Crap, as if
I wasn't nervous already.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
Maintain your focus.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
Don't let your
eyes wander around.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
All that matters is what's on
the court: our team and theirs.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Haijima.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Don't panic. Just wait.

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
Yuni hasn't hit
a single ball yet.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Kuroba.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
What do you think is special
about Haijima's sets?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
Since they're so fast,
they can be an A or B pass.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
Also, he doesn't have
a pattern when he sets,

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
so it's hard for us to
know what he's doing next.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.477 position:50% align:center
On top of that, he acts
like it's the spikers' fault

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
for not reaching his sets,

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
even though
he sets up really high.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
The one thing about his sets is
that they're extremely accurate.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
Each is customized to match

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
every hitter's
abilities on the team.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.994 position:50% align:center
The reason Haijima aims high is

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
because he's setting challenges
he knows you're capable of.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
From what I've seen,
he gets you to hit your best,

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
at the pinnacle of your reach.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
That's why when you practice
with him, you improve.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
You'll understand
in an actual match.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
The court won't seem
as daunting as in practice.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
You'll have the strength
to hit at your peak height.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
I've never met a more
devoted setter in my life.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go that far.

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
So, you don't believe
in your teammate?

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
It's not that I don't believe in
Haijima, as much as I don't...

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna know
what Haijima told me at camp?

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
He said to keep you in the game.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
Whole game,
no matter what happens.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
The real problem is you
don't believe in yourself.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
If you feel you can't do that...

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
...try believing in Haijima.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
Damn it!
Their two and four blockers!

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Not yet.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
You're the highest...

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
...the fastest...

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
...and strongest!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
There was never any question...

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
who can be our ace.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
Kuroba! The killer emerges!

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
[ODA] There are two essential
parts of the Seiin High team:

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
The various combo
attacks invented

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
and executed by our setter,
Kimichika Haijima,

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
and the explosive power
of our ace, Yuni Kuroba.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
I want people to remember
our team because of that.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
That sound good to you?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's turn up the heat!

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Right!

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
So, this was your plan
from the very beginning?

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
Back in middle school,

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
the only choice
I had was setting to you.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
I guess that's why you
left me out of practice

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
for the combo attacks.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
The truth is, you're already
more than capable on your own.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
We just had to
draw out your potential.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
So, all of them were in on it.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised
they agreed to go along.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
If they cared more about

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
harming the team's reputation,
we wouldn't need them.

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
I'm getting you to
the Spring Tournament.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] You make it sound
like it's your responsibility...

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
But we're in
this together, got it?

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] More results
from the training camp.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Haijima!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
No more running!

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
I'm breaking through!

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yori, I'm serious.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
I wanna play volleyball,
for real.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Everything I need
is on the court:

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Our teammates and our opponents.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
I was hopeful,

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
but winning both of
your matches today?

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
If you keep this up, I might
start to think you're cool.

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Stop pretending
like you're on the fence.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Admit it,
you thought I was awesome.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna jinx
the semis and the finals.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
You always get cocky
when we compliment you.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
Yorimichi.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
Don't you have something
you wanna say to Yuni?

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[YORIMICHI]
Hmm? Yeah.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what'd you think?

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
I thought the venue
was freezing.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
I figured it'd be warmer.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
That's why I didn't
come watch before.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
There, I've said
what's on my mind.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Ugh! For crying out loud,

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
would it kill you to be honest?

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
You left out the part where
you wanted to see the game!

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
You mean you're
interested in volleyball?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right! Fine.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see with my own eyes
why you were so obsessed.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
It looks like you're sticking
to your guns, for once.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
So, try not to quit.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO] Jeez. Well, I suppose
it's better than nothing.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
I'll keep doing my best. Really.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Yori!

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A, B, C]
No way!

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
You should've said so!

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Itoko brought
her boyfriend!

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
What? No!

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
Boyfriend? He's my cousin!

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS excited chatter]

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
Dating a mutant like her
is never gonna happen

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
for several reasons!

00:21:57.108 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
After all, someone like me
is way out of her league.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO growls]
Oh, yeah?

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
Then how about
I knock you down a few?

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
You're so mean.

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
Words can hurt,
but not as bad as a right hook!

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO]
Hmph!

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
I have another match tomorrow!

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:19.339 position:50% align:center
What if I'd gotten hurt?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.717 position:50% align:center
[PUNK A] Seriously, you're
pulling that crap with us?

00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
Step back, ya bastard!

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:26.221 position:50% align:center
I've had enough of you assholes!

00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:28.306 position:50% align:center
It's Yori?

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:31.976 position:50% align:center
Yori!

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER A]
Someone break them up.

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:34.479 position:50% align:center
[ONLOOKER B]
Wait. Is there a fight?

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.356 position:50% align:center
The hell are you doing here?

00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:37.816 position:50% align:center
[PUNK A]
Can't afford to lose focus.

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:39.526 position:50% align:center
[PUNK B]
And who might you be?

00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:40.443 position:50% align:center
A friend of his?

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:41.986 position:50% align:center
Go home!

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.490 position:50% align:center
[PUNK B]
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.117 position:50% align:center
And leave you?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.828 position:50% align:center
It's that or lose volleyball!

00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:50.954 position:50% align:center
[PUNK B]
Let go!

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.997 position:50% align:center
[PUNK A]
You're dead, pal!
