00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that block.
I went way too hard.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how's your nose?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Not too bad.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
Luckily it isn't broken
or anything more serious.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
Kinda bloody, though.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad to hear
it wasn't anything worse.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
You may have heard the news
already, but our manager

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
ended up with a broken arm
and couldn't make it

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
out to the court today.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
Would've been a bummer
if more than one person

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
from our teams ended up
going to the hospital.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
You sound relieved
to be let off the hook.

Cool it!

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
Heh. I apologize if it came
off that way to you because,

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.646 position:50% align:center
truth be told, the fact
that your ace player

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
is out of commission is the best
thing that we have going for us,

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
though obviously it's
not too good for you.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
For the time being, we're
not in the best position

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
to take you on at
the top of your game.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
Relax. You can let
your guards down.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
This was only a friendly
visit and nothing more.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center

if you can help it.

knowing about my weak spots.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center

And besides, this is my
last Spring Tournament.

Even though it's given
us an advantage,

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.108 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to gloat over
your teammates losing you.

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
There's no point in being
a poor sport right now.

Y'know?

But whatever happens,
at the end of the day,

everything I've got.

About what Mimura said earlier.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
I think he was trying
to say something about me,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
that I'm holding the team
back by not doing my job.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Well, I made it my job

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center

doing your job.

I know whether we win
or lose isn't solely

up to any one person,
but I ended up

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
putting everything on you.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center

resist being petty.

we put Kuroba in the lineup?

from the back, too.

Can't wait. I'm heading in.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center

Okay.

[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center

Guess they caught up.

You hanging in there?

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
Did they take care
of you at the hospital?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
I hope it doesn't
hurt too bad.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
I won't lie, it's killing me.
Definitely broken.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
Anyway, can I see the scorebook?

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
Here. There were three of us
logging the numbers,

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
so we don't have a
final combined tally yet.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
You can keep recording that
way for the rest of the set.

Sir!

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center

Jinno has the ball!

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Jin, we're counting
on you, okay?

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO]
You can do it, Jinno.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
Push it, push it, Jinno!

I see you, Haijima

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Who's in front?

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
It's Kanno.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Will they hold or slide hit?

still inconsistent.

[MIMURA] I've got so much
riding on my back.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Talk about pressure, huh?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
But taking that responsibility,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
that's the stuff
that keeps me moving.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center

[OCHI]
He dumped it!

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
How's he playing like that
when he's only a first-year?

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
Haijima's a formidable threat,

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
but there are others
to watch out for.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
Their whole team's been
evolving as the match continues.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
They have a strong leader
at the helm, which has inspired

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
the other players
to follow his example

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
and improve with
remarkable speed.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
But even then, I don't think
he would've fit on our team.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
Fukuho already has an ace.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center

We don't need another.

No worries.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center

to make sure no one
worries about him.

with this one!

[HATA]
Ochi.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Yes, sir?

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center

[MIMURA grunts]

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
I'm incredibly proud that
I've gotten to manage us

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
for three years.
It's been an honor I hold dear.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
However, if I'm honest?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.058 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Heck yeah!

00:16:57.142 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] If I had the chance
to stand on the court with him,

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
I'd be out there
playing this match.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Look, Subaru.
Do you see those faces?

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
It's everyone in town
who loves this game.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
They're watching.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
And there's no way any of them

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
want you or Fukuho
to lose today.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center
They're here for us.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Seiin might be
pretty fierce and no doubt

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
Haijima's an incredible setter.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
Even so, he won't be
the one smiling in the end.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
The people may cheer,

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
but they'll be cheering
for another player.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
For the true king
who'll take them

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
to the center court in Tokyo.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Let's go!

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] You're the chosen one,
Mimura Subaru.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Always have been.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
There's not a soul in this room
who'd dare to challenge that.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] We're switching
sides after the next point.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
This isn't over yet.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
--Next one's ours!
--[FUKUHO] Yes, sir!

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] So stubborn.
You still won't break, will you?

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
Try favoring the left side.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Kuroba and I can put
ourselves on the court

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
wherever you need us.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
This is an important match,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
but it's also just a checkpoint.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
First, we need to defeat Fukuho,
then the real test is nationals!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I want us to get it over with.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to win!

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
So then, why?

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Why this sudden hesitation?

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
The match'll be done soon.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
And yet--

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I don't want it to end.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Good try, Aoki!

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[KANNO]
That was a hard fall. You okay?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
You wimping out?

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'm just getting started.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
Good, you can't
slack off until we win.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You're telling me.
Thanks for the hand.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I wanna keep playing.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
Forever.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Deuce.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
If they score the next point,
it's gonna be rough.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Haijima! Give the ball to me!

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
This is it.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
I'm right where I have to be.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
Screw strategy.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
Screw being in control.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
All I need is to
get him the ball!

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Spike it!

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA grunts]

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA] Where the hell
did that come from?

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
A super cross shot.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Only one more point.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
We'll finish this one
with a bang!

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN]
Let's go!

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] That's funny.
When did he get so serious?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
Set it up, Tomoki!

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Here we go!

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
No one's on him!

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Get ready to lose!

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
You got this, Subaru!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
It's over. You're done!

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
No.

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Don't let it end. Please.
