[KUROBA]
But I didn't do anything!

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
A bunch of punks
were in a fistfight,

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
and someone must've thought

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
that I was a
part of their group!

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
Well, from what
people are saying,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
you didn't think twice

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
before jumping in
the middle of the brawl.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
They're wrong!

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
So, you weren't involved?

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
No.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Then how'd you get that bruise?

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
This bruise isn't related.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
none of your business.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
Who do you think
you're talking to?

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
Kuroba.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
If you can't explain
to me how you got hurt,

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
we won't be able
to convince the school.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
I would never do anything to
ruin our chances at competing!

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
The last thing I want is
to burden the team!

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
Well, you're doing a great job!

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
We're suspended!

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
That's one game down!

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
And the only person
to blame is you!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
[ODA] While I can't fault them
for making us forfeit the game,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
completely suspending
us was overkill.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.704 position:50% align:center
Kuroba wouldn't talk,
so what else could they do?

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50% align:center
Without an alibi,
the school's got no choice

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
but to conclude he was involved.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
I believe he wasn't
a part of it.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
But still...

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
Ugh, we might just be screwed.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Must be nice.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
Wandering around,
enjoying a snack.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
At least pretend to feel bad.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
We might not go to the Spring
Tournament because of you.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
You think I don't know that?

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
This is the seniors' last year,
of course I feel like crap.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
But, it's not like
I did anything wrong.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
It's not only the seniors.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
The entire team is
losing their chance to go!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
You know, you're way obsessed
over the Spring Tournament.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
If you love it so much,

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
why don't you just go back
to your old school in Tokyo?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hey, wait.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
Back to Tokyo.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
My old school. Meisei Academy.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
Leaving the prefecture
without telling anyone?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
On top of being
involved in a scandal?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
I'm not guilty,
but this looks pretty bad.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
You realize this is
all your fault.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well...

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
[phone beeping]

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
It's my cuz.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
I mean, my other
cousin that isn't Yori.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
I bet she's just
as dysfunctional

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
as the rest of your family.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna answer that?

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
Uh, I sorta got in
a little fight with her,

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
but we're good now.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
If you're so worried
about it, call her back.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
No, it's not a big deal.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
What about you, though?

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
You weren't serious about
filling out transfer papers.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
--Who can say?
--Hey. Come on now.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Maybe I'll make up
my mind if I see Sota.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Who's that?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
Sota Yoshino, my teammate
since the fourth grade.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
So, uh, is he the one from...

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
Y'know, from that
earlier situation?

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
I've known him forever, from a
club back in grade school.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
Miss Minami was the coach there.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
She's the one who
told me about Meisei.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
We made a promise
to go to school there

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.316 position:50% align:center
and play at the Spring
Tournament, and so we applied.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you
two got along.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
We did, not so sure
about now, though.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
I got into Meisei
and so did Sota.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
The hospital?

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
They found him at home?

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
He tried to...?

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
Rumors spread like wildfire,

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
and pretty soon
everyone had heard 'em.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
I got called a murderer,
worse things.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
I was bullied online
and in real life.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
I stopped going to school
my second term.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Then transferred back
here for my final term,

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
and well, you know how
the rest of the story goes.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Haijima.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Tokyo. Tokyo.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] I was thinking maybe
we shouldn't go after all.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
I mean, what good's gonna
come from going back there?

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right,
after you egged me on.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're the one
who told me to make this trip.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay, I did,
but the only reason

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
was 'cause you went and said--

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
No, this one's all on you.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
And good thing, because
otherwise, I might chicken out.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Wow. This is like a
school you see in some TV show!

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
We sure got in here easy
with it being spring break.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
Kuroba, listen.
I'm losing my nerve.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
No way. You can't stop now.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
You knew what
you were getting into.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
egged you on, remember?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting you back out.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
You're okay with that, right?

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Whoa! There're four courts here!

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
This place is huge!

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
Meisei puts a lot of cash
into their sports program.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
Don't see the
volleyball team, though.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Are they practicing outside?

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
Huh? Chika?

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
What d'ya know?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
Thought that was you.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
Tetto and Kou.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
[KOMUKAI] The second- and third-
years are in practice matches.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
We'll meet up at four.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
Remind me where you went
and transferred again?

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
Tohoku region, right?

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
It's in Hokuriku, actually.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
Seiin High School in Fukui.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
Your friend from back home?

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
Kuroba's been my friend
since kindergarten.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
Now we're on the
volleyball team and...

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
He's our ace spiker.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[KOMUKAI] Oh...

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive,
and for a first-year, too.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
I'm Komukai by the way.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
And I'm... Ikawa.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
Never heard of Seiin.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
Well, do they have
a pretty strong team?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
We don't exactly have much
of a track record,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
but that'll change.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
We actually ended up at the
Kanto Tournament this year.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
Too bad we couldn't
get past the top 16.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
You got that far 'cause
the second- and third-years.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Did you contribute anything?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
Big shock, I see you
haven't changed one bit.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
Yeah? And what does that mean?

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
I think it's pretty obvious.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
Look, could you just tell us
if that Yoshino kid is here?

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
You must be talking
about Sota Yoshino.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
The guy switched
to a different school

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
and doesn't play
volleyball anymore.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Are you saying he just stopped?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
Did he quit because of me?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
You know,
the whole thing with Sota.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
What thing? Wait.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. I'm surprised.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
Didn't think you'd still be
worried about that, Chika.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Since he transferred,
guess I can say this now.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
Nobody could stand you,

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
so we all came up
with this little prank,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
thinking you'd chill out
if somebody on the team

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
said they tried
offing themselves.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
We joked around and said someone

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
oughta actually say they tried
and Sota gladly volunteered.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
I mean, even we were shocked

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
when he actually went
through with the plan.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What the hell?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
Your sense of humor's
so screwed up.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
You think what happened
was a joke?

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
Not like you've got
anything to do with this!

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
None of us thought
Chika would transfer

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
to the middle of nowhere
over something like that.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
Oh, something
like attempted suicide?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
[KOMUKAI]
The hell's this guy's problem?

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
Call 'em off, Chika!

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Haijima!

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Listen up.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for you
to play volleyball with them.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
You belong at Seiin High,
with your real teammates.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
Captain Oda, Aoki, Kanno,
and the other people

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
who care about you!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
Coming to Tokyo
was a great idea!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
Now we know how
crappy these guys are.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
After today, you shouldn't
have any doubts left.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's go back home.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Huh? Haijima, what's the matter?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
I'll get help!

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
How did I get here?

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO]
Hey. You're finally awake.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Sota?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO] Kou sent me
a message, so I'm here.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
Been a while.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
I wanted to ask...

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
Is it true you
really quit volleyball?

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO exhales] Ever
since we got into middle school,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to play.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
But we all made that promise,

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
so I couldn't say
I wanted to back out.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
my mom was in the PTA.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
A lot of things tied me down.

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't breathe.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINO] But then, I figured
if it looked like I was pushed

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
to the point of
taking my own life,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
I would finally be able to quit.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
So, I went ahead and
told the others I'd do it.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
How come you
never said anything?

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Someone like you would
have no problem with that,

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
Guess I just didn't want
to be seen as the bad guy.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
And didn't want
everyone hating me.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay,

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
but it's not like I want people
to hate on me either.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
Well, then, I'll get going.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
You take care, Haijima.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
And don't push
yourself too hard.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
Chika.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
You're a genius
when it comes to volleyball

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
and the game may not push you
to the edge like it did to me.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
Thing is, if you ever
feel betrayed by volleyball,

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
I kinda suspect it
might hit you pretty hard.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
And to be honest,
that what worries me the most.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
So, you guys were able to talk?

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
Did anything change?
Like, at all?

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
Who knows? But I guess
I got some closure.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
This has been a heckuva trip.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
So, you thought it
was a smart move

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
to go Tokyo even
though you were sick?

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was feeling off,

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think
I had a fever or anything.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
If you felt something coming,

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
then you shouldn't have pushed
yourself in the first place.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
Even I know that.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stop.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
If a day goes by
where I don't play volleyball,

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
I fall into this panic.

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
And I thought I was bad.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Turns out you're the
king of reckless behavior.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
[NURSE]
Mister Haijima.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
You have a visitor
here to see you.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
There he is.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
Well? How're you feeling?

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
Miss Minami!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
I-I can't believe you're here.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
Wow. You've
gotten taller, Chika.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] So, you were
a volleyball player, too?

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
Yep. I played
professionally for a while,

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
but I quit that
and now I'm a teacher.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
Chika. Still feeling all right?

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Just sleep if you need to.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
No, I'm okay.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
I mean she's no Vabo- <i>chan</i> ,
but I get it now.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
If I'd have known,
I would've gotten my own ride

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
somewhere else instead of being
a third wheel, am I right?

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
The hell do you mean?

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
The girl you said you like.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
It's her, isn't it? Obviously.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
If you can be normal,
there's hope for anyone!

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
Hey! It was a joke!

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
No roughhousing, boys.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
I am driving a compact here.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Hey!

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
I just saw a sign
that said "Shinjuku!"

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
Do you want to go?

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
What? Can we?

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
Jeez, learn to say no.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
She's already driving us
back to the station!

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
Aw... But I wanted
to look around in the city

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
just a little while longer!

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
I mean, since we
are here and all...

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sorry, but, um...
could we stop there?

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
[MINAMI]
You got it.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to see the
best site in all of Tokyo?

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
It's the home of
the Spring Tournament.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
This is it, huh...?

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
Ever since I started playing,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
I've come back here
several times.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
On the days of the tournament,

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
they inflate a giant
Vabo- <i>chan</i> balloon.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
There're tons of
spectators from all over--

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
cheerleaders, brass bands,
reporters and TV cameras...

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
And of course, teams
representing their prefectures.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
From the semi-finals on,

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
they start to play the
matches on the center court.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
And when you look down,

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
you're watching the best teams
and players out there,

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
competing to be
number one in Japan.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Dude, I get it.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
This place is something else.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
Now I understand why

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
you want to come
and play here so badly.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
There's a setter
worthy of standing

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
in the middle court
and that's you.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
When are you gonna
stop making this about me?

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
You need to imagine
yourself standing there!

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
Actually want it for once!

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Trust me, when you play against
the best players on the court,

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
you'll want it even more!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
To get stronger and to compete
for however long you can!

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
That's why I want you
to be our ace,

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.429 position:50% align:center
so you can experience that.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
I swore that'd I go
to Meisei Academy

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
and play in the Spring
Tournament, but I can't.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
Not anymore.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
I will make it, but I want
to do it with my new school.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
They're my team now.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
There's no need to apologize.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
Sota came to me almost in
tears asking if he could quit.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
The path you choose
is all up to you.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
You've gotten older, and
you're in high school now.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
So, of course
it's totally natural

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
that some of your friends

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
and interests have
changed along the way.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
That's part of growing up,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
and there's not a
thing wrong with it.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
Then, you also spoke with Sota?

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. Truly.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
I said you don't
need to apologize.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
You were the one who got hurt
most in all of this, Chika.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
Let someone else say it now.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
We're sorry.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine,
but thank you, Miss Minami.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here on my own.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
Seiin might've been just the
change you needed, like he said.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.202 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Hold up. How did you
know about Seiin?

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
[MINAMI]
Who do you think called

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
and told me you were
at the hospital?

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
The coach from Meisei
asked if I could get you.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Your old coach?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
[MINAMI]
Apparently, he felt responsible

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
about you transferring.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
He figured all
this would blow over

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
once you entered high school.

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
There was even a
moment that he thought

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
about bringing you back,
but then he decided against it.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
Because he knew you were
in good hands over there.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
You've got quite
the famous coach.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA, KUROBA]
Our coach? Famous?

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
Nobody lives in a bubble.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
Adults have connections
you kids don't understand yet.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
You're where?

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
Just how much trouble
are you two gonna cause us?

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA, HAIJIMA]
We're sorry, Captain.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
[ODA] About the
prefectural qualifiers,

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
we're back in.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Whoa, are you serious?

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Yeah.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Someone came to Kuroba's
defense and spoke up.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Wait. Was it...?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Your cousin. What's her name?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
Itoko.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
[ITOKO] Yuni Kuroba has a bruise
on his face because I hit him!

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
He teased me, so boom!
Right in the face!

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
If I knew the team
was suspended,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
I would've said
something sooner!

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
So, that's resolved.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
Why would you decide
to keep something like that

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
a secret from everyone?

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Cause Itoko would've
been forced to apologize.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope that wasn't the
only reason you kept it quiet.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.748 position:50% align:center
It's that or lose volleyball.

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There's no other reason.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
Well, all right.

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
Moving on from that, then.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
Haijima, are you
feeling any better

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
after your little episode?

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I'm good.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
Cool. The prefect qualifiers
start at the end of September.

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
We've only got a month,

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
which means we gotta
hustle harder now.

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
We're gonna see
this through to the end

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
and back each other up,

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
like all our lives depend on it.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're never alone.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
Copy that.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
We'll be back in plenty of time.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's me again.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
Because of what I did,

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
you and the rest of the team

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
nearly lost your shot
at competing this year.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
Captain, I really want to go
to the Spring Tournament.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
I wanna be there with you
and the rest of our team

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
and hit a spike right
across that center court.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
It's clear now.

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
I realize what
I wanted this entire time

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
was the same thing
that Haijima wanted.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.468 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know this by now,

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
but this setter of ours
is way beyond greedy.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
Everyone calls him a genius
and he's got a lot of talent,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
but the truth is,
he's never satisfied.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
He's always hungry for
some new kind of challenge.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
And the way his eyes light up

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
whenever he mentions
the Spring Tournament.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
Well, I have this feeling

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
it's gotta be the
mother of all treasures!

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Trust me,
you're getting through.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
We got the message
loud and clear,

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
and we know you're always
looking out for us.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
See you at tomorrow's practice

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
with the rest of the team.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
[ALL 4]
Heya.

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
That's your breakfast?

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.588 position:50% align:center
Guys, we've gotta have a talk.

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
Since our
suspension's been lifted,

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
we want to spend as much
time on the court gearing up

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
for the qualifier as we can.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
Figures.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
The third-years showed up first,

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.099 position:50% align:center
followed by all
the second-years,

00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
and guess who has
the balls to turn up late?

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
Heh. If you think
we got here first,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
you better take
a look inside the gym.

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Haijima, I'm only
gonna tell you this once.

00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
I know I said you
were greedy, but me?

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
You have no idea.

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
Not only do I have
an amazing setter,

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
but I want everything you want.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
And if that wasn't enough,
I also wanna be your ace.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
So, you ain't got
nothing on my greed.

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:15.710 position:50% align:center
FYI, wanting my talent along

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
with everything
I'm working for is ambitious,

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
no question about it.

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:22.425 position:50% align:center
But if that is what you want,
you better be prepared,

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.011 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm going
to climb even higher.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:27.764 position:50% align:center
Could you let me
outdo you just once?

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:30.600 position:50% align:center
First step's getting through
the prefect qualifier,

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.936 position:50% align:center
which means we have to
break Fukuho Tech's streak

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:34.729 position:50% align:center
for being the reps each year.

00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:36.940 position:50% align:center
We can't waste time
at that level.

00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:39.275 position:50% align:center
Then again, we don't
have time, period.

00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:42.445 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Let's go!

00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:43.655 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Yeah!

00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:49.327 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Kuroba. We can make it.

00:22:56.793 --> 00:23:00.547 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] This team can make it
to the Spring Tournament.
