00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
He's left-handed?

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
A spike serve!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
[SEIIN cheering]
Yeah!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Look at him. How's he so calm?

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
Sorry, dude!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Now the right hand.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
He uses both?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
Sweet!

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Who the hell is that kid?

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Kimichika Haijima.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
Powerhouse player from
Tokyo up until last year.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
He's a second-year
starting setter.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
Even been picked as
MVP in a tournament.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Kimichika... Haijima.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
[ODA] All right, so all
you first-years,

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
start by introducing yourself
and what position you've played.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
First up, Ryo Nagato.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
Where're you?

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
Here, sir.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
My name's Ryo Nagato,
from Class 1-E.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
I'm from Monshiro Middle School.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
Currently a
178 centimeters tall.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
As for position, last year
I was typically middle blocker.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
--Next.
--Yes, sir.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
Yuni Kuroba, from
Monshiro Middle School.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
One hundred eighty-four
centimeters.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
And I played wing spiker.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Hmm...

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
It's only you two?

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
I show there's supposed
to be another player

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
from your middle school.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.419 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
He should be
enrolled here with you.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
Haijima...

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
...Kimichika...?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, you see.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
After the prefect tournament,
he quit showing up.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's
not playing volleyball.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Can I help you?

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
I'm Oda, a third-year.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
This is Aoki.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
We're in charge of
the volleyball club.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
He's a middle blocker
and I'm a wing spiker.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
His position's obvious, but...

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
Your point is?

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
You want me to join?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Since you pick up on things
fast, let's get to business.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
How come you didn't stop by
and check out our club?

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
You got through the
prelims for the Inter-High

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
but lost in the first
match of the finals, 1-2.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
You lost 0-2 in the second
round at the Fall Tournament

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
and 0-2 in first round of
the Spring Tournament prelims.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
Didn't make the rookie's match.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
So, I don't see the
point of joining a team

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
where I'm the only
halfway decent player.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
Just a sec!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
We're not done
talking yet, first-year!

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shin.
We don't need this guy.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
Let him go.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Pathetic.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
Why're you clinging to
your position so desperately?

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE C]
Wait, what just...?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
[JUDO A] I'm being
completely serious, Oda.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
If you wanna play
in a tournament,

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
then here's what you do:

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
Drop the volleyball
and sign up for judo.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Back off, man.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
You're so persistent.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
You lost the prefect
tournament, right?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
Haven't you had
enough volleyball?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Still got the Spring Tournament.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[JUDO A]
Hold up!

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm not kidding around.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
With your height and physique,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
you belong with us
over on the Judo team,

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
not wasting all that
talent on volleyball.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Give it a rest.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
Aoki.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
We can't do anything
outside 'cause the rain,

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
so we'll meet in the club room.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
Yeah, got it.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
Something on
your mind there, Shin?

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
Uh. No. What would
make you think that?

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
Not a thing.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
[ODA] We have to
somehow rebuild our team

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
by the Spring Tournament.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
Ball game tournament my ass.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] He says to someone
who's working on it?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
[ODA] If only we had
Haijima back then.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Well? Would you care to see

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
who'll be playing in
the ball game festival?

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
You could say things are
looking interesting this year.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
The players for Team C:

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
Misao Aoki, Akito Kanno,
Yuni Kuroba.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
Three guys from
the volleyball club?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
What's with this lineup?

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
Feels wrong having this
many all-stars on one team.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Up to three is perfectly legal.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
I checked the rule book.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
Though, worst case,
I might have to drop out early.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
Don't forget,
I'm managing this thing also.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
You better not!

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
It's no fun if you don't play.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Oh, I won't hold back.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
Well, that's good to hear,
because if you did,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
you realize that I could
never speak to you again.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
You have my assurance
that I'm going all in.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
Might as well see
who's on F team with me.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Haijima?

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
I told you this
year's interesting.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Hi, I'm the
volleyball captain, Oda,

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
playing on team 3-F,
and I'll be in charge today.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
Shorty here's a third-year?
Seriously?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[ODA] The rotation can be
tricky, but just remember.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
There's three guys in the front.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
Keep that formation,
don't mess up the serving order,

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
and you should be okay.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
We'll start by having you
split up into your teams

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
and do some practice.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
[OKUMA]
Question, Captain, sir.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Go ahead.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
Where's the fun in us
practicing separately?

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
Teams B and F
should have a match.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
We'll be playing on
the day of the festival.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
So, I don't understand
the benefit of letting you

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
get an idea of how our team
performs before then.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Kinda funny how you're
making it sound like

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
we have the advantage here, Cap.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
One little game wouldn't hurt.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
It's not like you'd lose to a
buncha amateurs like us, right?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
Aren't captains supposed
to be able to jump

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
like two meters high?

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I hope so, 'cause otherwise,

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
we could probably bat you down
without leaving the ground.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Haijima! You're with us!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
Someone go get Kanno from 2-C.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
He's on the volleyball team.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
Tell him.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
We need a referee.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
Whenever you guys
receive the ball,

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
do your best to get it
over to our setter.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
He's the tall
first-year over there.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
Haijima.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
You good with playing setter?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
You might be a little rusty.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Just how high can you hit?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
If we're talking spikes,
I've done 315 lately.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Not bad,
considering your height.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
Was that a compliment?

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Wait, no.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
What was with that set?

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Like we're supposed
to hit that outta nowhere?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] It was
lower than 315, I know.

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
I haven't played for a while.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
My instinct's off.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
I mean, height's one thing,
but the real problem's timing.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
We've never played together,

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
so how do you expect me
to hit at that tempo?

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
Kuroba could do it.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
Kuroba?

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
So, you can't?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
[ODA] I'll match up this time,
so don't change anything.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
That's not your job.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
I'll match up with your timing.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
If there's some leeway,
can I set it higher though?

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
How about 320?

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Sure. Give it a shot!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Haijima.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Just like I thought.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
You're awesome!

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
[TEAMMATE G]
Yeah! We won!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
[TEAMMATE F]
For real, did you see me?

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
What'll it take to sign you up?

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
The net. It's at 2.43.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
What? Oh. Hey, you're right.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
I wonder how come
I didn't notice that.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
I told them to set it at 2.40

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
since it wasn't
the club meeting today.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
You usually practice with
the net at this height?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
The prelims for the Spring
Tournament are 2.40,

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
but the main tournament
is three centimeters higher.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
It's weird, right?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
How our team's already thinking
about the Spring Tournament.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I'm not
the least bit embarrassed

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
to look that far ahead.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
Know what I think?

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
This is how the
Spring Tournament feels.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
[ODA] It was fun playing
with you today.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
And unless I'm mistaken,

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
you seem to have
had a good time, too.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You're a dyed in
the wool athlete, aren't you?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
What you lack in height,
you make up for in spirit.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Do it.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
Come join the club, Haijima.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
We need you,
and you need a team.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] I'm sure eventually
you'll change your mind.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
People don't tend to like me.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
But as long as
I get to be the setter.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Captain!

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
You all finished
with the ball game lineu--

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
Haijima?

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
What's up?

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
Is he joining the team?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
Well, we're still negotiating,
but I'd like him to.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, because I'm not.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[ODA] That was certainly
loud and clear.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Kuroba? What 'bout you?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
Uh, the thing is...

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
[RYO] You don't know
the full story, Captain!

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
As long as Haijima's
on the team,

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
Yuni won't be able
to play in official games!

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
Us losing at the
prefect tournament,

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
it was basically
'cause of Haijima.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Ryo, that's enough.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
It wasn't his fault.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Back up.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
Eat this!

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
Ugh, damn it!

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] What do you mean
they're on bad terms?

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the reason
Kuroba always messes up

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
during official games
is because of him.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
It goes back to one of their
middle school tournaments.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Then we have no choice but to
pair them against one another.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
For the finals, we'll have you
on Team C with Kuroba,

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
and I'll be on
Team F with Haijima.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking let's make
the two of 'em throw down.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
A good brawl will work out

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
whatever's been
going on between them.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
That's your brilliant solution?

00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
We'd ruin our only shot
at getting Haijima to join.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't we a bit obsessive?

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
Well, after seeing him play,
I'm kinda surprised you aren't.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
So, if you want my opinion,
I'm digging Okuma.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
We could use someone
with his build.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
It would make
the team look stronger.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Problem is he's
already on the rugby team.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, I'll convince him.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
Dude, we should focus on Haijima

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
before we try and
snag other players.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
What would you say
to a little wager?

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
If C Team wins,
then we get Okuma to join.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
If F wins, we'll take Haijima.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
Have we got a deal?

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
You're not seriously--

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE]
Aoki!

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
One of the teachers
just keeled over!

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
Keeled over?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE] Apparently,
it's 'cause of the weather.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
It might be heatstroke.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Who's gonna referee?

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] Well, guess it'll
just have to be me.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
[ODA] You're supposed
to play in the game!

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
Don't get yourself worked up.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
Kanno's still gonna be there.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
He can take my spot.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
I don't see the point
of making Kuroba sit out.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Having two experienced
players on each team

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
is probably for the better.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center
We would've won even
with three against two.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
Don't be so sure of that.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Kuroba's looking
pretty nervous over there.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
We're allowed to do spike serves
during the finals, right?

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
Yep. Feel free to go wild.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
It's been eleven months.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
Let's see if you've
gotten any better.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
Right side!

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
How's that fair?

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
Hey! Why's the ref
giving out directions?

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
His defense is almost worse.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.733 position:50% align:center
Back row!

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
[ODA] So, he's given
up on Kuroba entirely

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
and trying to get
all the sets to Kanno.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
Blockers on the right!

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
That's time out.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
The hell, man?

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
You saw it.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Kuroba self-destructs when
he's face-to-face with blockers.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
Has he even been practicing?

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
He's been like that since April.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
As soon as he feels any
pressure, he's through.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
Just like the
prefect tournament.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
Honestly, he's useless
in official matches.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Why? Why is
he getting so hung up?

00:15:56.581 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
[ODA] Something happened during
the middle school tournament.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
What about it?

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
That was his
debut match, wasn't it?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
Some players don't recover
after their first defeat.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
So, tell me.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Are you saying
it was all my fault?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
I mean, what was
I supposed to do?

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
I waited for him!

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
At the station on that day.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.020 position:50% align:center
For so long.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
And then, he went
and abandoned me.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
You're keeping him in? Jeez.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
He's got the body.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
Nothing's stopping him.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
If I had his height, then I'd...

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
C'mon get one over, Kuroba!

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? Get back here!

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
Stop running!

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
What's your problem?

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
Fight back, damn it!

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
At least get one over the net!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna get nervous
over a ball game tournament,

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.886 position:50% align:center
you don't deserve to play!

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
Just quit already!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm nervous!

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's a
ball game tournament!

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
But it's the first game
I'm supposed to lose on purpose.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
It's not as if I can
decide when to choke,

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
but I'll do it if
that's what it takes.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Wait. What're you...?

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Aoki made me an offer.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
If our team lost this match,

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
then you were supposed
to join the volleyball team.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
This was your plan all along?

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
Dude, this is stupid.

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
Come back, already.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
I miss you!

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
Us, being on the court!

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
--Kuroba.
--[whistle blows]

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
And with that, you're both out.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
If you two want to fight,
go join the judo club.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
Do you know how much sleep
I lost preparing this event?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop making a mockery of it.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
Where is the respect?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
[ODA] You're okay with
them leaving the net up?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who asked them to.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
I'll take it down.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
What gives?

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
supposed to be at 2.40.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
It was the finals,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
so I had them do 2.43.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Besides, we had plenty
of experienced players.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
So listen, the team's having
a party at this restaurant.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
We meet over at
the gates at 6:30.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Well, don't expect me
to show up.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
You know, the thing
about volleyball

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
is It sure knows how
to pick its people.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
A player can't keep
hitting the ball themselves,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
and you can't win on your own,

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
no matter how good you are.

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
Remember saying that?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
Got my ass kicked for it.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
There's been plenty of times
I cried over my height,

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
believe me, but some things
in life you can't change.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter how much
training I do, my technique,

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
or telling myself
I'm never losing to anyone.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.978 position:50% align:center
In the end, there'll always
be someone taller than me

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
on the other side of the net.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
It kinda makes me
wonder why I got hooked

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
on volleyball in
the first place.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
Because nothing else
can compare to it.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
It's not even close.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
Got that right.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
Truth is, there's nothing
I love more than this sport

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
and that's something no
one can ever take away from me.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
I feel the same.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:14.297 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Haijima.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
I'll be honest with you,
the reason I wanted you

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
to join the team
was for my own sake.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
I'm a third-year now,
but I still want to play

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
as many games as I possibly can.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
So how about it?

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
Think I can talk you
into helping me out here?

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
Show me what you've got.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
One thing, were you serious

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
about playing the
Spring Tournament?

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
That's why the net is
2.43 meters high, right?

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and if you join our team,

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
I'm absolutely sure
that Seiin will make it

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
to the nationals this year.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
There's not a doubt in my mind.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
I want you to believe in me!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
And give me
everything you've got.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.476 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] So, did Haijima
say he'll join the team?

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.061 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Who knows?

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.605 position:50% align:center
At the very least, I think he'll
show up to the next practice.

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:37.774 position:50% align:center
[AOKI] Frankly,
I'm not set on the idea.

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:41.277 position:50% align:center
But still, good for you.

00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:42.654 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:45.657 position:50% align:center
So, thanks for... you know.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.158 position:50% align:center
One day, you'll learn.

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:50.078 position:50% align:center
Your problem is you
think way too highly of me.

00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:52.706 position:50% align:center
Everything I do is
'cause I got ulterior motives.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.207 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.167 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:59.462 position:50% align:center
[AOKI]
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
