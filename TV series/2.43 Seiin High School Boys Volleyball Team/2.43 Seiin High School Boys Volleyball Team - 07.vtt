00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
Let's play!

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the invitation.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
Let's have a good game.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
[PLAYERS]
Yes, sir!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
We really appreciate this
opportunity, Coach Ichijodani.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
Oh, please, don't mention it.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
Just show these
young'uns how it's done.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
Do you guys happen
to have a sink nearby?

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
I need to put
my contacts in first.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
You can use the one in
front of the changing rooms.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Hold on.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
Where ya running off to, buddy?

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
Can't get out of playing
this match that easily!

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Pipe down guys,
we're at someone else's school!

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
The net's up at 243.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Do you want me
to bring it down a bit?

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
Nah, that's all right.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.722 position:50% align:center
We're already used to
practicing at that height, too.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
Well, we haven't played
any official games

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
with that regulation yet,
unlike you.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
You guys have got a few
nationals under your belts.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
Our first real time playing 243.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
This'll be awesome.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
I'm on a roll!

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.544 position:50% align:center
Haijima, another one!

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.712 position:50% align:center
No, we're finished.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:51.755 position:50% align:center
Let's clean up.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Aw!

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
Look at him.
Their number seven's a trip.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
It's kinda like looking
at me from two years ago.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.181 position:50% align:center
I see their number eight's
got him totally whipped.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
If you took him
out of the picture, 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
their whole team
would fall apart.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
Why would you leave so
much up to a single first-year?

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
--[MIMURA] Ochi.
--Huh?

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
You do wanna be in
center court, don't you?

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] You wanna be in center
court at the Spring Tournament?

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
Not that again.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
No offense, but you're beginning

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
to sound like
a broken record here.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
Whatever, bro, just say it.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
'Cause I won't stop repeating it

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
until I take us to nationals
with you as our manager.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
Why, though? It's dumb.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
Think of it as something
for good luck.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
Go on, then.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
What, like a mantra?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
Yep. Now say it.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
Duh.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course
I wanna be there.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
So come this spring,
you better make sure

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
I get to stand on center court.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
To be there at nationals and
cheer you on from the bench...

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
You know that's my dream.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
All righty then!

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
Priority number one: Let's take
the competition down a peg,

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
starting with that guy.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
The other so-called prodigy.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
I got it, guys!

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
They've matched us
point for point so far.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, we can catch a break

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
when Subaru's up front
on the third rotation.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
Did they actually...?

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
Waterfall.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
Is this the 23rd side
out in a row?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
No freaking way.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50% align:center
Good hustle, boys.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
We'll cut them off,
so don't lose your cool.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
How many is that for Subaru?

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
He's hit 11 and scored nine.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
Is Kohei having
trouble recovering?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
He's not the best when it
comes to staying focused.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
Gotta get him back in the game.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Touch!

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Free ball!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Haijima's doing even
better than I thought.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, we're giving
the ball to Subaru too much.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.990 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but from the looks
of it he isn't slowing down.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
I'm out here!

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
I touched it!

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
Keeping the ball away from
Subaru is less predictable.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
We can control the flow,
which is the better strategy.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
Right, but that's still
putting a lot on him.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
[HATA] Not to mention he'll
figure it out before long.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
[HATA]
He is our ace, after all.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Oda and Kanno
can attack from the back.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
Which one will
you set up, Haijima?

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
A strong dump shot!

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:46.948 position:50% align:center
They surprised us.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
None of our guys
saw that coming!

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
His left hand can hit as
powerfully as his right?

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
This'll be tricky.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
Bring it over left side!

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
You got this, Subaru!

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
--Yeah!
--Yes!

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[cheering]

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
That break was teamwork!

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
Okay, then.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Which one's next on deck?

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
Yes! He blocked it.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
--[FUKUHO A] Subaru!
--[FUKUHO B] C'mon Subaru!

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO D]
You show 'em how it's done!

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO E]
Do it to 'em, Subaru!

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[excited chatter]

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I see now.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
So that's the Demon Bazooka.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
Contact!

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
Yu!

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
Slam it in, Kohei!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
[FUKUHO F]
Yeah!

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
Damn, guys.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
Nice hustle!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
[OCHI] Don't get
too full of yourselves.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA] Consider me
officially wiped out.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna leave
the rest to Kohei.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
I've already talked
to Coach Hata.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
That last set though,
you didn't need to go that hard.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
I have a rep to protect.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm Fukuho's captain, the
team ace, and the prefect MVP.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
Everybody's counting on me,
so it's my job to take them

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
to the center court
at nationals, remember?

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
That includes you and the coach,

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
our entire team
and their families,

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
and each of the former teammates

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
who graduated before
they could make it.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
I've got so much
riding on my back.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Talk about pressure, huh?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
[OCHI]
In my opinion, it's too much.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
[MIMURA]
But taking that responsibility?

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
That's the stuff
that keeps me moving.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
It's this energy
that's so powerful

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
they can't even imagine it.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
Those newbies have no idea.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
There's no way
they'll get close to it.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
That's why I go hard.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
I won't lose to anyone.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
Kohei!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
Show 'em what Fukuho's made of!

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
Give those kids
everything ya got!

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
Will do. Okay!

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
C'mon on boys.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
Let's get this show on the road!

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
He might be a pain in the
neck who mopes out easily,

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
but lucky for us he's also
super easy to pick back up.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
I can't with you.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
You're something else, man.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
Don't let 'em bait ya,
two on the left!

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
Sweet. More of that!

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
[PLAYERS]
Thank you for the game!

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
We took three sets apiece.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
That makes it an even tie.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
Let's be real now,
you let us have our three.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
We've got our
work cut out for us.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.605 position:50% align:center
That so, huh?

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
Can't wait till we
play you in the finals.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
Slow down, bro.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
You're talking like you're
gonna make it there for sure.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
You betcha.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
Well, all right then.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
We'll be waiting
for you at the net.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
Number eight!

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
See ya later.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
Jeez, would it kill him
to crack a smile?

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
What was that kid's name again?

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
It's Haijima.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
Kimichika Haijima.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
Bye, Subaru.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Five days
until prefect qualifiers.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
We can't let Aoki and Oda retire

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
before we make it to
the real deal in January.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
Priorities, dude.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
When we play against Fukuho,

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
you know you'll be
facing off with Subaru, right?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
What, is that s'posed to
psych me out or something?

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
He's a beast, but
I don't get the impression

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
that he's totally unbeatable,

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:10.295 position:50% align:center
so I'm not exactly
losing my cool, ya know?

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
So, you didn't feel a
sense of impending doom?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
Wait, seriously?

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
I'll take that as a hint
I need to be training more.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
You have some
major catching up to do,

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
so get on his level by November.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
[ODA] We have to survive round
one of the qualifiers first.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA, HAIJIMA]
Right.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
Our team can't go
toe-to-toe against Fukuho

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
until we win three games.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
--Sir!
--Understood.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
By the way, thanks.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
For giving me time.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
Letting me stay on
as captain till January.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Oh. If you heard
what I said earlier,

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
you could've clued me in sooner.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Oda.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
--[KANNO] Heyo.
--[UCHIMURA] Hey.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Could you sit out
when we play Fukuho?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
Wha... What the hell.
Say that again?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
Fine. Look, Oda.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
I think you should sit out.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
Then who's replacing him?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm next in the lineup.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
During our practice match,

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
they kept hitting balls
over you, Oda.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
And next time they'll be
even more merciless.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
Considering how all the other
members are taller than him,

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
it doesn't make sense
to have him up front.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
Big deal,
so we find a workaround,

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
which I'm pretty
sure is your job.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
We can try attacking in
different ways, but still,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
our blocking strategy,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
I can't do jack about height.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
Hold on, back up a few steps.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
If we switch and we sacrifice
all our attack power,

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
then what's the point?

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we have me
to make up for that.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
Uchimura, you'd finally be
getting the opportunity

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
to actually play.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be
jumping at the chance?

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
Aren't you sick of
warming the bench?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
Especially with first-years
on the starting lineup.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
Do you have the guts to own
your position on this team?

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
Because I'm not sure you do.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
But if I'm wrong,

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
I'll do everything
I can to have your back.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Listen, Oda.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
You said you wanna play
this game for one day,

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
or even just a second.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
For as long as you can.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
You asked me, so I'm
willing to help you do that.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
But are you willing to
stay off the court as well?

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
To take one for the
good of the team?

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
Are you? Or did you only
intend to put yourself first?

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
Dude, um...

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
Us swapping out Uchimura
and Kuroba is one thing,

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
but if we're talking
Uchimura and Oda,

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
that's unknown territory.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
We should really buckle down

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
and polish up
every potential strategy.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
We still have two months
before the finals

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
which is plenty of time
to prep for our Fukuho match.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
In that case,
then this probably wasn't

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
the perfect moment
to bring this up, Haijima.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
Qualifiers are coming up.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
You didn't need to throw us
all off our game five days out.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
Taking Oda off of the court...

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
It's more than a
simple matter of logistics.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
You'd be taking away the
emotional backbone of the team!

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
But, the qualifiers...

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
We should still try it.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Ah... What's wrong?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
You boys not practicing?

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
Oh, Coach. Sorry. Go ahead.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
You guys get started
while I talk with the coach.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
I do get what
Haijima's trying to say.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Uchimura made good points, too.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
We'll discuss it later.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
Aoki, are you cool with that?

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
It's whatever you say, Captain.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
Haijima.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
Give me some time
to mull this over, okay?

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
I don't have a ready response
to your proposition right now.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting
some big changes here,

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
so I wanna be totally sure.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
Now, enough yammering.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
Let's get that net up.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
So intense.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50% align:center
Holy crap.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
I... That was, uh...

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] You didn't have
to be so aggro, you dumbass.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh... Uchimura?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
What's up, Kuroba?

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Uh, do you have a sec?

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering,

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
what the heck was
that weird convo earlier?

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
Are we supposed to pretend
it never happened?

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
That's what you
wanna talk about?

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Look, hear me out.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
About what Haijima said,
I was curious about

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
whether you were
actually getting cold feet

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
about stepping up.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
You know those TV documentaries
about sports legends?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
The ones who always say,

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
"If I was able to do it,
then anybody could.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
With hard work"?

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
I say that's a load of crap.

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
I reckon they think
they're being humble,

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
but that's 'cause
they can afford to be.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
To have the ability
to push beyond your limits--

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
that's an exceptional skill
in a class of its own.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.084 position:50% align:center
But people don't get that,

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
so they ask for the world
like all it takes is hard work.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
That's why we think
Haijima's out of line.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
I see you taking it in, but
clearly you don't get it either.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Lemme guess, you feel the exact
same way he does, don't you?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
And you figured
you'd convince me

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
to give it the ol' college try.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
Is that the whole reason
you dragged me out here?

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
Huh? That wasn't my plan.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
Wasn't it, though?

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
Come on. Jeez.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
You might not be the
brightest bulb in the bunch,

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
so thank goodness you're
at least easy to talk to.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
Haijima's never gonna get it

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
through that
stubborn skull of his,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
so listen carefully 'cause you
need to get on board with this.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
If we end up losing
Oda on defense,

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
you're the only one who can
back him up, you understand?

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
if he takes another position

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
he might get totally crushed.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
Wait. I see what
you're asking for,

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
but you can't expect me
to back him up forever.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
Ah... I see.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
You can unclench.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
I fully intend
to bring my A-Game,

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
not that I have
a choice, anyway.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
He called me out
in front of the team.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
[UCHIMURA]
And besides, I'm just like Oda.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
When you're not a pain, I think
you guys are pretty okay.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
I'm not about to rain on
that fresh first-year mojo.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
[running footsteps]

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
Haijima? What's got
you in such a rush?

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
You good?

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
They said there's somebody
calling me from home.

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
Grandma what?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
She's hurt and in the hospital?

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
It'll be two or
three days. I see.

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
Uh... Really?
I should be there, too!

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Kuroba?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
Fine, then. I'll do that.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
Okay. Bye.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
Haijima, what did
your folks say?

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed
to go home with you.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
--That cool?
--Huh?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA'S GRANDFATHER]
Listen, now.

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Ask Kuroba if you can stay
with him until Sunday.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
You have an important match
coming up, don't you?

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
Actually, Kiminobu
suggested the arrangement.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
This was dad's idea?

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA'S GRANDFATHER]
Well, he asked Grandma and me

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
to take care of you.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
But for now, he figured
this was the next best thing.

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA'S GRANDFATHER] Your
father had a lot of regrets.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Back when you were
still in middle school,

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
when that incident happened...

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
He's sorry it took him
so long to realize

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
what you were going through.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
[door slides open]

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Hey. Can we talk?

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
What's up?

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, lay it on me.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
Where to start?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
You see, my grandpa told me...

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
He said that my dad had regrets

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
about what happened
with me in middle school.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
Are you actually coming
to me for advice, bro?

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
Forget it!

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Wait, my bad.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
The middle school thing?

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
You mean with Sota?

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I was wrong for it,

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
for what I told Sota
and the team back then.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the fact that
my dad was bent outta shape.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
Tell me if I've got this right:
You don't like

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
that he's upset when you
didn't do anything wrong?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
I pointed out some
obvious things to work on.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
I knew the best way we could
win and I shared that.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
D'ya get it?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
It practically
guarantees that Oda

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
will make it on
the court this spring.

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it?

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
Look, pal.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows
you're probably right.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
When it comes to volleyball,

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
we can trust
the decisions you make,

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
and I bet nobody believes
that more than Oda.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
You say that,
but they won't listen.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
If they don't want to win,

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
then I can't stay on this team.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Whoa, wait.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make
sense that we're aware

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
of what we can do to improve

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
but none of us are willing
to follow through.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
None of that's on me.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
So...

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
So then, how come
I feel this--this regret?

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
I mean, I could totally
be off base here,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
but maybe it's the
same thing my dad felt.

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
Or maybe it isn't.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
What the hell.

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
Are you listening to me?

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
Man, what am
I going to do with you?

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
I swear you're
driving me insane!

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
What're you implying?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
Ugh, dammit.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.814 position:50% align:center
Now I completely forgot
what I wanted to say.

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
I know! Subaru Mimura!

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Yep.
He's the key to our victory!

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
You're saying
I should think like him.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
Me?

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
To begin with, Subaru's
a spiker, genius.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
You're a setter, remember?

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who's
the spiker here.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
You and me?

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
We make a pretty good pair
between the two of us, don't we?

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
With both of
our skills combined,

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
we have what it takes
to be like Subaru.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
Even though he's
two years older than us,

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
I'd wager we've got
enough combined experience

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
to match him.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
That's not enough.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
You need to catch up
to that guy's level

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
on your own, understand?

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
You need to surpass him.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA] Why are we raising
the bar all of a sudden?

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
And when did this conversation

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
become about us
instead of about me?

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
Dumbass.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
[KUROBA]
You city boys really know

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
how to hurt a guy's feelings.

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:52.831 position:50% align:center
[ICHIJODANI]
Hmm...

00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:56.584 position:50% align:center
This is the starting lineup you
want for the prefect qualifiers.

00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:58.044 position:50% align:center
Right, Oda?

00:22:58.128 --> 00:22:59.462 position:50% align:center
[ODA]
Yes.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:01.172 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir.
