1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,416
[MERO] Not to state the obvious,

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,458
but the Furuya household
is also a temple.

3
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,916
There've been a few minor
changes around here lately.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,791
For starters, we've got
a zombie staying with us,

5
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,708
but I'm sticking
to my routine.

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,083
I mean these chores
aren't gonna do themselves.

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,208
[CHIHIRO] Hey, Rea!

8
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,750
Don't stay
outside too long.

9
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,041
The sun's awfully
bright today.

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,625
I'll be inside in a minute.

11
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,583
Oh, hi, Mero!

12
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,875
Hello?

13
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,958
What's her problem?

14
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,666
Come on, it's way too hot!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,291
[MERO] I'm sure
you're all concerned

16
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,583
about the high-tension
cliffhanger predicament

17
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,958
my brother and Rea have
got themselves into.

18
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,666
But never fear.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,750
I'd like to offer
you a brief respite

20
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,500
from their dreadful drama.

21
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,666
Now enjoy this palate-cleansing
side dish of a story.

22
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,958
Hey, Mero.

23
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,083
It's time for me
to head out for the day.

24
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,250
Do you think you'll
get home late again tonight?

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,708
Most likely.

26
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,208
I've got three different
parishioners to visit.

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,375
I'll try to eat dinner
before I come home.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,916
Sure, less work for me.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,875
And Chihiro said
he's going out with Rea

30
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,958
so don't bother making
anything for him either.

31
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,041
Well that's unusual.

32
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,333
He's sure surprised me.

33
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,083
I'll admit I was a little
skeptical at first.

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,958
Him wanting to take
responsibility for Rea and all?

35
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,875
But here he is,
still sticking to it.

36
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, it's kind of bizarre.

37
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,916
He's always been so
lazy and dependent,

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
relying on you to take care
of everything for him.

39
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,375
And now he seems
determined to protect her.

40
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,250
It's like he's actually
getting his act together.

41
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,833
Hey, Mero.

42
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,541
You would probably
finish a lot faster

43
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,625
if you didn't just keep
sweeping the same spot.

44
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,791
Oh.

45
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,250
Well, I guess
I'd better get going.

46
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,208
Yeah.

47
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,000
Everything
my dad said is true.

48
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
This is the first time

49
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,541
I've ever seen Chihiro
work so hard in his life.

50
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:37,250
And the fact that
he's working this hard

51
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,708
for someone other than
himself makes it even weirder.

52
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,791
[school bell rings]

53
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,833
C'mon, this is a huge deal!

54
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,708
"With dramatic spikes in
zombie spottings worldwide,

55
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,541
is humanity doomed to become

56
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,750
a shambling race
of undead ghouls?"

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,375
This is my classmate,
Ichie Shinoda.

58
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,500
What?

59
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,083
Everyone knows
zombies don't exist.

60
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,416
And this pillar
of naivety is Miko Yasaka.

61
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,958
I mean it's like, y'know.

62
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,625
If there were actual zombies,

63
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,083
they'd be all over
the news by now.

64
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,166
That glaring omission is proof!

65
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,500
The government is
lying to the people

66
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,208
and covering up information!

67
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,625
Trust me, I read
about it on the internet.

68
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,291
But if zombies were really
about to take over the world,

69
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,375
don't you think that
we would've at least seen

70
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,833
some sign of them by now?

71
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,125
I have!

72
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
There are zombies among us.

73
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,541
And they're closer
than you realize!

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,125
Y'mean Mero?

75
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,041
No, I didn't mean that close.

76
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,583
Just listen to me!

77
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,833
I'm trying to warn you.

78
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,291
There's a legitimate
cause for concern, here!

79
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,083
The art teacher, Yamanouchi.

80
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,250
Wait, do you mean
Miss Yamanouchi?

81
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,541
Yes, geez!

82
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,791
Miss Yamanouchi!

83
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,833
I remembered that
I'd left something

84
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,000
in the art room as I was
leaving the other day.

85
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,291
But when I went to get it,

86
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,708
it struck me as odd that anyone
would be in there that late.

87
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,416
And that's when I saw it.

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,416
There ya go, eat up.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,625
Good boy.

90
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,041
Tasty, isn't it?

91
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,916
You want some more?

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,458
She was holding raw meat

93
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,666
dripping with blood
in her bare hands.

94
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,833
And she was feeding it
to something in a bag.

95
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,458
And to make it even weirder.

96
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,791
Y'know, I also noticed something
weird about Miss Yamanouchi.

97
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,833
I walk past the teacher's
lot in the morning,

98
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,041
so I usually see her arrive.

99
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,250
I'd bet my thumb something
was alive in that bag.

100
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,875
There's no way of telling
if it was a zombie,

101
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,333
but whatever it was,
it creeped me out.

102
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,416
Oh! Now that I think about it.

103
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,583
Hah?

104
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,125
I don't know if you
two have noticed it,

105
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,083
but I was just thinking that
she looks really haggard lately.

106
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,791
She looked all skinny and sick

107
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,458
and I was worried
something was wrong with her.

108
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,375
Alright, that settles it!

109
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:45,375
Yamanouchi is a lumbering,
blood-thirsty zombie!

110
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,000
You're still talking about that?

111
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,208
It's blatantly obvious.

112
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,458
Well, if she's a zombie, what
do you think was in the bag?

113
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,583
Baby?

114
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,666
Or maybe some kind
of zombie underling.

115
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,291
No matter how you add it up,

116
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,416
there's no way it could
possibly be anything else.

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,041
So, now that we've narrowed
down all possibilities,

118
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,083
let's get solid
proof she's a zombie!

119
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,791
You want us to get proof?

120
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,416
Well, who else?

121
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,666
It's our duty
as official zombie hunters.

122
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,541
We'll expose the legion
of the undead among us!

123
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,375
We're zombie hunters?

124
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,833
I guess?

125
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,125
Here you go.

126
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
Sorry to keep you all cooped up,

127
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,875
but I've got a nice
big dinner here for you.

128
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,208
Now you make sure to fill
your belly all nice and full.

129
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,958
I didn't think
this would be so scary.

130
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,333
How can you be scared?

131
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,000
We're about to see an actual
zombie, this is awesome!

132
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,083
Oh, man, here it comes.

133
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,291
[ALL gasp]

134
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,166
Open wide.

135
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,375
You've got a pet alligator,
Miss Yamanouchi?

136
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,666
I do indeed.

137
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,208
Isn't she so cute?

138
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,875
Maybe?

139
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,333
Sorry, but I've gotta ask.

140
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,666
Why do you bring
your pet alligator to school?

141
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,958
I get worried about
her being alone all day.

142
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,875
You always hear news reports
about alligators getting lost,

143
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
and getting found
in the sewers, you know?

144
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,875
Well, that's only a small
part of my reasoning.

145
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,625
The simple truth is
that I hate to spend

146
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,500
even a single minute
away from my sweet girl.

147
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,041
And so naturally,
you stuff her inside a bag

148
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,916
and try to hide her
in the art room.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
Yep.

150
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,250
I hate waiting
for the day to end.

151
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,833
But it's so worth it
when it finally does.

152
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,166
Feeding her after school
is my greatest comfort in life!

153
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,333
Uh-huh.

154
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,833
She can be such
a ravenous little monster.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,041
Uh, we were wondering.

156
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,083
Have you not been
feeling well lately?

157
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,166
You look like you've
lost a lotta weight.

158
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,958
You can thank her for that, too.

159
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,291
I've been preparing liver
for her dinner lately.

160
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,041
But it's started
to look so darned delicious.

161
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,958
I actually decided
to share it with her.

162
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,458
And it's really done
a number on my stomach.

163
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,208
How embarrassing.

164
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,458
I assumed I could eat it
like liver sashimi,

165
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,583
but I guess that's what I get
for carelessly eating raw meat.

166
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,458
My stomach's
been in such a state,

167
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,750
I've hardly
been able to eat.

168
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,625
Excuse me.

169
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,375
Hey, Ichie.

170
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,875
Have they been reporting
any more zombie sightings?

171
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,958
Nope.

172
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,750
That's too bad.

173
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,166
Do you wanna hear the crazy
experience I had the other day?

174
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,416
Y'know how I've got such
a super sharp sense of smell?

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,958
Did I know that?

176
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,666
It happened yesterday
on my way home from school.

177
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:27,125
I smelled this really strange
scent wafting down the street.

178
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,541
I don't know how
to properly describe it.

179
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,291
I guess it was like the smell of
a dead human body being boiled.

180
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,916
Whoa, back up.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Miko.

182
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,500
Have you ever actually smelled
a dead human body being boiled?

183
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,708
Where would I have
ever smelled that?

184
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,916
I just imagined that's
what it smells like.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,250
Okay, your imagination
is much more disturbing

186
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,416
than I thought it would be.

187
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,958
Pipe down.

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,708
Just let her finish the story.

189
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,958
Please.

190
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,333
So I followed the smell

191
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,750
to where it seemed
like it was coming from.

192
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,791
A small house covered in ivy.

193
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,041
I decided to peek
over the fence.

194
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,500
And then I saw it.

195
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,875
Finally!

196
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,750
About time this story
started to get interesting!

197
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,958
And then what?

198
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Go on.

199
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,791
Well, I just stood there,
frozen from the shock.

200
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,916
But then--

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,458
Excuse me, little girl.

202
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,875
Can I help you with something?

203
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,666
Please don't kill me
and eat my brains!

204
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,625
[COUPLE laughing]

205
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,416
That has gotta be the funniest
thing I've ever heard.

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,291
That is some wild
imagination you've got on you.

207
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,208
Smelling the soup
and seeing the bones

208
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,958
and thinking we're zombies.

209
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,291
I suppose this means we should
find some zombie customers.

210
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,416
Um.

211
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,250
What kind of soup
smells like that?

212
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,708
My husband quit his job,

213
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,458
and now he's working on
opening up his own ramen shop.

214
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,291
So he's been working
tirelessly, day and night,

215
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,125
7 days a week,
to concoct his very own recipe.

216
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,791
Try it.

217
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,583
Fate has chosen you
as my first patron,

218
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,500
so you've gotta give it a taste.

219
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,250
I know it smells,
but I promise it's delicious.

220
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,583
Go on.

221
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,708
Just a little bite.

222
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,750
Uh... Sure.

223
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,916
I took one bite and
I couldn't even put down

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,708
my chopsticks
until it was gone!

225
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,333
If it smelled that bad, then
it must've been tonkotsu style.

226
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,708
Yeah!

227
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,333
It was the first time
I'd ever heard of the stuff!

228
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,833
What exactly is
the point of this story?

229
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,416
Just that it was probably
the best ramen I've ever eaten!

230
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,375
And it had squat
to do with zombies!

231
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,083
Well I bet zombies don't taste

232
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
anywhere near as good
as that ramen did.

233
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,083
Why would anyone
ever eat a zombie?

234
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,916
What the hell.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,333
Who would've thought hunting
zombies would be such hard work?

236
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,041
But I remain determined
to find one someday soon!

237
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,541
I wonder what zombies
are actually like anyway.

238
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,833
What do you think
they're like, Mero?

239
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,291
If you really wanna know,

240
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,708
our family's had a zombie

241
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,875
living at our home with us
for a few days now.

242
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,083
Are you serious?

243
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:37,000
What's the big deal?

244
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:37,458
Really?

245
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,666
Sweet!

246
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,916
I wanna go see it!

247
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
Sure.

248
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,375
But there isn't any guarantee

249
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,750
she'll be at home,
she might be out.

250
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,833
Then take a picture
we can use as evidence!

251
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,083
We can get it published
and be famous!

252
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,708
You don't have
much familiarity

253
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,916
with the concept
of privacy, do you?

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,541
Zombies don't deserve
any damn privacy!

255
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,291
You may be right, but my
family's home certainly does.

256
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,208
Please understand there is

257
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,541
a delicate business
side to the temple.

258
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,791
Wait!

259
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,625
Did you just say that
the zombie might be out?

260
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,375
That doesn't sound very safe.

261
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,041
No, from what I can tell,

262
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,000
she knows how to take
care of herself alright.

263
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,750
Not her safety!

264
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,291
Zombies attack people
and eat their flesh, don't they?

265
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,750
No. The only thing I've seen
her eat is hydrangea leaves

266
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
so I think she's a vegetarian.

267
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,250
A what?

268
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,875
That is like, the exact
opposite of a normal zombie.

269
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,166
Yeah, I guess that's her game
plan to this whole zombie thing.

270
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,750
She's kind of
irritatingly obsessed

271
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,375
with being a normal girl.

272
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,208
You're not making
any sense here.

273
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,125
Are you sure she's a zombie?

274
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,916
My brother swears that she is.

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,250
Him?

276
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,458
The brother who wants
to make out with a zombie?

277
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,958
This is probably
just some weirdo cosplay!

278
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,041
How can you
actually believe him?

279
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,916
There's no way this is
for real, it's gotta be fake.

280
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,708
Whatevs.

281
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,708
Okay, I've gotta get going.

282
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,000
I need to buy some groceries.

283
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,291
Geez, for a second there

284
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,375
I thought we might
actually have a shot at fame.

For real, your brother

00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,708
is in serious need
of professional help.

287
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,416
You really ought
to tell your mom

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,125
to get him a therapist
or something.

289
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,458
Uh. Hey, c'mon, Ichie.

290
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,666
Mero doesn't have a--

291
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,083
Sorry.

292
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh.

293
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,916
No big deal,
don't worry about it.

294
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,750
Yeah.

295
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,875
I might as well mention
that my mother is dead.

296
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,791
I was so young
when she passed away

297
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,958
I hardly got
the chance to know her.

298
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:44,500
So I don't even have fond
memories of her to fall back on.

299
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,541
Although, there is
one memory of her

300
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,333
that sticks out
clearly in my head.

Hello.

302
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,833
And that memory.

Oh, dear.

a fever, darling?

Oh!

306
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,166
Would you look at me?

307
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,583
How silly.

I can't tell your temperature
with this bandage on.

borrow a stupid zombie DVD.

312

[CHIHIRO] Fine, just hurry
and pick one out, okay?

313

Geez, alright.

314
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,000
It'd be nice to watch one
together like we used to.

Not like I care though.

Why're you being so weird?

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,250
I'm not backing down
without a fight, that's all.

00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,291

322
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,541
I didn't say anything!

00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,958
Ugh.

324
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,416
Talking to you is like
putting my brain in a blender.

325
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,250
Maybe your brain's
just rotting.

326
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,833
Like a zombie!

327
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,750
Whoa! Ya think?

328
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,166
Don't look so excited.

329
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,708
I was only making a joke.

330
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,166
I know.

331
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,666
Hmm.

332
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,375
Chihiro thinks our dead mother

333
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,208
is some kind of
zombie Santa Claus.

334
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,625
Good grief.

335
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:41,208
Why can't he just leave
something normal for a change?

336
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,291
[gong rings]
[bird chirps]

337
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,333
There.

338
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,291
Now that's a proper offering.

339
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,708
[REA] Oh. Hey, Mero.

340
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,958
Hello?

341
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,041
Did you have a good day?

342
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,708
Yeah, I just got home.

343
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,500
Nice to see you, Lady Rea.

344
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,875
Is there something that you're
looking for in the cemetery?

345
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,666
No, nothing in particular.

346
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,041
Chihiro just had an unexpected
guest drop in on him.

347
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,666
So I thought I'd take a walk.

348
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,416
I see.

349
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,750
I dunno.

350
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,666
I can't help but get
a little worried sometimes.

351
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,125
Hmm?

352
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,416
Your family's
done so much for me.

353
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,708
I feel like
I must be such a burden.

354
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,833
No.

355
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
It's not like that at all.

356
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,791
Oh, don't feel bad.

357
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,833
I shouldn't have said anything.

358
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,083
So what are you doing out here?

359
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
You're visiting someone's grave?

360
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,166
Just saying hello.

361
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,875
To my mother.

362
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,083
I didn't know.

363
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,625
I've been kinda
wondering why your mother

364
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,500
was never around,
but I never imagined that.

365
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,875
I'm so impressed
with you, Mero.

366
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,958
You take care of all
the chores, don't you?

367
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,750
Yeah, it's been my job ever
since I was only a little girl.

368
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,250
My parents always pampered me

369
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,125
and didn't allow me
to do anything.

370
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,625
And you're already so
independent and self-sufficient.

371
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,541
I've got a lot
of respect for you, Mero.

372
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,708
Well.

373
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,083
I wouldn't exactly
bother with all of this

374
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,958
if the guys in my family

375
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:24,291
could just get their
crap together.

376
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,458
Oh, I know!

377
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,208
It would really
mean a lot to me

378
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,708
if you'd let me help you
with all the chores from now on.

379
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,125
Huh?

380
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,583
No, I can't let you do
that, that's not right.

381
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,125
Why not?

382
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,083
I'm staying here,
so I should help.

383
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,083
I know it sounds strange,
but I actually wanna do them.

384
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,791
Well, is that alright?

385
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,875
What do you think, Mero?

386
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,291
Mero.

387
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,500
What do you think?

388
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,666
Mm-hmm.

389
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, good!

390
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,291
Oh, no.

391
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,583
Is something wrong?

392
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,625
Why are you holding
your head down like that?

393
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,083
You're all flushed.

394
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,666
Are you running a fever?

395
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,833
It's freezing!

396
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,041
Oh.

397
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,375
How silly of me.

398
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,083
I keep forgetting I'm a zombie.

399
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,750
I'll never be able to tell your
temperature with my cold hands.

400
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:31,625
I love you, Mama!

401
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,666
Mama?

402
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,916
No.

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,625
I mean just forget it!

404
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,666
What?

405
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,625
Hold on!

406
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,791
Wait, Mero!

407
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,833
You forgot something!

408
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Thank you, Lady Rea.

409
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,541
Sorry for freaking out.

410
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,000
There!

411
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,041
You're all wrapped up.

412
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,000
Can I help you make supper?

413
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,208
It was strange.

414
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,291
I know why I called her that,
but it's not like me.

415
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,375
Regardless.

416
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,208
I can't deny how
I felt when it happened.

417
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,166
That's a zombie?

418
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,041
I didn't know
they were so pretty.

419
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,666
This is proof, alright.

420
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,541
It's a total fake.

421
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,375
I felt my mother's presence

422
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,875
from the zombie girl
who lives with us.

423
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,416
How come you
look so down, Mero?

424
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,333
Well, Miss Sanka.

425
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,208
Yeah?

426
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,583
Take a hint.

427
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,750
Take a hint!

428
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,583
Huh?

429
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,458
Oh.

430
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,625
Oh.

431
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,916
Okay.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,458
Next time, on Sankarea,

433
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,375
Episode 10,
"Strong... Feelings..."

434
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,583
Tune in to see Mero!

435
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,000
You know.

436
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,416
I can't help but get the
feeling that you're ungrateful

437
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,291
for Ranko and I helping
you out with this.

438
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,958
Rea! Duck!
