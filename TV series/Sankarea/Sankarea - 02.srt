I'll say it for you.

[REA] I want you to bring me
back whenever I die.

[DAN'ICHIRO] What was that?

00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,458
[REA] Well, I...

165
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,791
I think I'm too old for this,

[DAN'ICHIRO]
Where's this coming from?

167
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,541
It's only natural for a father

of his daughter's
development my dear.

Why can't we just have
a normal relationship?

I want to be

[REA] Of course not.

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,208
[DAN'ICHIRO] I want you

a father feels for his daughter.

I guess it isn't such
a well-known fact about them.

They bloom in most of
the gardens on our property.

My father is
obsessively protective of me

not to eat them ever

Maybe some people
are immune to them?

00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,125
Well, it doesn't matter,

[CHIHIRO] No...
It's time to give up.

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,583
I'm not supposed
to be out right now

315
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,333
so I can't go
in through the front door.

316
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,916
I have to sneak in and out

317
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
using this secret path
through the bushes back here.

318
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,416
Thanks, though.

319
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
[CHIHIRO] Oh... gotcha.

320
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,791
[REA] The only
reason I'm out now

321
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
is because my father
hasn't caught on to me yet.

322
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
I think I really would need

323
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,208
your zombie potion
if he caught me.

324
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,750
[CHIHIRO] Her old
man is sounding

325
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,583
worse and worse
by the second.

326
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,041
[REA] Oh, I almost
forgot to give Babu back.

327
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,708
[CHIHIRO] Right.

328
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,541
[CHIHIRO] Well... see ya.

329
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,833
Try not to be late for Babu's
funeral tomorrow, okay?

330
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,958
I won't! I promise!

331
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,833
See ya!

332
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,916
[DAN'ICHIRO] Who does
she think she's fooling?

333
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,125
[DAN'ICHIRO] Rea!

334
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,000
[RANKO slaps REA]
[REA gasps]

335

[RANKO humming]

336
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
[gate opening and closing]

337
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,125
[RANKO] It's about time
you got home.

338
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,958
[CHIHIRO] You scared
the crap outta me, Wanko!

339
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,875
What the hell are
you doing here so late?

340
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,250
[RANKO] I came to return
the DVD I borrowed from you.

341
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,875
[CHIHIRO]
And somehow found yourself

342
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,416
hanging out
the bathroom window naked?

343
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,958
[RANKO] So I'm suddenly not
allowed to use your bathroom?

344
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,375
[RANKO] Now, then...

345
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,000
You gonna tell me where
you've been out to this late?

346
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,958
Or am I gonna have
to beat it out of you?

347
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,416
[CHIHIRO]
She caught me off guard!

348
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,791
What should I say?

349
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,625
[CHIHIRO] Well I bought
some ice cream earlier today

350
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,791
and then I kinda
fell asleep by the river.

351
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
[RANKO] That's the best
alibi you've got?

352
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,833
Shame it doesn't match up
with what Mero told me.

353
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
She said that you've been
running off and disappearing

354
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,666
until late in the night
ever since Babu died.

355
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,625
[CHIHIRO whimpers]

356
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
[RANKO] And she said
you're always carrying

357
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,666
that cooler with you.

358
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,041
[CHIHIRO] Oh...
Yeah, that...

359
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,833
Ya can't go to
the river without a cooler.

360
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
[RANKO] Alright, fess up...
what's in this thing?

361
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,583
[CHIHIRO] Don't touch it!

362
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,083
I'm serious!

363
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,958
[RANKO] Don't tell me
your obsession with zombies

364
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,583
has pushed you to do something
sick with Babu's body.

365
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,666
[CHIHIRO] No, don't!

366
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,791
[CHIHIRO and RANKO gasp]

367
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
[BABU screaches]

368
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,958
[RANKO] That did not just happen
because it's not possible.

369
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:21,958
[CHIHIRO] Wow.

370
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,416
I can't believe it
actually worked.

371
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,250
[REA] I'm sorry,
Chihiro and Babu.

372
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,916
I can't make the funeral.

373
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He said he'll never let
me leave the house again.

374
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,500
He won't even
let me go to school.

375
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,791
And I know my father.

376
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,416
He means every word of it.

377
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,375
I'm so sorry.

378
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,833
I hope you don't mind...

379
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,583
but I took a little bit
of the potion.

380
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,416
I know it doesn't actually
bring the dead back to life.

381
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
But still...

382
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,625
I'm more concerned
with the poison in it.

383
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
I just want it
to work in reverse.

384
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,791
If I can't be reborn...

385
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,333
I would rather be... dead.

386
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,875
[MERO] Hey...

387
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,958
Why don't you just
go ahead and call it quits?

388
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,208
There's no way you're ever gonna
get people to watch this thing.

389
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,625
What?

390
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,833
It was well received in Japan?

391
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,416
You've gotta be kidding me.

392
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,416
[MERO] Next time, on Sankarea,

393
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,791
Episode 3, "Sanka... Rea..."

394
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,000
Tune in to see Mero!

395
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,625
[MERO] Let me speak to the
illiterate creep who wrote this.

396
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,375
I'd like to have
some real words with him.
