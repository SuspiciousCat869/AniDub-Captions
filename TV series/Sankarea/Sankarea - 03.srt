00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,833
[CHIHIRO] Hey,
are you all right?

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,958
[REA] Hmm?

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,625
I just noticed that
you're limping.

4
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,750
Oh.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,000
I guess I must've
twisted my ankle

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,000
a little when I fell earlier.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,541
But it looks
worse than it is.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll be fine.

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,208
Geez.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,416
Hey, wait a minute...

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,791
just what do you
think you're doing?

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,708
Careful!

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,000
Watch where you
put your hands!

14

There.

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,458
[CHIHIRO thinking] The whole way
home... it was radio silence.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,166
Neither of us said a word.

17
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,125
I should've used that time
to get to know her better.

18
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,000
If I'd asked her about her
about her hopes and dreams...

19
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:22,916
maybe she would've opened up
about her problems at home.

20
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,708
Thinking back on it now.

21
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,625
I feel like I dropped the ball.

22
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,375
That walk home
was my last chance

23
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,166
to save her,
and I blew it.

24

How dare you!

26
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,083
How could you
betray me like this?

27
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,625
I don't know that
I'll ever trust you again.

28
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,958
From this day forward,

29
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,625
you are never to
leave the house!

30
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,166
Not even to go to school!

31
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,791
I don't want you
seeing anyone!

32
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,333
You have no need
for friends!

33
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,375
I can't take it anymore.

34
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
No one should
have to endure this.

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,375
Drinking the potion
is the only way

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,916
I can escape
this wretched life.

37

They will never care
for you as much as I do!

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,333
I am the only person you need...
do you understand?

39
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,583
Well... I'm still alive.

40
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,208
Guess I'll have
to face another day.

41
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,833
Good morning
Mother and Father.

42
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,125
It's a beautiful day.

43
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,583
Wouldn't you agree?

44
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,416
Well, you're certainly in
good spirits this morning.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,750
Can't imagine why.

46
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,500
I heard about the stunt
you pulled yesterday.

47
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,000
Sneaking out of the house
and coming back late at night.

48
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,916
What were you thinking?

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
I can tell you're
disappointed with me, Mother.

50
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,583
I know I shouldn't leave
the house unattended

52
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,250
but the moon was so pretty
I had to take a walk.

53
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,541
Cut the crap.

54
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,166
You're on thin ice,
young lady.

55
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm not going to have
my good reputation

sullied by your
promiscuous behavior.

Don't take that
tone with her, Aria.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,041
She's already apologized
for her indiscretion.

59
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,625
Whatever you say, dear.

About last night.

63
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,708
I apologize for
losing my temper.

64
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,000
It was inappropriate of me
to slap you that way.

65
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,583
No, that's not true.

66
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,500
I deserved it.

67
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,958
I know that sneaking out
of the house is dangerous,

68
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
but I did it anyway.

69

I'm lucky to have
made it home safely.

May I ask why you're
wearing your school uniform?

myself clear when I said

lay a hand on my daughter.

If that's true, you're not
setting a very good example

No, I completely agree.

115

I've always thought my brother's
morals were questionable

116
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,500
because of his bizarre love
of zombies but I never imagined

117
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,208
he'd go to such lengths
to interact with one.

my cat back, okay Mero?

I will admit that attempting
to resurrect the dead

121

the "freedom" of love?

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,250
Let go, Father!

323
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,833
Let's talk about this!

324
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,625
If you'll let me stay I promise
I'll never disobey you again!

325
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,041
I know better!

326
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,958
You just want to see
that Furuya boy!

327
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,791
Where in the hell did
that mangy cat come from?

328
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,375
Keep away from us
you putrid animal!

329
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,416
Is that really you, Babu?

330
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,875
I'm warning you!

331
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,416
Stay back!

332
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,541
I'm highly allergic!

333
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,708
Babu!

334
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,208
It is you!
I don't believe it!

335
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,166
He actually brought
you back to life.

336
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,250
Rea! Wait!

337
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,791
Whatever you do,
don't touch that mongrel!

338
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,333
He could contaminate you!

339
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,875
I guess this means
Chihiro perfected

340
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,791
the reanimation potion
last night after I left.

341
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,208
I wish I could've been there.

342
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,541
What if the mixture I drank
was the one that worked?

343
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,416
Stand back, Rea!

344
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,291
No! Don't hurt him, Father!

345
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,166
Please!

346
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,250
No!

347
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,000
Rea!

348
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:42,041
Chihiro.

349
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:52,041
Chihiro.

350
00:19:52,125 --> 00:20:02,041
Chihiro.

351
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:15,083
Chihiro.

352
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,291
Rea, no.

353
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,166
Rea! Answer me!

354
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,166
[CHIHIRO crying]

355
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,458
You weren't supposed
to actually die.

356
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,666
I thought you were
just joking around.

357
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,666
Were you serious?

358
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,750
I want you to bring me
back whenever I die.

359
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,166
I'm sorry but...

360
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,041
I just can't do it.

361
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,291
[REA] Chi...

362
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,250
Chi... hiro.

363
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,833
Chihiro.

364
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,333
Whoa.

365
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,916
No way.

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,625
I didn't even give
you the potion but you...

367
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,250
You're alive.

368
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:47,250
Dear God,
how could this happen?

369
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,125
Master Dan'ichiro, sir?

370
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,708
Chihiro please.

371
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,625
I've asked
you this once before,

372
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:08,291
but now that I'm a zombie
will you please take care of me?

373
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,791
Rea, I... Uh.

374
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:21,750
Okay.

375
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,250
Sorry I've been kinda moody
the last few previews

376
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,750
but that won't happen again.

377
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,583
I finally got to meet
with the writers

378
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,000
and I'm happy to say that
everything's been resolved.

379
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,916
I had a nice,
long talk with them.

380
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,375
Next time on Sankarea,

381
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,458
Episode 4
"A Normal... Girl."

382
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,625
Tune in to see Mero!

383
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,875
They said they're trying to
appeal to our male fan base.

384
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,458
Apparently, men are suckers
for cutesy crap.
