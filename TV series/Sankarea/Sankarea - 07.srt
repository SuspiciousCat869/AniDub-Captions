This, sucks.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,416
Damn it, Chihiro.

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,791
Why do you always have to
make things difficult for me?

4
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,708
Come on, you slow poke!

5
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,666
Slow down!

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,000
You're runnin' too fast!

7
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,333
Geez, I'm gonna
leave you behind!

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,416
No!

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,250
Wait up, you meanie!

[RANKO crying]

11
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,625
Here you go.

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,416
Oh wow! Looks tasty.

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,083
It's so pretty.

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,291
Yes, it is.
But not too pretty to eat.

15
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,625
My name's Ranko Saoji.

16
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,958
I'm a sophomore at the
prestigious Sanka Academy.

17
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,583
This is my family's restaurant,
the Saoji Kaiseki Kitchen.

18
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,583
My mom manages the place
and my dad is the head chef.

19
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,666
I guess you could say

20
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,500
the restaurant business
is in my blood.

21
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,916
I've been helping out
at the restaurant

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,625
since I was barely
old enough to walk,

23
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,166
so I'm a handy fill-in
on days like this

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,875
when the staff
is short-handed.

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,750
Thank you, come back soon!

26
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,875
Chop, chop!

27
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,708
We've got people out there
waiting for those, y'know.

28
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, shut up.

29
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,958
And don't startle me!

30
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,000
I could cut off a finger.

31
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,125
Just be thankful
I'm here, alright?

32
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,791
I don't need you
ridin' my ass all day.

33
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,083
This is not how I wanted
to spend my Sunday.

34
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Yeah right, you know you're
happy to spend it with me!

35
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,958
You've been a grouch
since we were kids.

36
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,541
Now get back to work!

37
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,958
You're the one
who interrupted me!

38
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,875
Only to tell you to
stop being so lazy!

39
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,791
Listen to you.

40
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,125
You kids sound like an old,
married couple when you argue.

41
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,833
Mom, gross!

42
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:51,583
Don't worry, Chihiro,
I don't expect you to take over

43
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,083
the family business
when you two get married.

44
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,541
But we'll make sure to leave it
to you in our will when we die

45
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,583
just in case you
change your mind.

46
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,125
Isn't that right, dear?

47
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,541
What is wrong with you?

48
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,416
Geez.

49
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,666
Hey!

50
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,083
Be careful, okay?

51
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,250
I will. Thank you.

52
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,333
Whoa! It's gettin' hot in here!

53
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,583
You don't have to
act like touching me

54
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,416
is the worst thing in the world.

55
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,708
Say what?

56
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,666
Nothing, forget it!

57
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,541
I've known Chihiro
since I was a kid.

58
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
I met him when
I was in kindergarten.

59
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,250
Y'know how it is in
romantic comedies?

60
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,916
The protagonists
are introduced

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,875
and they immediately
hate each other,

62
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,750
but then they
suddenly realize

63
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,208
that they've fallen
hopelessly in love?

64
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,708
Well, the first time
I met Chihiro,

65
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,916
It was nothing like that.

66
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,458
Aren't you afraid?

67
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,791
No, there's nothin'
to be scared of.

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,833
I thought I'd been
rescued by a genuine prince.

69
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,666
Imagine my
surprise the next day,

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,458
when my uncle Do'on
introduced him as my cousin.

71
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,250
Well, Ranko.

72
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,416
I'd like you to
meet my son, Chihiro.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
He's a year younger than you,

74
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,333
but I'm sure you two
will have a good time.

75
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,250
You wanna play?

76
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,125
It'll be fun!

77
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,166
I'd made up my mind.

78
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,583
And I was determined
to be friends with him.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,208
Alright!

80
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,416
We're watching a movie?

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,833
Yeah. It's a good one, too.

Is something
the matter, Adriana?

a bad dream, baby?

like to do for fun, Chihiro?

No, I mean other than that.

97
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,916
Read zombie movie magazines.

98
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
Do you only like zombies?

99
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,916
I like eating, too.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
That's silly, eating isn't
somethin' you do for fun.

I've got an idea!

104
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,666
Let's play house
and we can use these to--

What the heck are
you doing, Chihiro?

106
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,208
I read that sometimes they bury
dead bodies under cherry trees.

107
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,666
Huh?

108
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,375
Maybe we'll find
a zombie down here.

109
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,625
What?

110
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,083
But I don't wanna find one!

111
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm scared of zombies!

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,541
Hey.

113
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,083
Isn't that Chihiro
from the temple?

00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,541
Think so.

with that girl over there?

Ew, gross!

117

He knows there's no way
we'd play with him,

118
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,125
so he had to get
a girl to instead!

119
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,625
What a loser!

120
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,250
Quit messin' with him,
you bullies!

121

You're just jealous 'cause you
don't get to play house with me!

122

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,083
Where are you going?

There go the waterworks!

126
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,291
Is there anything
that doesn't make him cry?

127
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,875
Maybe he thinks
it's okay for boys to cry.

128
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,750
I'd convinced myself
he was a prince

129
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
when he was actually
just a zombie-loving weirdo.

130
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,708
He was awkward,
lazy, antisocial.

131
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,291
Not to mention a total crybaby!

132
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,750
He wasn't scared of graveyards

133
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,166
'cause he'd seen 'em
in his zombie movies.

134
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,041
Well, that, and there
were graves in his backyard.

135
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,583
In one afternoon.

136
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,166
Chihiro had gone from my prince

137
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,000
to a creep that I never
wanted to see again.

138
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,125
It's a shame you
can't stay longer.

139
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,166
Yeah, but it's for the best

140
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,291
because with
the way we let loose,

141
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,666
you probably need
a break, don't you?

142
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,541
Well, you'll have to
be sure to come visit us

143
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,416
when festival time
starts up again.

144
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,416
Thank you, we'll definitely try.

145
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,833
Hey, couldn't Izuna make it?

146
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,791
Unfortunately, Mero came down
with a fever late last night,

147
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,541
so she took her to the hospital.

148
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,125
Oh, that's terrible.

149
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,666
I wish we'd had the chance
to see her before we took off.

150
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,083
Don't worry about it.

151

Hey, Ranko.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,916
Don't you want to say goodbye
to your new buddy Chihiro?

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
No.

157
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,875
What the hell?

158
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,416
Your parents called me
in to help in the kitchen,

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,708
so how come I'm stuck out here
making deliveries with you?

160
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,875
Because you're not exactly

161
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,750
what I'd consider
helpful in the kitchen.

162
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,250
Well that's not my fault.

163
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,708
I've only held a kitchen knife
like two times in my life.

164
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,916
That explains it,
but it doesn't excuse it.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,833
So, what made you decide
to tag along with me?

166
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,291
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to greet

167
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,541
the restaurant's
customers on your own.

168
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,875
You're not exactly
the most articulate guy,

169
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,208
if you know what I mean.

170
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,833
Oh, c'mon,
I'm not a total idiot.

171
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,958
I think I can handle
a simple greeting.

172
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,458
Can it, Chihiro!

173
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,916
Quit your bellyaching
and just do your job, young man!

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,958
Thank you, Ranko.

175
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,416
I appreciate it.

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,166
Don't be silly,
you know I don't mind coming by.

177
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,541
Please don't hesitate
to work that lazy bum

178
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,625
I call a son as
hard as possible.

179
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,666
As much as you do for us,
it's only fair.

180
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,541
I'll whip him into shape,
no problem.

181
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,000
Uh, shouldn't I have some kind
of say in this hard-work issue?

182
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,625
Uh-uh.

183
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,125
No.

184
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,166
Silly me.

185
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,916
So, how many stops we have left?

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Two more.

187
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,291
Why?

188
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,625
Is helping me
really that terrible?

189
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,666
C'mon, you know
it's not like that.

190
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm just worried about Rea.

191
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,291
Oh yeah.

192
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,750
Your zombie girlfriend.

193
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,458
Wanko, I thought
I made it clear

194
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,000
there's nothin'
going on between us.

195
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,458
There are just all sorts

196
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,750
of uncertain
variables I'm worried about.

197
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,000
I dunno.

198
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,708
I guess things haven't
really stabilized yet.

199
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,208
I see what's going on.

200
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,083
You do?

201
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,666
It's obvious that you're worried

202
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,958
'cause you've totally
got the hots for her.

203
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,041
What the--?

204
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,291
You aren't even listening to me.

205
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,541
Are you?

206
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,625
This is so not fair, Furuya!

207
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,208
How come you get to go on
a date with a hot chick?

208
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,041
Huh?

209
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:29,916
What?

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,708
Are you two really on a date?

211
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,583
Of course not.

212
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,375
Don't be an idiot.

213
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,875
Geez, don't be rude!

214
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,791
How's he supposed to know
whether we're on a date or not?

215
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,666
Well, it's not and
that's all that matters.

216
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Really?

217
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
Is it that horrible for someone
to think you're on date with me?

218
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,125
What in the hell
is wrong with you today?

219
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,583
Stop right there!

220
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,541
Don't deny it, because
I know how to recognize

221
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,833
a lover's spat when I see one!

222
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,458
Well, you're wrong.

223
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,125
Damn you!

224
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,666
First Rea and now Ranko?

225
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,291
What could such epic hotties
possibly see in a dope like you?

226
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,375
And the ironic cruelty of
your sick zombie fixation

227
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,666
is too much for me to bear!

228
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,750
Is it your charm?

229
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,916
Or your fashion sense?

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,625
You're doing this
to mock me, aren't you?

231
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,625
Well you've succeeded!

232
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,833
Come on, Yasutaka, calm down!

233
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,250
How can I be calm
when he stole my dream?

234
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,666
You're officially delusional.

235
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,333
Ranko, would you
please explain to me

236
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,125
what the hell you
see in this guy.

237
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,958
He's a creepy nerd who's
obsessed with zombies,

238
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,375
isn't remotely handsome,

239
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,916
is a rude and lazy
slacker, and a coward.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,625
Yeah, that sounds like Chihiro.

241
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,958
Wow really?

242
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,208
Gee, thanks.

243
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,083
That's some harsh
judgment coming from a guy

244
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,791
who pervs out over
any pretty girl he sees.

245
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,208
Yeah, so what?

246
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,000
I take pride in my adoration
of beautiful women!

247
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,083
And it's killing me that every
single one of 'em is into you!

248
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,625
You're wrong, dude.

249
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,166
Where are you getting this crap?

250
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,666
You keep denying but I can
see it with my own eyes!

251
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,250
Would the two of
you please calm down?

252
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,958
Look at me,
I'm perfectly calm, Mogi.

253
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,666
After our first meeting,

254
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,833
I didn't see Chihiro
again for two years,

255
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,666
and we picked up
right where we left off.

256
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,416
Shortly after I turned six,

257
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,916
my dad made the decision
to move the family restaurant

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,833
from our previous home
in Chiba to here in Shiyo.

259
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,583
Just a stone's throw
from the Furuya family temple.

260
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,541
After we got settled in,

261
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,125
my mom invited Chihiro
to come play one afternoon.

262
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,875
Even though my crush on him
had gone up in smoke,

263
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,166
our parents were determined
for us to be friends,

264
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,833
so I gave it a shot.

265
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
Hey, Chihiro.

266
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,750
Wanna play?

267
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,666
I've got some games.

268
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,916
Nah.

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,125
Well then we can
go play outside.

270
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,416
Nah.

271
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,208
He hasn't changed at all.

272
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,250
Here, I brought some
snacks for you kiddos.

273
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,750
Now, Chihiro.

274
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,750
You're our neighborhood
welcoming committee.

275
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
So you've gotta play
nice with Ranko, 'kay?

276
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, just look how bashful he is.

277
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,625
You're so adorable!

278
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,333
I don't know why, but my mom
liked Chihiro from the get go.

279
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,583
So she was always
pushing us to get along

280
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,833
which made the situation
even more unbearable.

281
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,458
Hey, stop it.

282
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,125
C'mon.

283
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,416
Ew, ew, ew

284
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Oh, you don't
like that, Chihiro.

285
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,083
No, just look
at this pouty face.

286
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:02,625
Such a cute face, look at him.

287
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,750
Right, Ranko?

288
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,458
Why the long face, kiddo?

289
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,750
Where'd Chihiro go?

290
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,333
He's reading a
monster magazine.

291
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,541
Why dontcha go upstairs
and get him to play with you?

292
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,458
Because he says he doesn't
want to play with me.

293
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,583
He doesn't like games
and won't go outside.

294
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,708
Well, then why
don't you take him

295
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,416
to the video store and pick out
a movie for you to watch?

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,875
Yeah.

297
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,625
Didn't you say there
was some new anime

298
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,125
out that you've
been wanting to see?

299
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,125
The two of you can go rent
that and watch it together.

300
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,041
Okay?

301
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,791
Ranko, I know you're not the
kind of girl who's gonna leave

302
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,625
her little cousin all alone
when he comes over to visit you.

303
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,291
I'll give it a try.

304
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,208
It's down this way.

305
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, I know.

306
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,791
Hey, where did you go?

307
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,875
[RANKO screams]

308
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,291
Chihiro, you're in
the horror section!

309
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,458
So?

310
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,750
I wanna get an anime.

311
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,916
It's a good one.

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,958
I promise you'll like it.

313
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,208
There's no way
it can beat this!

314
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,083
[RANKO gasps]

315
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,458
[RANKO screams]

316
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,666
Look!

317
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,833
Zombie Academy,
School Festival of Horror.

318
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,000
Yep.

319
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,875
You sure know how
to pick 'em, Chihiro.

320
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,000
But I've got one
you haven't seen yet.

321
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,875
I brought it back from my trip
to America and it's pretty sick.

322
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,000
Wanna see it?

323
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,625
You know it!

324
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,625
I tell ya, that little
guy is an incredible kid.

325
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,083
Only five years old

326
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,375
and he's a downright
encyclopedia of horror movies.

327
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,541
There.

328
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,250
Uh, this one's pretty hardcore,

329
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,833
so try to keep it
from your parents, okay?

330
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,958
Right.

331
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:53,958
Hey.

332
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,500
What's hardcore mean?

333
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,958
It means it's good and
shows all the awesome stuff.

334
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,833
I guess I like awesome stuff.

335
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,416
Yeah, it's gonna be really cool.

336
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,125
Guts and brains.

337
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,833
We were supposed to go and
pick something out together.

338
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,416
Just trust me on this.

339
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,416
It's way better
than some silly anime.

340
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,666
This whole series
is top-notch horror.

341
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,416
Whatever, you know I don't
even like horror movies.

342
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,416
I bet this is gonna be
the one that changes your mind.

343
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
But it's in
a different language.

344
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,666
You don't have to understand
the words for it to be fun.

345
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,916
Maybe for you,
but it's not fun for me!

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,458
I wanna watch an anime
that I can understand!

347
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,875
I promise this is way
cooler than some anime!

348
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,125
How many times do I have to tell
you I don't like scary movies?

349
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,875
I'm taking this one back!

350
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,083
Huh?

351
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,875
Hey, wait up!

I'm proud of you.

00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,541
The way you saved me back
there was really brave.

368
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,000
Thinking back on it now...

369
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,500
That first time I met
him in the cemetery,

370
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,666
it was love at first sight.

371
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,458
[ACTRESS] You mean
you'll stay with me?

372
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
[ACTOR] Of course I will.

373
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,916
[RANKO] And by
the time I was ten,

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,625
there was no denying it.

375
00:17:55,708 --> 00:18:00,500
I had fallen flat on
my face in love with Chihiro.

376
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, can I ask you something?

377
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,166
What?

378
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,166
I'm just curious.

379
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,000
Have you thought
about your first kiss?

380
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,250
Like what you want
it to be like?

381
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,583
Depends what
you mean by 'be like'?

382
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,416
Well, y'know, there's all
sorts of different ways.

383
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Standing on a cliff
by the sea at sunset.

384
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,708
A passionate goodbye
at the train station.

385
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,333
Like that.

386
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,666
I dunno.

387
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,583
I guess I'd want my first kiss
to be with a hot zombie chick.

388
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,333
What?

389
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,500
Are you serious?

390
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,666
You don't actually believe

391
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,708
there's a zombie girl
out there, do you?

392
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,500
I dunno there might be.

393
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,750
Aw c'mon, would ya give
me a serious answer?

394
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,333
Your first kiss is a very
important thing, y'know!

395
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,666
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

396
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,375
Geez!

397
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,083
Furuya!

398
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,416
Mark my words, one day you're
gonna get what's comin' to ya!

399
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,375
Or you could just introduce me
to a girl, that's cool, too!

400
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,291
Man.

401
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,916
I've got some annoying friends.

402
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,333
Alright, let's take care
of these last two stops.

403
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,541
Chihiro.

404
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,958
Here take my hand.

405
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:16,958
What?

406
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,458
Why would I do that?

407
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,083
Because I told you to, okay?

408
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,166
Okay, okay, I'll do it!

409
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,000
Alright then, let's go.

410
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,416
What the hell is
goin' on with you?

411
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,208
Chihiro.

412
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,208
Yeah?

413
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,333
Knowing you, you probably don't,

414
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,083
but do you remember
the first time we held hands?

415
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,916
Actually, I do.

416
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,750
It was the first time
we met, right?

417
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,125
I found you crying
in the cemetery

418
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,541
and I had to take you by the
hand to lead you out of there.

419
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,833
Wait.

420
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,833
Is that what happened?

421
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,541
I don't know,
was that the first time?

422
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,083
Yeah, I can't really remember

423
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,791
that far back,
that's why I asked you.

424
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,583
Seriously what
is with you today?

425
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,250
Man, girls are weird.

426
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,833
Well, that's
the last one for the day.

427
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,958
You deliver to some
pretty swanky houses.

428
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,500
Right?

429
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,333
The old lady that lives here
had us cater a memorial service

430
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,208
for one of her relatives
a few years back

431
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,833
and now she's a loyal customer

432
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,208
who orders delivery
from us almost every day.

433
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,250
You've officially made it
through a whole day of work.

434
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,916
Guess you can go home now.

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,375
Really?

436
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,458
We're past our
peak hours for the day,

437
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,791
and there's really nothing else

438
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,333
for you to do back
at the restaurant.

439
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,166
You'd just be
standing around bored.

440
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,625
You mean I'm free?

441
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,750
It's about damn time!

442
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,625
See ya later!

443
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,750
What's up?

444
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,833
Are you okay, Wanko?

445
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,458
Why do you have
to look so disgusted

446
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,083
when I'm coming in for a kiss?

447
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,500
Did'ya think about
how that makes me feel?

448
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,458
You know how important
a kiss is to me!

449
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,791
I really...

450
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,791
I don't wanna lose...

451
00:21:54,875 --> 00:22:01,166
I'm not gonna let
her take him from me!

452
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,166
'Cause I belong with Chihiro!

453
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,166
And you're sure that it's
alright for me to do this?

454
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,166
You did get Mero's
explicit permission, right?

455
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,208
Well, as long as
she's okay with it.

456
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,041
Cool, here we go.

457
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,833
Next time on Sankarea,

458
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,916
Episode 7,
"Counterfeit... Freedom..."

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,083
What?

460
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,291
Mero?

461
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,750
What the hell is this?

462
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,583
I wanna speak to the producer!

463
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,666
I'm sorry!

464
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,958
They said you were cool with it!

465
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,625
You guys better
explain this to me

466
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,666
or it's going
to get ugly in here!
