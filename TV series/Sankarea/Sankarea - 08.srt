1
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,958
We thank you
for this meal.

2
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,250
[JOGORO] And now
we speak in unison.

3
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,625
Thank you for this meal.

4
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,500
[CHIHIRO] Ever since
Rea's resurrection,

5
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,833
I've been keeping a diligent
observational record of her.

6
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:55,625
And while it's an incredibly
important chronicle,

7
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,625
it's also a really sweet
gig for a high school boy.

8
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,958
C'mon.

9
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,541
Can't you at least take
a little break from filming

10
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,333
while we're
trying to eat dinner?

11
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,916
[CHIHIRO] It'd be a terrible
observational record

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,833
if I didn't detail
your eating habits, too.

13
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,166
True, but that doesn't
make it less irritating.

14
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,625
You mean thorough.

15
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,208
Now let me get a close
up of you chewing.

16
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,458
[DO'ON] Cut it
out, Chihiro.

17
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,375
Your sister didn't
labor over this meal

18
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,833
just for you to ignore it.

19
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,625
That's quite
enough with the camera.

20
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,958
Fine.

21
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,666
I take it that you're
a rather strict vegetarian, Rea?

22
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,750
Uh... you could say that.

23
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,916
[JOGORO yells]
No!

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,666
Whatever you do,
don't eat the miso soup

25
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,208
'cause it's been infested
by an army of mud snails!

26
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,583
Calm, down.

27
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,666
Those are shijimi clams.

28
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,375
[JOGORO gurgles]

29
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,166
I'll be damned.

30
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,541
Okay.

31
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,041
[REA giggles]

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,291
I've already made some
surprising discoveries

33
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,875
about Rea's condition.

34
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,416
First off, zombies don't need
any sleep to function normally.

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,541
I know it sounds great

36
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
to have that much
time on your hands,

37
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,916
but Rea says
it gets super boring

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,291
when the rest
of us are sleeping.

39
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,666
She showers out of habit,
but she no longer sweats.

40
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,666
And apparently...

41
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,291
...she doesn't even need
to use the bathroom anymore.

42
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,708
The effects of
the hydrangea leaves

43
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,458
seem to wear off
pretty quickly,

44
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,333
so she has to eat them
every few hours.

45
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,708
It was surreal
watching Babu spit out

46
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
an undigested wad
of hydrangea leaves

47
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,208
like he was coughing up
a normal, everyday hairball.

48
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,083
It made me wonder if Rea
was gonna do the same thing.

49
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,083
I decided it would be
best to have my camera

50
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,708
at the ready just in case.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,208
You'll let me know
if you're about

52
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,750
to cough up anything
weird, won'tcha?

53
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,625
Are you saying I should expect
to cough up something?

54
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,291
Look.

55
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,500
I've had enough of your
never-ending surveillance thing.

56
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,250
I feel like I should get
something in exchange, you know?

57
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,833
[CHIHIRO] Like...?

58
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,708
[REA] I'd like to do something
a normal girl would do.

59
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,833
[CHIHIRO] What'd
you have in mind?

60
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,375
[REA] Check it out, Chihiro!

61
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,666
Don't you love these ruffles?

62
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

63
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,875
Nothin' I love more than pink,
ruffly girl crap.

64
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,458
C'mon, Chihiro.

65
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,416
Can't you try
to take this seriously?

66
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,083
I don't get to pick out
new clothes that often.

67
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,500
I get this is
a big deal for you.

68
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,416
But you haven't been able to
decide on a single outfit yet.

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,166
Because I need your help!

70
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,041
You're the one who's paying
for this stuff after all.

71
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,625
I want to make sure I get
something that looks nice on me.

72
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,166
Yeah, yeah, I know,

73
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,166
but do you have any idea
how much longer that'll take?

74
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,125
Would you mind if
I got a hat, too?

75
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,916
Yeah, that's fine I guess,

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,666
just try not
to break the bank, okay?

77
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,541
Mmhmm!

78
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,541
Well, there goes
this month's allowance.

79
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
It's a good thing
it's overcast today.

80
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,416
We need to keep her out of
the sun as much as possible.

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,291
We shouldn't risk speeding up
her body's decomposition.

82
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,416
But that's how badly
she wants to be a normal girl.

83
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,958
There's really no point keeping
a record of her shopping spree.

84
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,333
S'not like I'm making this
video for the sake of memories.

85
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,333
Oh, totally,
that is such a cute dress

86
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,458
and the color will look
fabulous with your complexion.

87
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,875
Hey, no fair!

88
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,750
Give it back!

89
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,583
See?

90
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,541
It looks sick
with your skin tone.

91
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,291
Thanks.

92
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,500
She's so excited just shopping.

93
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,375
It's nothing to me,

94
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,208
but I guess Rea's
never had the freedom

95
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,958
to do the stuff that
normal girls do every day.

96
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,750
I do believe I deserve
a nice, long bath.

97
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,833
That's the stuff.

98
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,166
I didn't know it was so quiet

99
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,375
in here in the middle
of the day.

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,041
Maybe even a little too quiet.

101
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,458
Look, guys.

102
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,416
I made a promise to Rea
that I would take care of her!

103
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,166
"The water's fine"
what a load of BS.

104
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,875
I've never seen
Chihiro so serious.

105
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,458
It's kind of unsettling.

106
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,375
I know that Miss Sanka
is technically a zombie

107
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,250
and that's, well,
a pretty big deal to him.

108
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,125
But regardless,
she's living with him now

109
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,208
and he didn't even bother
to say anything to me about it.

110
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,958
And I've gained some weight.

111
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,875
Damn it!

112
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
What is with him?

113
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,250
All he thinks about anymore
is Rea this and Rea that!

114
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,958
Can't he at least
try to think about my--

115
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,708
What're you doing here, Ranko?

116
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,250
Oh crap, it's Mero.

117
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,125
[RANKO laughing]

118
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,208
What a coincidence!

119
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,458
How's it goin'?

120
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,958
Hello, Ms. Ranko.

121
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,583
[RANKO giggles]

122
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,416
Sorry to barge in on you.

123
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,375
You must also know that it's
less crowded this time of day.

124
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,875
Yeah.

125
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,250
Nice and quiet, and I'm in
serious need of some relaxation.

126
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,125
A busy morning
at the restaurant.

127
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,166
[RANKO laughs nervously]

128
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,750
Are you just
starting out the day

129
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,250
or are you headed
home after this?

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,375
I'd think you ladies would
be out shopping or something.

131
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,750
Not today.

132
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,250
We thought it'd be
nice to go to the bathhouse

133
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,166
instead of the mall for once.

134
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,083
I don't suppose
you have any idea

135
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,750
what Chihiro's up to today?

136
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,708
Well, I haven't seen him
since this morning

137
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,333
but he told me he
was gonna head into town

138
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,083
to go shopping
at that new mega mall.

139
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,208
I think he said he was gonna buy
some new clothes for Lady Rea.

140
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,958
Oh, that sounds lovely.

141
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:13,041
I'm glad the two of them
are having so much fun lately.

142
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,625
You know what?

143
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,708
You just convinced me that I'm
in need of another bath, Mero!

144
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,708
Let's drown our troubles!

145
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,583
All four of us!

146
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,458
You can keep me company
for the rest of the day!

147
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,125
Bombs away!
[bath water splashing]

148
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,000
I think the steam
is getting to you.

149
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,875
I finally found something!

150
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,750
Sorry it took so long.

151
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,083
You look really nice.

152
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,291
Huh?

153
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,791
I couldn't quite hear
what you just said.

154
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
Maybe that's because
I didn't say anything.

155
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,750
Did too.

156
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,166
I saw your mouth moving.

157
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,375
That doesn't
mean I said anything.

158
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,791
But you did.

159
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
C'mon, why don't
you want to repeat it?

160

00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,583
I'd rather not.

323
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,000
C'mon!

324
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,791
Let's grab that open bench
before someone steals it!

325
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,583
Look...

326
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,625
I would just...

327
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,166
I don't want to...

328
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm not a big fan
of the sunlight.

329
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,375
Okay?

330
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,416
What?

331
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,875
You must be joking.

332
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,000
How could anyone
possibly not love the sun?

333
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,083
I mean, look at how
gorgeous it is out here!

334
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,125
Look!

335
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,083
You have a lovely
fair complexion,

336
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,625
but you could use some
more color in your cheeks.

337
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,458
She's still got
that kid with her,

338
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,125
but this could
be our only chance.

339
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,375
She's by the exit and
there aren't many witnesses.

340
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
Come on!

341
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,000
It looks good to me.

342
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,541
What do you think,
should we go?

343
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,250
Let's make our move
while we can.

344
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,416
Execute!

345
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,416
I'll deal with
the obnoxious kid.

346
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,333
Make sure to keep
the timing tight.

347
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,458
Three.

348
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,458
Two.

349
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,375
One.

350
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,833
It's go time.

351
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,500
What the--

352
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,250
Where'd she go?

353
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,458
She is freakishly powerful!

354
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,291
Her old man wasn't kidding

355
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,708
when he said she'd
be hard to capture!

356
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,916
Get off of me!

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,791
Somebody help me!

358
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,416
I can't even get her to budge!

359
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,958
Dammit!

360
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,250
Where the hell is she?

361
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:37,458
Stop!

362
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,416
Help me!

363
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,916
That's her.

364
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,583
I'm coming!

365
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,208
Rea, are you okay?

366
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:47,916
Get away from me!

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,791
No!

368
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,125
Uh.

369
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:56,958
It's alright now, Rea.

370
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,208
Oh, I was so scared!

371
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,833
I just don't know
what I would've done

372
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,625
if you hadn't
come to save me!

373
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,833
Well uh.

374
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,500
Looks like you did
all the saving yourself.

375
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,291
Except for
the bench you killed.

376
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,916
Man, how did you not
dislocate your shoulders?

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,583
It's like you
got even stronger.

378
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,166
It was so scary, Chihiro.

379
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,708
Those creeps picked me up
and tried to kidnap me.

380
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,166
Are you still alive?

381
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,416
I don't know.

382
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,916
You have any idea who they are?

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,333
None at all.

384
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,375
Don't tell me
Yasutaka's in on it.

385
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
Guys, we don't have a choice.

386
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,291
We've gotta resort
to Plan B at this point.

387
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,208
Alright.

388
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,000
Why don't you tell me
who you guys are?

389
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,208
And why you
tried to kidnap Rea.

390
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,208
Talk or I call the cops.

391
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,666
Did you hear me?

392
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,333
Start talking!

393
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,583
You work for
her father, don't you?

394
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,291
No, look out!

395
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,291
Chihiro!

396
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,583
Rea.

397
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,291
Geez!

398
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,583
No!

399
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,166
Don't take him away from me!

400
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
You have my deepest apologies.

401
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,125
We waited until
your daughter was alone

402
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,958
and before we tried
to apprehend her it's just.

403
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,166
Lemme go!

404
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,083
Untie me you freakin' jerks!

405
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,375
Who are you people?

406
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,250
You're not gonna
get away with this!

407
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,625
To be perfectly frank, sir,

408
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,083
she easily overpowered
us and managed to get away.

409
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,500
We had no other choice but
to move forward with Plan B.

410
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:50,083
How would you like us
to proceed, Master Dan'ichiro?

411
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,708
Should we get rid of the boy
and pursue Rea again?

412
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,375
Actually I'd like you
to bring him to me.

413
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,500
As you wish, sir.

414
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:05,333
This works out perfectly.

415
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,208
There is much he
and I need to discuss.

416
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:14,250
Isn't that right, Furuya?

417
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,333
Mero?

418
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,083
Oh, Mero?

419
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,458
I think it's clear.

420
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,541
Here goes.

421
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,541
Next time--

422
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,541
Next time, on Sankarea,

423
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,750
Episode 9.
"A Mother's... Hand..."

424
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,875
Tune in to see Mero!

425
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,958
That's how it's done.

426
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,583
Well, it would've been better if
Ranko hadn't dropped her line,

427
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,500
and let's not overlook the fact
that this script is terrible.

428
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:23,250
Ugh, it's bad enough
having to read this crap once

429
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,458
and now we have
to do a second take?

430
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,708
Sorry, Mero.
