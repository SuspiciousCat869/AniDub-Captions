00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,958
[CHIHIRO]
Ever since that day,

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:31,041
I can't help but ask myself
if this is really for the best.

3
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,625
[DAN'ICHIRO]
I have decided

4
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,666
I shall leave
my daughter in your care.

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,875
[CHIHIRO] I'm happy that
Rea finally has her freedom,

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,458
but now that her creepy
dad's left her here with me.

7
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,875
I can feel the weight
of that responsibility

8
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,875
bearing down on me
like a ton of bricks.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,708
[JOGORO] No!

10
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,416
Mero, why is there slimy green
stuff floating in my miso soup?

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Calm down.

12
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,166
Those are just
green peppers, Grandpa.

13
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,208
Well, I'll be damned.

14
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,416
Mero?

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,916
Is something wrong, Father?

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,208
Rea's dinner looks interesting.

17
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,833
What is it?

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,458
Lady Rea has a taste for leafy
greens of the poisonous variety.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,333
She requested boiled
hydrangea leaves.

20
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,583
Stir-fried hydrangea leaves.

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,708
And hydrangea leaf
broth for dinner.

22
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,416
I've never had
them, are they good?

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,791
I wouldn't know, I simply
followed brother's directions.

24
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,500
Even though it hurt
my heart to do so.

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,625
Mero just doesn't like
cooking for a vegetarian.

26
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,291
Since when are hydrangea
leaves considered vegetables?

27
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,416
I can always just
go eat by myself

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
so my diet won't be a
distraction at the dinner table.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,958
Oh no, it's not a distraction,

30
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,875
I was just asking
out of curiosity.

31
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,166
Geez, would you
cut it out, Dad.

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,875
Why do you have to be so nosy?

33
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,416
I'm sorry, I've just never heard

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,541
of anyone eating
hydrangea leaves for dinner.

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,250
There's no need to apologize.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,666
I understa--

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,333
Kiyo?

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,250
Kiyo!

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,666
When Grandpa goes cuckoo,

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,416
just hold your arm out and
he'll clothesline himself.

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,750
Um, okay.

42
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,500
Our quirkiness isn't going
to scare you off, is it?

43
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,750
No, sir.

44
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,708
[CHIHIRO] What have
I gotten myself into?

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
This is brutal.

46
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,166
I can tell Dad and
Mero are freaked out

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,875
that Rea's been
left in my care,

48
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,250
but they're not gonna say

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,958
anything because
they're too nice.

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,083
I never realized it'd be so

51
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
difficult to care
for another person.

52
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,875
Especially a zombie.

53
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,916
Hey.

54
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,708
What's up?

55
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,125
I know it's not much,

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,083
but I'm afraid that this
is the best I can do

57
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,833
considering your
current "condition."

58
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,333
It's okay.

59
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,708
I just wish.

60
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,041
I could take you someplace
nicer than this, y'know?

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,458
No need to beat
yourself up about it.

62
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,416
I'm having a great time.

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,875
When I was living at home,

64
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,375
my father would never let
me do things like this.

65
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
Are you serious?

66
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,250
Oh, yeah!

67
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey Chihiro?

68
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,208
Check it out!

69
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,291
There's a fireworks
show tomorrow night.

70
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
Yeah, they do that every year.

71
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,791
I've never actually
seen it, though.

72
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,458
But it's so pretty!

73
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,666
I've only ever seen
it from my window

74
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,000
but I've always wanted
to see it up close.

75
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,500
I think it would be thrilling

76
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,541
to watch the fireworks
explode overhead.

77
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,500
Do you wanna go?

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,958
Yeah, I'd love to!

79
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,416
Well, it's not gonna
start until after dark,

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,625
so yeah, I guess it's okay.

81
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,166
Thanks, Chihiro!

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
I don't want to ruin
this opportunity

83
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,208
so I'll do everything
in my power

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,666
to keep my body from decaying
before tomorrow night!

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,458
Calm down, it's not gonna
happen that quickly!

86
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,083
I can't believe you're gettin'
all worked up over fireworks.

87
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,458
What are you, a child?

88
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,791
Yeah, we both are!

89
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,500
So don't act like
you're better than me!

90
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,958
Whoa, I never
said that, did I?

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
I've researched
different methods

92
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,875
of preserving dead bodies,

93
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,875
such as embalming or
evisceration,

94
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,666
but I haven't found anything
that'll work in this situation.

95
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,791
I shouldn't be surprised.

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,458
It's not like I'm gonna
find a hypotheses

97
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,166
on how to keep a zombie from
decaying at the local library.

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
Hey, are you coming
upstairs with me?

99
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,083
I'll be up in a bit.

100
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,208
The only person I can turn to
right now is Grandpa, but...

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
How'm I supposed
to preserve Rea's body

102
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,250
and make sure
she's enjoying herself?

103
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,333
Brother, why are
you up at this hour?

104
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,291
Just.

105
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,666
Checking on Grandpa.

106
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,166
I've been meaning to ask you.

107
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Do you know when Lady Rea
plans on returning to school?

108
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,083
Don't have a clue.

109
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,041
but I don't think she's
ready to go back just yet.

110
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,541
And may I ask why not?

111
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,958
Well, because she's got some
health complications, okay?

112
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,750
I didn't notice that there
was anything wrong with her.

113
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
It's not somethin' you'd notice,

114
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,041
but I'm tellin' ya,
on the inside, she's a big mess.

115
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:05,500
If that's true, why'd she stop
me on my way out this morning?

116
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,541
"Are you going to school?

117
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,125
I'm so jealous, Mero" she said.

118
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,625
Dunno.

119
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,833
If she's ill she could leave
early or go every other day.

120
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,416
There's no reason
to keep her from going.

121
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,458
You've got a point but
I don't think it's a good idea.

122
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,916
So you're going to force Lady
Rea to stay at home from now on.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,791
Is that it?

124
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,208
It's not fair for me to keep
her from going to school.

125
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,916
In fact, it makes me
no different

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,208
than the father she despises.

127
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,500
All she wants is to be
treated like a normal girl,

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,083
but that's a lot
easier said than done

129
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,833
when you're dealing
with a zombie.

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,416
As if mother nature
was trying to echo my mood,

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,000
the fireworks show
was called off, due to rain.

132
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,791
It was cancelled, huh?

133
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,666
I guess there's
nothing we can do about it.

134
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,208
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

135
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,291
It's not your fault so
why are you apologizing?

136
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,791
I just felt like it.

137
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,750
I don't get you sometimes.

138
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,916
Chihiro.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,458
I know this is farfetched but
if I'm still around next year,

140
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,083
I would love to see it with you.

141
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,583
We'll make it a date, okay?

142
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
You know, I still can't believe
they cancelled the fireworks.

143
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,416
I'm pissed that
I didn't get to hang out

144
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,458
with a bevy
of beauties in yukatas.

145
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,666
As far as I'm concerned,
that's a huge life experience

146
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,458
for a red-blooded high-schooler

147
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,833
to miss out on
'cause of a little rain.

148
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:38,916
What do you think Mogi?

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
I think this has
less to do with yukatas

150
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
and more with
you being a horn dog.

151
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
Oh, gimme a break,

152
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,250
you know you
were lookin' forward

153
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,583
to it too, ya little fink!

154
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,666
It would've been nice
to see 'em all dolled up.

155
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,166
You agree with me,
dontcha Furuya?

156
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,000
Uh.

157
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,166
What are you talkin' about?

158
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,666
There are Sanka girls
dressed in yukatas

159
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,833
dancing around in
your head right now, huh?

160
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,250
No, because I'm not a perv.

161
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
Hey, wait up!

162
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,166
Good mornin' Chihiro!

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,875
What do you want, Wanko?

164
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,583
What's got your panties
in a bunch?

165
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,166
I dunno. Your presence?

166
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,875
Please don't tell me
you and your lady friend

167
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
are on the rocks already?

168
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you really think
I would tell you if I was?

169
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,041
Aw, c'mon!

170
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,875
Why don'tcha
tell me all about it

171
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,791
and I'll try to ease
your pain, you poor boy!

172
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,458
Gotta admit, I'm jealous.

173
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,333
Wow, you really will
take it any way you can get it.

174
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,208
I suppose there's
no denying it, is there?

175
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,875
You were gonna go
watch the fireworks?

176
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,583
Yeah, Rea was really
looking forward to seeing it.

177
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,291
I was looking forward
to seeing it, too.

178
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,541
In fact... I was hoping
we could go together.

179
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,625
There's always next year.

180
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,000
Here's an idea.

181
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,041
Why don't we all put on
a fireworks show of our own?

182
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,416
Lady Rea.

183
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,125
I don't know if
this is a good idea.

184
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,375
Brother's gonna be upset

185
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,000
when he finds out
you've been helping me.

186
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,208
Don't worry.

187
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm sure that he won't mind.

188
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,833
He doesn't want
you exerting yourself.

189
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,333
How could a little
sweeping hurt?

190
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,666
Uh-oh.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,666
I don't know, by
breaking my broom maybe?

192
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,833
I guess I don't know
my own strength.

193
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,083
What're you two doing?

194
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,333
Hi Chihiro, how was your day?

195
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,083
Brother, you're
home awfully early.

196
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,833
Rea, why're you outside
cleaning in broad daylight?

197
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,583
And with a broken broom,
no less.

198
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,083
I was helping with the chores.

199
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,125
It shouldn't be a big deal
because it's cloudy out,

200
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
and besides,
you worry too much.

201
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh, really?

202
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,833
Yeah, really.

203
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,375
Fine, just be sure
to get some rest later.

204
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,791
Yes, sir!

205
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,041
Seriously, you need to
rest up 'cause you don't wanna

206
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,583
miss the big fireworks
show later tonight.

207
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,458
Wait, I thought it had
been cancelled.

208
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,791
Yeah.

209
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,458
But we're having our own.

210
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,791
I figured we could shoot off

211
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,291
some bottle rockets
or somethin'.

212
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,250
I prefer the dainty flame
of a sparkler but count me in.

213
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,583
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun!

214
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, I guess that settles it.

215
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,958
Wanko's gonna bring an extra
yukata over 'specially for you.

216
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,875
She said she'll
help you get ready.

217
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,666
I know it's not the real deal
but it'll still be fun.

218
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,666
Miss Wanko's coming?

219
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
You're right that'll be a blast.

220
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, they're her fireworks.

221
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,416
I'm gonna change.

222
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,666
When she gets here,

223
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,625
make sure she doesn't
come barging in on me.

224
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,583
Well, I should go inside
and start getting supper ready.

225
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,875
Oh, okay.

226
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,500
Do you want me to
clean this up for you?

227
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,250
Yes, but try not
to break anything else.

228
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,833
She's coming too?

229
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,583
Neat.

230
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,791
Is anybody home?

231
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,541
Hi Ranko, it's a pleasure
to see you as always.

232
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,375
Are you kids gonna
shoot fireworks?

233
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,666
Yes, sir!

234
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,166
We were all pretty bummed
they got cancelled.

235
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,208
So we decided we should take
matters into our own hands.

236
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,041
[CHIHIRO]
Perfect timing.

237
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,916
[RANKO] I thought you said
yukatas were tricky?

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,375
I can't figure 'em out
but Mero's a pro.

239
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,125
[MERO] True, but
it's taken years

240
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,750
of wearing them daily
to master the art.

241
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,083
So, uh, where's Rea?

242
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,541
She's upstairs.

243
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,666
Rea!

244
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,541
[REA gasps]

245
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,833
I'm not gonna hurt you
when I tie the obi, am I?

246
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,666
Oh.

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,125
No, I doubt I'll even feel it.

248
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,541
In fact, I'd actually prefer it

249
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,708
if you'd wrap me up
nice and tight.

250
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,250
You got it.

251
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,833
May I ask you something?

252
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,458
Have you and Chihiro
always been this close?

253
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,583
You betcha.

254
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,958
We've been friends
since we were kids.

255
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,250
It's funny, 'cause
when I first met him

256
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,750
he annoyed the crap outta me.

257
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,458
I'd never met an oddball
like him before.

258
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,458
But once I got to know him
I saw his good points.

259
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,708
He may be weird
but he's a sweetheart.

260
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,541
I think so, too.

261
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,208
He's not the type
who's into fireworks,

262
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,708
or any outdoor activity, really.

263
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
So I was surprised
when he was on board.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,416
And that's when I realized.

265
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,625
He's doing it because
he thinks it'll make you happy.

266
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,291
I know he can be kinda weird,

267
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
but when it comes down
to it, he's a good guy.

268
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,833
Once you get past
the freaky stuff.

269
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,416
Considering my situation,
that's pretty easy.

270
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,708
All done!

271
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,000
How's that feel?

272
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,250
Do you think it's tight enough?

273
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,208
Yeah.

274
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,916
Wow, it's still
so hard to believe.

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,750
What?

276
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,958
If I saw you on the street

277
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,500
I'd never think you
were a living dead girl.

278
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,625
Are you tryin' to pull
a fast one on me?

279

No, I'm most
definitely a zombie.

280
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,583
I don't have
a pulse or anything.

281
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,916
But, other than that,
you're just like a normal girl?

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,291
Yeah, I guess so,

283
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,541
but I don't know how longer
I'm going to look like this.

284
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm afraid
I'm running out of time.

started to decay.

they workin' out for ya?

Oh.

297
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,958
I'm not worried because
I don't intend to stay.

were gonna be living

still kinda up in the air.

At least for now, anyway.

The only reason he's
