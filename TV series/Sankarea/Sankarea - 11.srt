1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,541
Hey.

2
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,708
Where the hell're we goin'?

3
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,833
For all I know he's
about to boil me in oil,

4
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,958
or throw me off a cliff.

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,833
I've gotta find
a way outta here.

6
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,458
I hate to bother you,
maid lady,

7
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,291
but could I swing by
the bathroom really quickly?

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,083
Soon as I'm untied I'm gone.

9
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,875
I wish I could help you
but unfortunately the Master

10
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,000
has ordered me not to let you
out of my sight for any reason.

11
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,666
Feel free to let loose here
and I'll clean it up later.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,791
Don't worry.

13
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,708
You must think I've brought
you here to torture you,

14
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,541
but I assure you
that's not the case.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,333
So make yourself at ease.

16
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,375
What is this place?

17
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,375
The weapons are
arranged on the wall.

18
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,958
The weapons?

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,291
You may use
whichever you like best.

20
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,583
Unless you'd prefer
to fight barehanded.

21
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,875
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,750
You wanna duel?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,416
How else will we know who is
better qualified to protect Rea?

24
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,458
You and I have a score
to settle, Furuya.

25
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,375
Looks like she's got more
than enough money for cab fare.

26
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,333
Father!

27
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,708
Good afternoon, Mistress.
Welcome home.

28
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,791
Where is he?

29
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,458
I demand to speak to my father!

30
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,041
Sorry but I'm afraid
you can't do that.

31
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,083
Master Dan'ichiro
is busy at the moment

32
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,916
and has asked that
he not be disturbed.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,750
I couldn't care less
if he's busy!

34
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,208
I know he had Chihiro
kidnapped and brought here.

35
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,833
I don't know what
to tell you, Mistress.

36
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,208
I have an idea, why don't you
spend some quality time with us

37
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,208
while you're waiting
for the Master?

38
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,083
[REA yells]

[MAID knocking on door]

40
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,250
Excuse me.

41
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,000
Excuse me, Madam Aria?

42
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,875
Mistress Rea is in
our care once again.

43
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,708
Oh.

44
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,708
Would you like to go see her?

45
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,000
Why should I?

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,708
Give me one good reason I should
welcome that little bitch home.

47
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,916
What's going on?

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,041
I don't understand.

49
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,250
Why're you doing this?

50
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,166
I apologize for
being so rough with you.

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,583
We're simply
following the orders

52
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,125
given to us by the Master.

53
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,125
In that case, I'll give
you an order of my own.

54
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,083
Take these shackles off me now!

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,041
Silly girl, don't you know
the household staff only

56
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,291
takes orders from
the Sanka family heir?

57
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,583
It's hard to believe our
demure Mistress could turn into

58
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,708
such a pushy young lady
practically overnight!

59
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,291
[MAIDS laughing]

60
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,541
Yeah, I think I liked
her better the other way.

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,833
I don't see why we can't
knock some sense into her

62
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,750
as long as Master Dan'ichiro
never finds out about it.

63
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,875
You're right.

64
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,125
What he doesn't
know won't hurt him

65
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,041
and we may never
get the chance again.

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,541
Wait.

67
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,458
What're you going to do to me?

68
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,250
No!

69
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,000
That's the cutest thing ever!

70
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,083
Hey! I'm not some kind of doll

71
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,833
for you to play
dress up with, you know!

72
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,375
We've always wanted to see

73
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,250
what you'd look like in one
of our uniforms, Mistress Rea!

74
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,666
And you look just as cute
as we thought you would!

75
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,958
You cowards!

76
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,500
Why would you
pull a stunt like this

77
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,333
when I can't
even defend myself?

78
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,666
How could you be so cruel?

79
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,875
Aw, she looks even cuter
when she's angry, doesn't she?

80
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,750
What should we
dress her up as next?

81
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,000
A ninja?

82
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,708
A stuffed animal?

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,000
Geez.

84
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,541
I so don't have time
for this right now.

85
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,541
I've got a bad feeling.

86
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,708
I hope he's okay!

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,166
Chihiro!

88
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,250
Is something wrong?

89
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,625
I thought I made myself clear.

90
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,541
All you have to do
is strike me once,

91
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,125
and you will be
declared the victor.

92
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,000
It still doesn't seem fair.

93
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,833
I don't know the last thing
about fencing and you're a pro.

94
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,125
I never said you had to fence.

95
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,833
You may use
whatever fighting style

96
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,125
you feel most
comfortable with.

97
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,458
I'm not comfortable
with any of them.

98
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,958
I'm not a fighter!

99
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,666
What kind of a man goes through
life without ever learning

100
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,083
how to defend himself and
protect those he cares about?

101
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,916
Do you honestly believe
Rea would be foolish enough

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,750
to run off with
a coward like you

103
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,541
when she has a valiant
protector in me?

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,125
You mean you really don't
know how she feels about you?

105
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:04,291
I know somethin' you don't know,
and I'm not gonna tell you!

[CHIHIRO laughing]

107
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625
I don't know if I can
take much more of this!

108
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,916
Her hyper-cuteness
is killing me!

109
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,166
Okay, you've had your fun.

110
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,583
Now would you let me go?

111
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,708
As we told you before,
we're not allowed to take orders

112
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,625
from anyone
but the Sanka family heir.

113
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,458
I guess you're stuck here.

114
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,250
Can we put her in
the ninja outfit next?

115
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,666
Okay, as long as we can

116
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,958
do the stuffed animal
costume after that.

117
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,083
Maybe.

118
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,166
Let's wait and see what happens.

119
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,250
I thought we were
gonna take turns?

120
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,291
Let's just play it by ear.

121
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,208
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

122
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm not wearing either of them.

123
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,458
I'm sorry, but I don't
have the time for this!

124
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,458
This guy's painfully
out of touch, isn't he?

125
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,041
Excuse me?

126
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,541
Care to elaborate?

127
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,208
There's not much more
to say except.

128
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,875
You are a poophead.

129
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,291
"Poophead"?

130
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,291
I'm just callin' it
like I see it, pops.

131
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,125
Deciding Rea's
future with a duel

132
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,708
instead of taking her feelings

133
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,791
into account is
totally uncool in my book.

134
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,166
It takes a special kind
of self-righteous jerk

135
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,291
to kidnap a guy just
to get his point across.

136
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,333
You must be
pretty desperate, huh?

137
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,083
And don't even get me
started on the whole

138
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,083
taking nude pics of your
daughter on her birthday thing.

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,875
How in the hell do
you know about that?

140
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,833
I've heard of some
twisted things in my time,

141
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,708
but your obsession
with Rea takes the cake.

142
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,166
Can you really
blame her for wanting

143
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,583
to get as far away

144
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,166
from a creepy, old man
like you as she possibly can?

145
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,166
Chihiro!

146
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,916
In all seriousness,
this isn't our decision to make.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,875
We could duel until
we're blue in the face

148
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,333
and it wouldn't change anything.

149
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,583
In the end, all that
matters is what Rea wants.

150
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,708
She's almost an adult
so she doesn't need anyone,

151
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,000
especially not her
overprotective father,

152
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,958
making decisions for her.

153
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,500
It's her life
so let her live it.

154
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,291
You know, I think I've
finally got you figured out.

155
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,791
You say you
want to protect Rea

156
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,583
but what you really
want is to control her.

157
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,416
You know that's
not normal, right?

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,583
I gotta say, I was more
than a little creeped out

159
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,750
when Aria told me your obsession
with her seemed to stem

160
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,583
from the fact that you couldn't

161
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,333
let go of the love you
felt for her mother.

162
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,916
So why don't you--

163
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,541
Sorry to interrupt.

164
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,250
I simply couldn't take any
more of your incessant chatter.

165
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,916
How dare you accuse
me of indecency?

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
As the Sanka family heir,

167
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,833
I have the power to erase
your existence entirely.

168
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,458
Isn't that right. Rea?

169
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,125
What have you done?

170
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Whoa.

171
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,875
The Master ran him through!

172
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,333
Shh!

173
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm sorry it had
to come to this,

174
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,666
but that's what you get
for not taking me seriously.

175
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,708
Why, you!

176
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,083
In your face.

177
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,250
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

178
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,666
You thought I was
a goner, huh, pops?

179
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,083
Are you okay?

180
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,750
Rea! I'm sorry.

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,708
I didn't see you standing there.

182
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,791
Whoa!

183
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,666
What's with that getup?

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,750
Talk about a match
made in heaven! Or hell.

185
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,875
Who knew the zombie
bunny girl look

186
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,041
would be way hotter
than the zombie nurse?

187
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:50,083
Uh, the maids forced me
to wear different costumes.

188
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:56,125
Who cares about my dumb outfit,
aren't you in pain?

189
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,791
Furuya!

190
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,875
How are you standing
after I've impaled you?

191
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,625
Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,208
Pretty crazy, huh?

193
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,125
I wish I could tell ya
but I'm not sure myself.

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,500
I suppose it could be because

195
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,916
I'm worked up right now
and my adrenaline is racing.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,291
Or maybe...

197
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,083
That's it! Of course!

198
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:24,000
I must've been infected when
Rea licked my wound at the park.

199
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,416
It seems she
inadvertently infected me

200
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,291
with her poison while
disinfecting one of my wounds.

201
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,583
Oh no!

202
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,166
What did I do to him?

203
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,500
My heart is still
beating normally

204
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,166
so I obviously didn't
receive a lethal dosage.

205
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,625
Apparently, it was just
enough to anesthetize any pain.

206
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,291
And that can only
mean one thing.

207
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm now what you'd
call a "half-zombie."

208
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,708
What? A zombie?

209
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,875
Not you, too!

210
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,916
In that case...
I'll cut off your head!

211
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,333
Father, you've
done enough damage.

212
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,708
Now stop.

213
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,583
You've already dealt
the finishing blow

214
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,375
so there's no
need to continue.

215
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,833
You had an unfair
advantage against Chihiro.

216
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,583
If you want to keep fighting
you'll have to take me on.

217
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,916
I don't want to fight you, Rea.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,916
All I have ever wanted

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,750
is to save you from
your mysterious affliction.

220
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,708
I'm determined to find a cure

221
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,416
because I want you
to live a long and happy life.

222
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,625
Can't you see that I only
want what's best for you?

223
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,750
I've hired a team
of doctors in America

224
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:57,958
and I've made arrangements
for us to move there.

225
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,500
If we surround ourselves
with the greatest doctors

226
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,791
and researchers
from around the globe.

227
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,916
They may be able--

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,125
No, they will be able
to find a cure for your disease.

229
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,333
I have the money and power
to ensure that you survive.

230
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,083
A boy with limited resources
and a ninth grade education

231
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:19,875
could never do as
much to save you.

232
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,625
You're right, Father.

233
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:29,500
The thing is that I don't
really want to be cured.

234
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,083
What do you mean?

235
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,291
This isn't something
we can simply ignore.

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,875
This is life or death.

237
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,708
If finding a cure means
that I have to move far away.

238
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,541
I'll take my chances here.

239
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,166
And even if it's only
for a little while,

240
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,666
I'd like to stay
and spend whatever time

241
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,333
that I may still have
left with my best friend.

242
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,208
Rea.

243
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:59,208
I don't understand. Why?

244
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,000
You would give up

245
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,541
everything you have for
a fleeting taste of freedom?

246
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,416
But you're special.

247
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,958
You're a beloved member
of a dignified family.

248
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,333
Listening to you talk, it's like
you barely know her, Pops!

249
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,666
What'd you call me?

250
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,000
Rea couldn't care less

251
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,833
about being "special"
like the rest of you!

252
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,583
Can you think of
a single time in her life

253
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,750
where you let her
have what she wanted?

254
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,708
Or have you always denied her?

255
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,875
You won't believe
what I found, Father!

256
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,500
I was digging in the gardens
and I found a snail!

257
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,375
Look!

258
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,708
I want you to be
more careful, Rea.

259
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,083
A privileged girl like you

260
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,583
shouldn't play with
such filthy things.

261
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,250
Understand?

262
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,000
If it's okay.

263
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,166
I'd like to go shopping
with my friends.

264
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,875
Or you could stay
home and make a list

265
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,333
of what you want
and I'll buy it for you.

266
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,666
How's that sound?

267
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,333
It's hard to believe Rea's
already in high school.

268
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,458
We'll need to
keep an eye on her.

269
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,666
I don't want any lowlife
cads her age coming near her.

270
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
She's spoken for.

271
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,625
She will only be accepting one
set of genes in her lifetime.

272
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,416
What is with you?

273
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,750
Why can't you see?

274
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,916
All she's ever wanted
is to be a normal girl!

275
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,333
How could I be so blind?

276
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,833
It's because of
my controlling ways.

277
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,583
That's why you
died and left me.

278
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,125
I pushed you away from me.

279
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,375
It was my fault.

280
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,791
Now that's out of the way,

281
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,708
I will admit there's
one thing you said about me

282
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,125
that I completely agree with.

283
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,125
I realize I don't have the same
resources that you do,

284
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,541
and I'm well aware there're many
things I can't do on my own.

285
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,166
That's why,
when those things come up

286
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,583
I'd like us to be able
to work together from now on.

287
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:31,291
I don't wanna lose Rea because
we can't see eye to eye.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,041
Oh. Chihiro.

289
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,916
Tell me.

290
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,291
Are you positive that
you have no regrets, Rea?

291
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,500
Yes, sir.

292
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,375
Very well then, Furuya.

293
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:09,500
I have decided I shall leave
my daughter in your care.

294
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,750
Are you being serious?

295
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,375
Do you really mean that?

296
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,666
However, this is
a temporary agreement

297
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
only to be recognized
while I am overseas

298
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,958
searching for a cure
for Rea's affliction.

299
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,583
I am not ready to hand
her over to you forever.

300
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,708
That sounds fair to me, sir.

301
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,750
One more thing.

302
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,750
Just because
she's in your care

303
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:38,125
doesn't mean you have the right
to deprive her of her chastity.

304
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,333
Uh. I swear I'd never
do such a thing!

305
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,041
What did he say to you?

306
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,583
Oh, nothing.

307
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,916
Definitely not
what you're thinking.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't worry your pretty,
little head about it.

309
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,458
I was worried this
was gonna be the end.

310
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,500
Thank goodness
we worked it out.

311
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,875
Rea and I get to live
together a little longer.

312
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,583
Chihiro!

313
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,916
Are you alright?

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,166
Please! Answer me!

315
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,791
No!

316
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,083
Would you care
for a beverage, sir?

317
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,541
No, thank you.

318
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,166
I was so worried about you!

319
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

320
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,541
Sorry, that probably hurt, huh?

321
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,916
What the hell?

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,333
So much for never
feeling pain again.

323
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,500
Looks like the poison in
my system's been used up

324
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
and now I'm back
to normal again.

325
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,791
This totally blows!

326
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,375
Thankfully, Satsuki
and I were here

327
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,166
to stitch you up and nurse
you back to health.

328
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,708
You have miraculously
come back to life, hooray.

329
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,041
How can that be when
I was never even dead?

330
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,375
I can't tell you how
happy I am right now!

331
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,416
It's just you lost so
much blood that for a while

332
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,000
I was worried we were
going to lose you forever.

333
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,166
I hate to think I made you
worry about me like that.

334
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,875
Sorry, Rea.

335
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,583
It's no big deal.

336
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,250
So, what's with
the nurse costume?

337
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,041
Huh? Oh, this?

338
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,458
I wasn't going to wear it,

339
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,708
but the maids convinced me

340
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,000
because they thought
you might like it.

341
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,708
So be honest.

342
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,208
Does it look okay on me?

343
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:47,750
Heck yeah!

344
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,000
You bet it does!

345
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,833
I love zombie nurses.

346
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,750
Just when I thought he
couldn't get any creepier.

347
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,958
Chihiro!

348
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,083
No, wait, Wanko!

349
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,708
I was so worried
about you, dummy!

350
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,791
Mero called.

351
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,833
She said you'd been hurt,

352
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,458
so I rushed over
as fast as I could!

353
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,875
If you know I'm injured then why
did you jump right on top of me?

354
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,416
Oh, sorry about that.

355
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,708
Now quit givin' me a hard time

356
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,333
and tell me how
this happened to you.

357
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,833
Well, you see--

358
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,833
It was all my fault.

359
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,583
I mean, I'm not
the one who hurt him,

360
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,416
but he got into
a fight because of me.

361
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,333
May I ask why
you're dressed as a nurse?

362
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,458
Because Chihiro
loves zombie nurses.

363
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,750
You've got her wearing
skimpy costumes, you sicko?

364
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,625
I'll have you know
I had nothing to do with it!

365
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,000
But you think it's hot.

366
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,500
Well yeah, of course I do!

367
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,291
That was a dirty trick, Mero!

368
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,500
As much as I hate to admit it,

369
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,208
I'm afraid I'm
the one responsible

370
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,958
for getting Chihiro
into this situation.

371
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,000
That isn't true
and you know it!

372
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,458
What?

373
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,916
You're Rea, right?

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,500
Don'tcha think it's weird for
a zombie to live near a temple?

375
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,416
Uh... not really.

376
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,083
Hmm

377
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,166
I'm sorry but I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

378
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,666
I'm Ranko Saoji and I'm one year
ahead of you at Sanka Academy.

379
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,500
It's a pleasure to meet you.

380
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,083
I'm Chihiro's older sister
figure and fiancée.

381
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,666
And I'm human!

382
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,291
Are you surprised?

383
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,500
You know she's joking, right?

384
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,083
She's just trying to
get a rise outta you.

385
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,333
Why the hell would you even
say something like that

386
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,875
to her when you know it's a
bold-faced lie, Wanko?

387
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,125
A lie?

388
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,666
Well, that's news to me
'cause you promised

389
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,500
we'd get married back when
we were in grade school.

390
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,625
Chihiro!

391
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,000
Whaddya want now?

392
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,000
When we grow up will
you be my fiancé?

393
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't even know
what that means.

394
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
Just say you'll do it, dummy!

395
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,916
Yeah, alright, whatever you say.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,125
How'm I supposed
to remember

397
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,750
some stupid thing
I said as a kid?

398
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,333
I was just kidding!

399
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry if
I freaked you out, Rea.

400
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,458
I always get a kick

401
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,250
out of watching Chihiro
squirm under pressure.

402
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,541
It's pure comedy!

403
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,125
Hey!

404
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,125
What happened to all the tears
you were cryin' a minute ago?

405
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,750
As if I'd ever cry
over your lame ass.

406
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,083
You're such a liar!

407
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,750
Here's a newsflash for ya,
I was just acting, too!

408
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,333
You ain't winning any
awards for that performance.

409
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,666
Enough!

410
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,208
You'd better tell
me what went down,

411
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,083
or I'll have to noogie you!

412
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,041
I'm not sayin' a word 'til you
let me out of this headlock.

413
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,625
Yeah right,
in your dreams, buddy!

414
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,500
I can tell by
the look in her eyes.

415
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,916
This Ranko girl.

416
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,875
She's in love with him, too.

417
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,708
I knew Mero was frustrated,

418
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,250
but I can't believe
she actually quit.

419
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,041
I can't say I'm surprised.

420
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,541
She may be mature but
she's still a twelve year old.

421
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,750
You ready to do this?

422
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,666
Yeah!

423
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,041
Next time on Sankarea,

424
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,250
Episode 12,
"At That Moment... I..."

425
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,083
Tune in to see Mero!

426
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,125
You're back!

427
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,166
Oh, thank goodness!

428
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,916
I'm not running away anymore.
