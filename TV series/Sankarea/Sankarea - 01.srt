[MOGI] Well, recent

I went to visit a relative
in Tohoku last year

and as we were
sorting through stuff

to donate to a local museum,

111
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,875
I came across something amazing.

112
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,166
It wasn't really a book per se,
more like a collection of notes.

It was so beat up I couldn't
even tell when it was written.

The museum's curator told us
it wasn't worth anything,

115
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,208
but after skimming through it

116
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,666
I was sure they were notes
on the reanimation process.

I knew it was probably
a load of bull,

but I figured it couldn't
hurt to give it a try.

I chose an abandoned hotel
as my lab.

come looking for me here.

dopey schmucks.

I know they're superior
to us in every way

00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,458
but why do we have to take
different routes to school?

163
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Maybe cuz Sanka's on the
opposite side of the river?

The only reason I came to Shiyo

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
was I thought I'd meet a nice
young lady, or two, or three.

She's the daughter of the

What's up?

Is there a girl at your
school named Rea Sanka?

Well, yeah.

Why do you ask?

I couldn't tell ya.

227

I don't know know her but
she's the director's daughter

228
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,958
so she's kinda hard to miss.

you've got it easy

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,416
just because
you're wealthy.

319
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,625
I can only imagine what it's
like to have overbearing parents

320
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,708
constantly shoving rules and
etiquette down your throat.

321
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,083
If I had to deal
with that crap

322
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,000
I bet I'd be out there
screaming my head off with you.

323
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,333
So what brings you here?

324
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,500
Are you trying to escape
your troubles like I am?

325
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,875
Oh no, no,
no, no, no.

326
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,291
[REA] No way! You're bringing
him back from the dead?

327
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,500
That's amazing.

328
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,541
Are you sure it's
going to work?

329
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,375
It hasn't yet
but I'll keep trying.

330
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,541
I don't know what to expect,

331
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,375
but even if he comes
back as a zombie

332
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,583
it's better than not
having him around.

333
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,375
I guess so...

334
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,041
I don't think Babu's
gonna be too jazzed

335
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,666
about joining the
legion of the undead

336
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,375
but I'm hoping he won't
hold it against me.

337
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,875
I know it's selfish but...

338
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,000
I just want my little buddy
to be part of my life again.

339
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,666
It's a win-win situation.

340
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,000
I get Babu
back and he gets...

341
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,666
Now that I think about it,

342
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,083
maybe it'd be better for
both of us if I gave up.

343
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:23,958
No!

344
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,166
You can't give up
on Babu yet!

345
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,333
I'm sure he'd be
happy to see you!

346
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,500
Even if it meant he
had to become a zombie.

347
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,125
Well, that's one way
to convince me.

348
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,291
I just realized you never
told me your name.

349
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,375
Oh.
It's Chihiro.

350
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,416
I'm Rea.
Nice to meet you.

351
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,833
Don'tcha mean
"nice knowin' ya"?

352
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,708
I didn't think you'd
be sticking around.

353
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh... Actually, I was
wondering if it'd be okay

354
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,708
for me to come
back tomorrow.

355
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,708
Huh? You for real?

356
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,416
Why would a proper
lady like you

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
wanna help out a
nerdy guy like me?

358
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,583
I've always wanted a pet

359
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,416
but my father won't allow it
because he's a germaphobe.

360
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
If this works and we bring Babu
back to life,

361
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,333
it'll be the closest I've ever
been to having a furry friend.

362
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
Oh, I mean...

363
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,541
He's your cat but I hope
you'll let me play with him.

364
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,791
Well, maybe.

365
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
Earlier you said you
would do anything I want.

366
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,708
Remember?

367
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,333
Yeah... I remember.

368
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
You wanna play with Babu?

369
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,750
Then prove your loyalty,

370
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,500
by acting as the test
subject for the potion.

371
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,458
You... want me
to drink it?

372
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,958
That's right.
Didn't you say you wanted to die

373
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,416
and come back as someone else?

374
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,458
This is your chance
to become... a zombie.

375
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,833
Ha! I was only kidding!

376

[REA whimpers]

377

Man, I had no idea
you were so gullible!

378
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,791
You really shouldn't believe

379
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,166
everything you're
told, princess.

380
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,333
I'm telling you.

Guys can smell
naivety a mile away.

382

And I know plenty of dudes

who would love to take
advantage of you.

384

Well how would I know that?

385
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,458
I've never been on...

386
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,916
I, uh...

387
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,333
I've never been on a date with
a boy before.

388
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,625
Well, not yet.

389
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
But I don't need protecting!

390

Quit treating me like
I'm a little girl!

391
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,625
The princess of Sanka Academy's
never had a boyfriend?

392
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,875
I want to, but I can't.

393
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,083
It's my father.

What about me?

00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,333
Uh... well, have you ever
had a girlfriend before?

398
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,333
I haven't met
the right girl.

399
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,500
You don't have any
right to tease me

400
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,500
about never
having a boyfriend

401
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,916
when you've never
had a girlfriend!

402

I don't want one.

403
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,583
I have no interest in
dating regular girls.

Why's that?

I would totally have
a girlfriend right now

if I could
find a zombie girl.
