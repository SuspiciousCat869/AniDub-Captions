I don't know why
I'm attracted to zombies.

But I've always fantasized

about being with
a girl like you.

of the ingredients we used

Ingesting the plant's poison

keeping them coherent.

but eating hydrangea leaves

given my beloved Sada

00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,625
the reanimation potion
and brought her back to life.

134
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,500

it was you.

135

Wait, are you talking about Rea?

137
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,958
You must be confusing
her with someone.

138
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,666
I should warn you.

139

My reanimation potion
was never perfected.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,875
There are a few
things you can do

141
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,625
to slow down the decomposition

142
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,291
but they must
be done diligently.

143
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,083
Otherwise the resurrected
will deteriorate

144
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,833
until you're left
with nothing but a corpse.

145
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,750
Get this old man off of me!

146
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,791
Now why would I go
and do that, Otoki?

147
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,416
After all, you're my missus!

148
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,333
[RANKO] How many times do I have
to tell you I'm not Otoki?

149
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,041
Get your hand off me,
you creepy perv!

150
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,291
Three things will slow the
decomposition of the reanimated.

151
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,916
First, they need
moderate exercise daily;

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,583
second, they should
avoid warm and humid climates;

153
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,375
and third, they must
eat plenty of hydrangea

154
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,875
to replenish the poison.

155
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,500
Stop it.

156
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,041
You know, it would've been
helpful if you'd taken the time

157
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,791
to write that stuff
down in your notes.

158
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,291
Quit whinin', boy!

159
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,875
I don't see why I have to
share that information with you

160
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,916

did all the hard work!

to share your findings!

163
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,500
What are they talking about?

164
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,375
Dunno.

165
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,083
Correct me if I'm wrong,

166
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,125
but you're telling me that
all it takes is a steady flow

167
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,750
of hydrangea poison
to prevent decomposition?

168
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,208
Not at all.

169
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,666
As I mentioned before,

170
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,583
my reanimation potion
is far from perfect.

171
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,208
While the tips I gave you

172
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,791
will help slow down
the decomposition,

173
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,291
it's impossible to
stop it completely.

174
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:16,791
There is one other
thing you should know--

175
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,666
Oh wow.

176
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,833
On the first try.

177
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,416
Can you hear me?

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,666
Hey, Grandpa?

179
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,625
Just my luck.

180
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,291
Horse walks into a bar

181
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,166
and the bartender asks,
"Why the long face, buddy?"

182
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,416
It looks like the poor guy's
gone back into dotty mode again.

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
He was finally
starting to make sense, too.

184
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,500
Sorry, but he deserved it
for getting frisky with me.

185
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,958
C'mon Grandpa, let's get you
inside before you catch a cold.

186
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,166
If only I'd had a few
more minutes with him.

187
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh well, I should
just be thankful

188
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,208
for the information
I did get out of him.

189
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,416
Even if it's not much.

190
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,250
If I wanna figure out
a way to preserve Rea's body,

191
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,375
I'm gonna have
to do it on my own.

192
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,458
Who is that young lady?

193
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,333
Is she a friend
of yours, Chihiro?

194
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,500
Uh, yeah!

195
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,791
But she's a girl friend.

196
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,750
I mean, she's not my girlfriend.

197
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,333
All I'm saying is
we're not, you know, intimate.

198
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,166
She's having a hard
time at home right now.

199
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,666
Which brings me to a question
I've been meaning to ask you

200
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,208
but I'm kinda nervous
about how you're gonna respond.

201
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,333
Those must be members
of Chihiro's family.

202
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,958
This is terrible!

203
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,000
Now they know about me
and it's my own fault.

204
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,416
What am I gonna do?

205
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,666
I doubt they'll let me
stay here after today.

206
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,541
Well, I'm waiting.

207
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,416
So let's hear it.

208
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,708
I wanted to know.

209
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,250
If you'd mind...

210
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,708
If Rea...

211
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,416
Would you mind if I invited Rea
to move in with us for a while?

212
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,375
[REA gasps]

[RANKO gasps]

214
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:59,791
Would you mind if I invited Rea
to move in with us for a while?

215
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,541
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,375
It's a lot to ask, and I can't
really go into detail right now,

217
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,791
but she doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

218
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,416
I've gotta help her, Dad.

219
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,833
Because I told her
I would take care of her

220
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,208
and I'm not the kind of guy
who can break a promise.

221
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,833
So would it be okay with you?

222
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,833
Well... let me think.

223
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,416
So you promised her, huh?

224
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,708
She must be a special girl.

225
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,208
This is the first time
I've seen you enthusiastic

226
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,583
about something
other than zombies.

227
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,291
Uh yeah.

228
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,958
If he knew the truth
he'd be so mad at me.

229
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
I don't know why
your friend ran away

230
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,208
but she came to
the right place,

231
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,666
because Shiryoji Temple

232
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,125
was originally intended
to be a safe haven.

233
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,041
She's welcome here.

234
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,166
Wait... You mean
she can move in?

235
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,291
Sure.

236
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,625
I can't think of
any reason for her not to.

237
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,625
[CHIHIRO laughing]

238
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,750
That's awesome!

239
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,750
I promise you
won't regret it, dad!

240
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,166
Hey Rea, you wanna come
up here and meet everybody?

241
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,208
My dad said it was cool
for you to move-in with us

242
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,416
so you don't have
to hide from my family anymore!

243
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,375
When you made
your plea on her behalf,

244
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,958
you failed to mention you've
been secretly cohabitating.

245
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,375
Uh...

246
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,375
We shared a room, but I wouldn't
call it cohabitating.

247
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,375
Really?

248
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
What would you call it?

249
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,541
It's not like we slept in
the same bed or anything.

250
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,125
If you say so.

251
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,416
That girl again.

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,750
She is beautiful, isn't she?

253
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,958
What's wrong with you?

254
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,833
How could you not
hook up with her?

255
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,083
Crap, I gotta go!

256
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,083
I'm supposed to be helping my
Mom out at the restaurant today.

257
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,750
She's gonna be so pissed

258
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
when she sees what
happened to my apron.

259
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,625
I have a feeling I'm gonna
get quite the tongue-lashing.

260
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,041
I hope you don't mind
if I borrow a shirt.

261
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,625
See ya!

262
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,791
Oh, and please give my
regards to Miss Sanka!

263
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,208
Now that Rea's
officially living with us,

264
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,541
I figured it'd be a good
time to start keeping a diary.

265
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,666
Unlike Grandpa,
I see the importance

266
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,916
of writing down
my daily observations.

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,250
We'll spend each day together

268
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,333
and I'll document every
single thing that happens.

269
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,916
My hope is that if I keep a log

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,583
of how the decomposition
process is affecting her,

271
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,583
it might help me figure out
how to preserve her body.

272
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,375
It's hard to fight
its effects when--

273
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,416
Uh... Chihiro?

274
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,916
Yeah?

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,916
Sure you don't
want to sleep in here?

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,958
I feel absolutely
horrible kicking you

277
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,583
out of your bedroom
two nights in a row.

278
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,333
Nah, I'm good out here.

279
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,958
I'm not gettin' too much sleep.

280
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,791
but it's cool 'cause now I can
empathize with the walking dead.

281
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,541
Uh... I'm worried.

282
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,958
About what?

283
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,541
Sleep deprivation can affect

284
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,416
not only cognitive function
but the brain itself.

285
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,333
Keep talking about brains
and I'll be too scared to sleep.

286
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,791
Oh, sorry.

287
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,208
Well, we could share your room.

288
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,750
The bed's big enough to sleep
both of us comfortably.

289
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,916
Huh?

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,375
Sorry, that's too risky.

291
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,083
I'm not sure I could control
myself if we shared a bed.

292
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,708
'Specially after
that kiss today.

293
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,125
What kiss are you talking about?

294
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,458
Apparently, Rea doesn't
remember anything that happened

295
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,666
while she was in
her zombified trance.

296
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,833
If we kissed why don't
I have any memory of it?

297
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
Look, I must've
been imagining things

298
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,458
so just forget
I ever mentioned it, okay?

299
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,541
I can't believe
you used my moment of weakness

300
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,500
as an opportunity
to take advantage of me!

301
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,083
I would never!

302
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,875
If anyone "took advantage"
it was you--

303
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,833
That was smooth.

304
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,291
You can't say something
like that and then try

305
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,875
to drop the conversation
without filling me in!

306
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,208
Please tell me!

307
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,000
I knew I should
never've opened my big mouth!

308
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,458
It's really not that big a deal.

309
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,125
I doubt you'd feel that way
if you were in my shoes.

310
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,583
Ow!

311
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,666
You don't have to be so rough!

312
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,416
She doesn't know
how strong she is.

313
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,041
The mental limiters
that suppressed her

314
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,166
strength must've
completely shut down.

315
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,583
If we had kissed, you wouldn't
lie about it, would you?

316
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
No, never!

317
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,708
My brother's becoming a man.

318
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,458
Took him long enough.

319
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,291
I've decided to keep
a video diary as well,

320
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,333
in order to document any and
all changes to Rea's condition.

321
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,291
No change to her thighs or feet.

322
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,750
[BABU meows]

323
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,166
No change to her upper arms,
or the nape of her neck.

324
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,541
Would you mind telling me why

325
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,000
you're following me around
with that video camera?

326
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,458
[CHIHIRO] I'm filming you.

327
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,958
I wanna document your condition.

328
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,041
No way!

329
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,083
You're filming me?

330
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,458
But you know how
painfully shy I am!

331
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,166
[CHIHIRO] Don't be embarrassed.

332
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,583
It's for your own good.

333
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,875
From now on, I'm gonna
videotape every nook and cranny

334
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,375
on your entire body
for my daily records.

335
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,166
C'mon, flash me that
pretty smile of yours!

336
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,041
You know you wanna!

337
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,833
Sometimes we have
to make sacrifices

338
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,000
in the name of science.

339
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,708
[JOGORO yells]

340
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,041
What are these
chunks of green pepper

341
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,583
doin' in my miso soup, Mero?

342
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,875
Calm down.

343
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
It's eggplant, Grandpa.

344
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,500
Well, I'll be damned.

345
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,333
Where's Rea?

346
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,583
Isn't she going to join us?

347
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:37,208
No she's terribly shy and
would rather eat by herself.

348
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,000
I made extra food
because I thought

349
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,583
she was going to be here.

350
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,250
[CHIHIRO] Sorry, but don't worry
about it in the future, okay?

351
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,791
She told me she
doesn't want to have

352
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,375
an impact on
the family budget.

353
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,833
I wouldn't have let her move-in

354
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,333
if I thought we couldn't
afford to feed her.

355
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,958
Please let her know
I don't mind doing the shopping

356
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,833
and cooking for the house

357
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,000
because I enjoy taking
care of those around me.

358
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,250
Yeah.

359
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,125
Sure, I'll let her know.

360
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,750
And here I thought
it'd be smooth

361
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,875
sailing once she moved-in.

362
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,000
They'll get suspicious if she
never joins them for a meal.

363
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,250
I suppose she could always
just go through the motions.

364
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,958
Here ya go.

365
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,583
I brought over a couple of
things I thought she might need.

366
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,416
You mean like
underwear and stuff?

367
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,791
I'm not letting
anybody borrow my underwear.

368
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,458
I can pick some up
for her tomorrow.

369
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,250
Later.

370
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,583
Hey, Wanko?

371
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,833
Rea and I aren't
a couple or anything.

372
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,833
Honestly.

373
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,958
Why are you offering me excuses?

374
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,916
Look, I'm telling you,
it's not an excuse!

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,250
Whatever you say. Ciao!

376
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,833
Hold on a second!

377
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,500
Don't yell at me!

378
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,791
Thanks for bringing this.

379
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
While I appreciate
her generosity,

380
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,083
I guess Rea doesn't really
need a change of clothes.

381
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,458
Now that she's a zombie,
she has no metabolism.

382
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,708
Then again, she's still a girl,

383
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm sure she'd like
to wear something

384
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,666
other than one of my shirts.

385
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,125
I can't help but
feel kinda sad for them.

386
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,416
They used to be so full of life.

387
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,166
But now, they're
completely devoid of it.

388
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,000
They're no longer a part
of the world of the living.

389
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,000
What's up, Chihiro?

390
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,083
Nothing.

391
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,791
Can I come in?

392
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,375
Got a change of clothes for you.

393
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,625
Oh, thanks!

394
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,958
I appreciate it!

395
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,041
And in a way, I'm the one
who did this to them.

396
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,375
Hey, Rea?

397
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,791
This is all I have to do?

398
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,166
Just walk normally?

399
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,500
[CHIHIRO] Pretty easy, huh?

400
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,250
According to Grandpa, all
you need is moderate exercise

401
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,875
so there's no reason
to overdo it.

402
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:54,125
If the people around us knew the
truth, it'd be mass hysteria.

403
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,500
But I suppose we look just like

404
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,708
any other couple out
for the evening.

405
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,833
They'd never
suspect she's a zombie.

406
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,791
As much as I'd like to think
I could recognize one,

407
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,416
I'd probably be fooled, too.

408
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,291
If I've learned
anything from this experience,

409
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,750
it's that there isn't much
difference between them and us.

410
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:18,208
Time passes the same for both
the living and the undead.

411
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,958
[REA] You know
what's weird?

412
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,000
[CHIHIRO] What's that?

413
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,166
I hope this
doesn't gross you out,

414
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,625
but I don't have to use
the restroom anymore.

415
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,166
Oh. Really?

416
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,125
And I never get
sleepy, either.

417
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,458
Yeah.

418
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,958
I kinda figured as much.

419
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,583
I'm really dead.

420
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,500
I guess it's finally
starting to sink in, you know?

421
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,958
It's funny.

422
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,416
You'd think I'd be depressed
but I'm actually quite happy.

423
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,625
I don't know what
happens to us when we die.

424
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,250
If we turn into ghosts or
whether there's an afterlife.

425
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,333
Honestly, I don't
think I'd want anything

426
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,125
to do with either
of those things.

427
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,541
I feel like they'd
make me unhappy

428
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,083
because I'd miss out on this.

429
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,916
What could be better
than taking a walk

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,500
and chatting with a friend?

431
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,916
I'm starting to think I'm cut
out for this zombie stuff.

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,458
I hope you know
how grateful I am.

433
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:20,000
If I hadn't run into you
I would've lived my whole life

434
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,750
without ever knowing
what it means to be free.

435
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,833
It's all thanks to you, Chihiro.

436
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,041
[CHIHIRO thinking]
Thanks to me

437
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,375
you're a rapidly
decomposing walking corpse.

438
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,791
It's only a matter of time 'til
you're back where you started.

439
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,041
I'll be here for you.

440
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,541
I promise.

441
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,333
I gave you my word
that I'd take care of you

442
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,750
and that's exactly
what I intend to do.

443
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,083
I know.

444
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,541
I only ask that you
treat my delicate body

445
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,666
with the utmost care.

446
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,583
You promise?

447
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,833
Geez, Rea!

448
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,875
Why'd you have to say it
all flirty like that?

449
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,916
Did I?

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,125
I didn't realize it
came out that way.

451
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,458
Yeah right,
you knew what you were doing!

452
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,875
C'mon, let's head home.

453
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,125
Yes, sir!

454
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,541
There's gotta be another
way for us to slow down

455
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,083
the decomposition of Rea's body.

456
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,000
At least long enough
for her to experience

457
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,791
the things she's missed out on.

458
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,791
Hydrangea leaves help
but what's gonna happen

459
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,166
when they
go out of season?

460
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,458
I'm determined
to keep her around

461
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,333
as long as I possibly can.

462
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,208
It's just a question
of how long that'll be.

463
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,625
Watch out!

464
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
That was a close one.

465
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,166
I'm so glad
I got to you in time!

466
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,041
Oh, Chihiro!

467
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,333
You've been injured.

468
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,625
What have I done?

469
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,958
I'm so sorry.

470
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,666
Just a little banged up.

471
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm guessing those
strength inhibitors

472
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,916
aren't coming
back anytime soon.

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,708
Okay.

474
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,583
Are you sure?

475
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,291
Oh, no!

476
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Hey, what're you doing?

477
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,416
That's nasty!

478
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,541
Cut it out, Rea!

479
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
Don't be a baby.

480
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,083
I'm just disinfecting it.

481
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,458
[MERO] You want me
to pick up the pace?

482
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,041
You got it.

483
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,041
My timing was off last time we
recorded one of these bad boys

484
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,250
but I'm gonna
get this in one take.

485
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,583
Watch and learn, gentlemen.

486
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,666
Next time on Sankarea,

487
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,625
Episode 7,
"Childhood... Friends..."

488
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,166
Can you guess which famous
Italian zombie film director

489
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,250
is the inspiration behind
my brother Chihiro's name?

490
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,583
The answer is Lucio Fulci!

491
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,083
Tune in to see Mero!

492
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,333
That was too fast?

493
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,041
Oh... What should I say?

494
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,291
Uh... Bye?
