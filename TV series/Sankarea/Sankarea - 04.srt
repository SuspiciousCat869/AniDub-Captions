he went straight
for the bathroom

99
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,458
it's a beneficial form
of mental gymnastics

100
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
and therefore require
that it be done every day.

[BABU meowing]

165
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,041
Is it just me or does
it sound like he might

166
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,166
be suffering from
a case of the sniffles?

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,833
No, I named him Babu
because of that weird meow.

168
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,166
When I first took him in
I was worried he might be sick

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,750
but the vet assured me
he was perfectly healthy.

170
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
That's just the way he meows.

171
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,541
Aw, the poor little guy.

172
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,333
I can't believe I was so worried

173
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,875
and he was probably
chillin' in a tree all day.

Huh?

178

Are you telling me you
understand what my cat's saying?

179
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,833
Well, not word-for-word,
but I get the general idea.

180
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,708
Right, Babu?

181

[CHIHIRO thinking] Apparently,
zombies have the ability

182
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,750
to communicate
regardless of their species.

183
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,375
I find it interesting
that their transformation

184
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,958
hasn't seemed to affect
their personalities at all.

185

Is something on your mind?

Well, yeah,

I don't understand how
you can be so lighthearted

about becoming a zombie.

196

I mean, doesn't
it make you anxious?

197

Of course.

when you say I'm going
to "take care" of you,

what do you mean by that?

What exactly do
you want me to do?

I hadn't thought about that.

I'd like for us to
go shopping together.

206

Maybe take a trip to the museum?

207

Huh?

I'm forgetting something.

Oh yeah, I want to go
to the amusement park!

And the summertime
festivals, too!

Rea that matters in my book.

did you ask me about her?

care less about

on between you two.

They're the only
females who do it for me.

Wow, it just hit me.

310
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,625
Now that Rea's a zombie,
she's basically my dream girl.

311
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,541
And she's sitting in my bedroom
right now waiting for me.

out your fantasies.

00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,208
Don't be silly,
I'm not smiling.

316
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,583
What's taking so long?

317
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,000
It's getting pretty late.

318
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,500
I wonder how
Chihiro knows that girl.

319
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,000
She was wearing
a Sanka Academy uniform.

320
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,458
I know he said he didn't
have a girlfriend but...

321
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,291
C'mon, it's not
like finding your porn stash

322
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,000
is gonna scar me for life.

323
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
It's so quiet.

324
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
Guess I can leave
his room if nobody's home.

325
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,083
I should've asked
Chihiro if it's okay

326
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,708
for zombies to take a shower.

327
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,625
But what could it hurt?

328
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,916
I don't know why, but this
feels different than it used to.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,541
Oh, I know.

330
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,958
It's because I can't feel

331
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,250
the temperature of
the water anymore.

332
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,250
Ah.

333
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,125
Still nice though.

334
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,958
I didn't know they
built bathrooms this small.

335
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,375
but I think it's kinda cute.

336
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,250
Well, this thingy's
weird looking.

337
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,791
I wonder what you use it for.

338
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,916
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it.

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,500
I think maybe you use it
like this to do exercises with.

340
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,166
Where did he come from?

341
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,750
I thought nobody was home!

342
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,958
My dear Sada!

343
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:12,791
Is it really you?

344
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, how I've missed you!

345
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,208
I never imagined
you'd come back

346
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,708
from the dead and return to me!

347
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,583
I'm not Sada!

348
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,458
Let go!

349
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,583
I know it was my fault,

350
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,958
but I hope you can
learn to forgive me!

351
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,541
You've got the wrong person,
now please let go of me!

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,458
Is anybody home?

353
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,916
Sada!

354
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,958
What has gotten
into you, Grandpa?

355
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,958
My precious Sada
came back to life!

356
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,416
It seems our bond
of love is so strong

357
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,958
that not even death
could keep her away from me!

358
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,541
If that was true
you'd be in big trouble.

359
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,708
Grandma wouldn't
like hearing you

360
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,166
call her Sada when
her name was Kiyo.

361
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,625
I dunno.

362
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,125
Name doesn't ring a bell.

363
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,166
Hang on...

364
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,666
what was I doing just now?

365
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
Oh, for Pete's sake.

366
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,166
Thank goodness I got
away from him when I did.

367
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,333
If I were home, I'd be sitting
at the dinner table with Father.

368
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,958
But I'm in someone else's home.

369
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,291
Not only that,
I'm sitting in a boy's bedroom

370
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,833
in nothing but a towel.

371
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,583
It's hard to believe how much
has happened in just one day.

372
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
I'll admit, it's a little scary.

373
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,166
I couldn't be happier
because I'm free.

374
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:41,166
But most of all, I don't have
to suffer my father's abuse.

375
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,041
Ever again.

376
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,333
That took a lot longer
than I expected.

377
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,583
I don't think I've ever met

378
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,916
anyone with as much
energy as Yasutaka.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,458
If only I could
convince him to use it

380
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,208
for something productive
instead of always pestering me.

381
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,708
Welcome home, Brother.

382
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,625
For dinner, we'll be
having a delicious stew

383
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,083
made from the innards
of various animals.

384
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,666
I'm gonna have to pass.

385
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,541
I don't have
much of an appetite.

386
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
I'm surprised
Mero hasn't found her yet.

387
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,875
I'm back.

388
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,250
Hey.

389
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,583
Chihiro, you're back.

390
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,041
Do you wanna explain why you're
wearing nothing but a towel?

391
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,708
I'm sorry, it's because I took
a shower while nobody was home.

392
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,750
Yeah, I figured.

393
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,708
You're still soaking wet.

394
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,166
You're gonna catch a cold.

395
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Nah.

396
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,375
You don't have
to worry about me.

397
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,500
After all, zombies don't
catch colds the way people do.

398
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,916
I guess you're right.

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
Wait a second, it just hit me!

400
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,250
The conversation
we're having right now.

401
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,000
It's the same kind
of loveable banter

402
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,208
I've always fantasized about
having with a zombie girl!

403
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,458
So how are you keeping up, Rea?

404
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,291
Your stomach's not bothering
you or anything, is it?

405
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,083
I don't feel any pain.

406
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,625
Bud I guess that's only
normal for a zombie, huh?

407
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,666
I can't take it!

408
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,458
This is too much!

409
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
Is there
something wrong, Chihiro?

410
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,041
Nothing at all!

411
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,500
Just trying to keep
myself in check now

412
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
that all of my wildest
dreams are coming true.

413
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,791
It'd be easier for me
if you'd put some clothes on.

414
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
Yeah.

415
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,000
I'd love to, but...

416
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
I'm afraid I'm not
really able to do much

417
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,125
of anything,
other than lay here.

418
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,666
I don't know what's wrong.

419
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,000
All of a sudden by body got
stiff and I couldn't move.

420
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
Is that why your
speech is slurred?

421
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,416
I just thought you were talking
funny because I woke you up.

422
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,125
No, it's because I can't move.

423
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,166
How could this happen?

424
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,500
Is the reanimation
potion wearing off?

425
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
I need to check something.

426
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:06,208
They won't budge, which means.

427
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,583
Rigor mortis is setting in.

428
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,625
Rigor mortis?
Never heard of dat.

429
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,125
Oh. It's not a big deal.

430
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,166
Just a natural phenomenon.

431
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,041
There's nothing to worry about.

432
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,416
Chihiro, you're so smart.

433
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,416
That makes me feel better.

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,583
Thanks for taking care of me.

435
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,666
Yeah, sure.

436
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,166
Rea's so full of life
I forget she's dead.

437
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,500
Her body's deteriorating.

438
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,083
It's a good thing
she can't feel pain

439
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,083
'cause I bet
it'd be excruciating.

440
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,833
Thank you, Chihiro.

441
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,416
I've got to find
a way to slow down

442
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,250
the decomposition process

443
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,125
before her flesh starts to rot.

444
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,625
Otherwise,
she'll be nothing more

445
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,958
than a skeleton
within a few months.

446
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,333
I can't let that happen.

447
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,166
I just want to experience life.

448
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,625
Do things other girls
do that I haven't yet.

449
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,541
I have to do whatever I can.

450
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:22,666
To preserve Rea's body.

451
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,208
Let me get this straight,
you want me to "dial it back"?

452
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,250
What do you mean by that?

453
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,375
My read doesn't
fit the character?

454
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,541
Do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

455
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,750
Hello, I am the character.

456
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,541
Next time on Sankarea,

457
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,583
Episode 5, "If She's
a Zombie... That Means..."

458
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,000
Tune in to see Mero!

459
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,458
I'm in this for the long haul,
and I'm not gonna let

460
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,125
your less than constructive
criticism break me down.
