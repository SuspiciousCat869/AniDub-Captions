Zombies!

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,750
Creatures that've been
brought back to life

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,000
with the use of dark
magic or secret potions.

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,000
They are said
to roam the Earth

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,833
feasting on
the flesh of the living.

6
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,500
They are terrifying.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,666
Monsters!

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,708
[BABU] There's a girl who
lives in our peaceful town

9
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,000
who's keeping a dark secret.

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,875
She's a zombie!

[REA gasps]

12
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,833
Babu!

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,625
Don't sneak up
on me like that!

14
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,208
You nearly
scared me to death!

15
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,375
[BABU] I, too,
am a zombie. Babu!

16
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:18,791
What? Wanna join me?

17
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,375
[BABU] We are
the living dead.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,541
C'mere.

19
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,916
You could use a bath, too.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,916
But let's get those
bandages off first.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
[BABU] We were
unfortunate enough

22
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,750
to lose our lives at a young age

23
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,666
due to unforeseen accidents.

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Thankfully, an incredible
elixir allowed us

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,541
to be reborn as zombies.

26
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,750
The person
responsible for that elixir.

27
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,083
is my master, Chihiro Furuya.

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh!

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,833
Hey Babu! I'm home!

30
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,375
Ya miss me?

31
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,083
Luckily for us, he considers
himself a devotee of the undead.

32
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,333
He's a zombie fanatic

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,416
and he's had plenty
of practice making potions.

34
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,291
I got some more dry ice
to keep your body cool.

35
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,041
Hey Chihiro!

36
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,250
Didya have a good day today?

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,500
Geez!

38
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,791
You know, you don't have
to shower all the time,

39
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,958
you're a freakin' zombie now!

40
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,000
I know.

41
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
But still...

42
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,041
We aren't like all
the other unhygienic zombies,

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,708
we prefer to stay clean.

44
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,375
Right, Babu?

45
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,708
[BABU] To be honest,
I don't particularly care

46
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,916
whether I bathe or not.

47
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,583
It'd be nice if I could
open up the wound on my belly

48
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,666
and scrub everything
on the inside, too!

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,750
I don't think that's a good
idea considering those stitches

50
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,208
are the only thing keeping your
intestines from popping out.

51
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,375
There.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,625
Here you go, Babu.

53
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
Have some hydrangea leaves.

54
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,500
[BABU] I've always lived here
as the Furuya family's housecat.

55
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,791
The girl, on the other hand,

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,500
ran away from home
when she became a zombie.

57
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,166
That's how she ended up
living here, too.

58
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,291
It's so beautiful outside.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,625
She spent her youth living

60
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,208
under the watchful eye of
her overprotective father.

61
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,500
But all she wanted was to live
the life of a normal girl.

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,291
Hey, Chihiro?

63
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,125
Whaddya say we go for a walk?

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,250
We can be back by suppertime.

65
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,416
What'd I tell you?

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,583
You shouldn't expose
yourself to the elements!

67
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,791
I explained what happens
to the body when you die.

68
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,583
Don't you remember?

69
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
Lemme see.

70
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,083
You said amino acids
increase because

71
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,291
proteins start to
decompose and so

72
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,416
the body becomes more savory!

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,958
That's gotta be it, right?

74
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,583
I wouldn't know if it
affects their flavor.

75
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,125
Nasty.

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,416
Now think back, remember how
just a few hours after you died

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,083
you couldn't move
your body anymore?

78
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,916
That's called rigor mortis.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,125
It causes the limbs of a corpse
to become rigid and stiff.

80
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,041
I see.

81
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,666
So it's kinda like when you
take a fish that just died,

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,916
turn it into sashimi,
and then it gets crunchy.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,166
It's impossible to talk
to you when you're hungry.

84
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,125
Now listen.

85
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,458
Once rigor mortis has passed,

86
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,708
the body will then
gradually begin to uh...

87
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Never mind.

88
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,791
Just try not to spend
too much time outside

89
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,791
while the sun
is still up, okay?

90
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,958
If you say so.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,125
[BABU] While my
master is concerned

92
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,333
about preserving
the girl's zombified-body,

93
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,125
he also understands her desire

94
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,416
to go out and enjoy
her newfound freedom.

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,375
Fine, let's go.

96
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,958
But we can't stay out long.

97
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,750
[BABU]
This experience has changed

98
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,375
my master
for the better.

99
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,041
He's much more dependable now

100
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,958
than he ever was
during my lifetime.

101

Wow, it's so
beautiful out today!

102

Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

103
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,958
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

104
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,583
Geez.

105
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,333
I get that you're excited about
going back to school and all,

106
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,208
but you've really gotta be more
careful with your body, Rea.

107
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,375
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,958
Well, the sun's
not at its peak yet.

109
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
Guess she'll be okay.

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,208
You got it from here?

111
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,125
Uh-huh.

112

I'll see ya later on.

113
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,166
I hate to be a nag but try to
stay out of direct sunlight.

114
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
and don't forget to
eat your hydrangea leaves.

115
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,500
I know!

116
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
If I don't eat them
I'll be in big trouble, right?

117
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
After all, they're
maintaining my body.

118
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,666
Got it!

119
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't worry about me!

120
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,958
Okay. I'll try.

122

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,666
Well... what's this?

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Are you transferring
to Sanka Girl's Academy?

130
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,333
Oh, you're so funny.

131
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,458
I walked Rea to school to
make sure she got here okay.

132
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,250
That's nice of you.

133
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,250
I have early morning tennis
practice every day, you know.

134
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,750
Think you can walk
me to school, too?

135
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,708
I'm such a delicate young lady.

136
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
You're a lot of things
but delicate ain't one.

Alright, that does it!

Oh, good morning,

You look pretty today,

Oh, thank you, Miss Kusakabe.

It's so good to see you!

never coming back to school!

Oh. Hello Heren!

149

Glad to be here!

How're you?

151
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, I'm good!

152
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
A little tired after
morning tennis practice

153
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
but that's because I have to
be there at the crack of dawn.

154
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,583
I'm kinda surprised
I've stuck with it.

155

Oh really?

Yeah, I do.

But I hate that it leaves
me drenched in sweat!

I'm gonna go and take
a quick shower now.

muscles perform at 20 to 30%

182
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:01,375
of their capacity because of
limitations set by the brain.

00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,875
That's right.

324
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,583
Just like the wound on my tummy,

325
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,750
you can sew it shut
but it'll never heal.

326
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,000
Even so.

327
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,000
I can't be scared.

328
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,208
I wanna make the most
of every moment.

329
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,791
It would be a shame to leave
this world with any regrets.

330
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,250
[BABU] It's common knowledge
that cellular metabolism

331
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:02,041
ceases almost immediately
after a creature dies.

332
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,250
Once a living thing is incapable
of producing new cells

333
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,375
and expelling old ones,
it's impossible to sustain life.

334
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,500
Except in the case of a zombie.

335
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
The effects of the reanimation
drug they've been given

336
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,083
will help sustain their
body to a certain degree.

337
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,791
But there's no longer any
active production of new cells.

338
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,583
In other words.

339
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,041
Even though we remain conscious
and don't feel any pain.

340
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,916
There is no denying
that gradually.

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,708
Our bodies are decaying.

342
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,416
Slow down!

343
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,458
You're moving too fast!

344
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,625
Thanks a lot, Rea.

345
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,125
No problem.

346
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,333
You've gotta be more
careful too, you know.

347
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,666
I'd be heartbroken if
anything ever happened to you.

348
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,333
Huh?  Oh, really?

349
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,500
[BABU] It's not
just our bodies,

350
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,791
but our minds too,
that gradually...

351
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,833
Gradually...

352
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:09,083
[BABU meows]

353
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,541
[BABU meows]
Hey there, Babu!

354
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,083
Perfect timing.

355
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,583
I just finished putting some
more dry ice in your bed for ya.

356
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,000
Goodness, look at you.

357
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,208
Someone's becoming
a spoiled little kitty.

358
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,708
That cat.

359
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,625
What's up with him?

360
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,583
[BABU meowing]
[REA laughing]

361
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,291
Bye Babu!

362
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:38,625
We'll see you when we get home!

363
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,500
Hey!

364
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
Watch yourself!

365
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,541
Try to stay in the shade
while the sun's out!

366
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,833
[BABU] Nothing in this world

367
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,291
ever goes the way
you want it to,

368
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,291
it doesn't matter
whether you're alive or dead.

369
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,541
I'm sure those two still have
a tough road ahead of them.

370
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,916
But I'm going to enjoy

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,250
every last moment
I have on this Earth.

372
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,125
Until my body wastes away.

373
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,541
[BABU meows]

374
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
we would like to thank you

375
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,000
for flying with us today.

376
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,333
In preparation for landing
at Tokyo Narita airport,

377
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,000
please make sure your
seatbelt is securely fastened.

378
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,416
The "Newly Dead" Period.

379
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,458
This period is
followed by a two week span

380
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,958
in which a zombie's emotions,

381
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,083
desires, and instincts
become blurred.

382
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,958
No matter how much rationality
they may seem to possess,

383
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,208
they have the urge to
devour their loved ones.

384
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,583
This is called
the "Confused" period.

385
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,541
Oh, Professor Jojo.

386
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,375
I'm excited to see what kinds of
samples await me here in Japan.
