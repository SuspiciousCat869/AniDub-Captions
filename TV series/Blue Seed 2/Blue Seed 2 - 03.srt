Why didn't I think
of that earlier, Koume?

Why not an ostrich doing the two-step

Where would you even begin to look?

374

There's an old abandoned cottage

We don't have the supplies
to do that, Yaegashi.

[Yoshiki] Oh yeah, right.

491
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,846
Cut the yellow wire in
the second panel then.

492
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,349
Yeah, that's right, the yellow one.

493
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,448
I think he's panicking.

494

We better get ready then.

Sakura, they're coming
towards the water.

They're coming.

499
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,286
Okay we have no choice
but to get out of the water

500

at the same time that they're getting in.

Kusanagi.

502

I can't leave, Momiji.

503

Now just go.

[Ryoko] I did it.

What's next?

507
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,526
There should be a green
wire around there somewhere.

508
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,501
That can't be right.

509
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,906
I've already cut all of those.

510
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,924
[Yoshiki] There has to be
another one there somewhere.

511
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:18,026
Look!

512
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,056
Stop yelling.

513
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,183
I'll find it.

514
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,926
It's not here.

515
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,896
I don't see it, I don't see it anywhere.

516
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,276
Calm down and look.

517
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,883
It has to be there.

No way.

No, not yet.

Man am I sore.

Was it disarmed?

What's the answer to riddle you gave us?

534

Mask.

[Koume] Hey don't die.
