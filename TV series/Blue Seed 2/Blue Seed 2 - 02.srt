Corporal, the monitor, please.

My word.

You guys really have been
living in the Stone Age.

68
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,497
The first step, as you can see,

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,042
will be to set up our perimeter
using these giant charms.

70
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,294
The charms will
need to be placed

71
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,119
at these six points
around the Aragami.

72
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,698
Then, for step two, we
place the giant seal

73
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,382
in the center,
trapping the monster

74

inside of the perimeter!

75
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,226
You really expect to fight
that creature with banners?

It's not voodoo.

It's magic energy.

From the Kasamakato family.

81

For the third step...

82
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,461
We place the seal

83
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,605
there on the Aragami
to focus the power.

If I understand the
situation correctly,

you've already sent destroyers

to intercept the
Aragami, haven't you?

94

Once the Aragami
has been trapped,

95
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,353
we go to step four and blast it.

Operation Fly Trap!

What a stupid name.

If we could fight this
thing out in the open

we wouldn't need
to use your voodoo.

The United States has a
lot to think about, Admiral.

101

Who knows why you found yourself

102

in the position you're in?

103
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,615
Perhaps it's impossible
for any country

to resist abusing its power

105

once it's gone
unchallenged for too long.

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,432
Or maybe it's decided that
insanity is the only choice

107
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,023
in an insane world.

108
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:47,238
Either way, it was a
mistake for you to research

109
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,953
the mitama so you could
develop a new weapon.

110
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,952
Now that your misguided
experiments have escaped

111

one by one, you've had to
turn to foreigners like us

the TAC has done for you today

so unilaterally.

119

Or maybe in the future Japan
won't be there for you.
