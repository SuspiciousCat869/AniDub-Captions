[Takeuchi] How's it going
over there, Mr. Sugishita?

165
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,367
[Sugishita] We're still
interviewing eyewitnesses,

166
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,233
but some of them reported
seeing a huge monster

167
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,481
break into the building
just before it collapsed.

168
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,866
[Takeuchi] Then it's
exactly as we feared.

169
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,358
I'm afraid so.

170
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:17,899
It's Aragami.

171
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,569
I'd have to disagree.

172
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,143
At least, it's not the same
Aragami we dealt with before.

173
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:24,241
How do you know that?

174
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,490
I didn't detect any change
whatsoever in Susano-oh.

(machinery beeping)

176
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,753
According to my work, all
Aragami activity ceased

177
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:35,914
when Susano-oh went dormant.

178
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:38,560
Everyone, that is,
except for Mr. Kusanagi.

179
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:42,123
As long as Susano-oh's soul
continues to remain dormant,

180
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,627
then there is absolutely no
way the Aragami could return.

181
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:50,480
But then what were all
of these people seeing?

182
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:52,722
I'm afraid that's not all.

183
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,576
The data on the Kushinada
has been stolen.

184
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,416
[Sugishita] Did
Kunikida tell you that?

185
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:58,817
Yes, he did.

186
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,302
Apparently this
thief went directly

187

data access cable.

They seem to be
targeting the Kushinada.

We have to find
Momiji before they do.

Right, and if
