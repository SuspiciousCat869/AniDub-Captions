[GOZABURO] Hey, it's you.

159
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,416
How come ya ain't
drinkin' any sake?

160
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,458
Hey, come on, officials
can have fun, too, right?

161
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,416
We can and do,
but it's frowned upon

162
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,083
when we're on the job,
even if it's at a

163
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
lovely festival
such as this one.

164
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,166
I'm going to have to
behave myself and abstain.

165
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,625
Hey, hold on there!

166
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,291
Ya came all the way
out here to Seto to visit us!

167
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,666
We can't just send
ya home without

168
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,541
experiencin' some
of our hospitality.

169
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,166
[GOZABURO] Come sit down
and have a drink with me!

170
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,541
I insist!

171
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,333
[AKENO'S BROTHER] I shouldn't...
But, if you insist.

172
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,250
[Gozaburo laughs]

173
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,166
Yeah! Would ya
look at her go!

174
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
Ain't my little
girl adorable?

175
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,833
[AKENO'S BROTHER]
Her name is Sun, Right?

176
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,208
You're very proud
of her, aren't you?

177
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,083
Yeah, I sure am... And
fer the rest of her life,

178
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,500
I gonna protect her!

179
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,166
Oh... Her entire
life, huh? Well...

180
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,791
I guess her future husband will
be in for a rough time then.

181
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,375
Huh?

182
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,416
What? Husband? Uh...

183
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,583
[GOZABURO]
Future husband, my ass!

184
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,500
Um, no, look, Mr. Seto...

185
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,958
[GOZABURO] And if any
maggots try put their

186
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,791
slimy little tentacles on her...

187
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,083
I'll whack 'em all!

188
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,041
Uh... Hey Mr. Official?

189
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,583
Hey there... You can
hear me, right?

190
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,791
Please tell me you can hear me!

191
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,333
You killed him?

192
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,916
No, but...

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,416
Wh--
Where uh-- am I?

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,291
A-And who am I?

195
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,083
You gave the
guy amnesia?

196
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,166
Okay, then what
happened next?

197
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,333
Well, I decided to
look after the official.

198
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,583
Until the guy's
memory came back.

199
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,500
But it never did, and
eventually, another came by.

200
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,250
He asked me what
happened to the first guy

201
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,750
they sent, and on the spur
of the moment, I said...

202
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,750
Well... That man
was here and he left

203
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,916
this old swordie
on the front porchie.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,750
He said "Don't lookie
for me-e" and went bye-bye!

205
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
Hey! Wait!

206
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,208
If this story's true.
No! Hold on!

207
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,833
It just can't be true!

208
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:51,833
[GOZABURO] It is!

209
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,750
That official from
ten years ago?

210
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,208
He's Masa today!

211
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,333
[NAGASUMI] What?

212
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,291
[SUN] Wow, it's been
so long since I

213
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,416
did any sword
practice with ya, Masa!

214
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,041
This'll be fun!

215
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,916
Crap! This definitely
ain't good maggot!

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,125
Look they're startin'!

217
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,958
Oh no! If Akeno finds
out that Masa's her

218
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,166
long-lost brother
who's still alive...

219
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,333
[AKENO] He won't
be living for much

220
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,208
longer because I'll kill 'em!

221
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,291
It's gonna be
a total bloodbath!

222
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,875
[GOZABURO] We gotta
save Masa's life,

223
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,541
so get in there and make sure
he doesn't remember anythin'!

224
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
[NAGASUMI] Me? Hey,
if you hadn't come

225
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,208
up with some crazy
lie to begin with,

226
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,958
we wouldn't be in
this trouble right now!

227
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,666
[GOZABURO] I'd be in bigger
trouble if the authorities

228
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,833
found out that I
punched one of their

229
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,625
officials out and
gave him amnesia!

230
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,000
[NAGASUMI] And by doing that,
you ruined the guy's life!

231
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,875
[GOZABURO (baby talk)] I
made a big booboo there.

232
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,541
I'm so-wwy; very so-wwy.
Pwease help me fix it.

233
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,583
[NAGASUMI] This guy.

234
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,791
[MASA] Akeno...

235
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
May I? I'd like to see
your sword, please.

236
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
For some reason, it's
had a strange pull

237
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,625
on me since I laid eyes on it.

238
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,250
All right then.

239
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,375
[GOZABURO AND NAGASUMI]
Thump thump thump thump thump!

240
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,750
The way it feels...

241
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,958
Like there's something
familiar about it.

242
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,250
[AKENO] What are you doing?

243
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,833
What the hell
has gotten into you?

244
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:11,791
[MASA] And you...

245
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,583
I... I don't know why,

246
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,916
but every time
I look at you, Akeno,

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,625
I get overwhelmed by
this particular emotion,

248
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
almost like homesickness.

249
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,708
and I feel like
I want to cry.

250
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,375
Masa, hold on,
could that mean that you're--

251
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,791
A dead man?

252
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,333
[SEXY VOICE] Forbidden love!

253
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
It must! You're head over
heels in love with Akeno!

254
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,291
[NAGASUMI] Nice wrong idea, Sun!

255
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,791
Yeah, that should
work, run with it!

256
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,583
[MASA] I'm not... sorry...

257
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,166
...but could I hold
that sword one more time?

258
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,916
[NAGASUMI] Arrgh!
My stomach's killing me!

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think I'm gonna die!

260
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,916
Masa, take me
home right now, please!

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,166
[MASA] What? Me?

262
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,250
[NAGASUMI] Yes!

263
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,166
Carry me on your
broad, muscular back!

264
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,541
Leave it to me!

265
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,458
I'll make sure Nagasumi
makes it home in one piece.

266
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,625
Masa, ya can just stay
here and practice with Akkie.

267
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,708
[NAGASUMI] There's no
point in you taking me home!

268
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,208
[MASA] There's something
about this sword--

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,250
[AKENO] Knock it off!

270
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,333
Why do you keep interfering
with us like that?

271
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,208
Well?

272
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,750
I see...
So that's it, is it?

273
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,875
--Well...I know ya, Nagasumi.
--[NAGASUMI] Huh? What's it?

274
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,166
Ya wouldn't interfere
like that unless

275
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,125
ya had a really
important reason to do so.

276
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,666
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Oh, Sun, you're the best.

277
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,083
You always know how I feel.

278
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,666
I don't even have
to say anything to you.

279
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,250
[SUN] Ya don't want her
to take him from ya, right?

280
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,291
[SUN] After all, Masa's the one
who gave ya your first kiss!

281
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,041
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
She thinks I'm in love with him?

282
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,208
[SEXY VOICE] Forbidden love.

283
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,625
[VOICES AND MASA] Part II!

284
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,083
[SUN] Why didn't
I realize it earlier?

285
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,250
I mean, every time ya
see him, ya get this face!

286
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,208
You love Masa!

287
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,625
[NAGASUMI] I make that face?

288
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,708
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Ever since that kiss we

289
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,958
shared over summer break,

290
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,291
I've had some weird
thoughts about Masa.

291
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,833
I've tried to bury them,
but I guess

292
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,208
I'm gonna have to dig them up!

293
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,666
[CLASS REP] Mr. Seto?

294
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,375
What is it that
you're looking at?

295
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,875
Somethin' scary.

296
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,500
[NAGASUMI] Yes, that's right!
I'm in love with Masa!

297
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,083
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Masa, Masa,
wherefore art thou Masa?

298
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,416
Nagasumi? Was Masa's
kiss really that good?

299
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,541
Was it?

300
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,083
[NAGASUMI] It was
sweeter than honey!

301
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,916
Oh, so you play for
that team, do you?

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,333
I do! Write it down!

303
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,875
Let everyone know that
I'm an actual gay who loves...

And you never
told me this before?

00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
How vexing!

306
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,625
[NAGASUMI] I can't
believe I just said that!

307
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,458
Somebody kill me, please!

308
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,125

a thing for Mr. Masa?

If ya ask me, that kid's been

312
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,500
livin' in denial
for far too long.

313
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,083
It's about time he finally
came out of the closet.

314
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,291
Look,
I'm really flattered,

315
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,250
but I gotta see Akeno's
sword more closely!

316
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,666
No, forget Akeno
and that stupid sword!

317
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,916
'Cause if you get
your memories back,

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,083
you're gonna get killed!

319
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,333
No! Don't look at the sword!

320
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,500
Look at me!

321
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,833
The gay guy who's
madly in love with you!

322
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,208
Hey! Stop Nagasumi!
Let Masa look at the sword!

323
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,041
Yes, so let
go of me, please!

324
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,250
[NAGASUMI] No, I'm
never letting go of you!

325

[GOZABURO] Masa!

326

[GOZABURO] I'm doin'
this for your sake!

327
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,416
Well...

328
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,375
Did that make that nostalgia
of yours go away?

329
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,416
No, I still feel that
sword is important somehow.

330
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,541
[GOZABURO]
I'm doin' this outta love!

331
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Have you gone totally
insane or something?

332
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,500
Wh-Where am I?

333
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,416
The last thing I remember is
attending a festival in Seto.

334
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
He remembers!

335
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,416
[GOZABURO] Sorry, but I gotta
do this for your own good, Masa!

336
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,916
For once I actually
agree with you!

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,083
Stop it!

338
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,250
If you don't,
you're going to kill him!

Akkie, no, come back!

340
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,291
It's too dangerous
to get near Dad now!

341
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,750
[NAGASUMI] Akeno?

342
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,125
[SUN] Oh, Akkie, I'm so sorry!
Did I hurt you?

343
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,125
Akeno, are you okay?

[AKENO] I'm... I'm...

[YOUNG AKENO] Four years old.
I'm Akeno Shiranui!

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,958
Huh?

[YOUNG AKENO]
Hey, where am I huh?

348
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,916
Oh, no, her mind's reverted
back to childhood!

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,250
[YOUNG AKENO]
Where's my big brother?

350
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,250
Hey, big brother!
Are you here somewhere?

351
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,250
[YOUNG AKENO] Or are you
outside somewhere, Big brother?

00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,750
[NAGASUMI] Akeno, wait! Hold on!

353
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,875
[SUN] Akkie, stay!

354
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, no,
this isn't good!

355
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,875
[GOZABURO]
Hey! M-Masa?

Wh-Where am I?

[MASA] You... You're...

358
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,333
You're me, the real me.

359
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,083
It's been awhile.

360
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,916
[MASA] I'm sorry.

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,958
[AKENO'S BROTHER]
You're sorry for what?

362
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,291
For forgetting everything,
including my true identity,

363
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,291
the family that I belonged to,

364
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,291
my obligations as a
mermaid examiner, and--

[Young Akeno crying]

366
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,875
[YOUNG AKENO] Big brother!

367
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,875
My little sister.

368
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,583
[AKENO'S BROTHER] Go to her.

369
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,666
[MASA] I have no right to.
I couldn't face her.

370
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,708
Not after all this
time has passed.

371
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,166
You go and do it instead.

372
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,166
This body, it belongs
to you in the first place.

373
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,833
Are you saying that you'll
give the body back to me?

374
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,000
But if you do that,
what will you do?

375
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,000
[MASA] I'm a false
existence to begin with.

376
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,708
I was born in your place
when you lost your memory.

377
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,958
I'm nothing more
than your shadow.

378
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,583
A shadow that will be
reabsorbed into the darkness.

379
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,166
That's all.

380
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,958
You want to disappear?

381
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,750
That's so foolish.

382
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,875
[MASA] Miss Sun.

383
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,500
[MASA] Boss, ma'am.

[MASA] Nagasumi.

386
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,541
[AKENO'S BROTHER]
You might have been born

387
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,625
as my shadow, but the
friendships you've built

388
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,166
over the last ten years
are very much real.

389
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,291
These people care
about you deeply.

390
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,375
They... They do.

391
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,500
I don't want you to do the

392
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,291
same thing to them
that I did to Akeno.

393
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,416
So you see I can't
let you disappear.

394
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,333
[MASA] But if you do that,
what'll happen to you?

395
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,541
Don't worry about me.

396
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,500
I'll be just fine.
I'll keep on living.

397
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,541
Inside of you, as a part of you.

398
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,750
[AKENO'S BROTHER]
Take care of my sister, okay?

399
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,666
[MASA] Oh...

Does that mean you're
back to normal, Masa?

402
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,625
[MASA] Yeah, Boss. I am.

[MASA] To keep a promise
I made to someone, that's all.

you are come back!

[NAGASUMI THINKS] What do we do?

414
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,333
Brother and sister
both have amnesia,

415
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,208
and it's all because of
a father and daughter.

see him again one day,

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,250
would you please
allow me to fill in?

429

I'll be your substitute

No way, mophead!

doesn't have crazy
mop hair like you,

Well, I do have
a splitting headache.

451
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,375
The very last thing I
remember doing is trying

452
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,708
to practice sword play
in the kendo hall.

453
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,291
What happened after that?

454

She can't remember.
Is she okay?

455
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,583
Yep, she'll be fine,
but it looks like

she can't remember anythin' that
happened while she had amnesia.

Oh, Akkie, you poor thing!
I'm so, so sorry!

Do ya hurt somewhere?

No.

[AKENO] This feeling
just came over me.

461
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,875
The best way I can
describe it is that it's

462
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,916
warm and tender
and strangely nostalgic.

463

[NAGASUMI] So, you
remember everything, huh?
