1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,666
[SUN] (deep voice)
Now listen up,

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,041
and listen up good, small fry;

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,208
I'm only
gonna say this once.

4
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:18,166
I'm Lunar Edomae's boyfriend,
Sunpachi Setojima!

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,291
[NARRATOR] Several dozen leagues
from the Inland Sea's foam,

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,250
Lies the land of Saitama,
birthplace and home,

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,000
But where'er you go,
the demons still roam.

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,041
A violent mob's on the scene.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,208
Watching the
schoolboy's routine.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,000
And poor Nagasumi
is only fourteen.

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,333
Like a stormy sea,
the course of this love

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,375
is anything but smooth.

13
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:48,541
♪

14
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,666
[LUNAR] ♪ Your love
pulls me close to you. ♪

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,916
[SUN] Wow, Lunar's
just gettin' more

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,791
and more popular, isn't she?

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,625
[MAKI] She's on TV all the time.

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,208
She's been working
really hard lately.

19
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,916
I hope she takes some time off.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,166
[Lunar cries out]

21
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,833
Crap...
This is way too hard.

22
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,666
They actually expect
us to memorize

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,458
this whole, giant script
in a few days?

24
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,250
It's totally impossible!
It can't be done! 

25
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,750
[SUN] Um... are you okay?

26
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,166
Wait! Um, Sun?

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,791
We need a teensy favor,
so would you be our lover?

28
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,708
[SUN] Huh?

29
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,916
We're rehearsing
our part on a

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,291
soap opera as a girl
who loves her boyfriend.

31
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,625
Would you be him, Sun?

32
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,250
Hey, if you need a rehearsal
boyfriend, I'm game.

33
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,125
Ha! A manservant playing
our lover? Yeah, right!

34
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,166
Only in your dreams,
you lowly commoner!

35
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,375
[NAGASUMI] She shot me down.

36
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,708
[MAKI] Hey, why
should Miss Sun waste

37
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,791
her precious time
rehearsin' with ya?

38
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,333
Because if we
can pull this off,

39
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,708
we could have an additional
career acting in soap operas.

40
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,333
So we really need your help
to nail this character, Sun!

41
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,833
So this soap opera job?

42
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,666
It's really that
important to ya, Lunar?

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,083
[LUNAR] Of course
it is, so hurry up

44
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,041
and say you'll help us!

45
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,916
We're a busy woman!

46
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,166
Okay...
I'll help ya then, Lunar.

47
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,625
Sun...

48
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,083
[SUN] Just don't
bite me anymore.

49
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,875
Yay,
Sun's gonna help us!

50
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,583
Okay, here's the
script; get started!

51
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,666
Sun and Lunar pretending
to be a couple, huh?

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,500
You know, I think I might
actually enjoy watching this.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,083
[MOM] Nagasumi!

54
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,625
Come have breakfast
before it gets cold!

55
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,125
[NAGASUMI] Coming.

56
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,916
[SUN] (in deep voice) Nagasumi.

57
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,333
Yo!

58
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,833
Please allow me
to introduce myself!

59
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,333
I'm Lunar Edomae's boyfriend,
Sunpachi Setojima!

60
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,416
She's in drag!

61
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,541
[DAD] Oh...

62
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,083
So you're just practicing
for a soap opera, huh?

63
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank goodness.

64
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,166
I'll say!

65
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,333
I was worried she
was dressed like that

66
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,750
because of something
you'd done to her!

67
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,916
What on earth could I
have done to have caused that?

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,791
So tell me, Lunar...

69
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,041
Is your character's boyfriend

70
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,083
in the soap opera
really like that?

71
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,708
[LUNAR] Nope, not even close!

72
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,166
Lunar told me
that she wanted me

73
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,500
to play the ideal boyfriend,
so that's what I'm doin'!

74
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,958
I gotta do my best acting
so Lunar can do hers!

75
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,625
Gimme another helpin'!

76
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,041
[DAD] So that's what
Sun thinks an ideal

77
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,041
boyfriend should look
and act like, huh?

78
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,000
She's being so
manly, it's creepy!

79
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,125
[VOICES] Manly!

80
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,541
[MAKI] Oh, Miss Sun!

81
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,791
[MOM] Personally, my ideal
boyfriend is quietly hot.

82
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,875
But as you can see,

83
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,333
I didn't end up
marrying my ideal type,

84
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,708
but the polar opposite.

85
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,916
[DAD] But you used to think
I was hot, right dear?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,791
I guess I really do fall
short of your ideal boyfriend.

87
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,333
I'm so very sorry, Sun.

88
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,083
[SUN] What are ya talkin' about?

89
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,250
[SUN] You're a man, ain't ya?
Don't sweat the small stuff!

90
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,458
Real men start the day
off with raw meat!

91
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,791
[CHIMP] Hey, good morning
there, Sun and Lunar!

92
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,041
Good mornin', Chimp!

93
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,291
[CHIMP] What the--? A beard?

94
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,750
[CHIMP] What happened?

95
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,041
Why does my beloved
Sun have facial hair!

96
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,416
Because I'm
Sunpachi Setojima.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,125
[CHIMP]
Can I get an interview?

98
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,541
Yeah sure...
What do ya want to know?

99
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,916
[CHIMP] For one,
why are you wearing

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,208
wide pants and a long coat?

101
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,541
[SUN] It's an expression
of male wildness.

102
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,458
[CHIMP] Why are you
holding a wooden sword?

103
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,708
[SUN] In case of attacks from
kids from other schools.

104
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,958
[CHIMP] Most importantly,
why do you have a beard?

105
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,416
To give me
the imposin' figure

106
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
of a military commander!

107
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,166
[CHIMP] My Sun. My Sun.

108
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,000
[CHIMP] My Sun isn't
a military commander!

109
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,000
[NAGASUMI] Chimp...

110
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,041
Ah... Just let him go.
Besides...

111
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,833
We should really
start rehearsing.

112
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,250
Hey let's walk arm-in-arm.

113
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,291
A woman should always walk

114
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,458
quietly three paces
behind her man!

115
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,875
[LUNAR] Uh... Right.

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,083
[SUN] What the--?

117
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,500
[SUN] Oh, no! A puddle!
And it's a pretty big one, too!

118
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,291
Here, this should do it.

119
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,750
Don't you worry, Lunar.

120
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,833
Walk on my coat.

121
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,458
I don't want my
girlfriend getting wet.

122
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,666
Uh... Thanks a lot.

123
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,041
All I did was what any man

124
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,750
would have done
in the same situation.

125
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,875
So there's no need to thank me.

126
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,708
[NAGASUMI] Oh, poor Sun.

127
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,416
I promise I'll try
my best to be as

128
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,875
good a boyfriend
as you're being.

129
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,166
[SUN] Now what?

130
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,125
Sun...
Is something wrong?

131
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
Yeah,
what's going on?

132
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,291
Go... leave now.

133
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,625
You get to school, Lunar;

134
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,458
I'll take care of
the problem here.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,208
[SUN] Namely this wild beast!

136
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,083
You mean... the cat?

137
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,375
Come on...

138
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,958
That's just the cat who's
friendly with my Dad.

139
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,500
He's harmless, well,
unless you happen to be Maki.

140
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,708
[NAGASUMI] Here, I'll prove it.
C'mere, kitty.

141
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,250
[SUN] No, Nagasumi! Get back!

142
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,541
[NAGASUMI] Sun, really,
there's no need for you

143
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,291
to get so worked
up over the cat.

144
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,708
Please, I have to look
good in front of the ladies.

145
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,333
Do me a solid and just
let me do this, Nagasumi.

146
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,458
Uh... sure.

147
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,125
[SUN] Thanks...
Now watch closely.

148
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,125
This is how Lunar
Edomae's boyfriend...

149
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,500
[SUN] This is how Sunpachi
Setojima lives his life!

150
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,250
[NAGASUMI] But Sun,
what about school?

151
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,666
And what about us?

152
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,916
We still need a
partner to rehearse with!

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,458
[NAGASUMI] Aagh! Lunar, stop!
What are you doing?

154
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,416
Even Fujishiro
never actually bit me!

155
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,583
Come on, get off my head!

156
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,708
[NAGASUMI] Like I
said before, if you need

157
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,750
someone to play your boyfriend,

158
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,458
I'll be more than
happy to do it!

159
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,708
[LUNAR] You?

160
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,458
[LUNAR] Like
we already told you,

161
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,458
you're light-years out of
our league, manservant!

162
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,083
[LUNAR] Listen, everybody!

163
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,291
We'll be brief.

164
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,958
We need someone
to play our boyfriend.

165
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,833
Any volunteers?

166
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,541
[BOY 1] Yeah, I'll do it!

167
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,750
[CHIMP] Use me however you want!

168
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,291
I'll be so real you
won't know I'm acting!

169
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
[LUNAR] Talk about fierce
competition for a role!

170
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,708
Go ahead and fight
over us, you pigs!

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,250
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

172
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:35,000
This is so disgusting!
Geez! Boys really do suck!

173
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,083
What about you, Kai,
you're not joining in?

174
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,916
Nope... The only girl that
I'm interested in is Sun.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
[CHIMP] I propose we form an

176
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,958
orderly line that
starts behind me!

177
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,041
[LUNAR DUDE A] Back!
Back, you cretins!

178
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,875
[LUNAR DUDE A] Know your place!

179
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,708
[CHIMP]
It's Lunar's elite guard!

180
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,916
[LUNAR DUDE B] Don't you
know who this is, you riff-raff?

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,708
[LUNAR DUDE C] You don't
approach a famous pop star

182
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,208
at the peak of
her fame like that!

183
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,125
[LUNAR DUDE A]
Everybody back off!

184
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,666
[LUNAR DUDES] Right!

185
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,375
[LUNAR DUDE A]
Are you okay, Miss Lunar?

186
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,625
[LUNAR] Hmph!

187
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,916
Yeah, but you sure took
your time getting here!

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,291
These losers are acting
like a pack of wild dogs.

189
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,833
And wild dogs need to
be brought under control!

190
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,250
So teach 'em to sit and
stay when we tell 'em to!

191
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,750
[LUNAR DUDES]
At once, Miss!

192
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
[LUNAR DUDE A] In the name
of Miss Lunar's elite guard,

193
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,291
I hereby place Class 2-1
under martial law!

194
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,458
[LUNAR DUDES] Right!

195
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,500
[KAI] I don't think so!
Hold it right there!

196
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,791
Just as the moon
rules the night,

197
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,125
the sun rules the day!

198
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,958
We, the proud members
of the Sun cult,

199
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,958
have no reason
to yield to Lunar!

200
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,708
Ya see, the Sun
cult has become even

201
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,583
more powerful thanks
to the sponsorship

202
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,125
of the Mikawa Conglomerate!

203
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,125
[KAI] Chimp, weren't ya in
Lunar's group a second ago?

204
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,625
[CHIMP] Yep, but where
my lord goes, I follow.

205
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,333
[LUNAR DUDE A] This
time, there's no super-warrior

206
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,333
around to save you from

207
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,916
the wrath of
Lunar's elite guard!

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,083
[SUN DUDE A] Bring it on then!

209
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,958
Ya see, we'll purify
ya with Sun's power!

210
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,958
[NAGASUMI] I can't believe
Lunar's doing this again!

211
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,125
What do you mean
"again," Nagasumi?

212
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,291
[NAGASUMI]
The school once split into

213
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,916
Sun and Lunar factions
and they clashed!

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,791
Like the last time,
all the boys chose sides

215
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,208
and they're ready to
fight over which girl is best!

216
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,416
[AKENO] Are you serious?

217
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,833
[NAGASUMI] Yes, and so are they!

218
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,500
I think the Second Sun-Lunar
War is about to begin!

219
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,500
Geez. How absurd.

220
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,333
Right!
Boys are so stupid!

221
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,708
In fact, I'm sick and tired of
having to deal with stupid boys!

222
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,250
I'm gonna haul all of
them down to the station!

223
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,041
Boys suck, don't they?

224
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:21,083
[GIRLS] Yeah! Boys suck! Boys
suck! Boys suck! Boys suck!

225
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,125
[NAGASUMI] Not the girls, too?

226
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,666
[SUN DUDE B]
Let's do this for Sun!

227
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,208
[SUN DUDE A] She's so beautiful,
she can make flowers bloom!

228
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,625
[LUNAR DUDE B]
You fools are dreaming!

229
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,666
[LUNAR DUDE A]
Her beauty can't match

230
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,166
that of a famous pop star's!

231
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,000
[MAWARI] That kind of
logic is so messed up!

232
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,083
[GIRL A] Individualistic
girls are beautiful, too!

233
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,291
[CLASS REP] Please calm down!

234
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,750
[LUNAR] Excellent!

235
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,541
This school will
be ours once more!

236
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,208
OURS!

237
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,541
[NAGASUMI] Great!

238
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,083
Thanks to Lunar,
they're ready to go to war!

239
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,375
I don't know if there's
anything that can stop them now!

240
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,000
[SUN] What's all
this fuss about?

241
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,458
[NAGASUMI] Sun you're back!

242
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
I'm not Sun, I'm
Lunar's boyfriend!

243
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,041
Sunpachi Setojima!

244
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,583
[ALL]
Wait. You're who now?

245
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,833
Suh-- Sun.

246
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,708
Our reason
for fightin' is gone.

247
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,583
Please accept our surrender.

248
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,250
[LUNAR DUDE A] Comrade,
we'll always respect the

249
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,166
fighting passion you and
your brave army showed today.

250
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,166
Sun, why are you
dressed like that?

251
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,958
She's an individual,
like us!

252
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,875
Welcome
to our side, Sun!

253
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,291
[GOZABURO] Alright,
ya punks, time for class.

254
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,625
[SUN] Pops!

255
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,125
[GOZABURO] Sun!

256
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,041
You're a-- You're
a delinquent in drag!

257
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,500
I can't take it!

258
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,583
[STUDENTS] Oh, no!
Mr. Seto cracked!

259
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,583
[LUNAR] This bites!

260
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,833
We didn't get
to rehearse for the

261
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,250
soap opera at all, not one bit!

262
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,791
[NAGASUMI] Lunar, are you okay?

263
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,708
[LUNAR] Do I look okay?
This is all your fault!

264
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,208
[NAGASUMI] Why is it my fault?

265
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
[SUN] Now that was
a damn fine bath.

266
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,583
[NAGASUMI] You're dressed
like that even after a bath?

267
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,833
Now this is what
a man lives for:

268
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,583
an after-bath milk!

269
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, Miss Sun!

270
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,833
[LUNAR] Thanks, Sun, but
you're not really working out.

271
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,958
We'll just have
to rehearse on our own.

272
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,083
Gimme my
beard back, please!

273
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,250
But you look better
this way, Miss Sun!

274
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,458
[LUNAR] Besides...
we've got another gig

275
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,333
to prepare for that's
shooting sooner!

276
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,875
[MAKI] Parlor tricks?

277
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
Wow!
That's awesome, Lunar!

278
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,916
The annual TV special, huh?

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,250
Yeah, but it's
another project we

280
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,166
haven't had any
time to rehearse for.

281
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
Oh wait, Maki!

282
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,083
[LUNAR] We need a teensy favor,
so would you be our left hand?

283
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,333
[MAKI] Huh?

284
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,708
[LUNAR] The trick we're
doing is ventriloquism,

285
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,000
but we haven't had
time to rehearse,

286
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,583
and the taping's tomorrow!

287
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,750
[MAKI] What are you, crazy?
Why should I be your partner?

288
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,500
We've never given
a bad performance

289
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,500
before and if we give one now,
it could really hurt our career.

290
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,333
So we have to nail
this act, no matter what!

291
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,958
[MAKI] Oh, yeah?
Good luck with that.

292
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,125
[LUNAR THINKS] We should
flush this little

293
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,583
runt straight down the toilet!

294
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,083
[SUN] Maki, look,
this job is really,

295
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,291
really important for
Lunar and her career.

296
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,916
So wontcha help her out.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
Well, Miss Sun...

298
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,041
[MAKI] If that's what ya want,
then okay, I'll do it then.

299
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,791
[LUNAR] Woo hoo!
Maki's gonna help us!

300
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,583
Alright, let's start rehearsing!

301
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
[MOM] Nagasumi!

302
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,541
Come have breakfast
before it gets cold!

303
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,041
[NAGASUMI] Coming.

304
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,333
[LUNAR] Good morning!

305
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,666
[NAGASUMI]
Good 'Morning, Lunar--

306
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,750
[NAGASUMI] Wait. Is that--?

307
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,708
[MAKI] Hi... I'm Little Lunar.
Good morning!

308
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,291
Oh...
Ventriloquism, huh?

309
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,000
So I guess
your gig as Lunar's

310
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,458
boyfriend is over now, huh, Sun?

311
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,458
[SUN] Yes, ma'am.

312
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,041
Unfortunately I
wasn't much help.

313
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,500
I guess I'll just have to try a
whole lot harder next time.

314
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,666
Well, if you
ask me, Sun,

315
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,250
you tried plenty hard this time.

316
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,125
Wow... So Maki's
actually inside there?

317
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,208
That's amazing!

318
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,375
[LUNAR] We fastened her to us,

319
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,333
so she shouldn't
come off too easily.

320
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,500
We're gonna
practice at school

321
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,458
before this afternoon's taping.

322
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,541
Nice to meet
ya, Little Lunar.

323
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,083
[MAKI] Nice to
meet you, Ms. Sun.

324
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
She's so adorable!

325
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,666
[MAKI] And you're so beautiful!

326
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,833
That's so sweet!

327
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,958
Not to mention
extremely impressive!

328
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,875
You sound like
a real ventriloquist!

329
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,208
Just one thing,
Little Lunar...

330
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,291
Take care not to get
found out at school, 'kay?

331
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,583
[MAKI] Shut up, sea louse.

332
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,833
Or I'll slit
your throat. Got it?

333
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,875
[NAGASUMI] Yeah.

334
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,750
[school bells chime]

335
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,583
[MAKI] Hello, there!
I'm Little Lunar!

336
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,500
That's awesome!

337
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,125
That's the best ventriloquism
I've ever seen!

338
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,000
[MAKI] I hope
we'll all be friends!

339
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,000
[CHIMP] Whoa, it talked
while Lunar was whistling!

340
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,208
[MAWARI] How are you doing that?

341
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,791
Hey there, Little Lunar?

342
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,583
The whole class wants to talk
to you, so don't clam up now.

343
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,666
[MAKI] I ain't their toy!
Get lost, ya lousy punks!

344
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,083
[LUNAR] You can't
say stuff like that!

345
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,708
We're supposed to charm them,
not tell them off!

346
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,875
You got that!

347
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
[MAKI] Yeah fine, whatever!

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,166
Little Lunar...

349
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,791
What are some
of your favorite things?

350
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,125
For one...
Miss Sun Seto!

351
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,583
[MAKI] Whether we're
chatting or playing

352
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,625
or taking a bath together,
she's always fun

353
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,083
no matter what we're doing!

354
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,875
Aw, thank you,
Little Lunar.

355
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,375
So you really
do like Sun,

356
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,625
no matter what
you say, huh, Lunar?

357
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,750
[LUNAR] Don't answer
as if you're you!

358
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
They'll misunderstand things!

359
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,041
[MAKI] You know what, Lunar?

360
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,291
There's something about you
that I don't understand at all.

361
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,166
[LUNAR] Yeah?

362
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,583
And what's that, Little Lunar?

363
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,250
[MAKI] Why do you call
these people "pigs"

364
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,666
and "idiots" and
"morons" at home,

365
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,083
but at school,
you act like you're friends?

366
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,291
[MAKI] It's almost like you've
got a dual personality or--

367
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,375
[LUNAR] That's it!
Not another word out of you!

368
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,416
[MAKI] The truth
hurts, don't it?

369
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,375
[LUNAR] Shut the
hell up or you're

370
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,083
going to ruin my image!

371
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,833
[MAKI] I wouldn't worry
too much about that!

372
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,750
You already do that evil laugh
of yours at school all the time!

373
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,291
I'm sure they already
know what an ass you are!

374
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,750
[MAWARI] Whoa! She's fighting
with her own left arm!

375
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,166
[KAI] She's really talented!

376
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,708
[SUN] Alright, you two.

377
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,208
[MAKI] Miss Sun.

378
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,791
Knock that off.

379
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,291
Little Lunar, you're supposed to
be helpin', not startin' fights.

380
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,500
Right?

381
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,750
[MAKI] If that's what
you want, Miss Sun.

382
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,666
And you... You need
to be nicer, Lunar.

383
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,250
[LUNAR] Alright, fine.
I'm sorry, 'kay?

384
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,500
Oh...

385
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,333
So this is like a play,
and Sun's in it, too?

386
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,333
[MAWARI] Bravo! Encore!

387
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,583
Well, Maki...
Guess yer secret's safe.

388
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,666
[AKENO] So that is Maki.

389
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,666
[AKENO] And after
I warned her not

390
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,375
to do anything that could
potentially reveal herself.

391
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,041
Akeno?

392
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,416
It appears
I need to have

393
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,916
another talk with Lunar Edomae.
How utterly vexing.

394
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,166
[AKENO] You're going on TV
with Maki inside that puppet?

395
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,875
[MAKI] Well, to be
honest with ya, miss.

396
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
I don't wanna do it,
but Miss Sun asked me to.

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,208
It'll be okay as long
as nobody sees her.

398
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,458
Am I right?

399
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,166
You're wrong.
We can't take any chance of her

400
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,791
possibly being
revealed, you dunce!

401
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,416
[AKENO] You're not doing this.

402
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,916
[LUNAR] Yes, we are!

403
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,875
We don't care if this is
a cheeseball TV special!

404
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,416
We have to win,
and we can't do it

405
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,125
without Maki's help because
we don't know ventriloquism!

406
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,541
That's your own fault!

407
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
If you'd bothered to practice,
you wouldn't need her!

408
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,625
We're not losing this!

409
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
Fine, be stubborn.

410
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,416
But it won't help you.

411
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,750
I'll just prevent you from
getting to the taping.

412
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,208
I'd like to see you try!

413
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,458
Don't you
worry, you will!

414
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,375
Hello, Kamata?

415
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,541
We need you to come
pick us up early today.

416
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,041
Yeah...
After third period.

417
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
[LUNAR THINKS] We will
not let you get in our way,

418
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,500
Akeno Shiranui!

419
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,291
[GOZABURO] Alright,
punks, here we go.

420
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,458
In "The Bride of Seto"...

421
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,208
[KAI THINKS] What's goin'
on over there?

422
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,250
The tension's so
thick between those two,

423
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,125
ya could cut it with a knife.

424
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,458
[school bells chime]

425
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,166
[SUN] Lunar?

426
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,250
[LUNAR] What is it, Sun?

427
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,000
Look, if we turn
Akeno against us,

428
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,833
she's gonna send
us back to Seto.

429
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,458
And we'll never be able to
set foot on land ever again.

430
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,708
[SUN] Is this ventriloquism
thing really worth it?

431
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,041
Can't ya just give up?

432
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,583
[crazy laughter]

433
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,041
We can't "give up"?

434
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,583
"Those are the two words we
hate most in this world!"

435
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
[LUNAR] We're doing
the ventriloquist act!

436
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
And we're still gonna
stay here on land, too!

437
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,875
But Lunar...

438
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,083
[LUNAR THINKS]
And as for you, Akeno...

439
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,833
Go ahead! Just try and stop me!

440
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,416
[AKENO] I won't let
you do this, Lunar.

441
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,458
So you're all here? Good.

442
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,083
[BURIO] You called!

443
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:50,791
[AJITARO] We came!

444
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,125
[MAGURO] And we're here!

445
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,166
[AKENO] What are you doing
under there, Kai Mikawa?

446
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,666
[KAI] It's strangely relaxin'.

447
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,083
Anyway, why'd ya
call us here and

448
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,333
more importantly, what do ya
want with us, Akeno?

449
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,125
[AKENO] If you recall,
the only reason you four didn't

450
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,958
get one-way tickets
back home to Seto

451
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,875
is because I granted
you amnesty.

452
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,458
so you will cooperate.

453
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,833
[KAI] Hmph, that again?

454
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,250
So if we don't obey,
ya cast us back to the sea?

455
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,333
[AKENO] Right.

456
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,666
[BURIO] Wow, Miss Akeno,
you don't beat

457
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,583
around the bush, do you, gyo?

458
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,875
[MAGURO] So, what is
it you want us to do, gyo?

459
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,750
[MASA] And that's a
percentage of the total amount.

460
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,500
Let me give you a
more practical example.

461
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,208
Say you make twenty
grand one week,

462
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,666
but you've got to
pay the local boss

463
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,625
thirty percent
of that out of respect.

464
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,125
That leaves you
