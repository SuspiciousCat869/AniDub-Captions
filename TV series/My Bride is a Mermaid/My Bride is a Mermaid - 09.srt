00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,916
[SUN (YOUNG)]
Maybe it's my fault.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,875
I must not be good
at talkin' ta people.

159
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,166
I mean, I have
this friend Lunar,

160
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,791
and I always seem
ta be sayin' stuff

161
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,375
that sets her off,
but I never know why.

162
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,666
I think you're
actually pretty lucky

163
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
that you've got friends
you can fight with.

164
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,291
How can fighting
make me lucky?

165
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,666
[KAI (YOUNG)] Everyone
who talks ta me only cares

166
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,750
about money and power,
so they jus' suck up ta me.

167
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,166
Grown-ups and kids fall all over

168
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
themselves tryin' ta
get on my good side.

169
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,708
[SUN (YOUNG)] Really?
I don't care much about

170
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,583
money or power, and I
don't know how to suck up.

171
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,333
Sometimes people
call me an airhead though.

172
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,416
I'm sick of it.

173
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,541
Well I think you're probably
fine just the way you are.

174
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,041
[SUN (YOUNG)] That was
a really nice thing ta say!

175
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,708
Oh, well, bein' nice
to the ladies at all

176
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,375
times is kinda this important
rule that my family has.

177
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,625
[SUN (YOUNG)] You're
going ta be nice ta me?

178
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,958
Okay, then why don't
you and I play house?

179
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,916
You can be the family boss,

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,333
Kai, and I'll be
the footsoldier.

181
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,416
Um, Sun, that's
an odd kind of family.

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,666
This'll be the front
door right here, okay?

183
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,541
Okay, sure.
That's the front door.

184
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,666
[Sun mimics a door creaking]

185
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,208
Boss we've got
a really big problem!

186
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,083
Someone from a rival
gang's shot Masa.

187
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,416
And Fujishiro's taken matters
into his own hands and gone to

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,916
stage a raid on the Naruto gang!

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,291
Should we send Nakajima
to bring him back

190
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,375
or should we storm in
with reinforcements?

191
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,750
I guess the way
I play house is

192
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,708
kinda different from the way
other people do it, huh?

193
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,083
[KAI (YOUNG)] Yeah, why don't
we try a more normal version?

194
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,791
Yeah, then I'll
be the mom 'kay?

195
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,250
And I'll be the
submarine, okay?

196
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,583
Yeah, submarines
are really nice.

197
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,916
All dark, cozy.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,916
[SUN (YOUNG)] Uh, yeah,
submarines are real cool.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,625
I-I can give it a try, I guess.

200
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,625
[KAI (YOUNG)]
Oh look, it's home port!

201
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,625
Aoogah!
Woosh! I'm back!

202
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
[SUN (YOUNG)]
Welcome home, dear.

203
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,791
Would you like to refuel?
Do you need some repairs?

204
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,500
Those were the most enjoyable
hours of my whole life.

205
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,500
[NAGASUMI] That's
what it means to have

206
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,875
someone understand your soul?

207
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,416
[KAI] If ya don't
open up to folks,

208
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,791
they'll never show you
who they really are either.

209
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,416
That's the lesson that I
learned from Sun that day.

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,166
So he's had it bad
for Sun. Poor boy.

211
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,541
If that's the case,
maybe we need to

212
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,708
teach him what a
truly cute girl is like.

213
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,458
[LUNAR] You're the eldest
son of the Mikawa family?

214
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,666
I'm so very honored
to meet you, sir!

215
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
And you're a pop singer.

216
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,625
You are famous,
and I will admit that

217
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,166
you're certainly a
beautiful young lady,

218
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,833
but I'm afraid that you're
nothing compared to Sun.

219
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,791
[LUNAR] Wh-What?

220
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,791
[LUNAR] No, this can't be!
How could a celebrity like us

221
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,916
lose to someone
as ordinary as Sun?

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,416
[LUNAR] We can't accept this!
It's time for a rematch, Sun.

223
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,541
We'll show you who's cuter!

224
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,291
We can out cute you
any day of the week!

225
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,250
[MAWARI] Stop it, you two.
No fighting!

226
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,583
[SHARK] I can snack now?

227
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,458
[MAWARI] I told you not
to joke around like that!

228
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,541
[KAI] Nagasumi Michishio,
of course I can

229
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,375
understand why
you're drawn to Sun.

230
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,750
[NAGASUMI] Oh yeah?

231
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,166
[KAI] She's not only pretty,
but charming and kind.

232
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,833
She'll be patient and sweet even

233
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,750
with a real shy kid
like I used ta be.

234
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,500
A girl like Sun is
more precious than

235
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,791
the biggest, most beautiful
pearl in the world.

236
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,125
[KAI] She's a true miracle
from underneath the sea.

237
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,083
[KAI] Do ya really think
she'll be happier with you?

238
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Money, power, and looks?

239
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,208
He totally beats me.

240
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm too young to be faced
with such a harsh reality.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,833
[KAI] If you really do
want what's best for Sun,

242
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,333
don't you think
you should back off?

243
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,625
Is it money ya want?
Huh? How much?

244
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,791
Name your price.

245
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,333
How much cash will
it take for a weakling

246
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,333
like you to be willing
to give up Sun to me?

247
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,791
[NAGASUMI] You're serious!
That just made up my mind!

248
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,541
No way am I ever handing Sun

249
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,500
over to an obnoxious
jerk like you!

250
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,041
[KAI] Then I'm afraid
I have no choice but

251
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,625
ta cut ya into pieces,
Nagasumi Michishio!

252
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,958
Kai Mikawa!

253
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,625
[KAI] Pitiful human!

254
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,333
You'll never beat
a merman like me!

255
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,916
Huh? The sky?

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
[KAI] The outdoors!

257
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,166
It's bright and
wide open with no walls!

258
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,958
[KAI] Help me! scary!

259
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,416
[KAI] It happened
when I was six.

260
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,833
I went along with my grandpa
on a job that he had,

261
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,833
and I got lost in
the Sahara Desert!

262
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,500
I've been scared of bright,
wide-open places ever since.

263
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,958
That's why I hid from the world.

264
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,625
I like dark, confined places
with walls to protect me!

265
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,666
Well, I guess that explains
the submarines, then.

266
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,291
[KAI] Please somebody help me!
I'll pay whatever you want.

267
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,958
Anything!
Just help me!

268
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,833
[SUN] Now hold
on a minute.

269
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,125
[NAGASUMI] Yes, Sun?

270
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,416
The Kai I knew four
years ago hated people

271
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,708
who swarmed around
money and power

272
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,250
just to make themselves
seem important.

273
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,041
But now here
ya are, throwin' money

274
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,333
at every problem ya come across.

275
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,583
[SUN] You're the one
who's become obsessed

276
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,083
with money and power now, Kai.

277
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,000
How could you?

278
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,916
[SUN] If ya need help,
ya can call on me

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,708
anytime, but without the money.

280
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,416
Sun, my love.

281
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,708
[KAI] Thank you, Sun.
You've taught me yet

282
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,416
another valuable lesson today.

283
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,875
I'll return once I've changed.

284
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,041
[KAI] As for you,
Nagasumi Michishio.

285
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,833
We'll table our fight
until next we meet.

286
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,000
[NAGASUMI] And so,
with mixed emotions,

287
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,625
we watched Kai Mikawa
disappear beneath the gym floor.

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,208
Okay class, we've got yet

289
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,125
another new
transfer student today.

290
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,000
[GOZABURO]
His name is Kai Mikawa.

291
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,375
I decided I'd do my
learnin' at this school.

292
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,375
I'm lookin' forward
to workin' with all of ya'.

293
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,208
[NAGASUMI]
Hey, you didn't leave!

294
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,375
[CLASS REP]
All right, we need to start

295
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,291
dividing up duties
for next week's field day.

296
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,625
Everyone should decide what

297
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,750
events they
want to participate--

298
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
[GIRL 2] I want to do the
three-legged race with you.

299
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,333
[CLASS REP] Everyone!
Please listen for a second!

300
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,666
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
This guy actually had the nerve

301
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,708
to say he'd make
Sun happier than me.

302
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,166
He's behaving himself
now, but we'll see.

303
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,375
You'll be split into the
red team and the white team.

304
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,416
Here we go!

305
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,791
A challenge, Nagasumi!

306
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,291
What? Why me?

307
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,208
[KAI] I came to this school to
settle the score with ya.

308
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
This here is the
perfect opportunity.

309
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll battle ya in the Field Day
events next week!

310
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:17,916
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

311
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,208
Ya think ya can beat me?

312
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,375
You're on.

313
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,208
I'll pound you into
the ground, Mikawa.

314
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,541
[CLASS REP] Repeat after me:
I hereby swear to follow a

315
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,625
spirit of sportsmanship and
engage only in fair--

316
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,833
[SARU] Et cetera, the end.

317
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,000
The fight's on now. Prepare
to lose to me, Nagasumi!

318
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,625
Hah! We'll see
about that, Mikawa!

319
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,833
[CLASS REP] The first
event of the morning is

320
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,208
the girls' hundred meter race.

321
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,750
Girls are you ready?

322
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,666
[CLASS REP] Why do have to
wear such a ridiculous outfit?

323
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:45,791
You can do it, Sun. Go!

324
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,708
[GOZABURO] Yeah, go!

325
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,166
[GOZABURO] You can
win this thing Sun!

326
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,458
Anyone who dares
to run in front of you--

327
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,875
[MASA] Boss, please calm down.

328
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,541
Remember, you can't act
like this during school hours.

329
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,500
Dad, stop it.
Please sit down.

330
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,875
A homeroom teacher shouldn't
show such blatant favoritism.

331
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,958
Start acting
like a proper teacher!

332
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,166
We're restarting. Go.

333
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
[SUN] Whew!

334
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,375
[CLASS REP]
And next up we have the

335
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,375
boys' two hundred meter race.

336
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,458
All right, now it's my turn.

337
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,541
Mikawa's going
to be running the

338
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,916
two hundred meter
for the white team.

339
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,958
And yet I don't see the
obnoxious jerk anywhere.

340
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,041
Maybe he's forfeiting it, huh?

341
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,375
[KAI] Sorry ta keep
ya waitin' Nagasumi.

342
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,875
Wh-What the...

343
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,208
[KAI] I found a solution.

344
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,750
By hermetically sealing
myself in this spacesuit,

345
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,708
I can conquer my fear of bright,
wide open, outside spaces.

346
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,000
It's one small step for mankind,
but one giant leap for me.

347
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,458
[SARU] Mikawa would
go this far for a fight?

348
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,041
He must be really serious then.

349
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
Too bad he's not
in outer space, though.

350
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,000
[KAI] Hey, I'm gonna run in this
lane instead of you. Move.

351
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,666
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I didn't expect him to

352
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,041
go this far for Sun.

353
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,208
[SHARK] Runners on your mark?

354
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I can't lose this fight.

355
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,833
[SHARK] Get set?

356
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I'm gonna
beat this guy if it kills me.

357
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,541
[KAI] Hey! Wait!
Wait for me!

358
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,458
Wow, Good job, Nagasumi.

359
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,458
Oh, hey, it was
nothing, Sun.

360
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
[Kai breathing heavy]

361
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,666
You gonna be okay?

362
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,208
I don't think the
spacesuit's working.

363
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,750
[KAI] I just didn't warm
up enough before I ran.

364
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,375
I'm sure. What was
the bet we made again?

365
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,625
The loser can't go
after Sun anymore?

366
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,875
[KAI] No, that wasn't it,
it was the losin' team!

367
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,250
The one on the losin'
team has to stand down.

368
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,708
You dirty cheater.

369
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,250
[LUNAR] Okay everybody,
next is the scavenger hunt race.

370
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,250
Are you ready?

371
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,750
[LUNA DUDES] Lunar! Lunar!

372
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,916
[CLASS REP] I'm just
not cut out for this.

373
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,125
[NAGASUMI] Cute girl?

374
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,083
[KAI] Cute guy?

375
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,125
There can only
be one cute

376
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,333
girl for me, and that's Sun!

377
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,791
Nagasumi.

378
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,208
[Lunar laughs]

379
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,375
We suppose we must do
this for the sake of victory.

380
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,750
We'll allow you to take
us with you, Nagasumi!

381
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,750
[NAGASUMI] No!

382
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,958
Hey Lunar,
Nagasumi was

383
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,333
going to pick me
as his cute girl.

384
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,416
Silly Sun. We are
a professional celebrity.

385
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,208
Obviously, cute girl
can only mean us.

386
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,750
Whatever anybody'll
do at this point!

387
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,375
Somebody come
be my cute girl, quick!

388
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,708
[MAWARI] Oh all right,
I guess I'll be the cute girl.

389
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,125
But that doesn't mean I'm yours.

390
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,375
[CLASS REP] I'm the class rep,
so if anyone'll do, maybe I--

391
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,791
[KAI] Huh?
What is this?

392
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,875
I won the race,
and yet I'm cryin'

393
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,083
a river of jealous tears.

394
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,708
[MASA] Young master Mikawa.

395
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
A man can only
shed his tears at

396
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,208
the death of a parent
or when he's shamed.

397
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,875
[KAI] Maybe I was
right to choose

398
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,208
him as my cute guy.

399
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,708
He seems to be very wise.

400
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,250
[ANNOUNCER] Next is
the cheering competition.

401
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,791
[VOICES] Be aggressive.
B-E aggressive!

402
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,083
Why you little brat!

403
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,541
What makes you think
you have the right to toss

404
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,958
a baton in a little skirt and
steal all our attention?

405
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,916
[SUN] Lunar, let me go.
I can't dance this way, ya see.

406
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,458
How're we gonna win
the cheering competition?

407
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,708
--[LUNAR DUDES] Hail Lunar!
--[SUN DUDES] Sun's our light!

408
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,125
[ANNOUNCER] Next will
be team white's entry

409
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,708
in the cheering competition.

410
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,833
[MAWARI] Yea! Yea! Woo-hoo!

411
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,125
[CLASS REP]
What's with these jerks.

412
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,833
Yeah, I know that
maybe I don't stand out

413
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,416
in a crowd even though
I'm the class rep.

414
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
But still, you'd think at least
one of them would know my name.

415
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,250
[SARU] You've got some
pent up aggression, huh?

416
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,750
[ANNOUNCER] This
concludes our morning events.

417
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,750
It's now time for lunch break.

418
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,791
[NAGASUMI] Wow!

419
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,250
Did you really
make all this, Sun?

420
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,541
[SUN] Uh-huh.
I worked really hard on it.

421
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,625
[Lunar laughs mockingly]

422
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,208
[LUNAR] Try this too.

423
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
This is the lunch that we made.
You may have a bite, servant.

424
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,166
It's tasty.

425
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,541
[NAGASUMI] Whoa!

426
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,500
I don't think that lunch
should look like modern art.

427
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,833
I taught Lunar
how to make a very

428
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,708
special lunch just
for you Nagasumi,

429
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,750
and I expect
you to eat all of it.

430
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,500
[NAGASUMI] Right!
Thanks for the food!

431
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,958
[MOM] Oh, and, Masa...

432
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,083
I um. I made this
lunch just for you.

433
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,833
[MASA] It does looks delicious,
and I do appreciate it.

434
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,375
But I must decline.

435
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,625
[MOM THINKS]
Oh, I know it's wrong,

436
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,166
but the more he pushes
away what I'm offering,

437
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,833
the more I want him to take it.

438
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,958
[DAD'S BOSS]
Where's that report?

439
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,625
If you've got time to eat,
you've got time to work.

440
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,041
Right away, sir, sorry.

441
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,458
[BUTLER]
Here you are, master Kai.

442
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,208
Your lunch buffet is prepared.

443
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,583
[KAI THINKS] I feel an emptiness
that no food can satisfy.

444
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,125
None but the food
prepared by beautiful Sun.

445
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,791
Nagasumi I could
kill you for that lunch.

446
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,125
[KAI THINKS] Money can't
be everything to me.

447
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,458
What I really need is
a friend or someone to--

448
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,833
[KAI] Do you, need
somethin' to eat, kid?

449
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,125
[KAI THINKS] I guess there's
always someone worse off.

450
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,416
[KAI] Eat!

451
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,875
[ANNOUNCER ] The first
event of the afternoon

452
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,833
is the mock cavalry battle.

453
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,541
Kai Mikawa!

454
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,291
[KAI] Nagasumi Michishio!

455
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,833
[NAGASUMI] Hey,
what's with the spear?

456
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,500
We're supposed to steal each
other's' headbands, that's all!

457
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,166
[KAI] Shut up! Take this!

458
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,375
I'm dead!

459
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,375
[KAI] You collapsed.
What kinda horse are you?

460
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,250
Hey, if you weren't
