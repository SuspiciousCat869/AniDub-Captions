money and his power.

157
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,125
[REN] I see.

158
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,875
[CHIMP] I got sick and tired of
both him and his dirty money.

159
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,208
So I quit following
him and joined up

160
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,458
with the powerful
Shot-Caller's group.

161
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,791
[REN] The Shot-Caller?
Who's that?

162
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,083
You don't know?
Who else?

163
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,000
The Vexingly Sexy
Akeno Shiranui.

164
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,666
she's the hottest thing
in school right now!

165
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,916
And speaking of
hot and sexy ladies,

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,875
you're looking pretty smokin'!

167
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,958
[REN] She's the school's
Shot-Caller, eh?

168
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,291
[GOZABURO THINKS]
Shot-Caller, my ass!

169
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,125
That Mermaid Exam's
just a crock!

170
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,541
You're trying to seize power!

171
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,625
Well, missy, I'll show
ya that the Seto's

172
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,583
are the strongest
things around here!

173
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,583
A Mermaid Exam
by sea officials, huh?

174
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,125
Wow, I never
imagined there was so

175
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,791
much red tape in
the mermaid world, Sun.

176
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,666
Nagasumi, ya
really shouldn't say

177
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,708
stuff like that out loud,

178
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,000
considering who
might be listening.

179
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,666
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll be more careful.

180
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,791
That goes for you, too.

181
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,458
Don't spill any more
water on yourself.

182
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,125
Why'd ya say that?
Do ya think I'm an airhead?

183
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,500
[NAGASUMI] I just meant
for you to be careful!

184
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,833
[NARRATOR] Actually,
he said it because

185
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,250
Sun is indeed an airhead.

186
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,833
[VOICES] She is!

187
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,166
[MAWARI] Akeno!

188
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,625
You've got no
other place else to run.

189
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,708
So give it up.

190
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,875
You're quite stubborn...
Discipline Girl.

191
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,750
You got away last time,
but that's not gonna happen

192
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,416
now that I've got you cornered!

193
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
You didn't have to corner her;
she's in our class.

194
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,083
You...! Your luck ran
out when you got put in

195
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,875
the same class
as Mawari Zenigata,

00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,500
daughter of the

Vexingly Sexy Shot-Caller!

198
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,791
[AKENO] Why?
You're just his daughter.

199
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,000
[GIRL A] Don't insult Mawari!

200
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,125
[GIRL B] Yeah, boobzilla!

201
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,958
[GIRL C] Stop your sexy flexing!

202
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,166
[AKENO] I thought
it was "Vexingly Sexy."

203
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,791
[NARRATOR] It is,
and Akeno's arrival has

204
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,416
destroyed all peace
within the school.

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,083
[MAWARI] As head of the
Disciplinary Committee

206
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,750
of this school,
I cannot tolerate your

207
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,166
criminal activities on
campus any longer, Akeno!

208
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,208
Cease all Vexingly

activities
immediately!

210
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,750
Oh wow, this thing is really
starting to get serious.

211
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,125
It's like gangsters
versus a crime squad,

212
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,250
and when things like this
happen, people go to jail!

213
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,916
It'll be fine, Sun,
just calm down!

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,416
This has been a
big misunderstanding.

215
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,916
First of all, I am not the
Vexingly Sexy Shot-Caller.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,833
Ms. Akeno is the
Vexingly Sexy Shot-Caller,

217
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,833
and the Vexingly Sexy
Shot-Caller is the toughest

218
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,833
and hottest girl at
Isono Junior High School!

219
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,375
[AKENO] Shut up, you morons!

220
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,541
What a surprise!
The boys side with the

221
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,625
girl with the big boobs!

222
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,750
How dare they,
those dirty-minded bums!

223
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,833
Why do boys always have
to be such sleazebags?

224
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:20,916
[BURIO] Can it, you runts!

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,541
I told you to stop
calling me a runt!

226
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,875
[BURIO] But that's what you are!

227
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,958
Shut up! Like I said,
cease and desist at once.

228
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,666
But if you don't, Akeno.

229
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,625
Then what, Mawari?

230
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,666

rules of this society!

That's right! It is the worst!

For the sake
of school discipline,

00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,375
we have to do something

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,208
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

310
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,333
Well... don't ya think
that maybe we're jumping

311
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,125
the gun a little here
by judging Akeno,

312
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,500
when we still don't even
know her all that well yet?

313
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:15,958
[GIRL A] Hmm...

314
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,041
[GIRL B] Maybe Sun's right!

315
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,666
[GIRL C] Yeah,
but boys still suck!

316
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
[GIRLS] Right! Boys still suck!

317
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,291
Well, I got no real
opinion on that, but...

318
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,958
Mawari?

319
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,708
You're right, Sun.
I did jump the gun again

320
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,458
for like the bazillionth time.

321
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,375
Then I guess...

322
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,708
No one has a reason
to fight now, right?

323
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,791
'Spose not.

324
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,125
[GIRLS] Of course we do!

325
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,125
Akeno's with the boys,
and boys suck!

326
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,625
[SUN] Any reason'll do, huh?

327
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,708
But why does everyone
still want to fight?

328
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,291
[NARRATOR]
Any old reason will do,

329
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,583
but these young ladies obviously
have something against Akeno.

330
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,791
[MAWARI THINKS]
I did the same thing when

331
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,375
Sun first transferred here.

332
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,333
I was suspicious of her, too,
before I ever got to know her.

333
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,291
That isn't right of me.

334
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,625
[girls continue to chant]

335
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,958
[GOZABURO] Well?
What's the situation?

336
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
[SHARK] She's very
popular with the boys?

337
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,541
And they're really buying
her merchandise?

338
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,791
[GOZABURO] What about the girls?

339
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,041
[MASA] A few words from Miss Sun

340
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,625
seem to have
swayed their opinion.

341
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,500
The situation's
in a state of flux.

342
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,750
[GOZABURO]
Then we gotta un-flux it!

343
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,916
[MASA] Huh?

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
[GOZABURO] That's
girl's gotta be squelched

345
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,916
before the day's over!
Take care of it!

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,125
She's just a kid, Boss, so I
don't feel too good about this.

347
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,958
[GOZABURO] I don't care
how ya feel about it Masa!

348
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,041
Just do your freakin'
job already, would ya?

349
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,375
[REN] What the hell?

350
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,625
What're ya up to back there?
Nothing good, I bet!

351
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,000
No, sweetie!

352
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,791
We were just back
here talkin' about, uh,

353
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,625
the student guidance
sessions that are comin' up!

354
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,500
Isn't that right?

355
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,291
Right!

356
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,666
We were discussing what

357
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,250
to say to the new
transfer student.

358
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,291
The new girl?

359
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,750
The one with the
bountiful cleavage?

360
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,666
[GOZABURO] Those things
are like missiles, aren't they?

361
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
[MASA] They've certainly
grabbed the boys' attention.

362
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,250
[SHARK] I'd like to
sink my teeth into her?

363
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,583
[GOZABURO]
So would I, but that would

364
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,416
earn me an express ride
to the slammer, ha ha ha!

365
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,625
You'll get an
express ride to

366
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,583
the grave if I hear
ya talk like that again!

367
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,333
[GOZABURO] I meant
"if I was her age and single!"

368
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,125
[SHARK] It didn't
sound that way to me?

369
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,166
[MASA] Hence Ms. Ren's response.

370
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,958
[MAWARI] Excuse me...

371
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,875
[REN] Oh, Ms. Zenigata.

372
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,000
[GOZABURO] Crap!

373
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,375
The Superintendent
General's daughter!

374
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,958
I'm sorry. I can come
back if this is a bad time.

375
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,750
[GOZABURO] No, no, not all!

376
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,083
Now's the perfect time
for ya talk with Ms. Ren!

377
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,333
Wouldn't ya say so, Masa?

378
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,041
[MASA] Yes!

379
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,625
[REN] Oh, For the love of...

380
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,250
[REN] So... what's wrong?
Ya worried about something?

381
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
[REN] The school's Shot-Caller?

382
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,416
Yes.

383
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,541
There's absolutely
nothing for ya to worry about.

384
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
Me and some of
the other teachers here

385
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,125
have dealt with gangs before,

386
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,833
so we know how
to put the screws to--

387
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,958
Um, I mean, we know
how to handle them!

388
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,625
[MAWARI]
No, that's not it.

389
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,291
I'm a member of the
Disciplinary Committee,

390
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,875
and should know
better, but I almost

391
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,291
instigated half the
school to attack Akeno.

392
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,875
[REN] Even so,
being a sea official,

393
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,333
Akeno could have
taken them all on and won.

394
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,583
The thing is...

395
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,958
I never gave Akeno
the benefit of the doubt.

396
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,833
I don't know her but
I assumed the worst because

397
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,333
there was something about
her that made me suspicious.

398
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,500
[REN THINKS] I wonder if
it's the police blood

399
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,916
in her that makes
her suspicious.

400
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,291
[MAWARI]
And for that...

401
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,333
I hate myself. And I'm
sure she hates me, too!

402
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,041
[REN] It's okay...

403
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,625
If ya ask me,

404
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,500
you're being way too
hard on yourself, sweetie.

405
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,416
You weren't really
being suspicious.

406
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,208
You were just being cautious.

407
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,333
But still...

408
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,416
[REN] Considering your family's

409
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,166
line of work,
I can't say I blame ya.

410
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,791
But you're a good kid.

411
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,416
Gee, thanks, Ms. Ren,
but what makes you say that?

412
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,958
[REN] Well, for one,
the fact that you're

413
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,208
in here telling me about this.

414
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,333
It means ya have a conscience,

415
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,083
and it made ya do
some soul-searching.

416
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,958
Ya realized ya
made a mistake today,

417
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
and ya owned up to it, too.

418
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,333
That's why you're good.

419
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,833
You think so?

420
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,708
Hey, let me see a smile!

421
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,791
Ya don't always
have to be so serious!

422
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,333
[REN THINKS] On the other hand,
there are certain people

423
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,916
around here who
aren't serious enough!

424
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,291
They don't do a
lick of soul-searching,

425
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,208
and unlike her,
they're no good at all!

[group laughing]

427
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,541
[NARRATOR] Children,
don't grow up to be like this.

428
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,083
Like I was saying,
we'll put the screws

429
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,000
to this Shot-Caller
gang, um, I mean,

430
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,583
we'll give them the
guidance they need,

431
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,041
so don't worry about it, okay?

432
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,875
[MAWARI]
'Kay...!

You're welcome, and ya
don't have to be so formal.

435
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,125
[CLASS REP] Mawari!

436
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,625
What is it?

Um, all the girls
are about to fight!

438

I've got quite a bit
to do this afternoon.

439
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,583
So if you insist on this,

440
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,916
you're gonna have
to make it quick.

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
Yeah! The Shot-Caller's
a busy woman,

442
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,958
so you ladies better
make it snappy!

443
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,083
[GIRL A] Why, is she too
busy with her boobs?

444
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,333
[GIRL B] She looks
down on us 'cause

445
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,583
she's got a better body!

446
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,500
[GIRL C] Let's teach
Boobzilla a lesson!

447
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,666
[AKENO] It seems
like their reason

448
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,333
for disliking me has changed.

449
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,500
[CHIMP] It looks like any
old reason'll do at this point.

450
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,666
[NARRATOR]
In this case, it's because the

451
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,500
girls are jealous
of Akeno's assets!

452
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,625
This is ridiculous.

453
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,750
I don't have time
for any more of this

454
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,041
nonsense today,
so I'm going home now.

455
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,708
[BURIO] Hold it,
Vexingly Sexy Shot-Caller!

456
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
[CHIMP] What are
you guys doing over there?

457
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,291
The Shot-Caller's over here!

458
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,833
The three of us
have decided that the

459
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,583
whole "Shot-Caller"
thing was a little passé, gyo.

460
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,166
[AKENO]
Your outfits say otherwise.

461
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,375
Someone has
to protect the girls

462
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,875
and carry out
