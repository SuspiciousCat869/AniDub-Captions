What are ya talkin' about?

159
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,041
Why? Why didn't
you tell me, my lord?

160
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,083
[KAI] What?

161
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,833
About your diagnosis
at the clinic!

162
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,875
How did ya find out?

163
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,208
[CHIMP] I'm so sorry, my lord,

164
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,916
but I sort of eavesdropped
on a doctor talking

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,083
about it outside
that clinic you went to!

166
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,375
[KAI] What?

167
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,666
How dare ya do such
a thing without my say-so?

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,291
[KAI THINKS] This is bad!

169
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,875
If people find out that
the handsome, cool, stylish,

170
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,625
and rich Kai Mikawa
has a boil on his butt...

171
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,083
[SUN] That's so disgustin'!

172
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,125
And to think, I was about to

173
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,291
reveal my true
feelings to ya, too!

174
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,875
You have to be kidding me!

175
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,333
That handsome, cool, stylish,
rich guy has a boil on his butt?

176
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,625
I guess you've
got nothing going

177
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,083
for you now, but your money?

178
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,541
A pustule on
your posterior!

179
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,916
Oh, I hope I didn't touch you!

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,833
You're a failure
to the mermaid race.

181
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,708
How vexing.

182
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,833
Hey, Kai, starting today,

183
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,833
your nickname
is "Butt!" Got that?

184
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,500
Now take this and
go buy me a soda, Butt!

185
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,541
[KAI] Listen and
listen good, Chimp!

186
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,583
Ya can't tell anyone
about my diagnosis!

187
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,333
No one can find out about it,
especially not Sun!

188
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,041
Understood?

189
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,000
[CHIMP THINKS] My lord.

190
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,583
Oh, I get it!

191
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,083
You're trying to spare Sun and
the others worry, aren't you?

192
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,083
You should
be worried about

193
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:57,958
yourself right now,

194
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,458
but you're worried about them!

195
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,333
What a great and selfless
man you are, my lord!

196
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,875
Understood!

197
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,083
You have my word,
man-to-man, my lord!

198
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,541
Oh, Chimp! What a
great bosom buddy you are!

199
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,583
Hey, try not to get too much
snot on my space suit, 'kay?

200
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,916
[VOICES] The next day!

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,375
My lord!

202
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,375
Yakisoba bread and a fried
mincemeat sandwich for you!

203
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,375
Oh...
Um, thank you.

204
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,208
It looks like you really
went all out, Chimp.

205
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,250
Nonsense!
A drink, my lord?

206
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,875
You, uh, thought
of everything.

207
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,041
Is there anything else
I can do for you, my lord?

208
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,583
No, I don't think so.

209
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,583
Hey! You two girls yapping
by the window over there!

210
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,125
You know my lord
can't stand brightness,

211
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,041
so hurry and shut the
curtains already, would ya?

212
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,833
A "please" would
be nice, you creep!

213
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,041
Besides, Chimp,
the weather's so nice today.

214
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,125
You! Nagasumi!
Quit spacing out!

215
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,458
Make yourself useful
and start reducing

216
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,916
the brightness
in here, chop chop?

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If you want the curtains shut
so bad, do it yourself!

218
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,208
Yeah, if the
brightness is that

219
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,708
much of a problem,
it's not gonna kill you

220
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,250
to put on your
space suit, Kai.

221
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,000
You need to put
up or shut up, Kai.

222
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,750
Otherwise, you can
just drop dead.

223
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,125
Take that back!

224
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,166
You're going to regret
talking to my lord that way!

225
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,416
Be nice to him!

226
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,041
Why should we...
and what are you babbling about?

227
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,333
Ya know, Chimp, you're
acting really weird today.

228
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,583
What's got ya upset?

229
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,833
Chimp, it's okay.

230
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,166
There's no reason for ya
to get so worked up--

231
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,708
[CHIMP]
Please do shut up, my lord!

232
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,916
[CHIMP THINKS]
I promised not to tell anyone

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,791
about my lord's illness,
but they'll keep

234
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
treating him like this unless...

235
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,791
[CHIMP]
Nagasumi, c'mere a second!

236
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,708
[NAGASUMI]
Hey, what's with you today?

237
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,708
[CHIMP] Whisper, whisper.

238
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,125
[NAGASUMI] What? Are you sure?

239
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,750
[CHIMP] Yeah... He told
me to keep it a secret,

240
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,875
but I don't know
much time he has left.

241
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
His illness...
It's incurable?

242
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,000
Sadly...

243
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,416
That's why I'm
trying to make sure

244
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,625
my lord is happy and comfortable
before he passes away.

245
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,625
You were trying
to help him,

246
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,000
while the rest of us--!

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,250
It's really admirable
what you're doing!

248
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,333
And I'm gonna
follow your example!

249
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,833
[NAGASUMI] Hey, Kai?

250
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,291
[NAGASUMI] Here...

251
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,625
These are for you.

252
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,166
They're candid shots
of Sun I thought you'd like.

253
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,708
Consider them a present.

254
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,416
[KAI] From you,
Nagasumi? But why?

255
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,083
Well, because...

256
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,333
Because I greatly treasure
our friendship, Kai.

257
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,583
What friendship?
We're rivals, ya idiot.

258
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,208
Hey, you're up to
somethin', aren't ya?

259
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,416
Even so, I'll take these
pictures off your hands.

260
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
[NAGASUMI] Hey, come over
to my place after school today!

261
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,000
We can hang out
a little and then enjoy

262
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,416
a home-cooked dinner from Sun!

263
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,208
Okay?

264
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,375
This is a set-up!

265
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,708
What are ya plannin'
for me, ya bastard?

266
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
Wait, now you're
fawning over him, too?

267
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,541
What the heck?

268
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,333
Shut up! If you
don't have anything

269
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,166
better to do,
then go buy Kai a soda!

270
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,333
Why should we do that?

271
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,208
[NAGASUMI] Argh!
Everybody, c'mere a sec!

272
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,625
[MAWARI] What? Why?

273
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,958
[SUN] What's goin' on?
[KAI] Hey, where's everybody--

274
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,583
Just stay put, my lord.
We'll be back in a jiffy.

275
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,666
Wait...

276
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,375
How come I'm the
one who get excluded?

277
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,750
[SUN] (sobbing) Poor Kai!

278
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,791
[CLASS REP] Oh, no! No!

279
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,416
It must be so
hard for him!

280
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,958
But even so, he's still--!

281
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,791
He's still facing the
fear of death all by himself?

282
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,041
Wow... It's enough
to make you cry.

283
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,500
It seems I
misjudged you...

284
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,916
Kai Mikawa.

285
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,458
Don't cry guys!
If we have to see my lord off,

286
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,458
then let's at least
do it... with a smile!

287
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,541
Right!

288
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,583
[GOZABURO] Like the
rest of ya, I heard about

289
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,333
what's goin' on,
so I've decided to cancel this

290
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,500
afternoon's Modern
Japanese class!

291
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,833
[GOZABURO] Instead
we're gonna hold a big

292
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,875
gatherin' in honor
of Kai Mikawa!

293
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,541
[STUDENTS] Yeah!

294
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,041
Huh? But why?

295
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,083
Here, bottoms up!
But because we're in school,

296
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,666
it's not the
hard stuff, just tea!

297
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,833
Okay...

298
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,750
[MAWARI] Take mine,
too, Kai, I insist!

299
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,208
[CLASS REP] Kai,
I just want you to know,

300
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,916
I'll never forget
you as long as I live!

301
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,791
[BOY 1] Out of all
the students in school,

302
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,708
you're the one
I look up to most, Kai!

303
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,458
[GIRL 1] Maybe we could go on
a picnic sometime real soon!

304
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,291
[REN] Kai, I'm so proud of you.
You're so brave.

305
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,458
Not just anyone
could face death like that.

306
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,375
The boss of the
Mikawa family really was

307
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,000
blessed with a wonderful
heir, wasn't he?

308
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,333
Yeah, but the
kid won't inherit

309
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
anything now
since he's dying, right?

310
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,125
[MAKI] Hey, show a little
sympathy, would ya, Fujishiro?

311
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,916
Chimp, what is this?
What's goin' on?

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,250
Why's everybody makin'
such a big fuss over me?

313
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,458
No need to worry,
my lord.

314
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,875
It's all good because,
don't you see?

315
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,375
They care about someone.

316
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,291
You! And that's
why they're doing this!

317
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,166
Out of their love for you!

318
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,125
[KAI] Out of their love?

319
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,416
[KAI] For me? Really?

320
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,791
[KAI] They're all lookin' at me.
I don't know what to say.

321
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,125
[KAI] But I... I...

322
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,083
I could get used
to being treated like this!

323
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,041
[NAGASUMI] Don't cry, Kai.

324
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,000
These next couple of days'll
be happy ones, 'kay?

325
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,500
[SUN] All ya need to do
is enjoy life to the fullest.

326
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,875
I will. I sure will.

327
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,916
[KAI] Hey, thanks for
everthin', everybody!

328
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,166
[students cheer]

329
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,541
Ya made today somethin'
really special for me!

330
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,958
Ya did!

331
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,708
Ya made it the happiest
day of my entire freakin' life!

332
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,791
[AKENO] Hey, you three!

333
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,208
[AKENO] Guard Kai and make
sure he gets home safely, okay?

334
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,791
Yes, ma'am, shot-caller!

335
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
[GIRL 1] You take care now, Kai!

336
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,250
[GIRL 2] See you tomorrow, okay?

337
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,500
[KAI] Yep! Have a
good evenin', ladies!

338
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,750
Wow! It's really him!

339
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,208
Yeah! It's Kai Mikawa!

340
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,875
That's him?
He's the sick kid?

341
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,666
Kai Mikawa!
You're my hero!

342
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,041
Can I get your autograph?

343
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,375
Look, dear!

344
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,250
It's that poor, young man
we've been praying for!

345
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,250
Bless his brave little heart!

346
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,500
[KAI THINKS]
Now this is more like it!

347
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,875
They're finally treatin'
the heir to the

348
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,416
Mikawa Conglomerate the
way I should to be treated!

349
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,625
[KAI] They realized
how handsome,

350
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,958
cool, stylish, and rich I am,

351
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,875
and are givin' me my
much-deserved due!

352
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,500
I can't remember the
last time I felt this good!

353
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,625
[ANNOUNCER]
We interrupt this broadcast

354
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,916
for this special report.

355
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,291
Kai Mikawa.

356
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,708
Friend, student, and heir to
the Mikawa Conglomerate.

357
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,333
A brave young man who's captured

358
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,833
the hearts and minds
of this community.

359
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,333
Oh!

360
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,666
The mass media's finally caught
on to how great I am, too!

361
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,750
[KAI] Whoa! Looks like
I'm on every channel!

362
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,041
It's about time. I guess
the programmin' execs

363
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,791
realized I can pull
in some huge ratin's.

364
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,375
[ANNOUNCER] Sadly
we'll never get to see Kai

365
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,208
take over the family business,
because he's been

366
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,166
stricken by
an incurable disease!

367
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,250
[KAI] Huh?

368
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,166
Until recently, no one knew that

369
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,625
Mikawa was fighting
his fatal illness all alone.

370
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,083
He kept it hidden from everyone,

371
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,833
including his
family and friends.

372
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,583
One of those people
is joining us:

373
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,125
famed pop singer Lunar,
who's also a classmate of Kai's.

374
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,458
Hello, there.

375
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,833
[ANNOUNCER] This must
be hard for you right now.

376
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,458
It is... Kai was always
the nicest guy in our class.

377
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,625
When I transferred here,
it was hard to fit in,

378
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,791
me being a big star,

379
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,875
but Kai welcomed
me with open arms.

380
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,916
[ANNOUNCER]
I can see he's been a

381
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,416
very important friend to you.

382
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,083
He is, and to find
out that your

383
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,083
best friend in the
world has a fatal illness.

384
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,916
Oh, why does fate
have to be so cruel?

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,666
All of you
watching at home...!

386
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,875
Please join me!

387
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,916
Let's all take a
stand against disease!

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,833
Please reach into
your hearts and your

389
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,500
wallets to help Kai
through this fundraiser!

390
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,166
[ANNOUNCER] You can
help Kai by purchasing a

391
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,750
"Shachihoko of Love" item,

392
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,833
such as this charity single.

393
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,166
We're pulling for you, Kai!

394
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,833
We'll never, ever
forget you, Kai!

395
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,916
You're one of a kind!

396
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,916
You're the best
friend we ever had!

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,333
Are you hearing this, Kai?

398
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,333
Everyone and I mean everyone
is cheering you on here!

399
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,875
[LUNAR] Look at this crowd!

400
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,000
I sometimes don't even get this
many people at my concerts!

401
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,958
But they all came
out for you, Kai!

402
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,291
So don't give up
even if you are dying!

403
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,750
Huh? Hold on.
Did they say I'm dyin'?

404
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
When this bank is full,

405
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,708
I'm going to use the money to

406
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,500
erect a bronze
statue of my lord.

407
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,875
[KAI] Chimp!

408
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,916
[KAI] Chimp!
Chimp! Chimp!

409
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,458
Uh... My lord!

410
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,500
[KAI] Chimp! Chimp!

411
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,083
What is it?
What's the matter, lord?

412
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,666
Is it true I've
contracted a fatal disease?

413
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,708
It's a lie, right?
Please tell me it's a lie!

414
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,250
Please don't
cry, my lord!

415
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,583
This is hard...
This is hard for me, as well!

416
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,833
But the doctor...!
He said it was all curable!

417
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,291
All I had to do was
use that medicine

418
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,083
three times a day and I'd be
better in about a week!

419
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,500
[CHIMP] But you won't, my lord!

420
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,500
Instead, you're gonna
be deceased!

421
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,625
[CHIMP] He must
have told you that

422
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,500
just to keep your spirits up!

423
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,666
[KAI] I can't believe it.
It thought it was just a boil.

424
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,333
I had no idea it was fatal.
But now that ya mention it,

425
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,041
my limbs do feel strangely heavy
and my breathin's real labored.

426
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,541
[MECHANICAL VOICE] Self-pity
levels are approaching overload.

427
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,500
[CHIMP] My poor lord.

428
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,500
[KAI] Well, my life might've
been a short one.

429
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,291
[KAI] But I've gotta admit,
I'm quite a lucky guy to have my

430
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,208
death lamented by
all those folks today.

431
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,458
My lord...

432
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,666
And ya know.

433
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,875
I've got nothin' to
regret about my life.

434
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,583
[KAI THINKS]
Hey, wait just a second.

435
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,125
Nothin' to regret?

436
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,166
Can ya honestly look at your
life and say that, Kai Mikawa?

437
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,541
[CLASS REP] Nagasumi, wait!

438
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,458
You're really going
to go through with this?

439
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,958
Please reconsider! Kai's ill!

440
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,666
[MAWARI] There's no reason
for the two of you to fight!

441
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,208
[MAWARI] He might have
challenged you, but he's dying!

442
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,500
Please just
let him spend what

443
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,041
little time he
has left with Sun!

444
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,083
Step aside, now, both of you.

445
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,625
[MAWARI] Nagasumi?

446
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,791
[NAGASUMI] I can't turn down
the last wish of a dying man.

447
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,208
That's why I'm
doing this for him.

448
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,291
But still...

449
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,500
He's dying!

450
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Fighting him doesn't
make any sense to me!

451
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,833
[AKENO] It does to me.

452
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,333
It's honorable.

453
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,333
[AKENO] Rather than
let Kai wither away,

454
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,500
you're allowing him
to go down fighting.

455
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,125
That's so sweet.

456
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,375
[LUNAR] Our good
friend Kai Mikawa

457
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,291
is standing before us all.

458
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,750
[LUNAR] No, not just us,
but the entire world!

459
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,625
[LUNAR] Why?

460
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,666
So he won't have any regrets and

461
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
know he lived
life to the fullest!

462
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,041
[GIRLS] Go, Kai!
[LUNAR] Good luck, Kai...!

463
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,333
[LUNAR] We'll never forget
how brave you were!

464
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,875
Once it's over. I'll take
care of your affairs.

465
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,833
Kai, look...

466
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,333
I'm flattered by all this,

467
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,291
but I'm already
Nagasumi's bride.

468
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,333
I thought ya'd
say something like that.

469
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,333
You're true. And faithful.

470
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,500
Those are the traits
that make me love ya.

471
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,166
[KAI] They're why I fell for ya!

472
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,583
But Kai...

473
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,000
[KAI] But nothin'.

474
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,000
Just let me do
this, Sun, please.

475
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,583
It's my last wish.

476
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,750
Hello, Kai.

477
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,541
[KAI] I'm glad ya could
make it, Nagasumi.

478
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,750
Ya know,
lookin' back, you're the

479
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,000
only one I ever
went all-out against.

480
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
[KAI] Just gimme a sec.

481
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,583
What the heck
are you doing?

482
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,166
[KAI] Behold...

483
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,208
[KAI] This...

484
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,375
This is how far
I'm prepared to go!

485
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,250
Your helmet!

486
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,208
[SUN] Kai!

487
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,541
Since this
fight'll be my last,

488
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm gonna fight ya face
to face and eye to eye!

489
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,083
So I see you're really
serious about

490
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,291
fighting for Sun's
hand, aren't you?

491
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,208
Bring it on, Kai Mikawa!

492
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,791
With pleasure,
Nagasumi Michishio!

493
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,583
[NAGASUMI'S FEMALE XO]
I can see everything!

494
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,416
Hah!
What's the matter, Kai?

495
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,416
I thought your swordsmanship
was better--

496
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,583
Wah! No fair!
Don't dodge, you stupid jerk!

497
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,583
Stay still!

498
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,791
[NAGASUMI] That's a real sword!

499
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,458
Don't swing it like
a kid throwing a fit!

500
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,416
[KAI] Shut up! Die!

501
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,166
[SUN] Nagasumi's moves sure
have gotten a lot less human.

502
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,750
[AKENO] Well, he has
had quite a few close

503
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,625
brushes with death as of late.

504
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,041
Kai, quit it!
We're all friends here!

505
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,291
Stop the violence!

506
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,958
Give peace a chance, will ya?

507
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,625
Oh, yeah, L-L-L-L-L-L-Lunar,
why don't ya

508
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,125
come say that to my face, huh?

509
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,458
[LUNAR] Give peace a chance!

510
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,000
We'll be back after
these messages!

511
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,666
Me, not the camera!

512
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,333
Dammit, why do
I have to die young,

513
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,083
while Nagasumi gets
to live a happy life

514
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,916
with Sun and probably
to a ripe, old age?

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,291
Look at you.

516
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,625
No! Don't look at me!

517
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,750
[MAWARI] The poor thing!
[KAI] Why?

518
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,708
[KAI] Why me, huh?

519
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,416
[KAI] I...
I don't want to die!

520
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,583
My lord!

521
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,958
The worst part
is that I don't

522
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,000
have any friends or anything!

523
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,958
[KAI] But you do, Nagasumi!

524
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,500
You've got it all!
It's not fair!

525
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,416
[KAI] I don't want
to die starvin' for love!

526
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,958
[KAI] Please!
Don't let me die like this!

527
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,666
[KAI] Somebody do somethin'.
I'm beggin'.

528
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,916
Come on. Love me.

529
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,916
[KAI] Someone love
me before I die!

530
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,458
[SUN] Kai...

531
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,500
[KAI] Sun?

532
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,666
[SUN] If ya ask
for love and get it,

533
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,083
then that love is cheap.

534
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,875
You're not cheap, are ya?
No, of course you're not.

535
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,833
You're Kai Mikawa, after all.

536
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,708
We're all just kids
in junior high right now.

537
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,625
So none of us really know what
a great love is like yet, but...

538
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,041
But isn't that the
reason why we cry

539
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,916
and laugh and
fight with all we've got.

540
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,791
[NAGASUMI] As we search for that
one great love of our life?

541
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,541
Nagasumi...

542
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,916
[CHIMP] My lord! I...

543
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,958
[KAI] Chimp!

544
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,125
I care for you lots and lots,
more than anything else in life!

545
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,208
And in fact, if I could trade
places with you right now...

546
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,208
[CHIMP] I'd gladly do
so and die in your place!

547
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,291
Nagasumi... Are ya cryin'?

548
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,541
No, I'm not!

549
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,583
Yeah, ya are, don't lie.

550
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,708
I am not!

551
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,791
[SUN] Kai...
What ya said earlier?

552
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,125
You're wrong.

553
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,708
Ya do have friends who
care about ya; just look!

554
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,583
She's right!

555
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,666
We love you!

556
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,666
Well, we don't know
if we'd go that far.

557
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,750
How very vexing.

558
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,791
[KAI] So I...

559
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,958
I guess I haven't been alone
all this time like I thought.

560
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,000
[NAGASUMI] Oh, no!

561
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,208
[SUN] Kai!

562
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,083
[KAI] All of you have shown me
how big your hearts could be.

563
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,291
But me?

564
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,833
All I did was show ya
how small mine was.

565
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,958
[KAI] Chimp?

566
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,791
I'm here for you,
my lord! What is it?

567
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,583
[KAI] I didn't appreciate
you. I'm sorry.

568
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,000
'Cause you were the best
friend a guy could ever have.

569
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
You honor me, my lord!

570
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,833
[KAI] Nagasumi...
Sun...

571
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,208
Have a happy life.
Been nice knowin' ya.

572
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,250
Kai, wait!

573
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,708
You can't...

574
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:02,833
Thanks.
All of you. Goodbye.

575
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,416
[SUN] Kai!

576
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,041
[NAGASUMI] No!

577
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,333
[CHIMP] My lord!

578
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,000
Mornin', everybody!

579
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,000
Where do you
get off being

580
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,416
fit as a fiddle, boilface?

581
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Right...

582
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,708
..."incurable illness,"
my ass, Butt!

583
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,458
Go buy me a soda, Butt!

584
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,625
It's not my fault
ya got the wrong idea!

585
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,041
Whatever, Butt!

586
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,583
If ya wanna fight,
I should warn ya that

587
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,291
I don't have any weaknesses--

588
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,875
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes!

589
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,750
My beautiful eyes!
Argh, it's too bright!

590
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,541
It looks like he's
totally back to normal.

591
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,833
Actually, he seems
worse than before?

592
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,375
Too bad I've lost the
will to tell him off.

593
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,291
Why's he so
vexingly stupid?

594
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,291
Well, I'm just happy.
Kai isn't really dyin'!

595
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,583
Chimp, get my
helmet back from

596
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,500
him and I'll give
ya a thousand yen!

597
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,458
[NAGASUMI] That's just low!

598
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,583
You're buying his
loyalty with money?

599
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,708
[KAI] Shut your face, poor-boy!

600
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,625
Money gets things
done in this world!

601
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,666
[CHIMP] That's my lord for you!

602
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,208
And money's what makes
you my lord, now and forever!

603
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,625
♪

604
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,208
[NAGASUMI] Listen! Even a
loving couple everyone envies

605
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,500
will have issues
if they live under

606
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,750
the same roof long enough!

607
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,000
It's no big deal, really!

608
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,333
But even the
smallest differences,

609
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,833
if they pile up,
can sadly make for

610
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:43,916
a huge amount of stress!

611
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,166
And in fact, they have!

612
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,833
And I'm a total idiot
for not noticing that!
