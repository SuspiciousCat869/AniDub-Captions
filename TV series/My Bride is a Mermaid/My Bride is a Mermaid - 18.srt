00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,958
Maybe this'll turn out to
be a nice, normal field trip.

156
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,416
[GOZABURO] Hey, Sun!

157
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,666
[GOZABURO] Check out
what dear old dad found!

158
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,916
Awesome, huh?

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,500
[SUN] That is one mighty
fine sword indeed, Dad!

160
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,875
--[NAGASUMI] Or maybe not!
--[GOZABURO] Ya want it?

161
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,500
[SUN] Yeah! Of course!
--Nagasumi, would ya please

162
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,708
take a photo of us in this

163
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,625
unique father-daughter
bonding moment?

164
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,125
Why, Mr. Seto,
I don't think I've

165
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,791
ever seen you so
calm and collected.

166
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,208
It happens every
now and then,

167
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,041
but he'll be climbin' the
walls again soon enough.

168
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,041
And enough to burst
a blood vessel and die?

169
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,083
It's rare that he's calm,

170
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,708
so you better take
that picture quick.

171
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,958
Gotcha.

172
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,375
Okay, everybody smile!

173
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
[NAGASUMI] I guess
this one's going on

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,625
the Christmas card this year?

175
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,500
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Wow,
they sure are relaxed for people

176
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,541
who are being evaluated
by an examiner.

177
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,083
[CHIMP] Hey,
Nagasumi! Over here!

178
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,000
Take some pictures
of me and Kai, too!

179
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,625
Um, okay, sure.

180
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,333
[KAI] Just don't
get my bad side!

181
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,125
[CHIMP] You don't
have one, my lord!

182
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,875
[Chimp and Kai laugh]

183
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,875
In that one, it looked

184
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333
like you were
floating in midair--

185
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,541
Oh, holy crap! Chimp!

186
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,083
Hey uh...
Are you alright?

187
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,083
[KAI] If it weren't for this
helmet, I wouldn't be alive.

188
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,375
[CHIMP'S SOUL] Mama!

189
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,708
Too bad Chimp
didn't make it.

190
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,083
[NAGASUMI] Hey, Akeno!

191
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,166
[AKENO] Hm?

192
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,666
So according to
the map at the front,

193
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,000
the famous Otowa Falls are
at the bottom of those steps.

194
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,250
Wanna check 'em out?

195
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,458
Wait, are you inviting
me, Nagasumi?

196
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,041
Not that I don't
appreciate it, but...

197
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,666
Don't you have something
better to do with Sun?

198
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,708
[SUN] Tag, you're it, Dad!

199
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,791
[NAGASUMI] She's
busy doing something

200
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,750
really important
with her dad right now.

201
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,916
You feel sorry for me because
I don't have any friends.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
No, that's not it,
I swear!

203
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,458
It's just that we don't go on
many field trips, you see,

204
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,916
and it would be no fun
to spend one all alone.

205
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,250
[AKENO] In my line of work,
I move frequently.

206
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,375
That makes it difficult
to make friends.

207
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,291
I'm always the
new transfer student.

208
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,666
Most of the time, no one
tries to get to know me,

209
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,916
but sometimes,
there is the rare exception.

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Kind and thoughtful people,
just like you Nagasumi.

211
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,583
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Wow...
So she actually can smile.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,375
Wh-What?

213
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,875
[AKENO] I owe you an apology.
I doubted you at first.

214
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,500
I thought the invitation
might be some

215
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,958
kind of trap you
were setting for me

216
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,458
since you're
involved with Sun.

217
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
 Wait, a trap? No way!

218
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,833
I apologize for my
suspicious nature.

219
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,916
[NAGASUMI] You take
your work pretty seriously.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,708
[AKENO] That I do,
and I am really sorry that it

221
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,041
caused me to doubt
your kindness, Nagasumi.

222
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,708
Oh, it's no problem.

223
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,333
[CREWPERSON] Enemy attack!
Raising the barrier!

224
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,791
[NAGASUMI] Nagasumi Barrier!

225
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,291
The assassin from
the Seto Gang?

226
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,958
Ah crap! She spotted me thanks
to that stupid sea louse!

227
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,916
Well, so much for the
element of surprise!

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ah, who cares?
I'm still takin' her down!

229
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,541
Hey, cut it out Maki!

230
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,500
I'll make sure everyone sees
your true form, Miss Examiner!

231
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,458
[NAGASUMI] Ow!

232
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
Nagasumi,
get out of my way!

233
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,500
Crap, you got wet!

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
[AKENO] Thanks to your
idiotic flailing around I did.

235
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
Why didn't you
move like I asked?

236
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,625
What the...

237
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,458
So I guess that much
is okay for you?

238
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,291
What's the matter?

239
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,625
[AKENO] The reason
why a mermaid can't

240
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,375
maintain their human
form whenever water

241
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,458
gets on them is because of
a physiological phenomenon.

242
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,250
[AKENO] The only thing
I can compare it

243
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,916
to is sneezing when
your nose tickles.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,208
But in our case, when our lower

245
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,458
bodies tickle, we turn
back into mermaids.

246
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,833
What can I do to help?

247
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,500
[AKENO] Just don't look at me!
It's embarassing!

248
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,208
[MAKI THINKS]
The water, it is working!

249
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,750
Don't fight it, Akeno!
Show the world your true colors!

250
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,708
Here, have a
little more, I insist!

251
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,041
[NAGASUMI] Maki! Stop shooting!

252
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,291
[AKENO] Nagasumi...
Did you plan this?

253
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,416
Be honest with me!

254
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,875
What? No! 'Course not!

255
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,708
Hey, what's
going on over here?

256
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,333
It's Akeno!

257
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,625
Crap!
The little cop girl!

258
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,916
Are you okay?

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,125
[AKENO] Yeah, it's nothing.

260
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,375
I just fell in a
puddle, that's all.

261
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,708
Don't tell me you tried
to pull something again...

262
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,625
Nagasumi...

263
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,666
Hey! What do
you mean by "again?"

264
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,750
[NAGASUMI]
Oh no, this looks bad.

265
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,041
And when I was
so close, too! Dammit!

266
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,916
[MAKI] M-Miss Sun!

267
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,833
I can explain.

268
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,583
How may I help you, sir?

269
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,708
[GOZABURO] We've
got reservations here!

270
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,458
Okay, guys, make
yourselves at home!

271
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,541
[BOYS] Yeah!

272
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
[INNKEEPER]
Sir, you can't do that!

273
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
Not in the lobby!
You have rooms!

274
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,041
Course I can!

275
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,916
I'm Gozaburo Seto,
boss of the Class 2-1 outfit!

276
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,625
[REN] For cryin' out loud!

277
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,333
You're too old to
be actin' this hyper!

278
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,458
[NAGASUMI] Akeno, wait...

279
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,291
I want to clear up this
misunderstanding between us.

280
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,541
Here, I'll explain.

281
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,750
Just save
your breath, okay?

282
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,625
I don't listen to people
who betray my trust.

283
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,166
[MAWARI] Ooh,
that looks de-lish!

284
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,625
Why, thank you!

285
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,250
It's poached sardines and
some of Kyoto's famous yuba.

286
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,833
[MAGURO] I could
never eat a sardine, gyo!

287
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,166
[INNKEEPER] Gyo?

288
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,250
[BURIO] Washio, I can't
bear to see you like this!

289
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,041
That wonderful
sardine was the guy who

290
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,541
first taught me how
to ride a motorcycle!

291
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,916
[WASHIO]
Be careful of those RPMs

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,208
when you engage the clutch, gyo.

293
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,875
[WASHIO] Nothing beats the
Purple Road at sunrise, gyo.

294
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,750
[WASHIO] Next year
I'm getting married, gyo.

295
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,583
Married, gyo. (echo)

296
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,083
[AJITARO] On a winding
course going one hundred

297
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,416
and thirty miles per hour,

298
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,458
he passed into the
summer sky and sea.

299
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,125
Oh poor Washio!

300
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,083
Don't you have
anything else to eat?

301
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,791
I've horse mackerel.

302
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,958
[FISH BROTHERS]
We're not cannibals!

303
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,833
I'm a horse mackerel, lady!

304
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,833
[INNKEEPER] Cannibals?
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...

305
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,416
[SUN] Those three guys...
They're not bad people, ya know?

306
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,916
[AKENO] I disagree,
and they failed

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,416
from the moment
I met them.

308
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,583
And speaking
of people, Akeno...

309
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,416
Maki's not a bad girl either,

310
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,958
even if she does
do stupid stuff sometimes.

311
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,666
So you know
about this afternoon?

312
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,125
Yeah...

313
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,958
I caught her a little while
ago and made her confess.

314
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,916
I don't know why
she acted like that.

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,458
I'm supposed
to believe that?

316
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,208
She acted alone and you had
nothing to do with that attack?

317
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,541
I didn't, I swear.

318
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,041
I know it must be really hard
for ya to trust people, Akeno.

319
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,875
Especially so after today.

320
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,458
But even if ya don't believe
a single thing that I'm sayin',

321
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,750
please believe this...

322
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,333
Nagasumi had
absolutely nothin' to do

323
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,541
with what happened back
there at the falls today!

324
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,333
Ya really've gotta
trust me on this!

325
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,750
[SUN] Please!

326
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,791
[AKENO] Okay. I will.

327
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,291
Wow, really?

328
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,375
I'd like some
more rice, please.

329
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,000
A whole tub!

330
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I can't
believe I made a girl cry.

331
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,583
Nagasumi!

332
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,083
[CHIMP] How can you sit
there looking all depressed

333
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,208
when we should be thinking
about what's going on next door?

334
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,416
[NAGASUMI] Why on
Earth should we be

335
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,625
thinking about what's
going on next door?

336
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,500
[CHIMP] Why?

337
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,625
Because it's the girl's bath!

338
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,291
I wonder if Sun's
in there right now?

339
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,083
Not a chance, you pervert.

340
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,708
What? She's not?

341
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
Um, 'cause she's,
uh, got a cold,

342
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
and she said she won't be

343
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
taking a bath
tonight because of it.

344
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,041
Huh, I bet Sun's
really stinky then.

345
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,333
[NAGASUMI] Stinky?

346
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,541
Alright, forget Sun!

347
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,083
Aren't you the least
bit curious about what's

348
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,041
going on in the naked paradise
one thin wall away from us?

349
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,041
[girl cries out]

350
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,208
[CHIMP AND NAGASUMI]
What's that?

351
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,375
What are you doing,
Mawari?

352
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,208
Don't grope my chest!

353
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,125
Hey, come on!
We haven't bathed together

354
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
in a couple of years,
right Class Rep?

355
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,375
All I was doing
was checking out

356
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,333
how my friend's
portions have filled out!

357
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,875
I assume by "portions,"
you mean "proportions,"

358
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,208
as in secondary
sex traits, right?

359
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,333
Whatever, we're on a field
trip, not in science class.

360
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,708
Just for talking like that,

361
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,875
maybe I should teach
you the rules of this society.

362
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,166
Starting with not
wearing towels in the bath!

363
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,291
[CLASS REP] Mawari!
What's gotten into you?

364
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,166
Come on, stop it!

365
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,458
[MAWARI] I guess I'll
just have to wrestle

366
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,708
that towel away from you, huh?

367
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,375
There! Got it!

368
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,750
[MAWARI] Whoa, those
things have gotten huge!

369
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,833
[CLASS REP] I'm not the
only one who's grown!

370
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,541
Yours look slightly
bigger, too, Mawari!

371
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,166
[MAWARI] Hey, what do
you mean "slightly?"

372
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,208
[CLASS REP]
Take this! Tickle torture!

373
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,833
[MAWARI] No! Stop!
I can't stand it!

374
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,333
I'm gonna scream,
and if we make too

375
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
much noise,
the boys will hear us!

376
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,333
[NAGASUMI] We heard
you and it was great,

377
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,125
so please don't stop!

378
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,875
[KAI] What all this fuss?

379
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,041
[KAI] There's no
fussin' in the bath!

380
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,833
Wait, you're wearing
that thing in here, too?

381
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,000
Well of course I am!
It's good bath manners!

382
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,750
Let me teach you guys some!

383
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,291
[KAI] First, before you
even get in the bath,

384
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,666
you gotta rinse
yourself off real good!

385
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,291
[KAI] Then once you've
thoroughly rinsed off,

386
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,041
you can enjoy a
nice, leisurely soak.

387
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,791
Just remember:
no towels in the bath.

388
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,541
It isn't sanitary.

389
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,666
[KAI] And when
you're done, towel off.

390
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,791
[NAGASUMI] No, really?

391
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,791
[KAI] And shampoo!

392
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,166
[NAGASUMI] Like that'll work.

393
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
[KAI] I feel refreshed!

394
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,750
[CHIMP] As refined
as ever, my lord!

395
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,458
[NAGASUMI] Are you
guys out of your minds?

396
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,375
[CLASS REP] Wonder what all the
fuss is about on the boy's side?

397
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,458
[SUN] I know ya were
just lookin' out for me,

398
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,791
but what ya did today was wrong.

399
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,333
[MAKI] Yes, Miss!

400
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,208
[SUN] It also coulda caused
a lot of trouble for all of us.

401
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,541
[MAKI] Yes, Miss!

402
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,083
If I'm gonna pass
this mermaid exam,

403
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,375
I'm gonna do it fair
and square, ya hear me?

404
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,375
Yes, ma'am.
I'm really sorry, Miss Sun.

405
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,000
Please forgive me!

406
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,291
[MAKI THINKS] What a strong
woman Sun's become!

407
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,041
I'm so proud of her I could cry!

408
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,041
Sounds like you've
really steeled yourself.

409
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
Well, I've tried
to at least.

410
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,541
If that is
indeed the case,

411
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,125
then why don't we go
test that steel right now?

412
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
[MAWARI] I wanted to
check out Sun's boobs, too!

413
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,041
It sucks that she wasn't there.

414
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,958
[NAGASUMI] You sound
just like a dirty old man.

415
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,291
Shut your trap!

416
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,333
[SUN] I don't know
if I'm ready for that yet.

417
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,083
Shouldn't we wait
until we're a little older?

418
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,166
[AKENO] People usually
start doing it at our age.

419
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
That sounds like
Akeno and Sun.

420
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,708
It is, but what are
they talking about?

421
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,458
[SUN] Ya want
to do it in the bath?

422
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,166
But what if somebody sees us?

423
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,000
[AKENO] We'll do it later
when no one's in there.

424
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,208
[SUN] You'll show me how?

425
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,833
[AKENO] Yes, I've got
lots of experience.

426
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll teach you exactly
what to do with your body.

427
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,000
[SUN] Okay,
but I'm a little nervous.

428
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,625
[AKENO] Don't be
afraid. I'll be gentle.

429
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,291
What is it they should be
a little older before doing?

430
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,708
What did she mean by
"I'll be gentle?"

431
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,291
[AKENO] I'll drip it
on you a little at a time,

432
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,208
so do your best to hold on.

433
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,916
[NAGASUMI AND MAWARI]
Drip it on?

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,833
[NAGASUMI]
Homina-homina-homina-homina--

435
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,250
[MAWARI] Wait,
you mean to tell me

436
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,625
Akeno's one of those people?

437
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,125
[NAGASUMI] I never thought so,

438
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
but just what the heck is
she planning on doing with Sun?

439
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,500
[MAWARI] I don't stick my nose
into people's romances,

440
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,000
but if they're doing
it on a school trip,

441
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,458
I've gotta put my foot down!

442
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,625
I'm a member of the Disciplinary
Committee, after all!

443
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,750
Who the kelunna!

444
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,208
[NAGASUMI] Officer?
Officer Mawari? Hello? Um.

445
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,500
[SUN] So ya reserved
the bath just for this, huh?

446
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,958
When I told
her why we wanted it,

447
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,541
your mother was
quite pleased.

448
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,791
Are you ready to do it?

449
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,833
[AKENO] Well?

450
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,208
If they're only taking
a bath, then that's fine.

451
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,083
But we find 'em
doing anything else.

452
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,125
So help them, I'll--

453
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,375
[NAGASUMI] Wait...

454
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,208
I think maybe we should
just leave them alone.

455
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,291
What? Why?

456
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,500
You heard what
they were saying too!

457
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,250
Something fishy's
going on here!

458
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,041
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Exactly!
That's what I'm afraid of!

459
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,833
They could be in
mermaid form in there!

460
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,750

What am I saying?

saying is we shouldn't

It wouldn't be a crime we'd
be interrupting but love.

[NAGASUMI] Oh, no!

[MAWARI] What are you doing?

503
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,041
As a member of the
Disciplinary Committee,

it's my duty to
stop behavior like that!

[NAGASUMI THINKS] We had
it all wrong thankfully.

For you? Sure.

I hope you finally
realized it today.

529
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,875
After those near-disasters,
you must realize

530
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,250
that humans and
mermaids can't coexist.

Hold on, what are
you trying to tell me?

You need to
break up with Sun.

533

[AKENO] I can convince
the powers-that-be

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,625
to make a special
exception for you.

Your life will be spared and you

won't have to
get married, either.

537
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,458
I won't? You can
really do that, Akeno?

538
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,000
[AKENO] I can,
so what do you say?

539
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,875
I say no...

540
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,000
The Seto code says no
doing things by halves.

541
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,291
[NAGASUMI] Sun'd say
that if she were here.

542
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,000
And I agree with that code.

543
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,583
Besides, it'd be
really uncool if I

544
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,041
broke a vow to
someone I care about.

545

It certainly appears that the

air-headed as the wife.

In that case,

you apologizing for?

Because...

I am a screw-up and maybe
if I wasn't so much of one,
