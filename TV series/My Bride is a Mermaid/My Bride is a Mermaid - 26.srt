00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,708
Don't call me "Dad,"
ya piss ant!

313
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,166
[GOZABURO] Hey, Yoshiuo!

314
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,583
[GOZABURO]
You're gonna pay for screwin'

315
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,375
with the Seto's, ya damn punk!

316
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,583
Like I have time
for that, old dude.

317
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,625
Hey um, I need you guys here,
like, right way, okay!

318
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,666
[ELITE GUARD A] Chill out.

319
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
Keep your shirt on,
bro, we're here.

320
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,250
[ELITE GUARD B]
You sounded like you

321
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,416
were about to freak, man.

322
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,833
What's the dealio?

323
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,000
[GOZABURO] Who the
hell are these punks?

324
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,000
[YOSHIUO] Thanks!

325
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,375
I'll leave these
two dudes to you!

326
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,541
Hey! Hold it!

327
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
[ELITE GUARD]
Roger that, Yoshiuo!

328
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,375
We'll, like, totally chop these

329
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,000
lame-o's up
into itty-bitty pieces!

330
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,625
[MAKI] Not if my
Liquid Machine Gun

331
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,625
has anything to say about it!

332
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,541
[NAGASUMI] What the--?

333
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,583
[NAGASUMI] Maki!

334
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,458
[MAKI] That wasn't too
shabby for a sea louse!

335
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,708
[MASA] Nagasumi...
I heard that speech you made.

336
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,958
Nice job, I'm proud of you.

337
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,708
[SHARK]
Sorry, guys, but the only

338
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,416
one who can eat Nagasumi...

339
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,750
...is me.

340
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,958
Masa!
Shark Fujishiro!

341
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,375
I just knew ya
had somethin'

342
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,750
to do with that tremor!

343
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,416
So you're here, too?
Mom, are all of you guys okay?

344
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,250
[GOZABURO] We're fine,
and we're gonna be a whole

345
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,708
lot better once we teach
these nobles a lesson!

346
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,041
Let's show 'em what happens
when you mess with the Setos!

347
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,708
[MASA AND SHARK AND MAKI]
Sure, Boss, whatever you say!

348
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,000
Where did it get ya?

349
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,208
The legs,
but they're not that bad.

350
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,791
[SHARK] Time to eat?

351
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,125
[ELITE GUARD D] No! Don't! Stop!

352
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,125
[REN] If he keeps
eatin' that fast,

353
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,000
he's gonna get a
bad stomach ache.

354
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,583
[REN] Hey, Nagasumi.

355
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,791
We'll handle the rest.

356
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,166
This place isn't safe,
so get out of here.

357
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,333
[NAGASUMI] No.

358
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,083
[NAGASUMI] I can't!

359
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm not leaving until
I've saved Sun!

360
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,791
[NAGASUMI] I will not and
cannot let her down!

361
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,291
I wouldn't be here
today if it wasn't for Sun.

362
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,333
I was drowning,
and she saved me.

363
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,708
Even though she knew she'd die

364
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,083
if she did it,
she still saved me.

365
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,708
A total stranger.
That was so selfless of her.

366
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,166
[NAGASUMI]
I learned something really

367
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,708
important from Sun that day.

368
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,041
There's some
things in this world

369
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,875
more important than my own life!

370
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,708
That's the Seto gang's
honor among thieves!

371
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,916
[Gozaburo grunts]

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,958
[NAGASUMI]
A good husband's supposed to

373
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,500
protect his wife
and keep her safe!

374
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,375
I will do that!

375
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,958
Sun's real lucky to have
a guy like you, Nagasumi.

376
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,500
Hey! Don't you
forget what ya said!

377
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,041
[GOZABURO] 'Cause you're
a Seto, now maggot!

378
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,833
[GOZABURO] Now go.

379
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,291
Right!

380
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,583
[ELITE GUARD E]
As if we'd let you go, dude!

381
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,750
[ELITE GUARD F]
You're going down, bro!

382
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,333
No, you are!

383
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,208
Thanks, Lunar!

384
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,500
Manservant!

385
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,000
[CHIMP] Ow, my freakin ears.
That was so loud.

386
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,500
What are ya...
waitin' for?

387
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,666
[SHARK] Nagasumi?

388
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,541
[MAKI] Grow some balls
and get Sun back!

389
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,083
You can do it, Nagasumi!

390
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
We're countin' on ya!

391
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,500
Go! Get your bride
back, Nagasumi!

392
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,375
[Nagasumi cries out]

393
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,333
What the hell?
There's two of 'em now?

394
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,500
Miss Ren!
Can you sing at the same pitch?

395
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,041
As the sword, sure.

396
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,458
[REN] But my voice...

397
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,750
[REN] (distorted)
It ain't as pretty!

398
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,791
And now's my chance!

399
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,625
What the hell?

400
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,291
You mean there are
three of them now?

401
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,333
[LUNA PAPA] I told
you I'd be back!

402
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,375
Edomae?

403
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,416
You're in
that outfit again?

404
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,333
It's no problemo!

405
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,125
Papa! Terminate 'em!

406
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,875
[LUNAR PAPA] Lunar!

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,291
Oh, man!

408
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,250
This is just like being
in a big-budget blockbuster!

409
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,000
[LUNAR] Eat beam!

410
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,958
[Lunar laughs wickedly]

411
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,250
[YOSHIUO] Man,
what's the deal with, like,

412
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,416
everyone getting in
my freaking way today?

413
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,041
Nothing pisses me
off more than people

414
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,916
getting between me
and having a good time.

415
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,333
[YOSHIUO] Like
we're about to have.

416
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,250
[Yoshiuo snickers]

417
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,458
[NAGASUMI] Sun!

418
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,875
[YOSHIUO] Huh?

419
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,000
[YOSHIUO] What's your damage?

420
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,958
You're, like, seriously
stubborn, you know that?

421
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,125
You shut up!
Don't worry Sun!

422
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll get you out of
this place right now!

423
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,083
[YOSHIUO] And, like, totally
mess up my wedding night?

424
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,625
No way, dude!

425
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,583
[YOSHIUO] Did you
really think a human

426
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,708
could take on mermaid nobility?
Man, you're a dumbass!

427
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,416
Sun...

428
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,250
[NAGASUMI] Come on Sun.
Why aren't ya--

429
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,583
Saying anything?

430
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,125
I gave her a little somethin'
to keep her quiet.

431
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,625
It also keeps
her from hearing you.

432
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,708
[NAGASUMI] What is this stuff?

433
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,625
[YOSHIUO]
You could, like, call it a

434
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,791
secret mermaid treasure.

435
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,375
Humans can't
stand the smell of it,

436
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,875
but it doesn't have
any effect on 'em;

437
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,208
just mermaids.

438
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,833
So that's why
Sun's so out of it!

439
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,791
You gassed her with that stuff!

440
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,083
Duh, dude,
it'd be a real drag

441
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,833
if she started fighting back!

442
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,541
You lousy, no-good son of a--!

443
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,458
[YOSHIUO] Dude,
haven't you learned?

444
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,708
You can't beat a mermaid noble.
I'm, like, way stronger.

445
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,833
Don't care.

446
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,041
It doesn't matter
how strong you are,

447
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll never let you have Sun!

448
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,791
That's freaking hilarious!

449
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,875
I bet Sun would laugh, too,
if she could hear you right now!

450
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,000
Sun, please listen.

451
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:18,875
[NAGASUMI] I don't know
if you can hear me,

452
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,500
but I came to get you.

453
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,416
Sorry I'm so late.
And speaking of sorry,

454
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,333
I want to apologize
for that fight we had.

455
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,250
It was all my fault;

456
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,708
I took you for granted.

457
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,875
[NAGASUMI] I'm sorry...

458
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,166
I'll turn my socks
inside-out from now on.

459
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,250
I won't leave tissues
in my jeans, either.

460
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,208
I'll even rinse my plates off,
whatever it takes.

461
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,833
[NAGASUMI] Because I...

462
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
[NAGASUMI] Because I love you,

463
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
and I can't imagine
living without you!

464
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,083
[YOSHIUO] Dude, you're,
like, being a serious drag!

465
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,625
Stay by my side!

466
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,625
We can't let things
end like this!

467
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,208
