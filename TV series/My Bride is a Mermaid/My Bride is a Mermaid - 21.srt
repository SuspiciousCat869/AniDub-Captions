--Somebody please help!
--[BOYS] Burn him! Burn him!

310
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,708
Akeno!

311
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
I'm putting an
end to this!

312
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,666
Have you all gone
insane or something?

313
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,666
Are you alright, Nagasumi--

314
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,583
Give me your best attack.

315
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,541
[AKENO] Flawless defense!

316
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,541
I concede to you.
Do what you will.

317
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,125
[NAGASUMI] I just
really wanna disappear.

318
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,958
[GOZABURO] What,
and miss your barbecue?

319
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,250
No way, ya maggot!

320
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,125
[REN] The barbecue's
called off, dear!

321
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,916
[NAGASUMI] Thanks, Sun's mom!

322
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,375
I'm sorry about all
of this, my poor, Nagasumi.

323
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,083
[NAGASUMI] You said
it was just a small dose!

324
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,500
It was, but I didn't know
it would be this potent.

325
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,916
But don't worry, ya should be
back to normal tomorrow.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,333
In the meantime, how 'bout we
both make the most of it?

327
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,500
[NAGASUMI]
Man, that stuff is potent!

328
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,750
[REN] No.

329
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,375
[REN] Wait!

330
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,416
[BOYS]
Hey, he's getting away!

331
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,083
[NAGASUMI] I'm home.

332
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,416
[MOM] Nagasumi,
why aren't you in school?

333
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a long story, Mom.
What's up with you?

334
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,000
Mom, I'll call Dad!

335
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,625
Where is he? At work?

336
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,458
[DAD] I used to have a wife
and son who both loved me.

337
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,000
I am so glad now
that I gave birth to you.

338
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,958
Wait, you mean
you weren't glad before?

339
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,541
Well, before you
didn't have these rugged,

340
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,083
good looks, just a featureless
face and dull eyes.

341
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,166
Well, in that case, you're
not gonna be so happy about

342
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,208
giving birth to
me come tomorrow.

343
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,000
That's the stuff.

344
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,208
I need a hot bath after
all that's happened today.

345
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,166
[NAGASUMI] Man, it
was hard to resist those

346
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,375
chicks throwing
themselves at me!

347
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,125
What would I do if that potion
lasted for more than one day?

348
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,791
[MAKI] Good question.
What would you do?

349
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,083
Not anything
dirty, I swear!

350
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,208
[NAGASUMI] Maki?

351
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,416
I thought you might need
some help washing your back.

352
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,708
[NAGASUMI] Just how
long have you been there?

353
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,250
[MAKI] Well, actually,
I'm too embarrassed to say!

354
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,750
That means you saw
something embarrassing!

355
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,416
Don't worry! I didn't see your
sea cucumber or anythin'!

356
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,625
Whatever, get out,
and I'll wash

357
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,083
my own back,
thank you very much!

358
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,458
[SUN] Nagasumi...

359
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,083
[NAGASUMI] Sun? Lunar?

360
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,625
Hi...
I came here 'cause...

361
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,708
We thought you'd need
help washing your back.

362
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,666
[NAGASUMI] Mawari? Akeno?

363
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,291
Well, I have to make
sure that everyone

364
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,125
who's in my custody
is nice and clean.

365
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,875
Your back is the least
I could do after you bested me.

366
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,500
[NAGASUMI] You all
really wanna bathe me?

367
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,833
We thought it
would be a good way

368
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,916
for us to show
our appreciation for ya.

369
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,708
Just leave all
your scrubbing to me!

370
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,666
Would you like to
stand or sit in the tub?

371
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,666
We think you
should stand

372
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,291
so we can all
see your sexy bod!

373
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,083
[NAGASUMI] I don't think you
guys know what you're saying!

374
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,833
'Course we do, Nagasumi!

375
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:32,916
[MAKI] And we're
gonna get you as

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,583
clean as a whistle
from head to toe!

377
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,375
We're personally gonna
wash every nook and cranny!

378
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,541
No, I'm gonna
do that job myself!

379
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,041
Did you know I have
a black belt in bathing?

380
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,500
Guys, this is kinda crazy.

381
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
[GOZABURO] That's what
I was about to say!

382
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,916
[GOZABURO]
What're ya doin', ya pissant?

383
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,000
[DAD] I'm home.

384
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,583
[MOM] Hi, honey,
how was your day?

385
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,000
[screaming]

386
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,666
[GOZABURO] Ya maggot!
Ya expect Sun to wear a bathin'

387
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,166
suit and wash your
back every night?

388
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,958
[DAD] Nagasumi?

389
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,250
[NAGASUMI] (baby talk0
Hey, look at me, Daddy!

390
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm all nakie!
Goo goo, gah gah!

391
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,958
[GOZABURODAD] Die!

392
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,250
Oh, my boy's so big now.

393
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,541
[VOICES] The next day!

394
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,666
[SUN] I hope you're
okay, Nagasumi.

395
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,875
[NAGASUMI]
Thanks, Sun. I'll be okay.

396
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,500
[LUNAR] We must have gone
temporarily insane yesterday.

397
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,791
Us thinking that you
were sexy? Come on!

398
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,500
[NAGASUMI] Well, I'm just
happy to be unpopular again.

399
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,208
[NAGASUMI] Not again!

400
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,250
There's only so much my heart

401
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,625
can take, and it
can't take any more!

402
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,291
[GOZABURO] I'm
tired of sittin' around!

403
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,250
Your info better be legit, Maki!

404
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,833
It sure is, Boss.

405
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,416
I saw the sea louse find it this
mornin' with my own two eyes.

406
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,208
Great. Well, in that
case, we can just

407
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,833
sit back and
watch the fireworks.

408
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,833
I knew you'd
be hiding back here.

409
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,541
Don't sneak
up on me like that!

410
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,833
Is it that much fun?

411
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,500
Humiliating me with
another fake love letter?

412
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,583
Well, cheers, 'cause we

413
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,208
didn't send it
and it's not fake.

414
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,291
It's real.

415
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,333
Yeah! You just
forget about Miss Sun

416
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,166
and enjoy your
new love, sea louse!

417
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,041
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

418
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,125
Look! It's her!

419
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,875
How can you say that?

420
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,833
She's almost in position!

421
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,583
Quit hidin' and
get out there, maggot.

422
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,000
No you go!

423
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,875
[NAGASUMI] It's her.

424
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,000
[NAGASUMI]
The girl from the park.

425
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,000
[CLASS REP] I'll try telling
him how I feel about him.

426
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,833
[NAGASUMI] So she was
a student at this school!

427
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,500
[CLASS REP] A cute girl
like me shouldn't have

428
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,291
any trouble
snagging a guy, right?

429
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,250
[CLASS REP]
It's guaranteed, you said.

430
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
[CLASS REP] You said
life is brief, so fall in love.

431
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,500
Right, Nagasumi?

432
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,375
[CLASS REP] I've always been the
least noticeable girl in class.

433
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,708
My name could be
"the one next to Mawari."

434
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,166
But I've loved
you from afar

435
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,791
for a very long
time now, Nagasumi.

436
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,000
[CLASS REP] He's here!

437
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,125
[CLASS REP] What do I say?

438
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,541
Oh, no, my mind's
gone totally blank,

439
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,416
but I have to say something!

440
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,125
[CLASS REP] Um, I love you!
Please go out with me!

441
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,041
What?

442
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,791
[NAGASUMI]
The one you like is Sun?

443
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,333
[MAKI] What the hell?

444
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,875
[GOZABURO] I thought that girl
had a thing for the maggot!

445
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,958
[SUN] Um, I only came here
'cause my dad asked me to.

446
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,291
[CLASS REP] Huh?

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,375
[CLASS REP] Sun?

448
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,708
[SUN] I'm really flattered,
but I'm already involved,

449
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,375
so I gotta turn ya down.
Sorry.

450
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,875
[CLASS REP] Don't tell me I
confessed my love to Sun Seto?

451
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,458
[ALL]
Yep, ya sure did!

452
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,416
[CLASS REP] And I did it
in front of Nagasumi, too?

453
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,375
Yep, ya sure did!

454
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,458
[CLASS REP]
World, world, go away.

455
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,000
[CLASS REP] No!

456
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,708
[CLASS REP] Why?

457
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,458
[CLASS REP] Would somebody
please tell me what

458
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,125
I did in my life to deserve
this degree of humiliation?

459
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
I finally plucked up
enough courage and gave

460
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,208
the love confession
of a lifetime

461
