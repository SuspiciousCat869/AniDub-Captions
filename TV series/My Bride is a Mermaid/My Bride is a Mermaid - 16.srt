00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,291
[KAI] Well, now, I'm mighty
impressed there, Miss.

159
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,625
You're not just pretty,
but smart, too.

160
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,166
Explain something Kai...

161
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,916
What brought someone
like you to this school?

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,125
Simple...

163
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,166
It was for love!
I came for my one and only.

164
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,250
He's Sun's stalker.
That's why he came here.

165
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,250
What?

166
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,750
You've got some nerve!

167
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,666
Where do you get
off insulting my pure love,

168
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,291
you pathetic,
no-good human scum?

169
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,791
I didn't say anything
that wasn't true!

170
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,833
Alright Nagasumi,
that tears it!

171
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,916
I'm gonna teach you about
the power of the merfolk!

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,541
Fine! Bring it on,
you Sea World reject!

173
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,708
[MAWARI] Stop it!
No fighting in here, you two!

174
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,625
Maybe I should teach you
the rules of this classroom!

175
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,000
You fail! Kai!

176
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,875
[KAI] Feels, so darn, good.

177
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,166
Whoa... She
knocked him out.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
[AKENO] Kai Mikawa fails.
How vexing.

179
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,333
[SUN] Failed what?
What are ya talking about?

180
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,708
Here, look at this.

181
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,500
[SUN] Wait, is this?

182
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,333
[AKENO] He said
"No good human scum,"

183
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,291
and "power of the merfolk."

184
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,291
But...

185
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
The use of such
phrases in front

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
of humans is inexcusable.

187
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,041
So is flaunting the power
of our kind to humans.

188
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,541
It demonstrates
a flaw, so he fails.

189
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,875
You said "Our kind?" Akeno,
are ya saying you're a--

190
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,000
Correct...

191
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,375
I'm the same as you,
Lunar, and Mikawa.

192
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,666
A mermaid.

193
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,041
[SUN] Ya said Kai failed.

194
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,916
What did ya mean
by that exactly?

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,333
[AKENO] Those who
fail the exam must

196
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,291
leave the human
world forever.

197
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,625
I'm the official
who passes

198
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,333
judgment over those who take it.

199
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,583
[AKENO] Kai Mikawa's
being returned to the sea.

200
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,708
--[KAI] Chimp. Please. Help.
--[SUN] What?

201
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,166
Kai's gonna get
sent back to the sea?

202
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,708
And you will too if
you don't pass the exam.

203
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,208
I've already discussed
this with your father.

204
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,833
With my father?

205
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,458
[GOZABURO THINKS]
Just hang in there, Sun!

206
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,791
[AKENO] I've also instructed
Maki the Conch to stay

207
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,041
at home for the
duration of the exam.

208
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,125
[AKENO] She won't be
joining you at school today.

209
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm so sorry, Boss!

210
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,625
I feel so pathetic
not bein' able to

211
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,291
help you out when
you're in trouble!

212
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,291
And I can't stop cryin'!

213
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,625
And just how
the hell did I end

214
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,541
up getting stuck
in this package?

215
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,750
[MAKI] Oh, no! The beast!

216
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,250
The beast is comin'! Stop!
Don't come any closer!

217
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,416
I don't wanna get hurt again!

218
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,083
Just get away from me,
ya mangy furball!

219
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm not a snack!

220
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,666
Nooooo!

221
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
[AKENO] There's no
one here who can

222
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,750
help you with the exam, Sun.

223
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,666
[AKENO] Naturally,
you're not to tell anyone.

224
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,750
If you do,
you automatically fail.

225
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,000
Revealing my true
identity to those I test

226
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,041
is always the first
part of the exam.

227
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,625
Wait... Ya mean?

228
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,000
[AKENO] Yes, Akeno Shiranui's
Mermaid Exam has already begun.

229
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,583
It's a test to
determine if you'll be

230
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,791
allowed to remain in the human
world or sent back home.

231
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,333
[SUN] Mermaid Exam?

232
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,125
[OCTOPUS NAKAJIMA]
Lately, I've been hooked

233
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,250
on patchwork, mostly quilts.

234
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,875
Listen up, 'cause
this will be on the test.

235
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,166
Let's say you have one
cheap punk and ten bosses.

236
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,208
You gotta multiply
by four the formula

237
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,333
for the probability
of the punk completing...

238
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,000
That's useful info! Isn't
Mr. Masa just the greatest?

239
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,500
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Yeah,
both in terms of looks

240
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,333
and giving us a great education
in underworld accounting!

241
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,000
[AKENO] Masa,
lieutenant of the Seto outfit.

242
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,625
Based on my observations,
there don't appear

243
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,291
to be any issues with him.

244
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,041
I'm sure you figured this out,
but you're not the only one

245
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,625
that I came here to test, Sun.

246
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,000
And know this...

247
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,750
If one of the others slips up,
revealing themselves

248
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,125
as mermaids to the
human population.

249
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,333
I'll fail them
on the spot as well.

250
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,250
[SUN] And if ya fail, ya get
deported back to the sea!

251
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,291
I gotta pass!

252
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,541
If I don't, I'll get
sent back to the

253
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,208
Seto and Nagasumi'll
be left here all alone!

254
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,916
Um...
Hey, Sun?

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
Yes, Nagasumi,
what do you want?

256
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,541
I won't leave you!

257
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,000
Ms. Sun...
Are you okay girl?

258
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,041
Who? Me?
I'm great. Why do you ask?

259
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,250
For one... Your
book's upside down.

260
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,333
[SUN] It is?

261
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,666
About time you noticed.

262
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,791
You're taking notes
on me? Oh, no!

263
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,833
Hey, I don't get it.
Why did Akeno knock me out?

264
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,875
[CHIMP] My lord...

265
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,208
What is it, Chimp?

266
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,625
Would ya just hurry
and help me up?

267
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,416
Look over
there, my lord.

268
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,500
[KAI] Sun! She's staring at
me with such compassion!

269
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,916
[KAI] She's never looked
at me like that before!

270
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,416
Wait! Could
this finally mean...?

271
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,791
My guess, my lord?

272
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,875
Her heart started to
flutter wildly with sorrow

273
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,083
when she saw you laid
out on the floor in pain.

274
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,000
Fluttered? Oh, Sun!

275
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,583
[SUN THINKS] Oh no,
Kai failed and now he's

276
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,500
gonna have to go back
to the sea forever!

277
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,416
Goodbye, Kai, it's been
real nice knowing ya!

278
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,541
Please take care of
yourself and keep in touch!

279
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,625
Don't worry your pretty,
little head, Sun...

280
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,791
You look like you
lost a friend or something.

281
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,708
[KAI] Come here
and I'll make it all better.

282
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,875
[KAI THINKS] At last...

283
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,541
This long-awaited
moment has finally come.

284
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,875
Oh, Sun, I'm gonna
hug you so tight, I--

285
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,291
[Sun cries out]

286
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,916
[CHIMP THINKS] What a klutz!

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,833
[SUN] Owie ow!

288
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,000
[Sun screams]

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,375
[SUN] No, please
don't write that down!

290
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,875
[AKENO] "She has a
psychologically fragile side."

291
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,375
How vexing.

292
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,416
Well, class haha. Today...

293
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,208
We're gonna add a drop of
liquid B to liquid A okay?

294
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,041
[insane laughter]

295
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,541
Be real careful!
You don't wanna lose a hand?

296
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,416
[NAGASUMI] Agghh! Oh crap,
you put in too much!

297
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,875
[NAGASUMI] Wh-What the...?

298
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,083
[MAWARI]
Something's smoking! Run!

299
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,083
[CLASS REP]
Everybody, duck and cover!

300
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:25,458
[DYNAMITE GINJI] Yes! At last!
It's finally here!

301
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:30,416
[insane laughter]

302
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
[MAWARI] Property damage...
Improper handling

303
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,166
of hazardous materials,
maybe I should teach--

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,250
[AKENO] Forget the exam.

305
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,041
I feel like Sun Seto might
be a lost cause anyway.

306
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,208
How vexing.

307
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,000
[NAGASUMI] Akeno!

308
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,125
[AKENO] Yes, Nagasumi?

309
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,875
Sun's acting really
strange today.

310
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,083
You just met, but do
you have any idea why?

311
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
I'm afraid I don't.

312
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,875
The best thing to do would
be to ask Sun directly.

313
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,333
[Sun sobs]

314
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,791
This isn't a good day.

315
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,416
[NAGASUMI] Oh, so this
is where you ran off to.

316
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,791
Hi there Nagasumi.

317
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,000
You've been acting
really funny today, Sun.

318
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,583
Is something bothering you?

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
--[SUN] Oh, no!
--[NAGASUMI] Uh, Sun...?

320
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,875
Not you! You're so cruel!
And you're twisted!

321
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,166
Me? I am?
What did I do?

322
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,625
No! Just wait!
Ya got it wrong!

323
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,000
Got what wrong?
Sun I...

324
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,708
Oh please! Have mercy!

325
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,875
What? But I haven't
done anything!

326
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,708
Please! I'm begging ya!

327
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,875
[SUN] I'll do anything
ya ask of me!

328
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,333
Just please don't
do that, I'm begging!

329
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,875
Sun! What's going on?

330
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,291
How vexing.

331
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,375
[CHIMP] Oh!

332
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,916
Over there in the
distance, my lord!

333
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,375
Busty Akeno!

334
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,208
And not just Akeno,
but Akeno in gym clothes!

335
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,625
[CHIMP] They're jiggling!

336
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,375
[CHIMP] Bouncy bouncy!

337
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,250
[CHIMP] Jiggly jiggly!

338
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,375
[CHIMP] I can't take it!

339
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,791
I'm heading into
meltdown mode again!

340
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,833
[KAI] You fool...!

341
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,416
I've already got
my heart set on Sun!

342
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
That new girl might
be busty and all but...

343
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,333
But I guess it's okay if
look and don't touch, right?

344
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,375
Of course, my lord!
Don't feel ashamed!

345
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,958
All we're doing is
following our instinct to

346
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,958
cherish and admire
something beautiful!

347
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,250
It's the natural bounciness
and jiggling of life!

348
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,708
It's not perverted at all!

349
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,583
[KAI] Really?
Hey, you're right, Chimp!

350
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
We can't go against
our natural instinct,

351
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,375
so I say we follow it!

352
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,000
[KAI] Forgive me, Sun!

353
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,041
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

354
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,750
[CHIMP] Just remember to
think happy thoughts, my lord!

355
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,750
[NAGASUMI] Could you guys
just go somewhere else?

356
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,833
I'm worried about Sun.
She's still not looking good.

357
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,916
I wonder what's
gotten into her today.

358
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,958
[SHARK] Nagasumi?

359
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,625
What might you be doing over
here away from all the others?

360
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,625
Skipping out on
my gym class are you?

361
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,541
And here you are, scoping out
the girls in their gym clothes?

362
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,875
No sir! But, those
two are certa--

363
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,458
[CHIMP] Go Isono! Fight!

364
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,000
[KAI] Oh!

365
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,458
[CHIMP] Fight!

366
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,000
[KAI] Oh!

367
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,750
[CHIMP] Fight!

368
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,875
[NAGASUMI]
That's just great...

369
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,250
Those two are pulling
this stunt once again?

370
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,583
[SHARK] You've sure got
guts lying to me, Nagasumi?

371
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,750
It looks like you really do
need to be taught a lesson?

372
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,125
A painful one?

373
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,583
Could you just
give me a break

374
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,583
and the benefit of the doubt
this one time, pretty please?

375
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,333
[SHARK] Not a chance?

376
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,041
[SUN] Fujishiro, no, stop!
Please don't do that!

377
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,083
No, there's nothing
to see over there!

378
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,125
Um, Sun,
are you alright?

379
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,458
[LUNAR] Hang in there,
Sun! I'm here!

380
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,666
[AKENO] Uh...

381
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,166
Hah! We'd rather of
smacked you right in the

382
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,375
face with our fist
instead of a dodgeball!

383
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,250
[LUNAR] You poor thing!
That looked really painful!

384
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,625
Your face is swollen!

385
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,291
Although not enough
for our tastes!

386
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,041
Consider this payback
for showing us up

387
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,458
in front of Akeno, you
damn Goody Two Shoes!

388
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,583
Hold on! I'll go to the
Nurse's office and get

389
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,416
Ms. Ren as fast as I can!

390
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,125
Ha! Like hell we will!
You can just stay here and

391
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,125
eat dirt for the
rest of the day!

392
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,583
[AKENO] That girl's like a pot
of negative emotions, isn't she?

393
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,000
Um, Akeno? Does this
make me a failure?

394
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,250
As a mermaid, no...
As a human, yes.

395
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,083
Don't let it get you down.

396
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,208
[SUN'S SOUL] Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama!

397
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,333
Your soul is
slowly escaping.

398
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,791
Hey um, Sun...?

399
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,250
Yes, Nagasumi?

400
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,041
I couldn't help but notice
you're acting really weird.

401
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,458
Whatever it is
that's bothering you,

402
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,333
you can talk to me about it.

403
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,333
[SUN THINKS] I promised
Akeno I wouldn't

404
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,916
tell anyone about the exam.

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't even talk to Nagasumi
about what's going on.

406
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,750
[NAGASUMI] Sun, what's wrong?

407
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
Thank ya, but I can
handle it on my own.

408
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,291
I really appreciate ya worrying
about my well bein', though.

409
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,750
Ya see... I'm gonna do
my best to protect

410
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,416
our life the way
it is right now!

411
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,583
Just watch me!

412
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,708
Yeah, but...

413
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,333
Don't worry
about me, 'kay?

414
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,958
'cause everything's gonna be
alright soon, I'm sure of it.

415
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,625
Ya hear me, Nagasumi?

416
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,458
Okay but... I...

417
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,500
I don't know why,
but if you insist.

418
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,291
then I'll respect
your wishes, Sun,

419
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,416
but please listen, don't push
yourself too hard, 'kay?

420
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,041
Okay... I promise I won't.
Thanks, Nagasumi.

421
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,708
I was certain you
were going to give up.

422
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,416
I thought you were going to
crack and tell him everything.

423
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,916
I gave ya my word
that I wouldn't tell.

424
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,666
It seems a person's
true nature shines

425
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,458
through in the end,
whether it's good or not.

426
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey, where's our dinner
lousy manservant, hurry up.

427
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,125
Just behave as
your usual self.

428
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,958
And try not to get nervous.

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,708
Yeah... you're right.
Departin' from my everyday self.

430
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,166
Well, that just went against
our kind's code of honor.

431
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,416
From this moment forward,

432
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,791
I'm back to bein'
the usual Sun Seto!

433
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,333
[VOICES] The Usual!

434
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,583
[SUN] Uh!

435
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,708
What the...?

436
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,750
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes!

437
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,875
Um... Akeno! What the
heck are you doing?

438
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,000
[AKENO] Nagasumi,
wipe off Sun's legs!

439
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,250
What?

440
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,375
[AKENO] And don't worry...

441
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,708
I won't let anyone
into this classroom!

442
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,041
[BURIO] Not if we have
anything to say about it!

443
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,375
Oh no, it's THEM!

444
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,916
[BOY E] The terrifying
trio that scared all

445
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,458
the other gangs in
school into submission,

446
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,958
even though those guys
are only second-year students!

447
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:54,875
[BURIO] Burio!

448
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,708
[AJITARO] Ajitaro!

449
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,083
[MAGURO] Maguro!

450
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,166
[FISH BROTHERS] The
toughest at Isono Junior High:

451
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,416
the Branchial Respiration Three!

452
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,125
You're about to find out why!

453
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,291
[AJITARO] Right, it's time we
paid you back for last night!

454
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,458
[AKENO] You all fail at trying
to hide your true selves!

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,875
[KAI] Not bad, but let me show
ya show some real moves.

456
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
[AKENO] You again, Kai?

457
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,291
Like I told ya before, I know a
little something 'bout swords!

458
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,166
[KAI] So allow me to
demonstrate the greatest

459
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,583
merman sword technique
of the marine world!

460
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,208
[AKENO] You fail again!

461
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,041
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

462
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,708
[GOZABURO] Hey, ya
little wastes of space!

463
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,416
Why aren't you in class?
Just what the hell's goin' on?

464
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
[BOY A] That's the toughest
person at Isono Junior High!

465
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,083
[BOY B] Gozaburo the
Japanese Teacher!

466
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,250
Mr. Seto...

467
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,208
Round up these
students, would you?

468
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,625
[GOZABURO] Alright, kids.

469
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,750
It's time we all got
back to class now.

470
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,458
[STUDENTS] You take
orders from Akeno?

471
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,041
[FISH BROTHERS]
It sure sounds like it! Gyo.

472
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,791
[SUN] Oh! Akeno!

473
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,875
Hey look, my legs
are back to normal!

474
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:54,583
[AKENO] Sun Seto!
You dunce! You fail!

475
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,291
[BOY F] That sword's real!

476
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,041
[BOY G] Holy cow!

477
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,875
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I know
I've seen this before,

478
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,166
but when Sun has a sword,

479
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,458
she becomes a
totally different person!

480
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,833
You moron!
I told you to be careful.

481
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,375
But instead of listening,
you screwed up again!

482
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,875
[AKENO] Not listening
is going to cost you!

483
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,458
[SUN] So then...
I guess I failed, didn't I?

484
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,750
[NAGASUMI] Sun?

485
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,166
[SUN] I'm sorry.

486
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,833
I tried my best, I really did,
but she says I fail.

487
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,750
Huh? What do you
mean by "fail?"

488
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,708
Hey, Nagasumi?
I know it's a lot to ask,

489
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,250
but would ya come
live with me in Seto?

490
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,250
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

491
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,125
Um... Akeno. Tell me...

492
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,541
How much longer will
I be allowed to stay here?

493
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:58,208
Hold on, both of you.
What did Sun fail?

494
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,083
And what does she
mean "living in Seto"?

495
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,250
Once I report this to all
the agencies who are involved,

496
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,541
you should be transferred
within one week.

497
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,125
Wait, transferred?

498
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,708
[SUN] A week? That's it?

499
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,208
[AKENO] However...

500
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,750
Much to my
shock and surprise,

501
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,916
I was unable to land
the blow of failure upon you.

502
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,416
That's the first
time that's happened.

503
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,416
[AKENO] Therefore I've
decided to defer this "fail"

504
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,041
until the day I do
manage to land that blow.

505
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,333
You're safe for now.

506
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,625
I am, really?

507
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,041
[AKENO] I just hope
that you've learned today

508
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
that you need to
apply yourself more.

509
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,916
[AKENO] Good answer.
I have high hopes for you, Sun.

510
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,750
Thanks, Akeno!

511
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,791
So what was
that about exactly?

512
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,625
[STUDENTS] Now Akeno's the
toughest at Isono Junior High!

513
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,166
[STUDENTS] Tough-est!
Tough-est! Tough-est! Tough-est!

514
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,750
[NARRATOR] As of lunch
break on her first day here,

515
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,916
Akeno Shiranui conquers
Isono Eighth Junior High!

516
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,541
[AKENO THINKS] How vexing.

517
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,916
[NARRATOR]
Her Mermaid Exam continues!

518
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,666
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

519

♪

520
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,125
[NAGASUMI] Akeno might be
a Mermaid Exam administrator,

521
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,583
but she's also earned
the rep of being the

522
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,750
toughest person at school
on her first day here!

523
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,333
It's sparked a
big war and everyone's

524
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,166
talking with their fists
instead of their mouths!

525
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,375
Our youth has been stolen
by violence and chaos!

526
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,750
The gangs are on the warpath,

527
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,583
and Akeno's the
one calling the shots!
