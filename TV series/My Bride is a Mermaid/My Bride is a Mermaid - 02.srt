Huh?

158
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,541
Why don't we link arms?

159
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:54,041
'Cause we are a couple now.
It only makes sense, ya see?

160
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I am
so dead! So dead! So dead!

161
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,500
[TOSHI] Yo Sun!

162
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,291
[SUN] Oh!
Hi, Toshi!

163
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,458
[TOSHI] How would ya
like some free taiyaki?

164
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,083
[SUN] Wow, thank you!

165
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
[TOSHI] And I got an extra large
taiyaki for your friend here.

166
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,458
Oh.
Why thank you.

167
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,958
I think he just restored
all my faith in humanity!

168
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,791
Don't tell me
that's a cell phone.

169
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,041
Um yeah, hello?

170
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
[GOZABURO] Ya better
kiss yer balls goodbye,

171
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,750
cuz' I'm gonna tear 'em off.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,333
You okay, Nagasumi?
Yer lookin' a little pale.

173
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,458
Yeah. I'm having
a great time!

174
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,583
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Look at her.

175
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,875
She's having so
much fun, there's

176
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,666
no way I can tell
her what's going on.

177
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,458
And it would be wrong
to drag her into this.

178
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,833
This is my battle to fight!

179
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,458
Are ya sure yer
feelin' alright?

180
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,291
Yer not getting'
sick of eatin, are ya?

181
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,500
Really, I'm fine.

182
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,250
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I haven't eaten all night.

183
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,833
Is there anything that
you feel like doin'?

184
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:52,750
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Yeah, I'd like to call

185
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,000
my family and say goodbye.

186
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,416
[KID] Goldfish! Goldfish!

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,458
[SUN] We should go to the
goldfish scoopin' station!

188
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,500
[NAGASUMI] Okay, sure,
if that's what you want.

189
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,208
There's somethin' ya
should know first.

190
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,958
I go to the goldfish scoopin'
station for goldfish salvation!

191
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,125
Ya see, failure to
save a single goldfish.

192
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,125
would disgrace
all Seto mermaids!

193
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,541
So...

194
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Oh, man.

195
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,666
It's kind of a miracle
nobody's realized

196
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,375
she's a mermaid
with the way she acts.

197
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,708
Wait a minute, if that guys'

198
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,166
an aquatic creature,
then why is he selling fish?

199
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,708
Isn't that like some
kind of trafficking?

200
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,041
[NAGASUMI]
I'm thinking too much.

201
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,541
Besides, no one's gonna
find out she's a mermaid,

202
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,375
cuz' nobody
believes in mermaids.

203
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,875
Well I guess I might as well
dive in and help her out.

204
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,583
[FISH VENDOR] What exactly
do ya think yer doin'?

205
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,541
Yer fish scoopin'
tank is over here!

206
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,375
[SHARK] C'mon and
get to scoopin', boy?

207
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,166
Holy crap, that's
not a goldfish!

208
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,000
It's Shark Fujishiro!

209
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,291
--Is this really how
--Time fer dinner? Small fry?

210
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,250
--I'm gonna die?
--Time fer dinner? Small fry?

211
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,625
[SUN] Nagasumi!

212
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,791
[SUN] Nagasumi!

213
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,500
[NAGASUMI] I'm not your dinner!

214
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,416
[SHARK] No fair?

215
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,916
--Are ya shittin' me?
--I just saw my life

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
--That fappy bastard just won?
--flash before my eyes.

217
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,375
Hey, get over here, sissy boy?
Help me back into my tank?

218
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,458
[NAGASUMI] I can't
understand you when you

219
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,750
make everything
sound like a question!

220
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,375
[SUN] Nagasumi!
My legs changed!

221
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,375
Just hang on I'm coming!

222
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,041
Sun, why did your
legs change back?

223
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,958
They automatically
turn back into a mermaid

224
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,500
tail the moment
they get wet.

225
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,958
We can't let anyone
see you like this.

226
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,583
They'll revert back as soon
as we dry them off, ya see.

227
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,125
[NAGASUMI] Got it!

228
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
[REN] I wonder if
those two are havin' a

229
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,708
good time on their date.

230
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,125
[GOZABURO THINKS]
That kid's gonna be too dead

231
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,583
to have a good time.

232
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,541
[GOZABURO] It's taken
care of, right, Masa?

233
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,875
[MASA] Yes sir,
but I gotta say

234
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,250
that I don't feel
good about this.

235
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,875
[GOZABURO] I don't
care how you feel!

236
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,208
This is for my
precious daughter,

237
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,333
now you whack
that little maggot!

238
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,166
[REN] Oh, dear.

239
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,666
Ya better not be
up to anything.

240
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,208
Who, me? What do
you mean? Never.

241
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,291
[MASA] Uh.
Uh-huh.

242
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,708
Is that so?

243
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,666
C'mon. That's--! No!

244
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,833
I can't spend all my time
worryin' about my daughter--

245
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,666
[NAGASUMI] Damn!
Your yukata's too wet!

246
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,625
[SUN] That hurts,
Nagasumi! Slow down.

247
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,791
Looks like they are
havin' a good time!

248
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,958
Oh, how romantic!

249
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,083
Young love is just
so spontaneous!

250
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,833
Hormones are out
of control at that age.

251
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,291
--Oh, god! Why, why, please, no!
--You bastard!

252
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,458
--It's not what you think!
--I'm gonna cut yer head off!

253
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,833
[SUN] Dad, no!

254
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,250
[NAGASUMI] They're back!

255
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,083
--You slimy little piss ant!
--[MASA] Please listen, boss!

256
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,416
--I'm gonna tear off your limbs
--[NAGASUMI] Masa?

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,041
--and make ya eat them!
--It's not what you think!

258
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,375
--Nobody touches my daughter!
--It's just a misunderstanding!

259
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,583
--I'm gonna chop you up into
--Sun's legs got wet

260
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,666
--a million pieces--
--he was helping her!

261
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,208
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Ahh... My savior!

262
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,916
The one who gave
me my first kiss!

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,250
[MOM] Good lord, he's hot.

264
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,666
What are you
doing here, Mom?

265
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,458
Huh?
Oh nothing dear.

266
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,708
I just wanted to make sure

267
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,833
you were having
fun on your date.

268
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,375
Quit lying!

269
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,125
I don't want to come
from a broken home!

270
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,208
[DAD] Time for
another talk, honey.

271
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,291
--[MOM] Bye, Masa!
--Yer parents are

272
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,208
--[MOM] Bye, Masa!
--already leavin'?

273
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,458
Didn't they just get here?

274
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
I'm pretty sure they
have a lot to talk about.

275
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,875
I don't get it.

276
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,833
So you weren't foolin'
around with Sun after all?

277
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,625
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

278
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,791
What's takin' ya so long?

279
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,333
Hurry up and get
your act together!

280
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS] What is wrong
with the adults in my life?

281
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,625
I might as well go
steal a motorcycle!

282
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,708
Ren! Quit
encouraging them!

283
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,541
Do you really want that
maggot touching her--

284
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,708
[SUN] Alright, Dad!

285
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,208
Admit it.

286
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,166
--[SHARK] Please help me!
--This is yer doin', isn't it?

287
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,833
Now apologize to Nagasumi!

288
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,750
What! Come on!
I can't do that!

289
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,541
No way. Sun--

290
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,000
Apologize!

291
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,583
I can't respect a father who
won't even act like a man!

292
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,916
[SUN] Father won't
act like a man.

293
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,083
You win this time, punk.

294
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,583
But. Next time
it happens,

295
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,833
you're gonna be
a pile of shark shit.

296
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,166
--[SUN] You didn't say sorry!
--[GOZABURO] Dammit.

297
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,041
[GOZABURO] Now my
daughter hates me.

298
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,416
[MASA] I know it seems tough.

299
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,875
You have to try to understand
how he feels though.

300
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,666
It's just a parental
love thing, that's all.

301
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,500
Uh. I guess so.

302
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,625
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
But I don't want to die for

303
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,291
his parental love thing.

304
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,958
Alright, Sun,
what do you say?

305
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,958
Don't you think it's
time to call it a night?

306
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,000
Not yet.

307
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,166
Are, you sure?

308
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,666
I'm not gonna
let my Dad ruin

309
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,750

And all I have to
do is avoid water,

Okay.

00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,708
Well I decided I'd
risk my life to be with

463
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,750
her and it's about
time I show her that!

464
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,541
[NAGASUMI]
I'll help you find it, Sun!

465
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,541
This ring is
important to me too!

466
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,000
We'll find it together!

467
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,416
Why thank you, Nagasumi.

468
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,083
[SUN] But ya can't help.
I've gotta find it by myself.

469
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,416
Not only could I never
forgive myself if I were

470
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,875
to lose a precious gift
from my future husband,

471
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,625
but it would also disgrace
all Seto mermaids.

472
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,291
Cuz' honor among thieves...

473
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,083
...is honor
under the seas!

474
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,250
Well. if that's
how you feel.

475
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,041
That ring is precious
to me, ya see.

476
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,708
[REN] Hey there, you two.

477
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,333
[REN] Did either of ya happen
to lose a ring by any chance?

478
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,666
Wow, thanks a lot Mom,
where'd ya find it?

479
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,083
Actually, your father
deserves the credit.

480
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,416
[SUN] Dad found it?

481
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,333
Thanks, Dad!

482
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,666
Thanks, Dad!

483
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,291
Don't ya ever call me that
again, ya little maggot!

484
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,291
[REN] Wanna know
what's kinda funny, though?

485
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:02,125
[REN] The night I wore that
yukata to that Bon Festival,

486
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,041
is the same night yer dad
bought me a ring and proposed!

487
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,375
Are you serious?

488
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,875
--Don't you try to compare us!
--No sir, no sir,

489
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,916
that's not what I was doing!

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Dammit, yer humiliatin' me!

491
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,125
Well you can't marry my

492
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,333
daughter if your
ring's in outer space!

493
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,208
It's Masa!

494
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,666
[SUN] No!

495
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,041
[NAGASUMI THINKS] My summer
memories are ruptured

496
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,083
eardrums and countless bruises.

497
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,583
[GRANDPA] Nagasumi.

498
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,041
Nagasumi.
Nagasumi.

499
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,458
[NAGASUMI] Is that...
It's my Grandpa!

500
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,291
[NAGASUMI] Grandpa!

501
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,375
[GRANDPA] What a
good grandson you are.

502
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,041
Comin' all the way
up here to visit me.

503
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,333
[NAGASUMI] Hey, Grandpa?
I'm really tired.

504
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,166
[GRANDPA] I bet
you're exhausted.

505
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,583
Ya oughta come live
up here with me.

506
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,583
Ya never get tired or hungry
and there isn't any fightin'.

507
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,458
[NAGASUMI] So this
is what Heaven's like.

508
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,166
[GRANDPA] Yep!
This is Heaven.

509
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,375
[SUN] Nagasumi!

510
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,708
[NAGASUMI] Huh?
Is someone calling my name?

511
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,666
[GRANDPA] No, Nagasumi!
Don't listen to that voice!

512
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,041
I want ya to stay here with me!
Don't leave, Nagasumi!

513
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,000
[SUN] Nagasumi!

514
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,833
Where did Grandpa go?

515
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,041
Oh, Nagasumi!

516
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,208
I was getting
worried the little

517
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,416
guy wasn't gonna wake up.

518
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,458
Sorry!

519
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,625
I didn't mean to
scream at you again!

520
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,375
[REN] Sun. Ease up,
you're hurting him.

521
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,333
I'm fine, thank you.

522
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,208
Why didn't ya
just stay dead?

523
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,125
Is that all you can
think of to say to me?

524
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,833
[SUN] I'm really
sorry, Nagasumi.

525
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:46,875
[Nagasumi laughs nervously]

526
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,041
Don't worry
about it, it's nothing!

527
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,375
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Yeah,
nothing compared to what

528
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,208
her father has in store for me.

529
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,916
I should enjoy it while I can.

530
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,333
So, you're okay?

531
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,958
Me?
I'm terrific!

532
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,625
♪

533
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,875
[NAGASUMI] A glittering sea!
A glittering desert island!

534
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,000
And a glittering Sun!

535
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,333
How much glitter can I get?

536
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,833
I can't believe we get to
spend some time alone,

537
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,041
far away from her father!

538
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,916
Just me, Sun,
and her tiny body guard.

539
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,458
Wait a minute!
That's a tiny assassin!

540
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,166
Next time: The Island
Closest to Heaven.

541
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,166
When are these people
gonna stop trying to kill me?
