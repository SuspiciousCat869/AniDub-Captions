[MAKI] Miss Sun!

310
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,583
If you keep singing,
you're going to

311
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,291
put Nagasumi to
sleep pretty soon, too.

312
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,000
[LUNAR] Why isn't
Nagasumi falling asleep?

313
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,000
Sun's singing so loudly!

314
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,666
His resistance
to her voice is

315
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,125
higher thanks to the mermaid
mineral water he drank,

316
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,833
so the song isn't
puttin' him to sleep

317
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,500
like it should a
normal human being.

318
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,083
[MAKI] So he's becoming
less and less human?

319
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,666
[SUN] Nagasumi!

320
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,000
[MAKI] It's no good!

321
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,958
The mermaid water's
driving him out of his mind!

322
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,125
He's gone berserk!

323
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,916
[MAKI] Cover yerself, ya maggot!

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,375
[BASEBALL PLAYER 1]
Okay, there it goes!

325
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,000
[BASEBALL PLAYER 2]
You're clear!

326
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,166
[GIRL ] Wow!
You're amazing, Mawari!

327
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,583
[GIRL] You beat your personal
best at the fifty meter!

328
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,041
[Nagasumi roars]

329
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,041
[BASEBALL PLAYER 3]
Strike Three! You're out!

330
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,125
[MAWARI] Oh dear...

331
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,166
...maybe I've been working
a little too hard lately.

332
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,208
[Nagasumi roars]

333
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,916
[CLASS REP] Mom! I think it's
time for some new glasses!

334
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,375
Oh my...

335
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,500
My son looks
quite a bit different.

336
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,083
He's grown since the
last time I saw him.

337
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,208
[SUN] Mother, please!

338
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,500
We hafta do
something to help Father!

339
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,041
What do you want
me to do with him?

340
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,750
He fell asleep
with his pants down.

341
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,208
That's enough to
destroy a lifelong love.

342
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,750
[MAKI] Oh no, Miss Sun!

343
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,166
Nagsumi's started
to wander away!

344
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
[SUN] We have to find
some way to stop him.

345
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,125
Lucky for all of us,
I'm always prepared.

346
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,750
I brought along back-up with
me in case of an emergency.

347
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,666
Now abandon
yer human form and

348
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,708
return to yer true self,
Octopus Nakajima!

349
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,208
[OCTOPUS] Octopy!

350
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,041
[GOZABURO] That's a good
octopus! Pin him down!

351
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,833
[SUN] This is turning into
some kinda monster battle.

352
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,458
[OCTOPUS] Octopy!

353
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,208
[GOZABURO]
Octopus lost to that brat!

354
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,625
[MAKI] Yeah,
and it didn't take long!

355
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,125
[SUN] Mother! Look out!

356
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,458
How many times
have we told you

357
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,416
to be nice to your
parents, Nagasumi?

358
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,958
Are you all right ma'am?

359
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,708
Masa.

360
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,291
Honey?

361
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,500
This isn't good! At this rate,

362
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,125
Nagasumi is gonna
smash up the whole town!

363
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,166
[KAI] Don't worry!
Leave it to me, Sun.

364
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,958
Wait, that voice.
It's Kai!

365
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,166
[KAI] Emergency surface!

366
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,250
Bring The Sea King up
as steep as you can!

367
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,125
My little man's
little man.

368
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,333
Poor Nagasumi!

369
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,833
[KAI] Do ya give up now,
Nagasumi Michishio?

370
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,416
You're shameless.
It's about time I took ya out!

371
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,291
Nagasumi's outta
his mind with rage.

372
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,666
It's too dangerous to let
'im keep rampagin'.

373
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,333
I have to do something.

374
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,125
[SARU] I'm here my lord!

375
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,416
[KAI] That was
impressive, Chimp.

376
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,833
I've brought the space
shuttle you requested my lord.

377
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,916
Here you go!

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,416
Chimp, way to go.

379
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,625
My lord.

380
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,375
Pre-launch preparations
have been completed.

381
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,916
This device right
here will launch it.

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,416
Right... now get back.

383
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,291
Okay!

384
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,291
Patch me to
command central.

385
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Preparations are complete.

386
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,500
[KAI] Prepare for launch.

387
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,250
[KAI] Main engines
in starting positions.

388
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:03,458
T minus five.
Four Three Two

389
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,333
[KAI] Liftoff!

390
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,041
[KAI] Alright.
We're safe now, Sun.

391
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,458
You can just give up
on Nagasumi, and--

392
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,000
Just what were ya thinkin'
doin' somethin' like that?

393
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,541
[KAI] Please calm down!
You'll always have me!

394
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,208
Give us that thing.

395
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,750
[SUN] Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

396
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,125
[LUNAR] Honestly!

397
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,708
[LUNAR] Here, we can link
up to the satellite feed.

398
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,000
[SUN] It's Nagasumi!

399
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,041
[LUNAR] He's still alive!

400
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,500
He's stompin'
around on the moon!

401
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,041
Sun, it's time
to face facts.

402
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,208
I know it's a real shame,

403
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,416
but I don't think
you have any other

404
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
choice but to give up on
Nagasumi for good.

405
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,250
It pains me too, but we're gonna

406
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,583
hafta go ahead
and kill the bastard!

407
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,333
No dad!

408
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,916
I'll take care of it!

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,333
Destroying Nagasumi
Michishio once and for all.

410
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,916
Stop talking
like that, Kai!

411
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,208
[KAI] Fire military satellite
missiles one through three.

412
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,750
[KAI] Any minute now,
the missiles

413
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,750
will hit Nagasumi from above.

414
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,791
Time for you to die,
Nagasumi Michishio!

415
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,291
Nagasumi!

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,041
Yeah, I did it!

417
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,166
Let's have a drink!
Time to celebrate!

418
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,916
[LUNAR] He's still alive!

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,458
[MAKI] It's amazing
what he can survive.

420
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,375
[SUN] Just look at that.
Nagasumi's crying.

421
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,041
He's crying because he
misses Earth so badly.

422
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,000
Sun.

423
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,416
Dad please!

424
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,333
Isn't there anyway that
we can save Nagasumi?

425
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,791
Anything?

426
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,250
Sun.

427
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,291
There has to be
something that I can do.

428
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,500
There has to be!
There has to be!

429
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,750
[Sun begins to sob]

430
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,250
Sun, I understand how
yer feelin' right now.

431
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,833
But ya have to forget abou--

432
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,541
[GOZABURO THINKS] Amazing.

433
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,291
Sun is even cute
when she's upside down.

434
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,041
[REN] Sorry I'm late, Sun.

435
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,250
[SUN] Mom, it's you!

436
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,250
Yeah, I was working
after school. Honestly.

437
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,833
[REN] When I saw giant
Nagasumi dancing naked

438
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,250
from the nurse's window,
I spit out my coffee.

439
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,458
[REN] That lance is
the famous 'Neptune.'

440
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,000
It's got purifying powers that
can correct physical problems.

441
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,125
[GOZABURO] When did you
get a hold of that thing?

442
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,416
It's one of our at-home
shopping products, actually.

443
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
[MASA] Dial carefully, now.

444
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,791
You don't wanna
miss this chance.

445
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,125
Wow, it's heavy.

446
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,125
[REN] Throw that lance and
pierce Nagasumi with it.

447
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,375
It's weight is the
weight of your feelings.

448
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,166
Your desire to save
Nagasumi will become

449
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,958
the power to purify him.

450
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,833
You can save him
with that lance, Sun.

451
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,916
My feelin's for
Nagasumi will save him.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,458
My feelin's are
going to save him!

453
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,833
[SUN] Who cares how far away the

454
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,333
moon is or how
heavy this lance is?

455
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,458
What kind of wife
am I if I can't help

456
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,333
my husband when he needs me?

457
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,291
[SUN] Don't worry.
I'll save ya, Nagasumi.

458
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,708
No matter what!

459
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,375
'Cause, honor among thieves...
is honor under the seas!

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,291
[SUN] Let my feelin's
save him. Please!

461
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,666
[SUN] I fell down.

462
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,625
[OCTOPUS] Hey look!
Octopus is backy now.

463
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,958
[MAKI] Wow...

464
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,583
