into a serious problem.

158
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,416
Oh, come on. A pop star
doesn't really need math.

159
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,416
Maybe not, but it isn't
just math in this case.

160
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,416
You've gotten
zeros on everything.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
It's unbelievable.

162
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,166
Are you collecting
them or something?

163
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,833
That's just mean!

164
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,458
We basically
steamrolled these

165
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,250
people into letting
us be teachers here.

166
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,875
At the very least
we have to give the

167
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,833
appearance of doing
our jobs correctly.

168
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,875
So what are you saying?

169
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,708
I'm telling you
this as a teacher.

170
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,500
If you don't
improve soon,

171
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,791
then I'm afraid you'll
have to, repeat the year!

172
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:16,875
NO!

173
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,916
[VOICES] Flunk out!

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,791
But I'm only
in middle school!

175
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,125
[MASA] No one ever
said life was fair.

176
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,625
Oh, you're having
study trouble?

177
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,250
Maybe I can help
tutor you if you want.

178
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,583
H-Hi, Zenigata.

179
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,125
That isn't a bad idea,
Miss Edomae.

180
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,166
"Miss"?

181
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,166
Uh, what I mean is,
maybe you should

182
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,791
take Zenigata up on that offer.

183
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,291
Oh, yeah sure.

184
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,458
[LUNAR THINKS] No way!

185
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,333
We can't ask this
wannabe cop to tutor us.

186
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,500
That would be humiliating!

187
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,708
[LUNAR] Oh, thank you so
much for the offer, really.

188
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,583
But all I have to do is
go back to my estate,

189
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,083
and there will be a whole team
of experts waiting to tutor me.

190
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,958
[MASA THINKS] Right. If she
had even one tutor at home,

191
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,458
she wouldn't be
getting grades like this.

192
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,041
Come to think of it, Lunar.

193
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,708
You mentioned
your estate just now,

194
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,541
but I don't think I know
where you're living.

195
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,875
Well, I keep it a secret,
since I'm a celebrity.

196
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,041
Oh, I see.

197
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,958
Between the paparazzi
and the stalkers,

198
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,458
it's a lot to have to deal with.

199
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,125
I hadn't realized how difficult
it is being a big star.

200
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,166
You're right about that.
It can be rough.

201
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,041
And as a result,
I've ended up neglecting

202
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,916
my studies for the first time.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,666
I'm always mentally
and physically

204
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,958
exhausted from my
hectic celebrity's schedule.

205
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,583
Stress is the
illness of our age.

206
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,083
Our little spaceship
called Earth is in trouble.

207
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,375
I think you
lost me somewhere

208
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,416
around the spaceship
part of that speech.

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,375
But anyway, we're
classmates, so you can feel

210
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,166
free to come to me with
any problem you have.

211
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,416
Oh! Thanks so much,
you're so sweet!

212
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,250
It means a lot to me to know
that I have a friend on my side.

213
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,375
[Lunar spits]

214
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,708
[LUNAR THINKS] Just saying
this stuff makes us sick!

215
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,958
You live in a much different
world than us, girl!

216
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,291
And don't you forget it!

217
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,750
But again, I really do
appreciate the offer, I mean it!

218
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,250
Thank you so much!

219
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,166
[MAWARI] Sure.

220
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,458
Well! I'll see
you later! Okay!

221
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,291
Lunar has such a lovely
smile, don't you think so?

222
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,500
[Masa groans]

223
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,041
What's the point
in calling food 'lovely'?

224
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,333
I can go ahead
and eat you now?

225
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,875
You keep up that harassment.
I'll have you arrested!

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,291
Okay, I get it.

227
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,666
Why should
someone like us

228
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,833
be forced to repeat
a grade in junior high?

229
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,291
This is a major
pain in the ass,

230
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,875
and we have to put
up with it because they

231
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,208
think that they can
measure a superstar,

232
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,958
by the same standards
as common people.

233
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,666
Compulsory education,
nothing you can do about it.

234
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,791
It's gotta be nice
to be so carefree.

235
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,875
Hey, I am not carefree.
I'm stuck tutoring a prima donna

236
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,500
who doesn't get
anything but zeros.

237
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,125
You're pissing me off.
Be more respectful!

238
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,875
You like this?
All right, here's more!

239
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,291
[NAGASUMI] I can never go back!
I can never go back!

240
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,666
[NAGASUMI] She bit
the hand that fed her.

241
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,250
Damn you manservant.

242
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,750
[NAGASUMI] Solve this by
memorizing the formula.

243
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,125
It's easy as that.

244
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,583
Wow, you're right.

245
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,208
You know, you're a
surprisingly good teacher

246
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,041
for someone who
doesn't get good grades.

247
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,916
It kinda helps that we're
still on the easiest part here.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,916
Whatever. Just get
on to the next part.

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,375
Could you sit
somewhere else?

250
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,875
Please, You're kinda heavy.

251
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,250
We are not heavy at all!

252
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,916
Now, would you be a good
chair and quit complaining?

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,958
Wait, now she's
treating me like furniture.

254
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,166
Hurry up and start
teaching us the next part.

255
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,375
Um, yeah, okay.

256
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,333
My...

257
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,833
Lunar, what is it?

258
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,000
Us sitting here is making
you a little bit hot, isn't it?

259
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,041
You were a big
fan of Lunar the pop star

260
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
long before you
met us in person,

261
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,916
isn't that right?

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,708
So, is this your fantasy?

263
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,916
You're beloved star
sitting here on your lap?

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,916
No, no of course it isn't.

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,291
[LUNAR] We're just going
to shift a bit. Don't mind us.

266
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,416
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
With her sitting there,

267
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,666
I'm losing my grip
on a lot of things.

268
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,041
And my heart
won't stop pounding!

269
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,916
A manservant shouldn't
have the hots for his master.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,958
But it's certainly entertaining.

271
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,125
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Come to think of it,

272
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,250
I was Lunar's fan
long before I met Sun.

273
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,375
I was Lunar's fan first!

274
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,541
[NAGASUMI] No, I can't!

275
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't do this, Lunar.

276
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,125
My loyalty belongs
to Sun, not to you.

277
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
Yes, that's right,
you are Sun's.

278
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
So why are you getting
the hots for us, then?

279
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,541
Really. You shouldn't
be doing something like this,

280
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,875
now should you?

281
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,958
Lu-Lunar, let's try
and stick to studying, okay?

282
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,041
[LUNAR] You have to pick
between one or the other.

283
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,625
Your marriage to Sun or
your place as our manservant.

284
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,750
Which is it?

285
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,416
I don't think that
I have to pick.

286
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,791
It seems I already have both.

287
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,250
There's only one
answer that we'll accept.

288
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,083
You're ours, Nagasumi.

that ya want to.

are talking about, Maki.

all kinds of things.

Ya know ya wanna tell me.

report this to Miss Sun.

No, go ahead, Maybe
it'll all be for the best.

No, it certainly
would not!

307
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,916
[MAKI] And of course
I can't forget to report

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,625
that Miss Lunar got
zeros on everything.

You can't do
that to us, Maki!

looks like hard work.

00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,000
It's makin' me kinda thirsty.

312
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,041
Oh, of course! I'll get
you a drink right away!

313
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,000
What is it?

314
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,541
[MAKI] Miss Lunar.

315
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,583
[MAKI] Miss Lunar...

316
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,083
Ya don't seem to think too
badly of the sea louse.

317
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,416
Do ya think?

318
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,916
Would ya mind hookin'
up with him a little bit?

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,208
What the heck? Where did
that idea come from?

320
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,416
Where'd it come from?

321
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,916
I've never seen someone
flirt that much with

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
someone who they didn't
like at least a little bit.

323
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,750
As if we'd ever fall for a
member of the human species!

324
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,875
There's no way!

325
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,166
[NAGASUMI] Here,
I brought that drink.

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, hey,
sea louse. Listen up.

327
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,208
You're never
going to believe this.

328
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,041
Miss Lunar told me--

329
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,875
[LUNAR] Why you!
Take that!

330
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,333
[NAGASUMI] Wait,
what's going on here?

331
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't understand,
but please don't stop it!

332
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,833
[MAKI] Basically it's
a choice between

333
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,250
marriage to Sun and
becomin' Lunar's servant.

334
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,791
[MAKI] As long as this
rat becomes one of us

335
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,833
sea folk one way or
another, it's all good.

336
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,375
Everyone can live.

337
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,833
If the Edomae could just take
the sea louse off our hands,

338
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,541
then he wouldn't
hafta marry Miss Sun.

339
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,291
He can be Miss Lunar's
manservant,

340
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,625
and that would solve everything.

341
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,750
[NAGASUMI AND LUNAR]
You quit butting in, Maki!

342
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,125
Why can't the two
of you just hook up, huh?

343
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,791
How can you suggest it?
We'd never date a human!

344
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,291
Ever since
Sun saved my life,

345
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,416
I swore that I'd give our
relationship all I've got.

346
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,916
And I meant that for life.

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,916
I don't care what it solves!
I'd never date stupid Lunar!

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
[LUNAR] What are
you talking about?

349
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,666
Are you saying that we
aren't as good as Sun?

350
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,916
Lunar, what the heck
do you even want?

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
[MAKI] I knew it!
You two are perfect!

352
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,791
Perfect for each other!

353
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,583
Shut up already!

354
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,083
[MAKI] What's the
matter, sea louse?

355
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,000
You're her fan, aren't you?
Why can't ya hook up with her?

356
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,458
What's the big deal here?

357
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,625
How can you even say
that with a straight face?

358
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,875
Anyway, forget it.

359
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,916
What I feel for Sun
goes way beyond that.

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,375
Sun Seto's the only one for me!

361
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
Then I guess
there's no choice.

362
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,583
If there's nothin'
Miss Edomae can do

363
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,041
to change your mind, sea louse.

364
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll just have to
seduce you myself.

365
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,166
[LUNAR THINKS]
Is this shrimp actually

366
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,166
saying she's sexier than us?

367
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,625
Take a look
at this, sea louse.

368
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,666
Is it sexy?
Is this what you like to see?

369
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,916
In the end, all men
are beasts, after all.

370
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,875
Shut up and put
that away, Maki!

371
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,833
[LUNAR] Manservant,
from now on you love only us.

372
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,375
That's an order!
You got it?

373
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
We'll take good care of you
as long as you obey us, okay?

374
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,416
You understand?

375
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,958
[NAGASUMI] I have no idea
what's going on anymore!

376
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,708
Miss Lunar, in the end
you're exactly like Miss Sun.

377
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,583
The two of you are
still nothin' but kids.

378
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,958
Ya lose yer human form after
the tiniest splash of water.

379
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,916
I can't hold on!

380
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,833
There you go, turning into
your mermaid form again.

381
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,708
Here's a towel to dry off.

382
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,833
[MAKI THINKS] Always
so quick to wipe off

383
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,875
a girl's legs, huh, sea louse!

384
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,291
You're my manservant,
aren't you?

385
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,916
Dry me off! Dry me off now!

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,625
Hey now, what's wrong?

387
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,416
Even if I am
a successful singer,

388
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,125
I always lose to
Sun! I'm a terrible student,

389
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,083
and even my manservant
thinks Sun is better than me!

390
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,291
I'm completely pathetic!

391
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,458
[NAGASUMI]
Like hell you're pathetic!

392
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,250
You aren't pathetic at all,
Lunar! Think about it!

393
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,791
You do mountains of
homework every day.

394
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,416
But I've never
done my homework.

395
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,416
You stay up until
midnight reading scripts,

396
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,666
and then you go into work
at five o'clock in the morning.

397
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,708
[NAGASUMI] And then
you show up at school.

398
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,250
You have a tough
time studying because

399
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,208
you're working as hard
as physically possible.

400
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,250
I won't let anybody get away
with calling you pathetic.

401
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,875
Not even you yourself!

402
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,583
[NAGASUMI] After all. I like
you, and don't you forget it.

403
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,833
But not as much
as you like Sun.

404
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,416
Oh, well. that may
be true, but Sun is--

405
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,916
Hurry it up! Come over
here and dry off our legs.

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,583
It's a manservant's
duty, after all.

407
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,166
[NAGASUMI] Uh, right.

408
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,583
[MAKI THINKS] You're
really workin' on that

409
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,458
manly honor,
aren't ya, sea louse?

410
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,375
I wonder how I should
report this to Miss Sun now.

411
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,833
[tires screaching]

412
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,208
[DAD] Again, I'm
truly grateful to you

413
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,625
Mr. Edomae for arranging
the construction,

414
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,500
and to you Mr. Seto for
paying for it, of course.

415
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,166
I only paid for the repairs.

416
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,541
I left your original thirty-year
mortgage as it stood.

417
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,291
You understand that?

418
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,416
For a wealthy mob man, 

419
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,583
you certainly know
how to be a tight-ass.

420
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,208
Oh, nothing!

421
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,583
[LUNAR PAPA] Lunar.

422
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,083
[DAD] Oh! Mr. Edomae,
would you like to see Lunar?

423
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,916
I'm sure she's in her room.

424
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,208
All right, Lunar.
How's this?

425
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,583
Yeah, just like that.
A little more.

426
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,375
[NAGASUMI] Here?

427
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,791
[LUNAR] Yeah, right there.

428
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,291
[Lunar giggles shyly]

429
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,000
[NAGASUMI] Huh?

430
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,958
Lunar.

431
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,708
[NAGASUMI] Um, sir.
It's not how it looks.

432
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,291
[LUNAR PAPA] That's it for you,
human. You're terminated.

433
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,416
[NAGASUMI] Her legs were wet.
I was just drying them off.

434
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,750
That's all, Dad!

435
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,916
[LUNAR PAPA] Who are you
calling 'Dad?' Terminate!

436
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,583
Quit being so
overprotective, Papa!

437
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,708
I'm going to drown
this human in the bay.

438
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,583
[VOICES] Ker-splash!

439
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,083
Don't you dare!

440
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,750
[SUN] Oh, it looks like Dad
and the others beat us home.

441
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,291
[SUN] What's going here?

442
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,833
[MOM] Yeah, could
someone explain?

443
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,208
[GOZABURO] Hello, Sun.
You've got excellent timing.

444
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,375
But, we need to talk.

445
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,666
What? How can this be?
Nagasumi cheated on me?

446
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,916
And it was with Lunar?

447
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,458
I believed in Nagasumi
up until now, my dear.

448
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,708
I really did.

449
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,166
I kept telling myself
that Nagasumi was a guy.

450
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,083
A guy I could trust with
the welfare of my only daughter.

451
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,416
But!

452
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,083
Our trust has now been
betrayed by this monster!

453
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,541
It's hard, I know.
It's difficult for me too,

454
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,250
but yer relationship
with him is over.

455
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,333
[Gozaburo starts to laugh]

456
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,666
Nagasumi?

457
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,916
[MOM] I only took my eyes
off him for one second.

458
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,875
It was an unfortunate
accident, dear.

459
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,833
Let's forget
about Nagasumi.

460
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,833
You can't forget about me!
I'm your precious only son!

461
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,833
Yes I need
a chopper ASAP.

462
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,541
There's a human
I need to drown.

463
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,750

Stop right now.
Leave Nagasumi alone!

am I supposed to do?

I caught him
touching your butt.

You're blowing
this out of proportion.

What?
You touched her butt?

No, this is a
misunderstanding!

Nagasumi says
it's a misunderstandin'

You can't believe a
word that this maggot says!

474
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,625
Have the courage
to face the truth.

Reality is harsh.
Nagasumi, rest in peace!

You'll marry Lunar or die.

Well, Sun. Yeah.
Th-That's right!

492
