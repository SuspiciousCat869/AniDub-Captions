What the--

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,375
[CHIMP] Lunar,
you're off work today?

160
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,666
Wow, that's rare!

161
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,375
We're off work for the
next few weeks, actually.

162
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,416
Hey, Chimp.

163
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,666
Oh... good mornin', Chimp.

164
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,041
Ah, looking at Sun
really wakes me up!

165
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,833
Yeah, whatever...
Let's get moving.

166
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,458
[SUN] Ya sure are in a bad mood
this mornin', huh, Lunar?

167
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,458
[LUNAR] You would be too,
if you finally got a break from

168
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,208
work and it was
after the field trip!

169
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,125
[NAGASUMI] So that's why, huh?

170
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,208
I'll be happy to help
ya with the research

171
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,166
paper assignment ya
missed while ya were gone.

172
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,708
You should just let
us put our name on yours.

173
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,541
No, that would
be cheating!

174
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,750
Whatever!

175
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,666
Some friend you are,
Miss Goody Two-Shoes!

176
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,541
Hey, watch where
you're going, you stupid--

177
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,291
[LUNAR] Pa--

178
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,083
[LUNAR'S PAPA] Negative.

179
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,416
This set of choices
is for Akiharu,

180
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
the main character of the game.

181
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,541
Today I have
to play the heroine,

182
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,791
and as a result,
react to Lunar's choices.

183
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,666
(high pitched voice)
Akiharu, uh, I mean, Lunar!

184
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,791
You slept in, too? Not again!

185
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,708
Look what happens
when I don't wake you up!

186
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,875
You're so bad!

187
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,458
[LUNAR'S PAPA] Lunar, hold up!
Wait for me, please!

188
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,750
What the--

189
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,291
Was that who
I thought it was?

190
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,041
Uh huh, and if
my dad did something

191
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,500
like that in front
of me, I'd just die.

192
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:45,666
[alarm bell ringing]
[baby crying]

193
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,666
[SUN] He's still wearing
that school uniform.

194
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,083
But why? Why?

195
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,583
Oh make him stop, please!

196
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,958
M-M-Maybe
I sh-should teach

197
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,250
you the r-r-rules
of this s-society.

198
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,458
Hey, why's the
alarm goin' off?

199
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,291
So you're the reason someone
set off the alarm! Huh?

200
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,458
(high-pitched voice] Oh, dear!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Seto!

201
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,750
Not as sorry as
you're gonna be

202
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,375
when I'm done kickin' your butt!

203
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,375
[LUNAR'S PAPA] Oh, dear!

204
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,708
[GOZABURO]
Let's take this outside!

205
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,083
[LUNAR'S PAPA] Yessir!

206
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,583
[GOZABURO] So you're
Cross-dressin' now, huh?

207
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,541
I never figured ya
for the type Edomae.

208
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,500
[LUNAR'S PAPA]
{normal voice] Negative.

209
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,291
I'm only doing this
for my daughter's sake.

210
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,458
What?

211
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,625
Can you say you
understand your daughter?

212
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,041
Do you know why she cries?

213
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,625
Wait, don't tell me
your cross-dressin'

214
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,208
has somethin' to do with this!

215
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,416
Yes...

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
The father-daughter bond
between me and Lunar

217
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,500
is in danger of
being terminated,

218
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,916
like yours and Sun's.

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,750
It's in danger?

220
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,666
[GOZABURO] Well,
now that ya mention it,

221
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,708
ya might have a
point there, Edomae.

222
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,916
When Sun said she was gonna

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,666
marry that maggot,
I had no clue what

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,375
my little girl was thinkin'.

225
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,916
Gozaburo Seto...

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,291
We are both trying to make up

227
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,125
for failing to understand
our daughters.

228
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,791
I have involved
myself personally in the

229
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,916
life of mine while
you watch yours afar.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,208
Hey...!

231
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,500
Are ya sayin' I haven't
been tryin' as hard to

232
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,541
understand my daughter
as ya have with yours?

233
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,666
Yes.

234
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,875
So do ya have
any advice on what

235
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,583
else I can do
for her at this point,

236
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,333
aside from watchin' over her?

237
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,791
Use this and you
will have no problemo.

238
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,500
[GOZABURO] Huh?
"After School Love Hearts?"

239
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,708
[school bells chime]

240
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,583
Fujishiro...

241
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,916
Do you not have
a class to teach?

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,875
Oh, yeah, I guess
I do? So what?

243
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,083
You got a problem
with that or something?

244
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,458
Not really?

245
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,541
If that's so, then how come
you're not doing your job?

246
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,458
I didn't swear an oath to
the Seto outfit to play teacher?

247
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,125
In this place, all I am
is a glorified babysitter?

248
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,000
So yeah...

249
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
I guess I do
have a problem?

250
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,958
[MASA] I see...

251
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,875
Then you've also got a problem
with the Boss's orders!

252
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,000
[MASA] In our world,
if the Boss calls

253
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,666
something a spade, it's a spade.

254
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,083
Period. Got it?

255
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,958
[MASA] What the
Boss says is absolute!

256
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,208
[MASA] Are you going back
on the oath you swore to him?

257
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,458
Let me remind
you that an oath

258
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,625
isn't something
to be taken lightly.

259
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,958
Hey there guys!

260
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,916
We gotta beat this game
so I can solve my problem!

261
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,875
[MASA] Huh?

262
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:06,916
[GOZABURO] Now accordin'
to what I've heard,

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,625
there's lots of
girls in this game.

264
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,416
It's all about how they think
and feel and act and stuff.

265
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,708
We're each gonna
play as one of

266
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,083
these characters here
and then we're gonna

267
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
memorize all the
things they do and say!

268
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,375
So take your pick!

269
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,250
Hold on what? Boss.
And why would we do that?

270
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,458
Well isn't it obvious?

271
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,791
By playin' as these girls,

272
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,333
we're gonna learn
how they think and act,

273
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,708
and experience what
they're feelin' in their hearts!

274
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,875
This game is gonna help me

275
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,500
understand what's
goin' on in Sun's heart!

276
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
[MASA] What... no Boss. 
I don't--

277
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,208
I thought what the Boss
said was absolute?

278
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,333
[dog howls]

279
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,666
[FISH BROTHERS]
Gyo, gyo, gyo, gyo...

280
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,833
[GIRL NEXT DOOR]
Akiharu, you slept in, too?

281
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,750
Look what happens
when I don't wake you up!

282
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,125
You're going to have a tough
future if you don't shape up!

283
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,333
Bad boy!

284
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,500
[TSUNDERE] Forget him.

285
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,625
You need to leave
Akiharu alone sometimes.

286
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
It'll do him good
to get in trouble.

287
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,875
[GOZABURO]
"Boo hoo."

288
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,583
[LITTLE SISTER] Big brother,
you forgot something!

289
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,333
Here, take your lunch box.

290
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,000
[GOZABURO]
"Oh, sorry, sorry."

291
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,208
[BARBARELLA] Oh, look meow-t!

292
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,125
[BARBARELLA] Meow.
If I didn't have a cushion,

293
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,375
that would've been dangerous!

294
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,625
[GOZABURO] "Who're
you calling a 'cushion?'"

295
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,791
[BARBARELLA] My cushion
is grumbling, meow!

296
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,083
[GOZABURO] "Anyway,
you do realize I can

297
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,208
see your underwear, right?" 

298
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,666
[GOZABURO]
"Ugh?"

299
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,875
[BARBARELLA] Pervy humans
get the death penalty, meow!

300
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,041
[GOZABURO]
"Boo hoo?"

301
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,583
[GOZABURO] Huh?
What the hell's goin' on?

302
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,750
When do I get to start
playin' this damn game?

303
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,750
[MASA] Actually, I think you've

304
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,291
already started
playing it, Boss.

305
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,625
[SHARK] Which one's the enemy?

306
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,708
None of them.

307
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,833
It says here that the
goal of the game

308
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,500
is to set off
something called "flags."

309
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,125
[GOZABURO] "Flags?" What, like
Capture the Flag or somethin'?

310
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,541
A buncha grown
men sittin' around

311
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,416
playin' gal games is just gross!

312
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,666
Oh, come, on,
give 'em a break!

313
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,250
It's just harmless fun, gyo!

314
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
Yeah, and I remember
we used

315
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,208
to play a few
of them ourselves, gyo!

316
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,000
Not a few,
but a lot, gyo!

317
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
Gyo, gyo, gyo, gyo!

Hey, that makes Haneman!

[MAKI] Zugan!

323
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,625
What the hell?

324
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,500
Hey, why can't I flirt
with the school nurse!

325
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,666
[MASA] It says here she's
just a side character.

326
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,166
Crap!

327
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,583
Well, if I can't flirt with her,
I might as well drown her!

328
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,583
[SHARK] It won't let
you do that, either?

329
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,125
[MASA] All due respect,
I don't know if you

330
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,208

a girl's heart this way.

331

[GOZABURO] Don't give
me that crap, ya moron!

332
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,541
I'm gonna become totally

Ya hear me?

334
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,333
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Sun.

[MASA] Big brother.
Big brother.

336
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,291
[NAGASUMI] Huh?
What big brother? Is that me?

337

[LITTLE SISTER] Big brother!

No, I'm not Masa.

I'm your little sister.
I'm Masako.

342
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,750
[NAGASUMI] What the
heck are you talking about?

343
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,583
[MASA] Big brother,
please answer me honestly.

--Please tell us, Big brother.
--[MASA] Do you think I'm moe?

345
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,791
[NAGASUMI] What? M-Moe?

346
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,791
What I'm asking
is if I have

347
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,916
little sister moe going on.

348
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,166
[NAGASUMI] I don't
understand what you mean.

349
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,291
[MASA] I see.

350
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,750
For that matter,
what is moe, anyway?

351
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
Masa?
You okay?

352
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,958
Are you having a mid-life
crisis or something?

353
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,625
[MAKI] Look closer, sea louse!

354
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,708
[NAGASUMI] Maki!

355
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,208
What you're seein'
now is a real man!

356
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,208
[MASA] Maki?

357
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,583
A man so committed
to helping the

Sun that he'll do anything,

359
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,541
including dressing
up like a girl!

360
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,958
Oh, by the way...
that ribbon looks cute on ya!

It does? I look good?

[MAKI] Ya look moe to me!

363
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,458
Real moe!

364
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,958
Oh, so that's why.

365
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,791
It's all because of something
Sun's Dad is up to.

366
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,416
[LUNAR'S PAPA]
{high-pitched voice) Oh, no!

367

Don't look at me, you jerk!

Him, too, huh.

369
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,916
I've been told
that Mr. Edomae

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,375
is doing "the girl
who lives next door" moe.

371
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,750
That's what the
anguish of a man with

372
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,791
a teenage daughter
looks like, sea louse!

373

No! I don't want
to go to school today!

Miss Sun, why not?

375
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,541
What on earth's the matter?

376
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,625
If you don't hurry,
you'll be late for class, Sun!

377
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,833
[MAKI] Please, Miss Sun,
you've gotta go!

378
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,708
The Boss is waitin' for
ya there in full moe mode!

[SUN] No, I said
I don't wanna go!

380
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,583
[LUNAR] Come on, Sun!

381
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,000
You have to
suffer the same agony

382
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,083
that we did yesterday,
so move it!

Nice to meet you!

My name is Gozakko!

Pretty strong wind
today, huh, Lunar?

389
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,375
Yeah. We'll say.

390
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,833
It's dried all
of our tears away.

391
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,250
Maybe I should just
run away and disappear.

392
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,458
We'll go with you.

Why did you run
away all of a sudden?

396
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,750
If there's something
troubling you,

students and no one's learning!

407

You're supposed to
be fathers and teachers,

408
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,208
so do something to fix this!

409

[GOZABURO] Uguu!

turn and I'm in trouble!

The two of us
have talked things over.

416
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,041
[MASA] This isn't easy
to say, but we've decided to

417
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,458
take back our oaths to the Seto
outfit and stop working for you.
