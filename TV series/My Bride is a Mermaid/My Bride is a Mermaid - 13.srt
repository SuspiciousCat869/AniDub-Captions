155
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,583
person at all,
who I could talk straight with.

156
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,500
[LUNAR] But she has it
all now, everything!

157
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,541
She has family.

158
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,708
And friends.

159
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,250
And she's a good singer.

160
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,041
And she has you!

161
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,291
[LUNAR] And then there's me.

162
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,708
Compared to her, I have nothing.
Nothing at all!

163
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,583
Lunar.

164
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,208
[LUNAR] So you...
You have got to love me!

165
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,583
More than you love her!

166
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,291
[NAGASUMI] This is
what we're wearing?

167
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,208
[LUNAR] Yes, and it sure
looks good on you.

168
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,041
Uh, does my unveiling
ceremony really

169
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,875
need to be this
big of a deal though?

170
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,333
Silly, you don't even know
what a big deal looks like yet.

171
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,125
[LUNAR] Come on, let's relax
and enjoy ourselves.

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,750
Not this all over again!

173
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,666
[MOM AND DAD] Nagasumi!

174
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,458
[NAGASUMI] Mom! Dad!

175
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,916
[DAD] Now, mind
your p's and q's, son.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,333
[MOM]
Be a good boy tonight, okay?

177
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,041
[NAGASUMI]
Real helpful.

178
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,416
The east-meets-west
yakuza get together.

179
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,875
[LUNAR] That was where...

180
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,708
...we met Sun
for the first time.

181
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,958
[LUNAR] The first East-West get
together was a special ceremony.

182
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,833
It was intended to
mark the two groups'

183
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,750
reconciliation after
years of gang warfare.

184
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,958
This hall we're in now
is the grandest place

185
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,791
to hold a ceremony in the
underwater yakuza world today.

186
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,625
[EDOMAE MEMBER A]
Who the hell is that

187
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,166
pale-faced little weakling?

188
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,500
[EDOMAE MEMBER B]
Apparently he was a guest

189
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,250
member of the Seto gang.

190
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,416
[SETO MEMBER A]
That's the sea louse who

191
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
was toyin' with Miss Sun?
The maggot!

192
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,541
[SETO MEMBER B]
I'd like to whack 'im.

193
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,708
[NAGASUMI THINKS] It's all over.

194
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,333
I'm a dead man!
They're going to kill me!

195
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,250
Let's get started.
We'll begin with introductions.

196
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
This is the human
who'll be marrying Lunar.

197
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,041
His name is Nagasumi Michishio.

198
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,708
'Kay, Nagasumi.
Say a few words.

199
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,791
[NAGASUMI] Um. Um. Um.

200
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,083
Hi everybody, my name
is Nagasumi Michishio.

201
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,666
You Dirty rat!
How dare ya smile!

202
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,041
[SETO MEMBER C] Is it
true ya kidnapped Miss Sun,

203
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,166
toyed with her, used her up,

204
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,041
then tossed her
aside like an old rag?

205
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,875
Quiet, you! The introduction
ain't over yet.

206
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,458
Can't you show some respect?

207
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,416
Damn hicks only need
an excuse to go wild.

208
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,666
[SETO MEMBER A]
I'll show you wild!

209
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,166
[DYNAMITE GINJI]
Shut yer damn traps, all of ya!

210
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,291
[DYNAMITE GINJI] Maybe I'll
take all of ya out with me!

211
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,750
[SETO GANGSTER C]
Ooh, I like it!

212
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,291
Dumbass! We are not about to
let ourselves die with you!

213
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,291
[SHARK] Bye-bye?

214
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,625
[GOZABURO] You're
running a little late, Masa.

215
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,666
[NAGASUMI] Masa!

216
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,000
[MASA] Boss.

217
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,833
I told the school you were
out taking a sick day.

218
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,166
Oh please...

219
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,583
Why should I care about
any of that stuff anymore?

220
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,208
After all, things have changed.

221
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,166
With these new developments,
there's no need for

222
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,375
us to play teacher or
stay in Saitama anymore.

223
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,958
Are you serious
about this? Well?

224
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:52,958
Masa.

225
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,708
[Gozaburo laughs]

226
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,625
Nagasumi, ya maggot,
thank ya for takin'

227
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,916
care of my precious
little Sun for so long.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,666
Sweet, darling little
girl that she is,

229
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,000
she's still telling me not to
mess with you or anything.

230
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,291
So we'll just let bygones
be bygones, okay?

231
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,291
[NAGASUMI]
So you'll just sit back

232
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,791
and watch the chaos, then?

233
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,291
Well, frankly, I'm in a
pretty good mood right now.

234
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,666
But, Nagasumi...

235
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,125
I'd be watching my back
real carefully if I was you.

236
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,083
[GOZABURO] Edomae
isn't lettin' it show,

237
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,000
but he's in a royally bad mood.

238
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,541
Can't blame him.

239
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,666
Havin' a piss ant like you take
his only daughter from him.

240
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,333
Human, ceremonial sake.

241
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,375
[LUNAR PAPA]
Drink it and you'll be

242
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,708
a made man in the Edomae.

243
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,208
Drink it and swear
never to betray Lunar.

244
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,333
[NAGASUMI] No.
I cannot drink this sake.

245
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,833
[murmurs]

246
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,500
Lunar. This isn't how you
find love for yourself,

247
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,416
by ordering someone to love you.

248
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,375
I'm sorry, but it
just doesn't work that way.

249
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:23,833
[Lunar begins to cry]

250
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,750
[LUNAR] All of that...

251
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,250
All of that begging
I did wasn't enough?

252
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,375
Look, Lunar!
Don't you get it?

253
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,083
Can't you see how much
your father cares about you?

254
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,791
[LUNAR] No, stop, Papa!

255
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,750
[NAGASUMI] True, he sucks
at expressing his love.

256
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,000
He's so bad at it,

257
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,541
it's almost
impossible to believe.

258
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,333
But look at how
he's acting right now.

259
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,666
Look at how angry he is
at me for making you cry, Lunar.

260
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,583
[NAGASUMI] Just take a second
and see how loved you are.

261
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,708
And I care about
you too, Lunar.

262
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
That's why I can't go
along with a ceremony

263
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,291
that's tainted with
lies like this, you see?

264
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,583
[gasps]

265
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,000
[LUNAR PAPA] Lies?
Lunar, what does he mean

266
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,916
when he says
'tainted with lies'?

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
[LUNAR] The reason. I was
naked from the waist down

268
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,833
that time was because I had

269
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,333
just turned back
from my mermaid form.

270
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,666
[LUNAR] That's all.

271
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,916
Nagasumi and I don't
have a special relationship.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,708
[LUNAR PAPA]
Why did you think you

273
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,458
needed to lie about it?

274
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,333
[LUNAR] I wanted win against
Sun by stealing him from her.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,208
You don't have
anything to prove.

276
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,666
I accept you for you.

277
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,458
Please just open
your mind, Lunar.

278
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,416
Open your mind. Okay?

279
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,208
You usually seem
like a cyborg, Papa,

280
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,625
but you can talk like
a parent sometimes too.

281
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,458
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Oh, good, things should

282
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,541
be all settled on this end.

283
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,625
Now I can go back to Sun.

284
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,916
[LUNAR] Nagasumi.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,041
Not 'manservant'?

286
00:14:56,041 --> 00:15:00,791
[LUNAR] I'm sorry.
And I... love you.

287
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,541
[LUNAR PAPA] Is that
the truth, Lunar?

288
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,875
We're starting
this all over, human.

289
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
You will take care of Lunar.

290
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,625
[SUN] Hold onto that
sake for a minute!

the same way I do

hold onto that sake.

461
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,083
That's a long time to be gone.

462
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,833
[MAWARI] Just give it
up and confess already.

463
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,250
We got sick and just kept
passing it back and forth.

464
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,458
[SUN] Yeah, that's right.

465
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,791
The same with Mister Seto?

466
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,250
Yeah.

467
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,208
I don't buy
it for a second.

468
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,666
My cop sense tells me there was

469
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,750
some huge incident
I should know about.

470
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,916
[NAGASUMI] No,
there was no incident.

471
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,291
Nope, none at all.

472
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,166
Yep. Everybody got
along really well.

473
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,791
[SUN] It's okay, Dad.

474
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,875
Ya can forget what I said
about cutting family ties.

475
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,500
And also, Mom told me to
tell you to snap out of it.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,291
[GOZABURO] I'm back!

477
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,250
[NAGASUMI] Wow, that
was a rough few days.

478
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,250
Well, that closes the book
on My Bride is a Mermaid.

479
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,583
Yeah, right!

480
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,000
Even back in Saitama
with everything sorted out,

481
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,791
my life continues
to be complicated.

482
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,166
A new enemy's coming for me,

483
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,625
and the only weapon
that I've been given is a cat.

484
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,875
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
