00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,875
Congratulations!

158
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,500
[SUN] I couldn't've
done it without ya!

159
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,000
[NAGASUMI]
Really? Hey.

160
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,125
Uh, this card isn't
it your favorite, Mawari?

161
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,333
[MAWARI] Yeah...

162
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,291
...that one's always
been my favorite.

163
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,250
[SUN] Look, Nagasumi!
I did it.

164
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,583
[NAGASUMI] Congratulations!

165
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,583
What the heck has gotten
into you now, Mawari?

166
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,041
When did I start being
such a pouty girl?

167
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,333
[MAWARI] There's
something about watching

168
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,083
Nagasumi with Sun
that bothers me.

169
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,666
[MAWARI] It feels like a police
siren is going off in my heart.

170
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,291
[MAWARI] We have an
emergency on our hands!

171
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,000
This is a code red!
This is no way for me to behave!

172
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,166
Get your act together,
Mawari Zenigata!

173
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,708
[MAWARI] Starting tomorrow,
I'll double my efforts!

174
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,333
[MAWARI] You there!

175
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,166
No walking more than two
abreast on the sidewalk!

176
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,333
And you two over there!

177
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,125
No flirting on your
way to school!

178
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,583
You, young man!

179
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,791
No messing with your cell
phone while you're walking!

180
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,708
Hey you stop
that right now!

181
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,875
Maybe you all need to be taught

182
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,958
a lesson about the
rules of this society!

183
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,416
[NAGASUMI] See you later.

184
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
I'll take another
beer, please.

185
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,208
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Mawari!

186
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,291
[SUN] Officer Mawari, uh.

187
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,375
[MAWARI] You two over there!

188
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,708
Do you care to explain
to me why you're

189
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,833
coming out of the
same house together?

190
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,125
Whoa that's bright!
Turn it down.

191
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,333
That's right. And now
you're gonna talk.

192
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,791
Tell me why you and Sun came out
of the same house this morning.

193
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,666
Did you hear the
latest news, neighbor?

194
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,750
You'll never believe it!

195
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,375
Nagasumi and Sun
were seen coming

196
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,916
out of the same
house this morning.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,208
Oh, well, I never!

198
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,875
I wonder what
their relationship is!

199
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,125
[NAGASUMI]
My husband can't find out.

200
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,666
Don't tell him.
I'm begging you!

201
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,250
This is awful!
Poor Nagasumi!

202
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,708
Officer Mawari's
taken him into custody!

203
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,500
So what's your answer?
You gonna squeal?

204
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,333
Ya see, Sun and
I have our reasons.

205
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,458
And they're good ones.

206
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,666
Reasons? Oh, now
this I'm interested in.

207
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,041
Please, tell me one good
reason a couple of junior high

208
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,041
school kids are sleeping
together under the same roof.

209
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I don't know why,

210
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,333
but this little act of
hers is exciting me.

211
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,958
[MAWARI] Well, what
do you have to say.

212
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,000
Your 'reasons,'
can't wait to hear them.

213
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,541
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I don't mind this too much.

214
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,333
Maybe I'll keep my
mouth shut a while longer.

215
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,250
[MAWARI] Here...

216
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,750
Fried pork with rice!

217
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,416
You'd better eat it while
it's still hot, don't you think?

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,000
[NAGASUMI THINKS] It looks so
good, but I have to be strong!

219
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,916
Oh, why do I feel such
a burning need to eat this?

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,250
--[SUN] Don't do it Nagasumi,
--My mouth is watering just from

221
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,583
--I'm warnin' ya!
--sitting here looking at it.

222
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,166
[MAWARI] So why don't
you take a little bite?

223
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,500
[NAGASUMI] Don't mind if I do.

224
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,625
[SUN] He's done it!
It's all over! Mawari wins!

225
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,708
[MAWARI] Just fess up, Nagasumi.
You'll feel much better.

226
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,875
Oh, the truth
is pretty simple.

227
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,750
Sun and I are
living together now.

228
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,916
[GOZABURO] Seriously?

229
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,791
The two of you
are living together?

230
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,375
What's the
meaning of this?

231
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,875
Please spare me,
Officer Mawari!

232
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,041
The two of
them are related.

233
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,291
That's why they live together.

234
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,666
Oh, so you're
related now, huh?

235
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,583
Where are your parents then?
What are they doing?

236
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,791
Um, Officer Mawari,
ya see, my dad is--

237
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,333
I'm right over here, darlin'.
Don't you worry about me haha.

238
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,625
[SUN] He's usin'
some old-fashioned

239
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,958
instruments of
torture on Nagasumi.

240
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,250
[GOZABURO] No way in
hell I'll ever let a filthy

241
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,208
maggot like you live with
my Sun, ya hear me?

242
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,458
You're gonna pay for this!

243
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,791
[NAGASUMI] No, please stop it!

244
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,791
Okay, I understand now.
Mister Seto is Sun's dad.

245
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,958
I did wonder about that,

246
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,750
given that their last
names are the same.

247
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,041
In that case,
what about your mother?

248
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,583
Where is she hiding, huh?

249
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,125
--Alright you puny piss-ant.
--[SUN] Um, my mother is.

250
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,458
[REN] Time for you to calm down.

251
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,958
[SUN] My mom's over there.
looking after my dad.

252
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,000
[BOY 1] They came to
school as a family?

253
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,541
[BOY 2] Can a parent be in
charge of his child's class?

254
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,208
[SUN] We got the
principal's permission for it.

255
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
[MAWARI] Sun, tell us exactly.

256
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,000
[CLASS] Who are you?

257
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,333
[MAWARI] Is the rest
of your family living

258
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,833
in Nagasumi's house with you?

259
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,708
[SUN] Naw, Mom and
Dad live somewhere

260
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,041
else 'cause of,
family circumstances.

261
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,125
[BOY 1] That complete loser...

262
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,791
[BOY 2] ...is actually
living with Sun?

263
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,833
[NAGASUMI] Sun, I'll save you!

264
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,458
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Sun got hit full-on with water!

265
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,041
She'll change back
into mermaid form!

266
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,208
[NAGASUMI] Sun,
are you all right?

267
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,416
Here, let me dry
your legs for you.

268
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,333
It shouldn't take too long.

269
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,208
I'm really sorry
about that, Sun.

270
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,166
[BOY 1] Nagasumi, you dirty rat.

271
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,208
[BOY 2] How dare you
rub her legs like that!

272
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,666
What's going on?
I saw it a tail.

273
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,416
I don't know what the heck is
going on with these people!

274
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Mawari
was acting weird yesterday.

275
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,458
Could she have seen Sun's tail?

276
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,541
Mermaid law states that
if a human finds out

277
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,833
about one of the sea folk,

278
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,250
either the human or
the mermaid has to die.

279
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,833
But today Mawari's
just been studying

280
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,416
like normal, so maybe
there's no problem.

281
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,708
Yeah, of course. Anyone
would think it was just

282
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,416
their eyes playing
tricks on them.

283
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,708
Oh no, my hand slipped.
I spilled some water!

284
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,625
Nagasumi barrier!

285
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,041
Nagasumi!

286
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,875
His reaction!
He protected her.

287
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,000
Does that mean something weird

288
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,583
happens to her legs
when they get wet?

289
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,083
[NAGASUMI THINKS] She's onto us!

290
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,750
Mawari, I don't know
what you're talking about.

291
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,916
I saw that Sun was going to

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,583
get wet, so I shielded
her, that's all.

293
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,833
That isn't all!

294
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,625
I saw her legs turn into
a fish tail yesterday.

295
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,833
Drenching someone
because you had

296
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,958
some sort of delusion
is incredibly rude.

297
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,041
I know it sounds crazy,

298
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,083
but I'm telling
you that's what I saw!

299
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
I'm sorry, Mawari,

300
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,958
but this is for your own good.
Please, drop it!

301
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,375
[MAWARI]
Nagasumi, remember,

302
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,291
my family has been in law
enforcement for centuries.

303
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,291
[MAWARI] Right now,
my cop sense is telling me

304
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,083
Sun isn't what she seems to be,

305
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,416
so don't you dare to lie to me!

306
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,875
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Dammit!
Mawari's cop sense?

307
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,583
We're in real trouble!

308
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,875
[SUN] It's okay Nagasumi,
it's what I expected.

309
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,375
We can talk about
honor among thieves,

310
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,250
but in the end, we yakuza
are fugitives from the law.

311
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,416
Attractin' the attention of the

312
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
police is somethin'
that we're used to.

313
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,041
Great. 'Honor among
thieves' mode.

314
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,958
Too much about
that girl is unnatural.

315
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,875
From now on I'm gonna
watch her like a hawk.

316
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,833
Just like a good
police officer would!

317
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,958
[MAWARI] Oh, sorry Sun.

318
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,916
I didn't mean to turn
the water so high.

319
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,291
Nagasumi barrier!

320
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,583
[MAWARI] Nagasumi!

321
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,791
[MAWARI] Whoops!
I tripped! How clumsy of me!

322
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,500
[garbled]
Nagasumi barrier!

323
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,500
[MAWARI] Huh?

324
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,458
[MAWARI]
Oh! Sorry!

325
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,208
[MAWARI] Looks like
my hand slipped again!

326
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,125
[NAGASUMI garbled]
Nagasumi barrier!

327
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,708
[SUN] Nagasumi!
Get out! You're a boy!

328
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,291
You're not allowed in here!

329
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,125
[MAWARI] What the hell are you
doing in the girls' bathroom?

330
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,875
Bastard!

331
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,416
So he thinks he can
follow my daughter

332
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,625
into the girls' bathroom
to peep at her, does he?

333
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,291
[MASA] Boss, no
swords in the school!

334
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,333
Come on Boss! Boss, please
put the sword down!

335
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
[OCTOPUS] After schooly.

336
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,500
[MAWARI] Stare.

337
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,041
[MAKI] Hey, Miss Sun!
Miss Sun!

338
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,916
Oh, Maki, hey.

339
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,666
Someone's been
spying on you,

340
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,625
haven't they, Miss Sun?

341
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,666
Uh-huh.

342
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,250
Leave it me.
I'll take care of it.

343
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,041
I'll dispose of
that little creep.

344
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:46,875
Let me at 'em.

345
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,291
No, Maki.
Don't do that.

346
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,291
But...

347
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,666
Ya see, I'm not
even sure whether

348
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,458
she's found out
everything or not.

349
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,875
--[NAGASUMI] Help me!
--[GOZABURO] You maggot!

350
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,041
I'm gonna kill ya, maggot!

351
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,875
[MAKI] The boss is
still goin' at it, huh?

352
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,291
[SUN] Part of the
reason Nagasumi's

353
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,333
workin' so hard is
to protect Mawari.

354
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,916
As his wife,
I gotta do my best to

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,791
protect her, too,
dontcha see, Maki?

356
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,083
[MAKI] Miss Sun.

357
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,208
He isn't keepin' the
secret just to protect me.

358
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,208
If officer Mawari
finds out about me,

359
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,416
then mermaid law demands that
she get the death penalty.

360
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,208
[MAWARI THINKS] Sun's
hiding something all right.

361
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,333
She goes to such great
lengths to avoid water.

362
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,666
Almost impossible
to believe.

363
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,125
But that girl is,
she must be!

364
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,875
[MAWARI] Sun!

365
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
[SUN] Officer Mawari!

366
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
I know, you
can't hide from me.

367
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,625
You're a fish aren't you!

368
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,291
So close!

369
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,708
Don't say that!

370
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,166
Your innocent act's not
gonna work on Officer Mawari.

371
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,833
Take a look at this.

372
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,541
That, tha-that
looks like a--

373
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,333
[MAWARI] A cat.

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
I'm sure you
know cats love fish.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,125
You can fool a human,

376
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,791
but do you really think
you can fool a cat?

377
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,958
[NAGASUMI] Mawari,
you kinda sound like a moron.

378
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,416
[MAWARI] What'd you say?

379
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,625
Not a cat!

380
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,041
[NAGASUMI] Yet,
your plan is working.

381
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,125
And that's not
the only one I've got.

382
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,625
Go!

383
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,583
[MAWARI] Take that!
Full-speed cat attack!

384
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,583
Miss Sun, a mermaid's
weapon is her voice!

385
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,708
Use your howling voice
to stop the cat attack!

386
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,333
No, Maki!
Mawari's watching!

387
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,583
[SUN] And Chimp is here too!

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,833
Nagasumi barrier!

389
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,041
[NAGASUMI] NO! The cats
are just going around me!

390
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,041
[MAWARI] Huh. The cats
actually are swarming her.

391
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,166
That could
only happen to

392
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,875
someone who's
as beautiful as Sun.

393
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,166
I'll take care of
the humans

394
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,875
if you deal with these cats.

395
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,375
Please, just use
your howling voice!

396
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,208
[SUN] No Maki. I don't
wanna mess up the life

397
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,875
I have right now, even
if that life includes Mawari!

398
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,833
I can't use my mermaid
powers right now,

399
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,541
even if cats are bitin' me.

400
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,291
[MAKI] Please, Miss Sun.

401
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,291
[NAGASUMI] Mawari.
Why are you doing this?

402
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,375
[NAGASUMI] Stop trying
to figure out everyone's

403
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,250
secrets just for your
own sick curiosity!

404
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,208
[NAGASUMI] What
has Sun ever done

405
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,333
to deserve this from you?

406
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,625
Has she caused
anyone any problems?

407
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,708
Look what a hard
time you're giving her!

408
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,291
The Mawari I know would

409
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
never do anything
like this to someone.

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,541
[MAWARI] No!
That's not fair!

411
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,708
That isn't fair!

412
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,041
[NAGASUMI] Mawari, wait!

413
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,000
[car honks and tires screech]

414
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,000
Look out, Mawari!

415
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:26,250
Ultrasonic Level Reached!

416
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,208
[SUN] Howling voice!

417
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,916
[MAWARI THINKS]
What's happening?

418
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,791
[NAGASUMI] Mawari, you're alive.

419
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,958
[MAKI] I don't understand.
Why did you save that human?

420
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,208
[SUN] Ya see, Maki.

421
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,250
I couldn't let Officer Mawari
die just because

422
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,875
I was concerned about
keepin' my own secret safe.

423
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,250
If I did, that would be a
disgrace to all Seto mermaids.

424
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,166
[SUN] Because honor among
thieves is honor under the seas.

425
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,625
Where am I?

426
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,708
In the hospital, Mawari.

427
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,666
[NAGASUMI]
You have a concussion.

428
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,583
But they say the driver
of the car wasn't hurt.

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,250
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Sun
used one of her mermaid

430
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,333
powers right in front of her.

431
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,291
[NAGASUMI] I guess I should
prepare for the worst.

432
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,333
[SARU] Hot Mawari!

433
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,166
Oh, I guess
you're awake already?

434
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,625
Oh, hi Chimp.

435
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,875
[SARU] Sun sure saved you
from an ugly situation, huh?

436
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,083
What's that?
Sun saved me?

437
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,916
[SARU] But holy crap,
Sun, you've really got a hell

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,958
of a loud voice if it was enough
to cause a car accident.

439
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,250
Did you say a
loud voice, Chimp?

440
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,833
[SARU] I've never heard such
an incredible voice before.

441
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,666
You could be on tv!

442
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,916
A loud voice? Seriously?

443
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,125
Chimp, that's the
understatement of the century.

444
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,583
Okay, Mawari, how would
you describe a voice like that?

445
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,750
I guess I would
say her voice was--

446
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,083
You're absolutely
right, Chimp.

447
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,000
Sun's sure got an
incredible gift, doesn't she?

448
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,916
Yeah, that's
our Sun for ya.

449
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,625
[MAWARI] You're gonna
write that off as a gift?

450
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:28,708
[nervous laughter]

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,333
You're really
going to say that a

452
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,791
voice that sends cars
flying is nothing but a gift.

453
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,541
Maybe you two need a lesson
about the rules of this society.

454
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,208
[NAGASUMI]
Hey Chimp, you're a good man.

455
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,958
[VOICES] This is a
vase of water spilling.

456
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,625
[VOICES] And the
person being spilled on.

457
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,041
Thank you, Sun. You really
saved me back there.

458
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,083
I'm sorry.

459
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,125
I shouldn't have
been so suspicious.

460
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,750
Officer Mawari.

461
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,583
Just call me Mawari.
Okay, Sun?

462

I do apologize.

From now on I'll
stick to doing my job.

What did Chimp start

Dunno.

[NAGASUMI] Okay,
this is a secret from Sun,

483
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,291
but I'm a huge fan of this
pop star named Lunar!

different issue.

We can draw a
clear line there, right?

Wait, why is Lunar passed
out in front of my house?

She's Sun's childhood friend?
This is amazing!
