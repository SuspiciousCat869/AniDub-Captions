We weren't gone
long; what happened?

158
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,333
Where did all 
the actors go?

159
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,000
To the hospital! Every
single one of them, too!

160
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,166
[STAFF DUDE] It was terrible!
They were attacked!

161
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,125
[KAMATA] What? Attacked by who?

162
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,750
[STAFF DUDE] This trio of masked
men who came out of nowhere!

163
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,500
So there's no
way we can keep

164
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,333
shooting since we
lost our whole cast!

165
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh, no, this isn't good.

166
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,500
Now we're behind
schedule and over-budget.

167
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,958
We may miss our opening date.

168
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,083
Like hell we will!

169
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,750
This is our big movie
debut, you morons,

170
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,125
so we're not missing any
opening date, you hear us?

171
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,041
Look, I understand
how you feel, but--

172
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,333
But nothing!

173
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,250
I don't care what it takes,
go find us a cast!

174
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
Wait!
That music, it's--!

175
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,000
I told you I'd be back!

176
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,291
Papa?

177
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,166
[BOB] Oh, Samurai!

178
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,125
[MICHAEL] Bushido!

179
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,291
Wow, what's your
dad doing here?

180
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,916
He's the executive
producer of this movie.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,458
He must have come
to terminate our problem.

182
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,625
Lunar!

183
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,000
First off, I'm adding
a million dollars

184
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,583
to this movie's budget!

185
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,083
[LUNAR PAPA] Take it!

186
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,416
[NAGASUMI] A million?

187
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,375
And secondly...

188
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,541
As for casting,
it's no problemo.

189
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,916
But how sir?

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,083
[LUNAR PAPA] Sun Seto!
And all of you humans here!

191
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,625
Your mission is to protect

192
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,166
this movie,
so you will be the actors!

193
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,291
[LUNAR PAPA]
Hasta la vista, babies!

194
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,333
Junior high students
acting in a historical drama?

195
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,916
That sounds completely insane!

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,875
Actually, that
sounds pretty cool!

197
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,916
I could become
the next Kin-san!

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,166
If I was an actor...

199
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,041
Chicks would dig me!
I'll marry a pop star!

200
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,375
Wow! It does
sound like a lot of fun!

201
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,666
Well, I guess I can't
be the only one who says no.

202
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,833
[AKENO] Count us in as well.

203
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,041
We'll be happy to
help out with the film.

204
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,625
[NAGASUMI] Akeno! And you guys.

205
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,000
My lord!
You've returned!

206
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,541
I missed you so much!

207
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,625
[KAI] Oh, how I've missed
your groveling, Chimp!

208
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,750
This is really exciting.

209
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,583
I'm a big fan of
historical dramas.

210
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
Yeah, so are the Branchial
Respiration Three!

211
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,958
We love 'em, too, gyo!

212
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,291
[FISH BROTHERS]
Gyo, gyo, gyo, gyo...

213
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,458
Then there's
no time to waste!

214
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125
Let's get to wardrobe
and into costume!

215
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,500
Yeah!

216
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,541
I still don't
know about this.

217
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
[LUNAR] Down the hall there's a

218
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,041
changing room
for the girls to use.

219
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,208
Boys, change wherever. Alright?

220
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,250
Right!

221
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,291
Hey, hold on a second...

222
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,625
Where's Akeno?

223
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,041
I don't know. She was
with us just a minute ago.

224
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,541
[KAI] Hey, everybody!

225
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,208
[KAI] I got a surprise!

226
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,166
Yeah, what?

227
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,041
[KAI] Soft drinks for everybody!

228
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,166
[NAGASUMI] Soft drinks?

229
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,500
They're nice and cold, too!

230
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,166
Thanks, that was
really thoughtful!

231
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,041
And just as I was
getting thirsty, too!

232
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,583
Well, let's drink 'em
while they're cold!

233
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,291
Aren't you guys gonna
have any soda?

234
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh , uh, we already
drank ours, gyo.

235
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,291
[KAI] It's too much
trouble with this thing on.

236
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,750
[NAGASUMI THINKS] The last
time I had a mermaid drink,

237
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,208
things didn't go too well.

238
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,833
I'll skip it and the side
effects, thank you.

239
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,500
[MAWARI] That was good!

240
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
[LUNAR] Okay, girls!
Let's get changed!

241
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,791
Sure thing!
You lead the way!

242
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,750
[LUNAR] Not you, perv!

243
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,125
[Fish Brothers laugh]

244
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,833
[AKENO] I see.

245
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,416
[AKENO] So it went well?

246
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,916
[MAGURO]
Yes, of course it did, gyo.

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,208
Miss Akeno, ma'am.

248
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,250
What good could one
little soft drink do, gyo?

249
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,541
[AKENO] What you gave
them wasn't a soft drink,

250
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,958
but a secret potion passed

251
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,708
down among we merfolk.
The Fish Shot!

252
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,916
Fish Shot?

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,541
[AKENO] It's a powerful
potion that releases

254
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,458
the inner desires
of those who drink it.

255
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,208
After just one little sip,
you can no longer

256
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,583
hide your heart's
hidden desires,

257
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,250
and you're transformed
into a raving,

258
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,458
single-minded beast who
acts solely on instinct.

259
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,833
[AKENO] When Sun
sees how everyone

260
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,083
acts after drinking it,
she'll become disillusioned

261
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,291
with the human race,
hence the use of the Fish Shot.

262
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,208
I didn't want to take
such cowardly measures,

263
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,333
but I have no choice
but to follow my orders.

264
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
Well then... I've probably said
more than I needed to.

265
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,958
Boy...

266
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,416
All this explaining's
made me fairly parched.

267
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,333
[AJITARO] Try one of
these; it's refreshing.

268
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,250
I will, thank you.

269
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,750
What do you
mean "refreshing?"

270
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,708
This is the Fish Shot!

271
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,250
[BURIO] Oh...

272
00:10:59,333 --> 00:10:59,750
[AJITARO] It...

273
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,916
[MAGURO] Is?

274
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,666
[AKENO] Please don't
tell me you guys--

275
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,000
We drank it, gyo!

276
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,958
It was good, gyo!
Smooth and full of flavor gyo!

277
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,416
[AKENO] You imbeciles!

278
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,541
How are we supposed to do our

279
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,791
job if we're hopped
up on this stuff?

280
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,625
[NAGASUMI] So I guess
we're just supposed

281
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,916
to hang out here
until filming starts, huh?

282
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,625
I've been pretty nervous
since I left wardrobe.

283
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,666
Speaking of which, you're not

284
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,083
wearing THAT
in the movie, are you?

285
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,708
[KAI] My full dress uniform?
What's the problem?

286
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,958
Spacesuits weren't
around in the Edo Period.

287
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,500
[KAI] Would ya
just chill out?

288
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,375
[KAI] That reminds me, did ya
drink the drink I brought ya?

289
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,916
Yep, it was tasty.

290
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
[KAI] Glad ya liked it.

291
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,708
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Actually, I
didn't. I didn't drink a drop!

292
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,083
[NAGASUMI] I know
it's a historical drama,

293
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,541
but do you know what
this movie's about?

294
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,000
I haven't seen a script.

295
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,875
[KAI] How dumb are ya?
Didn't ya see the sign outside?

296
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,708
[KAI] The one that
says "Ikeda Inn" on it?

297
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,958
[NAGASUMI] Is the Ikeda
Inn famous or something?

298
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,375
[KAI] Dammit, you are ignorant!

299
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,458
Alright, listen up
and let me explain!

300
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,416
On July 8th, 1864--

301
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,958
[fast forward tape sound]

302
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,666
[KAI] So? Didja
learn something?

303
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,333
Yep!

304
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,541
Am I imagining things
or is someone spying on us?

305
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,416
[KAI] Hah... Maybe the
Shinsengumi's on your tail.

306
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,791
[KAI] You believe in
mermaid-human marriage

307
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,625
which sort of makes
you like the Ishin Shishi

308
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,125
rebels the Shinsengumi
attacked at the Inn...

309
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,750
Wait, maybe attacked's
not the right word.

310
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,666
Massacred's more like it.

311
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,958
[AKENO] End of the line, rebel!

312
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,625
[AKENO] Nagasumi Michishio,
you scoundrel who

313
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,958
dares do harm to
the ruling government.

314
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,375
We, the Shinsengumi have
come for your punishment!

315
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,416
[AKENO] My Kotetsu sword
is thirsting for your blood.

316
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,208
Wow. That costume looks
fantastic on you Akeno,

317
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,541
and that prop
sword almost looks real!

318
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,250
[AKENO] Hmm...
I suppose the blade was dull.

319
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,708
It feels pretty real, too!
I think I'm needed on the set!

320
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:54,958
[KAI] I got 'em!

321
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,250
What the--?
Stop Kai! Lemme go!

322
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,333
[KAI] Don't worry, Miss Akeno!

323
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,000
He's not going anywhere!
Take 'em out!

324
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,291
What's going on here?

325
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,541
The world outside
is dark and cold,

326
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,250
but you, you're just like a big,

327
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,291
bright ray of sunshine
beaming down on us all!

328
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,291
[AKENO] Give me your
warmth, I command you!

329
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,791
[CAPTAIN SWORDSMAN]
I hope you're following

330
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,583
my orders to the letter, Akeno.

331
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,458
[CAPTAIN SWORDSMAN]
You've got it together for

332
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,916
someone your age, but you
can be clumsy sometimes.

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,916
I just hope you've got

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
everything under
control right now.

335
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,958
[people crying out]

336
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,125
[KAI] N-Not again!

337
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,958
[KAI] My eyes! My eyes!
My beautiful, gorgeous eyes!

338
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,500
Nagasumi Michishio!
Come give me a hug right now!

339
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,458
A-Akeno?

340
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,500
[NAGASUMI] She's gonna kill me!

341
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,791
And Michishio?

342
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,333
[AKENO] Hey, what do
you know! Look who's here!

343
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,291
You've got perfect
timing, Captain!

344
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,291
[CAPTAIN SWORDSMAN] Don't
talk to me in public, you idiot!

345
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,500
Aye aye, sir!

346
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
Captain, my Kotetsu's
broken, so I humbly

347
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,375
request permission to
draw the Morning Star!

348
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,958
Hold up. Why are you
acting so strangely?

349
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,250
[AKENO] Huh?
Why, whatever would make

350
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,291
you think that
about me, Captain?

351
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,083
[AKENO] Thanks for
giving me permission

352
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,666
to draw the Morning Star,
sir! See ya!

353
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,125
[CAPTAIN SWORDSMAN]
But I never did!

354
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,083
Maybe she gave up.

355
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,000
[NAGASUMI]
What the heck was that for?

356
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,208
[Lunar giggles]

357
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,458
[NAGASUMI] Lunar?
What are you doing--!

358
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,916
[LUNAR] We re-arranged
our shooting schedule

359
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,916
for one reason
and one reason only,

360
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,708
so that we could
see you, Nagasumi.

361
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,000
So what is she doing here?

362
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,375
[NAGASUMI] Wait, what
are you talking about?

363
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,583
[LUNAR] We don't
see you for days,

364
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,958
and when we finally do,

365
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,291
you flirt and play hard-to-get
with her on our set.

366
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,750
[LUNAR] You've got
some nerve... You...

367
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,708
[LUNAR] Freakin' manservant!
Sun was bad enough,

368
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,666
but now you've taken
up with Akeno, too?

369
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,666
You gigolo! You player!

370
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,291
You lousy two-timer!

371
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,375
We're going to make
it so that every girl

372
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,666
knows you're mine,
and the way to do

373
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,333
that is with a love
scene captured on film.

374
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,333
[NAGASUMI] No! No one'll
want to marry me then!

375
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,291
It'll be good
for our movie, too.

376
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,041
After all, viewers
aren't satisfied these

377
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,750
days unless a movie has
at least one love scene in it.

378
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,500
[NAGASUMI] But that's
only with R-rated movies!

379
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,875
[LUNAR] You're gonna
marry me on camera,

380
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,375
and every marriage
begins with a kiss!

381
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,250
[MAWARI] I may not
know the ABCs of love,

382
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,875
but I know the stench of
evil whenever I smell it!

383
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,708
[MAWARI] I've got law
enforcement in my blood,

384
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,625
and when I see someone
committing a crime,

385
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,833
I teach them the
rules of this society!

386
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,083
[MAWARI]
They call me the demonic

387
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
Disciplinary Committee
member of Isono Eighth.

388
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,083
Mawari Zenigata!

389
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,291
And I'm not gonna let
you slide, Nagasumi Michishio!

390
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,416
About what?

391
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,541
You've trampled
on the emotions

392
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,458
of several young women, pal!

393
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,875
Sadly, the courts don't
consider that a crime.

394
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
So the law won't punish you.

395
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,375
But I will!

396
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,583
[MAWARI] How 'bout
telling me what you

397
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,291
meant by those things
you said last night?

398
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,625
[NAGASUMI] Uh, no thanks!

399
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,500
[NAGASUMI] Now what?

400
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,666
Say it now.

401
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,291
My name! Say it!
You heard me! Say my name!

402
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,333
It's Class Rep.

403
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,458
Uh huh, Class Rep.

404
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,333
Yeah, It's Class
Rep, isn't it?

405
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,500
[VOICES] Is that
your final answer?

406
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,791
[CLASS REP] Yes, it is I,
the wallflower who's

407
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,625
always seen, but rarely heard;

408
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,708
the one who's
so easily forgotten.

409
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,791
[CLASS REP] But not anymore!

410
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,666
I bet you won't forget
me now, will ya?

411
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,625
Not with those
throwing stars, I won't!

412
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,416
[NAGASUMI] I don't know
what's going on with them,

413
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,125
but I gotta get away
from these crazy girls!

414
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,625
[AKENO] Nagasumi!

415
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,791
You might be able
to run, but you can't hide.

416
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,166
[NAGASUMI]
Oh, crap! I'm cut off!

417
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,750
[BURIO] To protect the
order in the capitol...

418
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,500
[AJITARO] All Ishin Shishi
rebels must be killed!

419
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,166
[MAGURO] That task falls to us:

420
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,500
the most handsome
samurai in Kyoto.

421
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,791
[BURIO] Toshizo Burikata!

422
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,875
[AJITARO] Soji Ajita!

423
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,416
[MAGURO] Hajime Maguto!

424
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
The Branchial Respiration
Shinsengumi has arrived!

425
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,125
[NAGASUMI] Arrived to do what?

426
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,958
To help you meet your maker,
Nagasumi Michishio, gyo!

427
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,166
[NAGASUMI] Did you know
your name's spelled wrong?

428
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,166
[AJITARO] Shut up!

429
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,541
[MAGURO]
Gatotsu technique, my brothers!

430
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,000
[NAGASUMI] Gatotsu!

431
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,291
[AKENO] Squeeze
me like a grapefruit!

432
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,625
Hug me dammit!

433
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,875
[AKENO] I said squeeze!
Not you, you mangy beast!

434
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:52,791
Get your paws off me!

435
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,791
[NAGASUMI] Hey, stop that.

436
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
[BURIO] Look, it's him!

437
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,375
[AJITARO] I don't believe it!
Movie Land's beloved mascot!

438
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
[MAGURO] Yay,
it's Sarumage, gyo!

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,541
[BURIO] If he jumps on you,
something good'll happen gyo!

440
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,250
[AKENO] Like hell
it will, you moron!

441
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,583
[AKENO] Stop or
Nagasumi'll get away!

442
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,666
[NAGASUMI] See ya!

443
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:07,958
[MAGURO] Too late, gyo!

444
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,958
[BURIO] After him, gyo!

445
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,750
[NAGASUMI] Thanks
a lot, Sarumage!

446
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,083
I hope you got a handful!

447
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,041
[CHIMP] Did I ever!

448
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
You filthy beast!

449
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,791
[NAGASUMI] Why's
everyone acting so weird?

450
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,250
[NAGASUMI] Wait a minute?
Could it have been those drinks?

451
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,916
[Lunar chuckles]

452
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,125
[LUNAR] Come here, manservant.

453
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,541
[MAWARI] You're
under arrest, meow!

454
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,583
[CLASS REP]
My name. Say my name!

455
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,458
[AKENO] I'm so cold!

456
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,083
How vexing! Nagasumi,
give me your warmth!

457
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm surrounded!

458
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,083
[NAGASUMI] Oh, man,
this looks like the end!

459
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,875
[SUN] Hey, what's goin' on here?

460
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,166
What're ya guys
doin' to Nagasumi?

461
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,791
[NAGASUMI] Sun!

462
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,958
If you want 'em,
get in line. 'Kay?

463
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,333
[SUN] I won't let anyone
pick on Nagasumi.

464
