1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,125
[DAD THINKS] Damn it.
I'm doing the best I can,

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,291
I really am.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,333
[horns honking]

4
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,833
[HENCHMAN] Damn it.
[SECRETARY] Damn it!

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,625
[gunshot and then gun click]

6
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,875
[tires screaching]

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,958
[machine gun fire]

8
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,625
[SECRETARY] Hey boss!
Come back!

9
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,541
[sirens]

10
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,708
[DAD] Wha-what's-?

11
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,125
[LUNAR PAPA] Target.
Lock on.

12
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,625
[NARRATOR] Beneath
the gently rolling

13
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,916
waves of the Seto Inland Sea.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,458
Young Nagasumi's life is saved,
and forever changed.

15
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,083
But as with any debt,
this one too must be repaid.

16
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,208
So our story begins.

17
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,375
Please humor them with a smile,
for young love is never easy.

18
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,750
[alarm rings]

19
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,375
[NAGASUMI]
Lunar no. Please stop.

20
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,708
Just a dream. Oh, good.

21
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,666
What a weird dream.
That was some nightma--

22
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,041
Listen up human.

23
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,708
If you do not treat my Lunar
with the proper respect,

24
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,916
you will find yourself
terminated quickly.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,125
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
He. he. he. He's not a dream!

26
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,875
[Magasumi cries out]
[banging around]

27
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,750
What's wrong?
Are you okay Nagasumi?

28
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,958
You look like you're
really freaked.

29
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,291
Sun, just now there
was a man in my room.

30
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,583
A man in your room?

31
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,916
Yeah. Big.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,583
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Wait a
second. The weird guy said

33
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,083
something about
Lunar, didn't he?

34
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,666
Hey Sun, where's
Lunar right now?

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,916
Lunar ran outta the house

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
in a panic just
a little while ago.

37
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,500
All she said was that she had to
do some work again this morning.

38
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,875
[NAGASUMI] Oh. Okay, I see.

39
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,166
[NAGASUMI THINKS] What the heck
was that all about, anyway?

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,250
Heya Nagasumi.

41
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,166
Incredibly normal
morning, isn't it?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,458
Yeah, thanks for
stating the obvious

43
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,041
for no apparent reason, Chimp.

44
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,708
It's just that lately,
every morning's brought

45
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,541
some fun new
drama along with it.

46
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,166
So now I'm feeling
a little deflated.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,208
Do you think that
you could go

48
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,750
and deflate somewhere
else, maybe?

49
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,125
He's right, though.
It has been lively lately.

50
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,500
[SUN] First Kai
transferred to the school.

51
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,000
And then there was field day.

52
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
And don't forget
that amazing singing

53
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,416
contest between you and Lunar!

54
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,833
It was hot!

55
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,125
Again Chimp,
could you reminisce

56
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,125
somewhere else, maybe?

57
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,583
Exactly, there's
nothing to get so

58
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,250
excited about, ya damn monkey.

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,666
I'm sick an' tired of this
outta the ordinary stuff.

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,291
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Out of the ordinary!

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,833
[MAWARI] Seriously now, Chimp!

62
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,125
Why can't normal, everyday
events be enough for you?

63
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,708
Yeah, Chimp,
normal, everyday events

64
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,791
are much better in the long run.

65
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,916
Whistle! Whistle!

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,375
Now you're getting
on my case, too, huh?

67
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,083
It does seem
like you've been

68
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,500
actin' pretty
strange all mornin'.

69
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,458
So you've finally
lost it, Nagasumi?

70
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,416
That's fantastic news.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,458
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
It's pretty hard not to tell

72
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,000
anyone about
something this weird.

73
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,666
Maybe I should let
these guys in on it.

74
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,000
I was worried about
saying anything

75
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
because they might
think I'm nuts,

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,541
but they're my friends, right?

77
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,791
If I just act natural enough,

78
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,375
I'm sure they'll
be very accepting.

79
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Yeah, I'll do that.

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,166
I'm sure they'll be
behind me 100%.

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, actually.

82
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,166
When I woke up,
a strange, gleaming,

83
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,708
six and a half foot tall man
dressed all in black

84
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,833
was standing by my bed with

85
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
a shotgun and
threatening to kill me.

86
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,625
And then he jumped
right out the window.

87
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,250
Surprising, huh?

88
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS] Oh boy.

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,250
Your room is in the attic
above the second floor.

90
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,333
You do realize that,
don't you, Nagasumi?

91
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,875
You don't believe me?
He was really there, I swear!

92
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,375
And you're the only
one who's actually

93
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,958
seen this supposed man?

94
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,166
I wasn't hallucinating!

95
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,500
Um, Nagasumi...

96
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,666
Maybe you should go
home and rest a little bit.

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,833
[NAGASUMI] I'm not sick either!

98
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,041
This is my fault.

99
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,541
If only I'd tried harder
to counsel you when

100
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,916
you so obviously
needed some help.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,791
I don't need a shrink!

102
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,916
[NAGASUMI] Come on Sun, please,
tell me you saw that!

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,541
SUN] Huh?

104
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,541
What now?

105
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,708
[NAGASUMI] Are you blind?

106
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,833
The gleaming man
in black showed up again.

107
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,666
He was right there!

108
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,041
Here, right here!

109
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,333
He fogged up the
window with his breath

110
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,291
and wrote 'Lunar is
my life' with his finger!

111
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,583
[SARU] Dude,
there's nothing there.

112
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,666
Oh. Well, it must've dried
up and disappeared.

113
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,208
[NAGASUMI] And he did it again!

114
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,166
He left with an
amazing backward jump.

115
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,166
Just like this!

116
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,250
[MAWARI] We're on
the second floor.

117
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,958
[NAGASUMI] Don't you
think I know that?

118
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
I don't have a clue what
he wants either, but...

119
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,750
No, wait! Wait!
Don't leave me behind!

120
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,041
I'm telling the truth!
Please don't leave!

121
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
[SHARK] Well now,
we certainly can't have this?

122
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,125
Trespassing on
school grounds is strictly

123
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,333
forbidden and quite
closely monitored?

124
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,958
And bringing something
as dangerous and

125
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,375
deadly as that
shotgun you have there

126
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,333
into a student area
is definitely a bad idea?

127
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,791
Your track suit,
you'll give it to me, now.

128
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,208
[Shark chuckles]

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,250
[SHARK] It looks like I'm
wasting my breath on you?

130
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,416
I guess I'll have no choice but

131
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,541
to remove you
by force then, huh?

132
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,833
[REN] A strange man, you say?

133
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,458
Yeah, but no one
will believe what I say,

134
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,833
and I can't figure out
how to convince them.

135
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,458
But it is the truth! Really!

136
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,958
I saw him
with my own eyes.

137
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,625
A man who's six
and a half feet tall?]

138
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,541
That's right.

139
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,833
A man dressed
all in black,

140
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,583
carrying a shotgun,
whose body gleams?

141
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

142
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,458
All right then, maybe
you should lie down and rest.

143
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,958
I'm telling you, it's true!
Please listen to me!

144
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,916
But it's true. I saw it.
Oh! It's not fair!

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,333
Why won't anyone
believe what I'm saying?

146
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,541
[Ren sighs]

147
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,333
A strange man
dressed all in black, huh?

148
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,250
[REN] All in black?

149
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,875
[Shark cries and sniffles]

150
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,666
[clock ticks]

151
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,708
[NAGASUMI] Oh, is that the time?
I must have fallen asleep.

152
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,583
It seems like it's
unusually quiet in here.

153
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,125
[NAGASUMI] Hey, uh, Sun's mom,
are you here somewhere?

154
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,791
Well, she's not answering.
I guess no one's here then, huh?

155
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,583
[NAGASUMI 'Kay, I guess I'll
just go back to the classroo--

156
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
[Nagasumi cries out]

157
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,250
[NAGASUMI]
Sun's mom turned into that

158
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
strange man wearing
a gym jersey!

159
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,541
[NAGASUMI]
Kai Mikawa! Perfect timing!

160
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,750
Nagasumi Michishio.

161
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,958
Blah, blah, blah, et cetera.

162
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,000
Let me guess.

163
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,333
You're being chased
by a gleaming,

164
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,166
six and a half foot tall
man dressed all in black,

165
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
carrying a shotgun,
who's wearin' a

166
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,750
jersey now for some reason?

167
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,875
Come on, don't you think
you should let this one go now?

168
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,416
[NAGASUMI] It's true! I'm
telling the truth! Just look!

169
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,041
Huh?
Where did he go?

170
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,208
[KAI] Hah.

171
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,625
Why don't you save
your dreamin' for bedtime.

172
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,416
He was definitely
there a second ago!

173
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,125
My goodness, yer
a mighty nervous type,

174
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,208
aren't ya Nagasumi?

175
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,916
Do yourself a favor and try

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,416
to copy my refinement
and dignity.

177
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
[NAGASUMI AND KAI] It's him!

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,791
[KAI] Nagasumi,
who the hell is that

179
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,000
six and a half foot tall,
gleaming man carrying a shot gun

180
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,875
and wearing a skintight
jersey for some reason?

181
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,333
[NAGASUMI]
That's what I'd like to know!

182
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,416
[NAGASUMI]
He's still coming after us!

183
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,208
[KAI] We've gotta
get out of here now!

184
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,708
[KAI] No! The outside!

185
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,500
[NAGASUMI] Do you
have to do that right now?

186
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,875
[SARU] My lord Kai!

187
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,833
[SARU] Here my lord.

188
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,875
[KAI] What is it Chimp?

189
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,666
[KAI] Oh yeah!

190
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,041
[SARU] Please, take this.

191
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,166
[KAI] Well done Chimp...
I'll give ya a banana later.

192
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,791
[NAGASUMI]
You're so high maintenance.

193
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,291
My lord, good fortune to you.

194
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,916
[KAI] Who the hell is that guy,
and why is he chasing us?

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,041
How am I supposed to know?
But we're inside now.

196
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,541
Can't you take that
stupid thing off already?

197
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,541
When I'm ready.
Hey do you think.

198
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,375
That maybe he gave up?

199
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,416
[NAGASUMI AND KAI]
This statue's kinda warm.

200
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,375
[KAI AND NAGASUMI]
Total! Recall!

201
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,833
[KAI] How much longer is
this guy gonna chase us?

202
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,208
[NAGASUMI] And how
does he keep making

203
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,416
it to places before we do?

204
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,083
[NAGASUMI] Oh, that's
not good! It's a dead end!

205
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,291
[NAGASUMI] He's getting closer!

206
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,791
[SARU] My lord Kai!

207
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,625
Grab on tightly to
the rope, my lord!

208
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,625
[KAI] Chimp!
Okay Chimp, I'm ready.

209
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,750
[NAGASUMI] NO!

210
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,833
What're you doin',
Nagasumi Michishio?

211
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,166
[NAGASUMI]
You think I'm going to let

212
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,958
you escape all
by yourself, you jerk?

213
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:39,208
[KAI] Jus' do the right thing
and sacrifice yourself for me.

214
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,791
[SARU] If you keep struggling...

215
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,916
[NAGASUMI] You'd make
a more appropriate

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,250
sacrifice than me, I think.

217
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,916
[KAI] Let me go or I'll
kick you in your fat face.

218
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,916
[SARU] Can't hold
it much longer.

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,750
[NAGASUMI AND KAI] Chimp! No!

220
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,708
[NAGASUMI AND KAI] Chimp no!

221
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,416
Why is this happening to us?
I don't understand.

222
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,916
It's obviously all your
fault, ya dirty bastard!

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,916
Shut up! This is
exactly why the only

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,333
friend you have
is all your money!

225
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,208
Quit shoutin he'll find us
because of your stupid face!

226
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,750
[KAI] Oh, please spare me!

227
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,958
[NAGASUMI] This is
the end of us, isn't it?

228
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,708
[KAI] Of all the people to share
my last moments on Earth with.

229
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,250
[NAGASUMI]
Just what I was thinking.

230
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,583
[NAGASUMI] Oh, Sun!

231
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
[KAI] Oh, Chimp!

232
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
Did the guy, go away?

233
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,750
Are--
Are we safe now?

234
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,000
[KAI AND NAGASUMI] Yea!
We're both still alive!

235
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
[KAI] He broke
a hole in the wall!

236
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,583
[NAGASUMI] And now
I bet he's still--I knew it!

237
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,916
He's right there!

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,958
[KAI] All right, if that's
how this is gonna go!

239
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,000
[NAGASUMI]
Why do you even have a

240
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:34,916
thing like that
in the first place?

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,458
[KAI] For self-defense.

242
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,375
[NAGASUMI]
Whoa! He actually did it!

243
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,041
[alarm bells ring]

244
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,333
[KAI] I did it!
I got the guy good!

245
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,875
I always knew I had
that killer instinct in me.

246
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,833
Never mind the method
as long as we're safe now.

247
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,375
[KAI] Don't underestimate the

248
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,625
Mikawa family,
ya freak of nature!

249
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,708
He's been blown
ta smithereens!

250
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
I've got a taste
of violence now,

251
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
and ya know, I like it!

252
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,791
Ya' I do!

253
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,750
Just don't ever use that
thing on me, okay, Mikawa?

254
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,041
[GOZABURO]
All right, ya little punks.

255
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,791
Form yerselves into a line.

256
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,750
[GOZABURO] Word from the top
is we're evacuatin' to the gym.

257
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,833
Apparently the first floor
is some kinda disaster area.

258
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,000
That's strange.

259
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,416
I wonder what that
explosion could've been.

260
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,583
Come to think of it,

261
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,583
there was that gas
explosion not long ago.

262
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,041
I'll need to make a thorough
investigation into both of them.

263
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,750
Hey have ya seen
Nagasumi anywhere?

264
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,416
He did go to the nurse's
office earlier this morning.

265
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,916
That's a long time for
him to be there, though.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,333
[school bell rings]

267
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,916
I can't believe that I'll never
get to eat miso katsu again!

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,416
[KAI] Or Doteni stew!

269
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,333
[KAI] I woulda liked a miso
katsu parfait for my last meal.

270
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,375
[NAGASUMI] Farewell, Kai.

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,250
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
He'll come after me

272
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,333
no matter how far I run.

273
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,916
Oh, Sun. I'm afraid
it's all over now.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
[SUN] An' what do
ya think yer doin?

275
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,041
You're the guy, the one
Nagasumi told us about.

276
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
I'm not gonna
let ya hurt him.

277
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Nagasumi's my husband,

278
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,583
and ya won't harm
a hair on his head.

279
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,208
'Cuz, honor among thieves...

280
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
...Is honor under the seas.

281
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,791
Uh, Sun!

282
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,875
Sun Seto.

283
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,958
Ultranso--

284
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,625
[NAGASUMI THINKS] He prevented
her from using Howling Voice?

285
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,416
How does he know how
to fight mermaids like that?

286
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,125
Hey you!
Let go of Sun right now!

287
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,625
[SUN] Nagasumi!

288
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,583
[GOZABURO] I'll kill ya!

289
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,041
[GOZABURO] That's my daughter.
What do ya think yer doing?

290
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,250
You filthy piece of shit!

291
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,125
Oh Dad, you saved us!

292
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,416
[NAGASUMI]
Did Sun's dad really save me?

293
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,458
[GOZABURO] I'm gonna give ya
a beatin' ya won't soon forget!

294
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,125
[GOZABURO]
Take that! And that!

295
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:40,875
[GOZABURO]
How do ya like that, huh?

296
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,500
Dad seems really angry.

297
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,333
He's totally flipping out.
Seriously, this is crazy.

298
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,708
Sure that guy's an
invincible monster,

299
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,333
but at this rate even he--

300
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,333
[GOZABURO]
Not the urinal!

301
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,750
[SUN] Oh no, Dad!

302
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,250
[NAGASUMI] He beat
your dad? Impossible!

303
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
Human.

304
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,541
You are living with Lunar.

305
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,208
What exactly are your
intentions toward her?

306
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,166
Huh?
What about Lunar?

307
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,333
[NAGASUMI THINKS]
Come to think of it,

308
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,833
he said something
like that this morning.

309
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,833
Answer me now human.

310
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,791
[NAGASUMI THINKS] I'd better
answer. He's not messing around.
