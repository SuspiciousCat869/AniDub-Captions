sing tonight, Sun.

312
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,041
[LUNAR] After all,
since we announced

313
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,000
this to the media,
so many of our fans

flocked here that
they couldn't all fit inside.

this is unfair at all.

[LUNAR] It's just
the way things are.

There will always be a
huge gap between someone

who's a national star like us,

a little school star like you.

Everything is fair in a fight.

you that I can win

this without using
any dirty tricks,

325
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,958

The mermaids'
singing voices directly

in the brain and all.

462
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,500
Go!

463
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,708
You're still daring
to interfere with us, Sun?

464
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,500
[SUN] You're the only
one who can help them.

465
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,833
Just you, Nagasumi.

466
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,166
[SUN] You're the only one who
can make them understand.

467
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,250
It's up to you now.

468
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,333
[LUNA FAN] Annihilate them!

469
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,666
[SUN FAN] You're gonna die now!

470
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,708
[SUN] Hearts
transform into bonds

471
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,958
[SUN DUDE A]
What's with this guy?

472
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,375
[LUNAR DUDE A] Who
cares? Let's just get him!

473
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,875
Crush them all!

474
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,041
[NAGASUMI] I'm a dragon.
Back off, all of you!

475
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,166
Unless you think you can

476
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,333
stand up to the
full power of my fist.

477
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,666
[SARU] The storm has come. Now!

478
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,583
[SUN DUDE B] What, did
you come out of a manga?

479
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,416
[LUNAR DUDE B]
Don't try to mess with us!

480
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,000
[STUDENT A] Whoa!

481
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,916
He's fighting off three
people with one hand?

482
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,916
Wow. When did Nagasumi
become so incredibly strong?

483
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
[STICK FIGURE A]
Attack all at once!

484
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,333
[STICK FIGURE B] We'll
come at him from all sides.

485
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,416
[STICK FIGURES] He got us!

486
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,416
[NAGASUMI] I thought
I told you to back off.

487
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,625
[FANS] We're sorry!

488
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,625
And we've decided we
can't win this anymore.

489
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,958
We'll give up now.

490
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,833
A great warrior.

491
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,125
[LUNAR] What the hell is this?

492
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,875
It's love.

493
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,833
Kamata! Our special
performance.

494
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,000
It was completely ruined.

495
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:53,958
There, there, my dear.

496
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,375
[SUN] Lunar.

497
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,166
[LUNAR] Why are you
glaring at me like that?

498
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,375
You look so mean!

499
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,333
You don't, you don't
hate me now do you?

500
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,416
Our battle is over.

501
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,958
Now, you come over
and apologize to Maki,

502
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,083
and then we can put
all of this behind us.

503
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,166
[LUNAR] Maki?
Do you mean the little conch?

504
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,666
[SUN] Yes, her!

505
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,958
And what justification did
you have to hurt her so badly?

506
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,500
But I didn't.
I didn't do anything to her!

507
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,250
--Huh?

508
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,500
--So who then?
--Huh?

509
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,583
Ya actually have the nerve
to deny it, ya brat?

510
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,416
[MAKI] Please, boss, hold on.

511
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,666
[ALL] Maki?

512
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,041
Jeez, what happened here?

513
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,791
You guys sure did
a number on this place.

514
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,000
Miss Sun.

515
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,875
The truth is,
the day that Lunar first

516
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,541
showed up at the
Michishio residence.

517
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,916
[MAKI] Well if
it isn't Miss Lunar.

518
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,166
It's been a long time.

519
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,333
What brings you
here all of a sudden?

520
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,625
Oh shut it, Maki.

521
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,625
We're here because
we're graciously deigning

522
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,625
to pay a little visit to
Sun Seto, that's all.

523
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,875
Now move over.
We're coming through.

524
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,041
No one gets through unless
Maki the Conch allows them to!

525
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,625
Take my Jet Ram Attack!

526
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
[BOB] Kamikaze!

527
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,250
[MICHAEL] That'll leave a mark.

528
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,500
[LUNAR] Yeah.
We'll do you a favor

529
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,125
and pretend we
didn't see that.

530
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,458
It has to be embarrassing.

531
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,041
[MAKI] Thank you.

532
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,583
It was embarrassing.
I didn't know how to tell you.

533
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,000
Ugh...
what did you do?

534
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,625
You mean she
did it to herself?

535
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,916
You made a hell
of a mess girl.

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,041
[SHARK] You call
yourself an assassin?

537
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,458
[SUN] Oh well,
it was a good fight!

538
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,875
Yeah, a real good fight!

539
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,166
[LUNAR] What's going on?
Did we do all that for nothing?

540
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,500
[SUN] Never mind!
Let's just forget it.

541
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,583
[NAGASUMI THINKS] So Lunar isn't
a horrible person after all.

542
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,291
[KAMATA] Lunar!
Aren't you ready yet?

543
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,083
[LUNAR] We overslept.

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,583
Lunar, chew slower.
You're going to choke yourself.

545
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,125
But I'm not used
to eating this early.

546
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,916
I don't usually
eat any breakfast.

547
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,583
We eat breakfast
in this house.

548
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,541
Can't I just take a
vitamin or something?

549
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,041
As long as you
live under my roof,

550
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,458
you're going to eat
a proper breakfast.

551
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,083
Aw!

552
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,375
[NAGASUMI] I can't believe it.
My mom's done the impossible.

553
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,250
She can actually control Lunar.

554
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,416
Lunar, does this
mean that you're

555
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,291
really going to live
here with all of us?

556
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,791
We've simply decided
that perhaps

557
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,416
it would be interesting
to try living the

558
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,375
commoner's life for a
little while, that's all.

559
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,250
You realized you were
going to miss us, huh?

560
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,416
No. Our manservant
isn't broken in yet.

561
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,958
We can't leave.
You should be grateful.

562
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,291
Why are you laughing
at us? Idiots!

563
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:11,916
♪

564
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,166
[NAGASUMI] Now Lunar's
crashing at our house too.

565
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,125
Two new girls in the house!
Boy am I lucky!

566
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,708
I'll take my responsibility
seriously and protect them!

567
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,041
Of course no
sooner do I say that

568
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,291
than a new enemy shows up.

569
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,458
A third mermaid?

570
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,375
Wait, it's a guy?

571
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,625
And he's taking Sun?

572
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,791
Now hold on just a second!
