00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Why are you depressed
about them fighting?

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,250
[MAWARI] Hey, Sun...?

159
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,083
Is it true that you had
a big fight with Nagasumi?

160
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,625
That's Officer Mawari for ya!
All knowing and all seeing?

161
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,000
It's just "Mawari."

162
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,166
So anyway,
what started the fight?

163
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,958
His dirty socks!

164
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,416
Dirty socks?

165
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,958
[MAWARI THINKS] I've got ten
thousand misdemeanor files

166
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
inputted into my brain,
but I'm not finding

167
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,041
any matches for any
dirty sock-related crimes!

168
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,250
[SUN] I know
it must sound silly,

169
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,875
but it's a big issue to me!

170
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,541
Maybe Nagasumi'll
realize he's upset

171
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,166
you and apologize soon.

172
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,375
Ya really think so?

173
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,541
I'm sure he will, so
come on, Sun, cheer up.

174
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,208
Okay! Thanks, Mawari.

175
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,875
There's no need
to thank me, Sun!

176
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,375
Feel free to come to
me for help anytime!

177
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,833
[door opens and closes]

178
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,333
How vexing.

179
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,666
What?

180
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,083
Sun and Nagasumi had
a fight and aren't talkin'?

181
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,125
Is that true?

182
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,458
Yes, my lord.

183
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,166
[KAI] I heard about the fight.

184
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,250
Hey, Kai...

185
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Thanks, but I don't need any--

186
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,166
And I couldn't be happier!

187
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,750
I'll bet anythin'
that Sun hates ya with

188
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,541
all her heart now,
ya dumb bastard!

189
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,583
That's it, my lord!
Finish him off!

190
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,166
[NAGASUMI]
Knock it off, would ya!

191
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,500
Honestly,
I'm a little jealous of ya,

192
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,541
cause a fight with Sun

193
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,250
would be full of
fire and passion.

194
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,416
I can even imagine what
she'd say if it was me!

195
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,083
[KAI] I hate ya with
all my heart, Kai;

196
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,416
go away, ya see!

197
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,041
And then she'd lock me up
somewhere nice and dark,

198
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,083
and maybe even give me
the discipline I need!

199
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,583
[NAGASUMI] You're really warped.

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,083
Sun!

201
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,333
There's no reason
for ya to feel obligated

202
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,041
to that jerk Nagasumi anymore.

203
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,291
Call off the engagement,
ya don't have to marry him--

204
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,708
[AKENO] That's enough!

205
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,916
I've told you, think about
where you are before you speak!

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
Oh, Akeno!

207
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,625
Whoa, is somebody
getting married?

208
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,666
I could have
sworn I just heard

209
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,541
something about an engagement?

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,083
[AKENO] Oh...

211
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,416
Hey, look at that
over there. A banana.

212
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
[CHIMP] Oo oo ah ah!

213
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,375
Uhh... Is something
wrong, Akeno?

214
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,291
Please come with me, Sun.

215
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
[REN] "Undersea Palace
Merfolk Garden Party?"

216
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,416
[AKENO] It's being hosted
by Yoshiuo Minamoto.

217
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,291
He's specifically requested
that the Seto gang attend.

218
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,125
Geez! Didja hear
that, Masa?

219
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,250
That pain-in-the-ass
brat "requested" us!

220
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,500
Who is this guy, Boss?

221
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,875
Can I eat him?

222
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,541
[MASA] Actually, I hear he's
a tough pill to swallow.

223
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,208
If I remember right,
he's a descendent

224
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,958
of General Minamoto himself.

225
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,416
This is a direct invitation
from Lord Yoshiuo.

226
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,166
In addition to the Seto's,
other prominent

227
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,083
families have
been invited as well.

228
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,458
[AKENO]
He requests all solicited

229
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,583
to make an appearance.

230
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,458
Uh! Why's he want that?

231
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,583
Why else? So people
can kiss his butt!

232
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,291
I'm gettin' sick to my stomach
just thinkin' about it.

233
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,625
We're gonna pass.

234
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,083
[MASA] Boss, I understand
how you feel,

235
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,708
but how's it gonna
look if all the other

236
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,041
bosses and families
show up and we don't?

237
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,375
It's a matter of obligation.

238
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,666
We have to do our duty.

239
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,833
Crap, ya gotta
point there.

240
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,375
[REN] Ya know, Sun...

241
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,458
It's okay if ya
don't want to go.

242
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,791
No, I'll go.

243
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,666
[MAKI] Yay!

244
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,791
Just forget that
sea louse, Miss Sun!

245
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,166
We're gonna have
a fantastic time!

246
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,416
[LUNAR] We heard all
about it, manservant!

247
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,791
'Bout what?

248
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,166
Oh, just that big fight you
and Sun had yesterday!

249
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,333
[Lunar laughs]

250
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,166
[LUNAR] We didn't
think you had it in you!

251
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,250
We guess that old saying
"Tread on a manservant,

252
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,583
and it will turn" is true, huh?

253
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,250
[NAGASUMI] Don't you
mean "tread on a worm?"

254
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,458
Oh, like there's
a difference!

255
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,833
Anyway, we think you and us

256
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,000
should make a deal,
what do you say?

257
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,833
Huh?

258
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,916
You don't
talk back to us

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,375
like you did with Sun,
and we allow you

260
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,916
to continue to be
our manservant!

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,875
You'll spend the rest of your
life doing whatever we say!

262
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,541
Well, how does that sound?

263
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,916
Will you stop hurting
me if I say yes?

264
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,583
What's going on?

265
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,875
Oh, hi, Sun.

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,333
Don't mind me, Nagasumi.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

267
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,583
Just keep doin' whatever it is

268
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,208
you're doin' with
your love at first sight.

269
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,208
Sure, okay! So I guess
we'll continue then.

270
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,416
[NAGASUMI] No! Stop!
That tickles!

271
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,875
Alright then...
I'm bouncin'.

272
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458
[MAKI] Miss Sun,
are ya sure it's okay if ya

273
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,166
don't tell the sea louse
that you're goin' to this party?

274
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,708
It's fine! Who cares
if he doesn't know!

275
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,208
I'm gonna go to this party
and cheer myself up!

276
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,583
Ya see, I think if
we have a little time apart,

277
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,250
Nagsumi'll come
around and apologize.

278
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,958
Oh, I almost forgot!

279
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,916
[SUN] I've gotta pick
some accessories!

280
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,291
[SUN THINKS] I can't wear
this because of the

281
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,250
way things are right now,

282
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,708
but this ring is precious to me.

283
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
'Morning, everybody.

284
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,875
Hey? Where's Sun?

285
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,875
[MOM] I was hoping that was a

286
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,625
question you
could answer for me.

287
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,208
This morning, I looked
out the window and

288
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,208
saw Sun leaving with
a suitcase in her hand.

289
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,000
[NAGASUMI] She left?
Where'd she go?

290
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,166
You don't know?

291
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
The reason I didn't
yell out the window

292
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,541
and ask her where
she was going was

293
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,291
because I was sure
she'd already told you.

294
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,708
No. She didn't.

295
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,208
I hardly even talked
to Sun yesterday.

296
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,291
[MOM] I wonder what
could have happened to

297
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,541
make her leave like that without

298
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,375
at least saying
something to you.

299
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,875
Hah! If you ask me,
she probably just

300
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,041
finally got sick
of you, manservant!

301
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,791
Just think: If you'd
married me,

302
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,583
you wouldn't be in
this situation right now!

303
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,750
She's gone for good, you moron!

304
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,500
Nah-no way.

305
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,666
You should have listened.

306
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,541
I told you to apologize
to her right away.

307
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,458
But you didn't, Dopey-sumi.

308
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,458
Well...

309
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,333
I'm sure she'll
be back real soon.

310
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,541
[NAGASUMI] Um, hey, Dad?

311
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,875
"I'm bouncin'" is something
they say in the Seto, right?

312
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,208
What's it mean?

313
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,083
Saying "I'm bouncin'" is
another way of saying

314
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,875
"Okay, I'll leave you to it," or
sometimes "Goodbye."

315
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,083
Is everything
okay, Nagasumi?

316
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
I forgot to mention it, but when

317
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,500
Sun left, Maki
went along with her.

318
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,291
Good morning, sweet Sun!

319
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,166
Hey, uh, did Sun head
to school early, Nagasumi?

320
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,458
[NAGASUMI] Huh? Uh, yeah.

321
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,583
[CHIMP] I hope
you're gonna make up

322
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,208
with her when you get to school!

323
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,958
It's no fun when
she's not around!

324
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,458
She's not coming today.

325
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,416
Wait, she's not?
How come?

326
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,958
No idea.

327
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,583
But it's certainly got
nothing to do with us.

328
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,625
Ask him.

329
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,791
[CHIMP] Well, Nagasumi?

330
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,583
[NAGASUMI] I don't know, either.

331
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,541
Um... Mr. Seto is absent
today, so I'll hand out

332
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,625
the printouts for
our self-guided study.

333
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,666
Take one and
pass it back, please.

334
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,958
Well, that's weird.
Sun's mom is out, too.

335
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,458
[MAWARI] She's not the only one!

336
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,916
What?

337
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,166
[MAWARI] Mr. Masa and Mr.
Fujishiro aren't here, either!

338
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,500
What gives?

339
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,000
Everyone who's close
to Sun is out today!

340
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,291
There's no way this can
just be a coincidence!

341
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,625
Um...
It could be.

342
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
No, I smell a case here!

343
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,958
My policewoman's soul is ablaze
for the first time in a while!

344
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,916
Uh, you're just
over-thinking this one, Mawari.

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,958
Do you have any
clue why they're gone?

346
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,541
Nope, but isn't school
quiet without Mr. Seto around?

347
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,166
Pretty nice, huh?

348
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,625
So nice... so funny.

349
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,791
[KAI] You know
somethin' about why Sun

350
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,125
and all the others
are missin' today.

351
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm sure of it.

352
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,375
[AKENO] What do you mean?

353
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,916
[KAI] Playin' dumb
won't work on me.

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,916
Isn't it peculiar all the
Seto members are gone?

355
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,458
You're not
gonna talk, huh?

356
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,708
[phone rings]

357
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:19,500
That's fine. Kai, here.
Yeah. I see. Good work.

358
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,291
The Undersea Palace
Merfolk Garden Party?

359
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,208
And hosted by none other
than Yoshiuo Minamoto.

360
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,333
So I take it the Seto's
aren't here today

361
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,416
'cause they're attendin'
this get-together?

362
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,625
How did you find out?

363
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,166
Never underestimate
the power of the

364
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,083
Mikawa Conglomerate's
intelligence network.

365
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,666
I wonder what Yoshiuo
could want with the Setos?

366
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,291
[LUNAR] They're with Yoshiuo?

367
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,541
[AKENO] Lunar!

368
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,250
That's not good.
That guy's bad news.

369
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,500
He's pretty infamous for only

370
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,291
wanting one thing
from his girls.

371
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,583
[LUNAR] Rumor has it that really

372
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,333
bad things happen
at his parties.

373
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,916
Like what?

374
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,291
[LUNAR] Like people showing up
and then never being seen again.

375
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,375
Everyone always says to

376
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,666
avoid Yoshiuo at all costs.

377
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,958
[LUNAR] Why on earth
would the Seto gang waltz

378
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,208
into a party being
thrown by this maniac?

379
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,625
Because a gang
such as the Seto's

380
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,958
can't ignore a request
from mermaid nobility.

381
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,541
Sun's in danger!

382
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,958
That's why we're
sneakin' in there!

383
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,750
Hold on!

384
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,541
If you're going to defy a noble,
there will be consequences!

385
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,750
Ah, who cares?

386
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,208
Think how good we'll
look saving our rival!

387
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,875
You can't buy
that kind of press!

388
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,750
Besides, our company
is foreign-owned!

389
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,666
We've got nothing to fear
from Japanese nobility!

390
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,125
So, what's the plan?

391
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,625
And... Is the manservant
coming, too?

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,416
That's entirely
up to him, Lunar.

393
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:40,083
[classical music montage]

394
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,083
[NAGASUMI] Please be at
your dad's apartment, Sun.

395
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,208
[doorbell rings]

396
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,250
Maybe she's at home.

397
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,708
I hope.

398
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,500
Alright then.
I'm bouncin'.

399
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,541
[Nagasumi begins to cry]

400
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,625
[NAGASUMI]
Where did you go, Sun?

401
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,083
I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me...

402
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,541
With a goodbye like that.

403
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,916
[MAKI] What fancy digs!

404
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,916
I knew it'd be nice,
but this really takes the cake!

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,666
It's even bigger
than I expected.

406
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,541
The guy who owns
this swanky place?

407
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,541
You said he was a
big-shot noble, Boss?

408
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,458
[GOZABURO] Yeah!

409
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,416
Can't ya tell by
the pricy decor?

410
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
I can't stand
joints that are fulla

411
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,750
artsy-fartsy doodads
and knickknacks!

412
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,541
[MASA] Don't you find
it a bit odd that

413
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,083
we seem to be
the only family here?

414
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,166
[REN] Yes.

415
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,666
[SHARK]
Kinda strange, don't you think?

416
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,541
[slow plodding drum
that speeds up in tempo]

417

You've got mail.

[YOSHIUO] Dudes,
you're just texting me now?

424
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,125
[YOSHIUO] You're running late?

425
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,833
I've been waiting,
like, forever for this!

426
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,583
Jet over here so we
can get this party started!

427

are, like, total zeros!

Boss, take it easy!

435
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,041
These nobility types
can get nastier than

gangsters if they don't
get what they want!

437

[GOZABURO] Yeah?
Well, I can get nasty myself!

so please settle down, Boss!

[NAGASUMI] Well, Sun...

What am I supposed
to do, just give up?

pretty troubled.

get it together!

I know is always

honest with himself
and his feelings!

with yourself
right now, you'll regret it.

Yeah you're right.

How could
you say that?

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,791
Of course not.

465
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,125
I did agree to marry you because

466
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,916

called for it, but...
